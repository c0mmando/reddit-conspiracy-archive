    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a fair point but the opposite is also true. People who look for conspiracy explanations will spend a lot of time poking holes in the official story, but will almost never critically examine or take into account the holes and problems with their own theories.</p>

<p>For instance, the issue I keep coming back to...let&#39;s assume the Towers were taken down with controlled explosions along with Building 7. What was the point? If you are going to stage a terrorist attack, wouldn&#39;t you just choose one method? Hijacking multiple planes and flying them into buildings is tricky enough. Counting on being able to trigger explosions at the exact moment the planes hit and then conceal all the evidence that it happened seems unnecessarily complicated when either the planes or the explosions would have gotten the job done. And why not come up with a better cover story for Building 7 if this was all planned out in advance?</p>

<p>Surely if there was a conspiracy behind 9/11, it would have simply involved <em>hiring the hijackers to fly planes into buildings</em>. Looking for &quot;clues&quot; and inconsistencies in the events themselves like it&#39;s a game of Where&#39;s Waldo is a massive distraction IMHO.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>He&#39;s just lucky that he had recently insured them against terrorist attack by airplane a few months before</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Larry Silverstein purchased the lease for the twin towers in 2001. The lease was signed July 24, 2001. Silverstein had built WTC7 in 1987, but owning the lease to WTC 1 &amp; 2 was new. The terms of the lease <em>required</em> Silverstein and his WTC Partners to purchase insurance which included terrorist coverage.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://judicialview.com/ajaxupload/upload_pdf/Business_Valuation/1230750322.pdf">one of the court decisions:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>WTCP covenanted by the terms of the leases to insure the buildings against loss from fire and other causes for the lesser of $1.5 billion or “actual replacement cost.” See, e.g., Agreement of Lease: One World Trade Center, § 14.1.1 (requiring insurance “equal to the lesser of (x) an amount sufficient to insure . . . the items of property described in this Subsection, except for the footings and foundations, to the extent of not less than the [actual replacement cost], and (y) One Billion Five Hundred Million and 00/100 Dollars . . . per occurrence”). The leases provide that <strong>there is to be no exclusion for terrorist acts</strong>, so long as such a policy term is available “at commercially reasonable rates.” Id.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, the insurance contracts between World Trade Center Partners and the 24 insurance companies had not been finalized by September 11. The insurance was being provided under temporary binders. One of the differences of the proposed contracts was what constituted an &quot;occurrence&quot; of a terrorist act. Some of the insurance companies were able to get summary judgment that the two planes crashing into the buildings constituted a single occurrence, which halved their liability. Other insurance companies lost on this point. See, for example, <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1361302.html">this</a>, one of many court decisions about this. Eventually the insurance companies settled for $4.55 billion. </p>

<p>Personally, if I were planning insurance fraud, I would make sure that the contracts which ensured a pay-off were finalized before I torched my buildings.</p>

<p>Some people apparently think that this means that Silverstein and his partners just get to keep all this money. That&#39;s not true, of course. Silverstein still had all the obligations from when he bought the lease, including 120 million dollars a year in lease payments, repaying money he borrowed, and, last but not least, the requirement that they pay to rebuild the WTC! </p>

<p>The first insurance payments, for example, were used to pay back a $563 million loan from GMAC and also bought out the retail lease from Westfield America for $124 million.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.plainsite.org/dockets/download.html?id=33161434&amp;amp;z=07d25976">this court transcript (PDF)</a>, the actual cash value of the WTC main site (not including WTC7) was appraised at $6.497 billion and the replacement cost at $7.183 billion.</p>

<p>Silverstein renegotiated the terms of the WTC lease in 2006. He owns the lease on three of five (planned) buildings in the new WTC complex. He does <em>not</em> own the lease on the largest building, One World Trade Center.</p>

<p>Also, if he went into an agreement with black-ops conspiracy planners in which he&#39;d knowingly watch thousands of people die and billions of dollars of investments collapse, wouldn&#39;t he at least want to receive a guarantee that he&#39;d receive appropriate compensation for it?  How were the conspiracy planners unable to motivate the judges and insurance underwriters to do their bidding and award Larry the settlements he asked for?  That seems like something that would be entirely in their wheelhouse.</p>

<p>You bet he had those investments, or he did have those investments? If he did, please post your citations below. </p>

<p>The best performing defense stocks post-9/11 rose by 80-90%. To recoup a $1B loss, Larry would have needed over $2B invested in defense firms. It would be impossible for someone with those kind of holdings to keep them under the regulatory radar. </p>

<p>If you <em>can</em> demonstrate that he had $2B+ in defense holdings, it would raise an important question: why would the U.S. military and many world governments be falling over themselves to earn Larry Silverstien investment returns?</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t &quot;missing&quot; nor was it announced on September 10th. </p>

<p>The issue, poorly linked and tracked transactions between DoD systems mainly, was detailed in a report released in early 2000. It was reported on numerous times in many media outlets in the intervening year and a half.  </p>

<p>The $2.3 trillion figure was a total of all transactions that weren&#39;t automatically reconcilable. Lots was balance transfers and adjustments between systems.</p>

<p>The mention (it was one sentence on a 5,000 word speech) on September 10th was as an example of problems with outdated DoD systems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea that no steel framed buildings had collapsed because of fire damage before 9/11 is completely wrong. Ok, since just posting a link isn&#39;t good enough, here we go.</p>

<p><em>In relation to the collapse of the McCormick Center:</em>
<strong>The McCormick Place fire &quot;is significant because it illustrates the fact that steel-frame buildings can collapse as a result of exposure to fire. This is true for all types of construction materials, not only steel.&quot; wrote Robert Berhinig, associate manager of UL&#39;s Fire Protection Division and a registered professional engineer. He also discusses UL&#39;s steel fire certification much more knowledgably than Kevin Ryan. He is an example of one more highly qualified engineer who supports the collapse theory.</strong> </p>

<p><em>In relation to the Sight and Sound Theater:</em> 
<strong>On the morning of January 28, 1997, in the Lancaster County, Pennsylvania township of Strasburg, a fire caused the collapse of the state-of-the-art, seven year old Sight and Sound Theater and resulted in structural damage to most of the connecting buildings. 
The theater was a total loss, valued at over $15 million.</strong></p>

<p>The theater was built of steel rigid frame construction to allow for the large open space of the auditorium, unobstructed by columns... The interior finish in the auditorium was drywall.</p>

<p><strong>The stage storage area, prop assembly building, and prop maintenance building were protected with a sprayed-on fire resistant coating on all structural steel. The plans called for the coating to meet a two-hour fire resistance assembly rating. The sprayed-on coating, which was susceptible to damage from the movement of theater equipment, was protected by attaching plywood coverings on the columns to a height of eight feet.</strong></p>

<p>The walls of the storage area beneath the stage were layered drywall to provide a two-hour fire protection rating for the mezzanine offices [the WTC used drywall as fire protection in the central core] , and sprayed-on fire-resistant coatings on the structural 
steel columns and ceiling bar joists supporting the stage floor.</p>

<p><strong>The two theater employees told the State Police Fire Investigator that when they first discovered the fire they noticed that the sprayed-on fire proofing had been knocked off the underside of the stage floor bar joists and support steel. The fire proofing was hanging on the wire mesh used to hold the coating to the overhead. The investigation revealed that the construction company&#39;s removal of the stage floor covering down to the corrugated decking involved striking the floor hard enough to knock off the sprayed-on protection, exposing the structural steel and bar-joists in the storage area.</strong></p>

<p>Temperatures of 1000° F can cause buckling and temperatures of 1500° F can cause steel to lose strength and collapse. When the heat and hot gases reached the stage ceiling they extended horizontally into the auditorium, causing the roof to fail all the way to the lobby fire wall. The fire also extended horizontally from the stage to the elevated hallway, causing the structural steel to fail and buckle in the prop assembly and prop maintenance buildings</p>

<p><strong>Once the heat of the fire caused the structural steel to fail in the storage area (aided by the damage to the sprayed-on fire protection during renovation), interior firefighting became too hazardous to continue. The truck crews ventilating the roof noted metal discoloration and buckling steel.</strong></p>

<p>The two hour fire resistance-rated assembly in the storage area beneath the stage was damaged during the stage floor renovation, leaving the structural members unprotected from the ensuing fire.</p>

<p><strong>Buildings constructed of steel should, in effect, be considered unprotected and capable of collapse from fire in as few as ten minutes. Fire resistant coatings sprayed onto structural steel are susceptible to damage from construction work.</strong></p>

<p>The impact of fire and heat on structural steel members warrant extreme caution by firefighters.</p>

<p><strong>Unless the steel members are cooled with high-volume hose streams, the fire&#39;s heat can rapidly cause steel to lose its strength and contribute to building collapse.</strong></p>

<p>Come on guys. If you&#39;re gonna post stuff, at least make it accurate.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the link anyways: <a href="http://www.debunking911.com/firsttime.htm">http://www.debunking911.com/firsttime.htm</a></p>

<p>EDIT:
In response to everyone saying that it was only the roof of the McCormick Center and how does that relate to the Twin Towers. I&#39;d argue that the enormous size of the towers without a doubt helped them fall the way they did in comparison to other structures. But please remember that the point of my comment was to prove that fire can indeed do damage to steel structured buildings, how much damage depends on many variables and I wasn&#39;t trying to suggest this is conclusive proof, only that the title of this post is incorrect and that should be addressed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kinda looks to me like half of the building completely collapsed. And the size of the towers would only help them fall like they did. They weighed 500,000 T each. That&#39;s a lot of weight to hold up on weakened supports in a freak situation the building was never designed for. </p>

<p>I should probably add that I do not believe that the steel was &#39;melted&#39; at all. In fact it&#39;s been proven that&#39;s not what happened. It was related to the Angle clips that supported the floors. Damage from the fire caused two floors to cave in, putting more weight onto the angle clips than they were ever designed to take, thus causing a domino effect that gets worse with each floor that collapses.</p>

<p>It does not matter for how long the building fell at the acceleration of gravity. What matters is that it happened at all, because for this to take place there had to be absolutely no resistance from ANY of the supporting structure of the building. There is only one way in which there would be absolutely zero resistance from any of the building below the roof of building 7 which fell, for a time, at the acceleration of gravity.</p>

<p>I&#39;m making no assertions about what actually happened. I AM saying that the government&#39;s official conspiracy theory makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. The only thing that can fall at the acceleration of gravity is that which has nothing but air between it and the ground. I don&#39;t know what happened that day, but I&#39;m convinced it sure isn&#39;t what we&#39;re being told. If building 7&#39;s support columns were removed, I do not know how. That&#39;s not my job to prove. The facts speak for themselves. Somehow they were all removed as supporting columns simultaneously.</p>

<p>Yes, you&#39;re correct, as I&#39;ve stated. As the main supports failed, the supporting structure would have entirely failed evenly as the weight was transferred onto it. Hence 8 floors of free fall. </p>

<p>Most architects or engineers disagree with you</p>

<p>Ask the Nist analyst who wrote a dissenting opinion about the collapses how that turned out for him. Challenge the status quo, lose your livelihood and your subsequent career. It takes a lot of guts to challenge the official story. Believe what you must. To me, the science is the science and nothing can fall at the acceleration of gravity if there is the least bit of structural resistance from below. There is no way that building offered zero resistance to the collapsing roofline. That, to me, makes absolutely no sense. How can all the columns collapse simultaneously? That&#39;s the only way you can have an asymmetrical collapse. It seems like you and I will never agree, though. That&#39;s cool. Everyone&#39;s entitled to what they think.</p>

<p>I will say this, if that&#39;s a demolition job, paint me impressed.</p>

<p>Just trying to offer another side guys. 
Also, I was just trying to say that if they managed to pull of setting up charges around the columns of the building without witnesses, which would be months of work and would then be able to set them off perfectly in-time with each other (without delay that you see in normal demolitions) then that&#39;s an incredible feat. That certainly doesn&#39;t make it ok.</p>

But if you accept the party line that something smashed into it and knocked it down... it&#39;s kind of hard to plan for or defend against that.

    <div class="md"><p>During an interview in 2002 for the PBS documentary America Rebuilds: A Year at Ground Zero, Mr. Silverstein said this about the fate of building 7 on 9/11:</p>

<p>&quot;I remember getting a call from the fire department commander, telling me that they were not sure they were gonna be able to contain the fire, and I said, &#39;We&#39;ve had such terrible loss of life, maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it.&#39; And they made that decision to pull and then we watched the building collapse.&quot; –Larry Silverstein</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. From the testimony of <a href="http://www.firehouse.com/news/10544364/9-11-issue-introduction-part-vi">Deputy Chief Peter Hayden</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, we had to <strong>pull</strong> everybody back. It was very difficult. We had to be very forceful in getting the guys out. They didn’t want to come out. There were guys going into areas that I wasn’t even really comfortable with, because of the possibility of secondary collapses. We didn’t know how stable any of this area was. We <strong>pulled everybody back probably by 3 or 3:30 in the afternoon</strong>. We said, this building is going to come down, get back. It came down about 5 o’clock or so, but we had everybody backed away by then. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note: 1) The use of &quot;pull&quot; to mean evacuate personnel. 2) The awareness that the building&#39;s condition meant it was going to collapse, some time before it happened. </p>

<p>I also doubt Larry has any say once the fire department is involved or given the authority to direct the operation, seeing that he was not on-site nor is he an experienced fireman.

    <div class="md"><p>My question is, since when does a building owner get brought in to the loop to make a decision as to whether the fire department continues fighting the blaze or withdraws?  How the hell is a private citizen giving the go-ahead to pull back first responders on any level?  That would be like a bank manager telling police officers to go home and let a robber go in the event of a hostage situation. Sorry, it just doesn&#39;t jive unless he&#39;s a reserve captain or something. If it is a true account, the person contacting him is guilty of gross negligence and should be stripped of his command.</p>

<p>1) The buildings could have been wired without anyone seeing</p>

<p>2) The MASSIVE amounts of explosives, as well as all of the det cables, etc. remained entirely unnoticed (<a href="http://i.imgur.com/GM1Ppcc.jpg">this is what a det primed building looks like</a>).</p>

<p>3) Why the damage from debris and fire didn&#39;t damage that setup.</p>

<p>4)Why none of the hundreds of firefighters noticed that demo setup that would have been uncovered/destroyed by the fires.</p>

<p>5) Why there was no series of explosions, and no visual flashes from either traditional explosives or the EXTREMELY bright flashes of thermitic explosions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best theories I&#39;ve heard for each of those points:</p>

<p>1) They had &quot;elevator maintenance&quot; crews (actually demolition crews) coming in for a week or two prior to the demolition, who walled off increasingly large interior portions of the building around the elevators (and support columns).</p>

<p>2) They used thermite, not regular explosives. It&#39;s smaller and faster to set up, but more expensive. Expense not being an issue in this particular case.</p>

<p>3) Maybe they were on different floors? Or maybe if the explosives need to be on all floors the fires were relatively controlled to be toward the windows. Those are just guesses. And debris from the twin towers would hit the outer edges of the building, which wouldn&#39;t go penetrate deep enough in to the building to get where the explosives would be. </p>

<p>4) They did, they&#39;re just not allowed to talk about it. This firefighter will though: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQrpLp-X0ws">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQrpLp-X0ws</a></p>

<p>5) There were series of explosions, you can see it in <a href="https://i.imgur.com/kob2Lz1.webm">the WTC7 GIF.</a> It looks like the columns blew. You can see a vertical column of windows explode right before collapse! Especially in the second video clip.  </p>

<p>Also remember the &quot;elevator maintenance crew&quot; could&#39;ve been hundreds of highly-trained military or intelligence people, so it could&#39;ve gone up extremely quickly, especially if they were working on it 24 hours a day.</p>

<p>These are good questions you ask, and they should be evaluated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you have a source for the eyewitness accounts? It&#39;s also one of the points that conspiracy theorists like to gloss over or ignore without providing any evidence. And the part about removing bomb-sniffing dogs isn&#39;t true. A K9 officer and explosive-sniffing dog named Sirius died in the basement of Tower Two that morning. Their job was to check vehicles coming in, which would make it hard for trucks carrying hundreds of pounds of explosives over several days, wouldn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>The sheer number of people this would take and the amount of effort, just to go completely undetected is beyond the realm of credulity and into insanity. Renovating the elevator shafts is leagues away from rigging the two tallest buildings in New York City to collapse with explosives.</p>

There is no corroborating evidence that a power-down of that size took place. It would have disrupted business operations affecting hundreds of people and there aren&#39;t any e-mail correspondences preparing for the outage? Why wasn&#39;t there an outage for the other tower?</p>

<p>And even if it was true and the power was only out on the top few floors, then that lends credence to the idea that the top collapsing would bring the rest down with it. </p>

Try that mate, then when you come back without the result you were looking for you know what I&#39;ll tell you? Jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel beams! LOL</p>

<p>The fact it has never happened before is more evidence against what you are saying than for. Look at the examples of steel framed buildings that have burned for many hours and the steel structure is still standing. That is proving a positive.

<p>Isn&#39;t that the point? The conspiracy is that it&#39;s never happened before so it must mean it could never happen. <a href="/u/i_alsodislikethat">/u/i_alsodislikethat</a> is asking if the 2 points he mentioned have ever been at play before, cause those 2 points are major factors in what happened vs other building fires. </p>

<p>If conspiracy wants to say a steel building has never collapsed cause of a fire before, so it can never happen. They also need to show that another steel building with as much weigh above the the fire and unfought has also happened before. Right now the argument that conspiracy is making is saying a steel building 50 miles high will not collapase under its own weight when the steel that is 49 miles below is structurally damaged. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thermite fits the evidence. The &quot;official story&quot; combustion literally does not:</p>

<p><a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10669-008-9182-4#">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10669-008-9182-4#</a></p>

<p>&quot;The occurrence of such extreme, sharp spikes in VOCs in air at GZ indicate something other than the behavior of a typical structure fire. Oxygen influx as a result of shifting of materials within the pile might have created an increase in combustion of material in localized areas. But these spikes in VOCs, at levels thousands of times higher than seen in other structure fires, suggest extremely violent but short-lived fire events. Probably the most striking spike in toxic air emissions, found in EPA monitoring data, occurred on 9th February, 2002. Note (Table 1 ) that this was nearly 5 months after 9/11, and after nearly all the debris had been cleared from GZ. In fact, the levels of some species, like toluene and styrene, were some of the highest observed at the site. But the levels of benzene and propylene detected on that day were far above previous measurements, at 610,000 and 990,000 ppb, respectively. Other VOCs were measured at their peak levels on this date, including 1,3-butadiene at 400,000 ppb.&quot; &quot;EPA also monitored very fine particulate matter (PM) and other sizes of PM. PM is probably the most reliable indicator for the activity of structure fires, as such fires are generally known to burn incompletely, and produce PM that drifts up and outward from the source. EPA data from the West Broadway sampling site, the location closest to GZ where PM was monitored, show the following trend in very fine PM (PM 2.5 , or all particles \ 2.5 l m) in October and November 2001 (Fig. 4 ). These data show that the peaks in levels of very fine PM near GZ correspond to different dates than the peaks for the previously discussed combustion products. The five stron- gest peaks in PM 2.5 levels are centered on 23th, 26th September, and 3rd, 10th, 20th October, closer in time to the events of 9/11. None of these dates correspond to the dates of five peaks in VOCs noted above. Additionally, it is clear that the levels of PM 2.5 emissions rose more gradu- ally, and died down more gradually, indicating slower fire dynamics as might be expected from the burning of the organic materials previously thought to exist in the WTC. These data suggest that the greatest level of fire activity, associated solely with the typical fuel sources expected in the WTC, was completed by the third week of October. That is, the materials expected to burn (incompletely) in a structure fire, producing PM, were largely burned off by mid- to late-October. Therefore, the extreme spikes in air concentrations of the five VOCs noted above, particularly on 3rd, 8th November, and 9th February, point not to other sources of typical combustible materials but to other forms of com- bustion. Such forms of combustion appear to be violent and short-lived, and thus similar to the effects of energetic materials, like thermite&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even according to NIST ( the official government story ) <a href="/u/I_AlsoDislikeThat">/u/I_AlsoDislikeThat</a> is wrong.</p>

<p>His #1 is irrelevant. According to NIST anyway.</p>

<p>&quot;What are the major differences between &quot;typical&quot; major high-rise building fires that have occurred in the United States and the fire in the WTC 7 building on Sept. 11, 2001?&quot;</p>

<p>There are more similarities than differences between the uncontrolled fires that burned in WTC 7 and those that occurred in the following buildings: First Interstate Bank Building (1988), One Meridian Plaza Building (1991), One New York Plaza (1970), and WTC 5 (2001).</p>

<p>NIST NCSTAR Report 1-9, Section 8.5, provides details about these building fires.</p>

<p>The following factors describe the fire events that occurred in both WTC 7 and the referenced buildings:</p>

<ul>
<li>The fuel for the fires was ordinary office combustibles at ordinary combustible load levels.</li>
<li>There was no use of accelerants.</li>
<li>The spread of fire from combustible to combustible was governed by ordinary fire physics.</li>
<li>Fire-induced window breakage provided ventilation for continued fire spread and growth.</li>
<li>There were simultaneous fires on multiple floors.</li>
<li>The fires on each floor occupied a substantial portion of the floor.</li>
<li>The fires on each floor had passed the point of flashover and the structure was subjected to typical post-flashover temperatures.</li>
<li>The sprinklers were inoperative or ineffective; and 9) the fires burned for sufficient time to cause significant distortion and/or failure to the building structure.</li>
</ul>

<p>There were some differences between the fires in WTC 7 and those in the referenced buildings, but these differences were secondary to the fire factors that led to the collapse of WTC 7:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fires in high-rise buildings typically have a single point of origin on a single floor, whereas the fires in WTC 7 likely had a single point of origin on multiple (10) floors.</li>
<li>Fires in other high-rise buildings were due to isolated events, whereas the fires in WTC 7 followed the collapse of WTC 1.</li>
<li>Water was available to fight fires in the other high rise buildings, but the water supply to fight fires in WTC 7 was impaired.</li>
<li>While the fires in the other buildings were actively fought by firefighters to the extent possible, in WTC 7, no efforts were made to fight the fires because of the lack of a water supply.</li>
</ul>

<p>The differences in the fires were not meaningful for the following reasons. By the time WTC 7 collapsed, the fires in WTC 7 had advanced well beyond the likely points of origin on multiple floors (i.e., south and west faces), and points of fire origin had no bearing on the fire conditions when the building collapsed (i.e., in the northeast quadrant). Additionally, in each of the other referenced buildings, the fires burned out several floors, even with available water and firefighting activities (except for WTC 5). <strong>Thus, whether the fire fighters fought the WTC 7 fires or not is not a meaningful point of dissimilarity from the other cited fires.</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to call people that believe this &quot;space based energy&quot; weapon bullshit crazy or even the missile nutters crazy but that&#39;d be 100% false.</p>

<p>Sane people believe insane things if the info is given to them in the right way.</p>

<p>Most of the debunkers didn&#39;t even bother dealing with judy wood because she was so nuts nobody thought she&#39;d have a following.</p>

<p>But there are a lot of debunkings about her theory and the entire thing falls apart when it&#39;s actually looked at.</p>

<p>The large majority of truthers won&#39;t even accept the no plane theory, even they think it&#39;s nuts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually really liked her because she just points out what was seen on 911 and other technologies that exist where we see similar outcomes. Take it or leave it I really liked her presentation and haven&#39;t seen any explanation of what happened on 911 that makes sense. There truly should have been more wreckage and it doesn&#39;t make sense how majority of the buildings became dust. Where are the desks and toilets and sinks and filing cabinets or even parts of the planes.. Especially the engines.  It&#39;s just crazy.. Not to mention the buildings falling at free fall speed. I dunno.. I just thought her presentation was interesting and made me think. You can think she&#39;s a wacko crazy nutjob but I found it interesting. It&#39;s pretty late so I&#39;m going to read the link you provided tomorrow, is there anything in there addressing anything Judy wood talks about? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The entire debunking I just linked you shreds any viable way for no planes to have hit the tower.</p>

<p>Trust me she&#39;s seen as pretty nuts, where is it you&#39;ve looked for evidence debunking her claims? because it&#39;s pretty easy to find.</p>

<p>The whole free fall speed thing has been debunked a lot too, I see this with a lot of people that are otherwise rational.</p>

<p>They say they can&#39;t find any debunking of a theory they believe but one google search brings up hundreds of results, even peer reviewed studies from experts saying it&#39;s nuts.</p>

<p>Her entire theory hinges on no planes hitting the towers, it&#39;s been proven many times that planes hit.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re not interested in reading the entire debunking, she actually got destroyed in an interview.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYm1AnUKi8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYm1AnUKi8</a> (the interview starts at 2 mins 20 seconds, but the video up to that point maybe helpful for you)</p>

<p>Even most of the mainstream truther websites said she was nuts and said her &quot;batshit theories&quot; were not welcome.</p>

<p>Her directed energy weapon theory is pretty wacko in basically every way.</p>

<p>This woman got a lot of wind under her wings from her original video, but after the interview I linked you everyone started questioning her mental health.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not so sure about the no planes theory but I&#39;ve read some stuff on how difficult it would be to fly the plane that hit the pentagon, especially the route it took as well as how far it was off the ground as it flew into the side of the building as opposed to flying it into the top of the building. And also stuff on how the types of planes that were used couldnt go up to the speeds the planes were going that day without the plane falling apart. I also think the fact that there&#39;s no footage released of the plane going into the pentagon is suspect especially with all the cameras around. The pictures out there just show the beginning of something on the right side and the next frame is a ball of flames. Plus the size of the hole in the damage compared to the size of the plane. Shit just doesn&#39;t add up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the thing though, it does add up. Seriously watch the interview with Judy wood, she makes herself look like a warped crack head. the guy thats interviewing her is cringing the entire time.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s some interesting things about the pentagon crash.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a5659/debunking-911-myths-pentagon/">http://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a5659/debunking-911-myths-pentagon/</a></p>

<p>So let&#39;s talk about how nobody saw the plane, this is false and the no plane hit the pentagon truthers like to leave out the overwhelming number of eyewitness accounts that saw a plane fly into the building.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just want to know why we can&#39;t see any videos or pictures of it. (Pentagon attack) If they had pictures or videos then why wouldn&#39;t they release one just to appease the public. And the fact that the people who filmed personal footage of the planes hitting the towers like major news corporations bought the rights to them and the people couldn&#39;t talk about their experiences like where they filmed it and such. I think that&#39;s kinda suspect. I honestly have to watch the video with Judy wood again because I watched it at 5am as I fell asleep so I&#39;ll watch it again but my impression on the beginning of the video I felt like the interviewer kept asking her what kind of energy weapon was used but how is she to know? There can very well be technologies that we don&#39;t know about that could have been used it doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;s a quack for not knowing. But again I haven&#39;t seen the entire interview I&#39;m going to give it a watch now. </p>

<p>And thank you for giving me your opinions on 911.. I know I have strong opinions on what happened and usually people get all bent out of shape having people tell them a different opinion but I like to do as much research as possible and am open to changing my opinion as I come across new evidence that contradicts what I&#39;ve learned. So thank you for being cool and reasonable without being all crazy and defensive, much appreciated. </p>

There&#39;s three parts to the video, each is like an hour and a half long. it&#39;s the most in-depth thing I&#39;ve ever seen talking about all the discrepancies from 9/11 ... I think these videos moreso than others have truly convinced me that the official story is bogus. </p>

<p>I think one of my biggest issues on 911 was the fact they said it was okay to breathe in the air after the towers collapsed. I think it&#39;s awful that majority of the rescue workers are dying or dead due to complications from breathing in the air that day. They should&#39;ve known to tell them it was toxic especially with all the asbestos in both buildings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you have any information on why the buildings fell at near free fall speed? It doesn&#39;t make sense how if you were to drop a bowling ball off the top of the tower it would fall at the same speed the towers fell down at. The towers got hit right, so at the point of impact if the building were to weaken it doesn&#39;t make sense that the top part of the building falling would have enough energy to demolish all the intact floors below it. As the top part of the building collapsed it would push down into the intact floors and those floors would push back up. But we don&#39;t see that happen. It&#39;s as if all of a sudden the entire building turns to dust and just falls or that the floors below are blown out so that the building can fall with no resistance. I would love to see something explaining this because it doesn&#39;t make any sense.</p>

<p>Plus I don&#39;t get how the planes disappear into a building reinforced with steel. The planes hitting the towers should have shown the plane getting smashed as well as the building getting equally smashed, not the plane slicing through the buildings or disappearing into the buildings. I saw a picture of a plane that hit a high rise building and you can see the tail of the plane sticking out of the building where part of the plane broke through the building and part of the plane was left sticking out. </p>

<p>This site actually has a bunch of reading and papers, the thing about most of the truther claims is they never actually prove anything, they just make claims.</p>

<p>There were more than a few papers that refuted the free-fall thing the truthers just never actually attempted to read them.</p>

<p>As for the plane vanishing, what do you think happens when a plane runs into a building at 500+ mph? the plane was no more.</p>

<p>You&#39;d have to provide a link to this picture of the plane and expand on it more.</p>

<p>This is how conspiracy theorists work, they&#39;ll see thousands of professionals in one field rationally explain something and then they&#39;ll find a few people confirming what they believe and assume that means they&#39;re correct.</p>

<p>So let me ask you this, if thousands of engineers all agree it was possible, and a very small minority say it wasn&#39;t who is right? it&#39;s like this with climate change too.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll find the very large majority of theories people believe about 911 stem from uneducated people forming opinions about things they just don&#39;t understand.</p>

<p>So, <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/">Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth</a> is a network of respected architects, physicists and engineers that, recognizing how professionally fatal it can be to vocally support alternative theories to the collapse of the World Trace Center tower 1, 2 and building 7, have openly joined this group to say they don&#39;t believe the engineering science pushed by NIST and the 9/11 Commission.</p>

<p>How is this group of scientists - whose numbers are in the thousands - retain less credibility that the other &quot;professional/official&quot; scientists? We have two versions of physics coming head to head. I&#39;m not a professional but as a student of Physics and Astronomy I don&#39;t believe the official story because I don&#39;t believe it makes sense with regards to the physics.</p>

<p>As far as this accusation is concerned I&#39;m just going to assert that it is simply an opinion of yours. Uneducated people forming opinions about things they don&#39;t understand can be applied to anywhere people get information from - the internet, televised news media, news entertainment, politics, finance. There are a lot of morons out there spreading ignorance that very easily spreads as common sense and truth, when it&#39;s clearly not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I knew you&#39;d link this website, let&#39;s talk about Gage.</p>

<p>Richard rage is an interesting guy and has some theories about building 7, Which I&#39;ll fully agree is weird some what but the guy is not really credible at all. first of all he&#39;s an architect, he isn&#39;t an engineer and he isn&#39;t an explosive expert at all.</p>

<p>This guy likes to brag about the fact he&#39;s a member of the AIA even though the AIA wants nothing to do with his website.</p>

<p>He even tried to act like they endorsed him even though that&#39;s 0% true, basically just lied to make himself seem more credible.</p>

<p>He&#39;s actually seen as kind of crazy by them, I wonder why.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s another cool fact about Gage, 31% of the architects and engineers for 9/11 truth go to paying his fucking salary.</p>

<p>That&#39;s right, this guy is paying himself nearly 100 thousand dollars a year for this non profit.</p>

<p>The evidence this guy has is also highly questionable, he&#39;s been caught lying multiple times.</p>

<p>Remember his thermite claims? remember when he got caught lying about the evidence of thermite? </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a video of him lying about the thermite.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDiAlMIJ8A4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDiAlMIJ8A4</a> and he still has this on his website claiming thermite was found when it never was.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.debunking911.com/thermite.htm">http://www.debunking911.com/thermite.htm</a> here&#39;s the debunking of the thermite claim backed with math that&#39;s very easy to check on your own.</p>

<p>He also claims the buildings fell at free fall speed right, that&#39;s also on his website and that&#39;s also been debunked.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.debunking911.com/freefall.htm">http://www.debunking911.com/freefall.htm</a></p>

<p>Seriously, don&#39;t believe me check the fucking math it&#39;s right there you can easily check it yourself.</p>

<p>Look, these people are entitled to their opinions and they do have around 2200 members but compared to the over whelming majority that&#39;s still a minority.</p>

<p>Literally every piece of evidence on this guys website has been debunked by people far more credible than him and that are actually experts in their field.</p>

<p>Be it explosives or be it engineers.</p>

<p>Either way we can&#39;t know for sure what happened, all we can do is look at the science the math and evidence and form an opinion.</p>

<p>And the over whelming majority of engineers agree that most of what richard gage has said has already been debunked.</p>

<p>That combined with the fact he&#39;s just shady as fuck and is using some 30% of the funds to pay his own salary makes it very questionable.</p>

<p>&quot;The occurrence of such extreme, sharp spikes in VOCs in air at GZ indicate something other than the behavior of a typical structure fire. Oxygen influx as a result of shifting of materials within the pile might have created an increase in combustion of material in localized areas. But these spikes in VOCs, at levels thousands of times higher than seen in other structure fires, suggest extremely violent but short-lived fire events. Probably the most striking spike in toxic air emissions, found in EPA monitoring data, occurred on 9th February, 2002. Note (Table 1 ) that this was nearly 5 months after 9/11, and after nearly all the debris had been cleared from GZ. In fact, the levels of some species, like toluene and styrene, were some of the highest observed at the site. But the levels of benzene and propylene detected on that day were far above previous measurements, at 610,000 and 990,000 ppb, respectively. Other VOCs were measured at their peak levels on this date, including 1,3-butadiene at 400,000 ppb.&quot; &quot;EPA also monitored very fine particulate matter (PM) and other sizes of PM. PM is probably the most reliable indicator for the activity of structure fires, as such fires are generally known to burn incompletely, and produce PM that drifts up and outward from the source. EPA data from the West Broadway sampling site, the location closest to GZ where PM was monitored, show the following trend in very fine PM (PM 2.5 , or all particles \ 2.5 l m) in October and November 2001 (Fig. 4 ). These data show that the peaks in levels of very fine PM near GZ correspond to different dates than the peaks for the previously discussed combustion products. The five stron- gest peaks in PM 2.5 levels are centered on 23th, 26th September, and 3rd, 10th, 20th October, closer in time to the events of 9/11. None of these dates correspond to the dates of five peaks in VOCs noted above. Additionally, it is clear that the levels of PM 2.5 emissions rose more gradu- ally, and died down more gradually, indicating slower fire dynamics as might be expected from the burning of the organic materials previously thought to exist in the WTC. These data suggest that the greatest level of fire activity, associated solely with the typical fuel sources expected in the WTC, was completed by the third week of October. That is, the materials expected to burn (incompletely) in a structure fire, producing PM, were largely burned off by mid- to late-October. Therefore, the extreme spikes in air concentrations of the five VOCs noted above, particularly on 3rd, 8th November, and 9th February, point not to other sources of typical combustible materials but to other forms of com- bustion. Such forms of combustion appear to be violent and short-lived, and thus similar to the effects of energetic materials, like thermite&quot;</p>

<p>So where is the thermite then, do you have any idea how much thermite would have been needed to bring down the towers? and we have zero direct evidence of thermite being used.</p>

<p>now lets pretend for a second this is the smoking gun (it&#39;s not at all, not sure why you&#39;d think that) so what? it says like thermite, it didn&#39;t actually prove thermite was used or find evidence of it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing you didn&#39;t actually read the paper or what? </p>

<p>Or are you just not very good at understanding things you&#39;ve read?</p>

<p>The presence of energetic materials, specifically energetic &quot;nanocomposites, at GZ, has the 
potential to explain much of the unusual environmental data seen at the WTC. Thermite, 
discussed briefly above, is such a pyrotechnic mixture that cannot be easily extinguished and 
is a common component of energetic nanocomposites. Unusually high detections of sulfur, 
silicon, aluminum, copper, nickel, iron, barium, and vanadium might all be explained by 
physical release of materials from such energetic nanocomposites&quot;</p>

<p>Do tell me where in this paper is confirms the use of thermite, because it doesn&#39;t at all.</p>

<p>It says it&#39;s possible, this does not = proof as to what happened at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, if you want to go down this road let&#39;s do it.  </p>

<p>Let&#39;s talk about Jones for a second mate, considering I&#39;m guessing you don&#39;t actually know anything about the guy.</p>

<p>He&#39;s submitted many papers, mostly to non-credible bullshit journals.</p>

<p>This is what happened after his first paper.</p>

<p>Jones&#39; early critics included members of BYU&#39;s engineering faculty shortly after he made his views public, the BYU College of Physical and Mathematical Sciences and the faculty of structural engineering issued statements in which they distanced themselves from Jones&#39; work. They noted that Jones&#39; &quot;hypotheses and interpretations of evidence were being questioned by scholars and practitioners,&quot; and expressed doubts on whether they had been &quot;submitted to relevant scientific venues that would ensure rigorous technical peer review.&quot;</p>

<p>Judging by the fact you held this up high and said it was peer reviewed so it must be correct, do you not understand what a good peer reviewed paper is? it needs to be in a respected journal, for example I can go find 100+ journals that claim peer reviewing but it isn&#39;t relevant if the journal isn&#39;t respected.</p>

<p>For example his first few papers got spat on because he published them not in a civil engineering journal, and in a less than respected journal.</p>

<p>His entire department disagreed with his paper and they all tried to get distance.</p>

<p>That being said lets get into this paper.</p>

<p>wow it took me all of 5 god damn seconds to find something discrediting the paper you linked.</p>

<p><a href="http://11-settembre.blogspot.com/2009/04/active-thermitic-material-claimed-in.html">http://11-settembre.blogspot.com/2009/04/active-thermitic-material-claimed-in.html</a></p>

<p>I knew you&#39;d link this paper because it&#39;s the paper conspiracy theorists like to think can&#39;t be debunked.</p>

<p>Lucky for me conspiracy theorists tend to forget the second paper which jones published to confirm this paper and prove thermite was used.</p>

<p>That paper was debunked and it was proven thermite wasn&#39;t used and jones didn&#39;t actually find any.</p>

<p>Next?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His first paper implied thermite was used, the second paper claims thermite was found but it wasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>It was such a god damn fiasco the editor of the journal resigned.</p>

<p>The article I linked is a paper about how thermite was found in the dust, which it turns out it wasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>&quot;Professor Marie-Paule Pileni, an expert in explosives and nano-technology, resigned. She received an e-mail from the Danish science journal Videnskab asking for her professional assessment of the article&#39;s content.According to Pileni, the article was published without her authorization. Subsequently, numerous concerns arose regarding the reliability of the publisher, Bentham Science Publishing. This included the publishing an allegedly peer reviewed article composed of nonsense&quot;</p>

<p>If thermite was in fact used, and that&#39;s what was found in the first paper the second paper would have confirmed it.</p>

<p>It was proven to be false in every way.</p>

<p>The fact you don&#39;t seem to grasp what peer reviewed means is a red flag for me, and I&#39;m not interested in debating a wacko on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> that is borderline illiterate because it&#39;d be the 3rd time in 2 days.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s make this really simple.</p>

<p>The second paper was meant to confirm the use of thermite, jones claimed thermite was found and the second paper confirmed thermite was not found in the dust, no thermite means his paper is now void.</p>

<p>After the editor of the journal realized it was nonsense bullshit and in no way true, she fucking resigned from the journal.</p>

<p>That is literally the only reason I post here, I just leave when I get angry because that&#39;s me failing.</p>

<p>The level of dumb is just too much for me to handle at this point, you&#39;re not grasping why the second paper debunks the first paper.</p>

<p>You literally can not link the 2 because you do not have the mental ability to do so.</p>

<p>I explain to you the first paper implies thermite was used, the second paper was to confirm thermite was used and it was then debunked.</p>

<p>AND YES IT WAS a fucking peer reviewed journal, which is why the editor resigned after the second paper because it was nonsense.</p>

<p>The bottom fucking line is he claimed thermite was used, and it was then proven that it wasn&#39;t used after he made the claim it was used.</p>

<p>If the second paper shows thermite WAS NOT USED, that means the first paper is now void.</p>

<p>That means it&#39;s no longer relevant because the entire thing it was trying to prove has been debunked.</p>

<p>Let me word this yet another way so you can fully grasp it.</p>

<p>THE CLAIM, was that THERMITE was used in the bringing down of the buildings.</p>

<p>They claimed to have FOUND THERMITE and then published a paper on it in another journal, this paper was proven to be FALSE which debunks the first paper for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>Look man, this is actually my last reply to you because as I&#39;ve already said, even if we assumed this paper was accurate it still does not prove anything.</p>

<p>You&#39;re trying to stack 1 paper against 100+ papers that are also peer reviewed in more credible journals.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;ll leave you with this.</p>

<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/wtc7lies/">https://sites.google.com/site/wtc7lies/</a> Good luck friend, even the debunking websites don&#39;t even update anymore because they realize how nuts truthers are and how dead the movement is.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll argue with moon landing deniers, I&#39;ll argue with people that believe lizard people exist.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t argue with truthers, they&#39;re the most rabid and delusional of all conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>You tried. You said you were done. But my response embarrassed you too much so you had to respond. So you proved yourself a liar and came back for more. Fine by me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just leave when I get angry because that&#39;s me failing.</p>

<p>Then you should do two things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Get an actual grasp on the subject beforehand</p></li>
<li><p>Produce something of substance / relevance</p></li>
</ol>

<p>That might help.</p>

<p>you&#39;re not grasping why the second paper debunks the first paper.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I explain to you the first paper implies thermite was used</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I showed you that the first (and only paper I gave you) confirms that the official story combustion cannot account for the VOCs. Something you&#39;re still having trouble with refuting. Don&#39;t worry. I won&#39;t forget. And I&#39;ll never stop bringing it up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the second paper was to confirm thermite was used and it was then debunked.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A peer reviewed, published refutation is required to debunk either of the papers. You have 0. So your argument fails....twice.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>AND YES IT WAS a fucking peer reviewed journal, which is why the editor resigned after the second paper because it was nonsense.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I really can&#39;t believe how dumb you are. Well, seeing as though you are a conspiratard poster....I get it. <strong>THIS</strong> is the link you gave me that I said was not peer reviewed:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>wow it took me all of 5 god damn seconds to find something discrediting the paper you linked.</p>

<p>That was what I was referencing. Understand? Again, this:</p>

<p>&quot;The occurrence of such extreme, sharp spikes in VOCs in air at GZ indicate something other than the behavior of a typical structure fire. Oxygen influx as a result of shifting of materials within the pile might have created an increase in combustion of material in localized areas. But these spikes in VOCs, at levels thousands of times higher than seen in other structure fires, suggest extremely violent but short-lived fire events. Probably the most striking spike in toxic air emissions, found in EPA monitoring data, occurred on 9th February, 2002. Note (Table 1 ) that this was nearly 5 months after 9/11, and after nearly all the debris had been cleared from GZ. In fact, the levels of some species, like toluene and styrene, were some of the highest observed at the site. But the levels of benzene and propylene detected on that day were far above previous measurements, at 610,000 and 990,000 ppb, respectively. Other VOCs were measured at their peak levels on this date, including 1,3-butadiene at 400,000 ppb.&quot; &quot;EPA also monitored very fine particulate matter (PM) and other sizes of PM. PM is probably the most reliable indicator for the activity of structure fires, as such fires are generally known to burn incompletely, and produce PM that drifts up and outward from the source. EPA data from the West Broadway sampling site, the location closest to GZ where PM was monitored, show the following trend in very fine PM (PM 2.5 , or all particles \ 2.5 l m) in October and November 2001 (Fig. 4 ). These data show that the peaks in levels of very fine PM near GZ correspond to different dates than the peaks for the previously discussed combustion products. The five stron- gest peaks in PM 2.5 levels are centered on 23th, 26th September, and 3rd, 10th, 20th October, closer in time to the events of 9/11. None of these dates correspond to the dates of five peaks in VOCs noted above. Additionally, it is clear that the levels of PM 2.5 emissions rose more gradu- ally, and died down more gradually, indicating slower fire dynamics as might be expected from the burning of the organic materials previously thought to exist in the WTC. These data suggest that the greatest level of fire activity, associated solely with the typical fuel sources expected in the WTC, was completed by the third week of October. That is, the materials expected to burn (incompletely) in a structure fire, producing PM, were largely burned off by mid- to late-October. Therefore, the extreme spikes in air concentrations of the five VOCs noted above, particularly on 3rd, 8th November, and 9th February, point not to other sources of typical combustible materials but to other forms of com- bustion. Such forms of combustion appear to be violent and short-lived, and thus similar to the effects of energetic materials, like thermite&quot;</p>

<p>I await the peer reviewed, published refutation of this paper. &quot;Good luck&quot; in your search. </p>

<p>Next time, educate yourself on the topic before speaking. It will save you the embarrassment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty solid logic friend.</p>

<p>&quot;I can&#39;t refute the 100+ peer reviewed papers that say i&#39;m wrong, but here&#39;s this 1 paper that doesn&#39;t even make any real sense or confirm anything so that means I&#39;m right&quot;</p>

<p>Who cares if the 4 papers he published before this one are complete bullshit and nobody finds them credible, this 1 paper is the smoking gun.</p>

<p>Except in that it doesn&#39;t actually confirm anything.</p>

<p>I also like how you don&#39;t realize this was published in a bullshit journal too, but you don&#39;t understand what peer review is so in your  conspiratard head you think you&#39;re right.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.springer.com/impact+factor+journals?SGWID=0-1766314-12-1028462-0">http://www.springer.com/impact+factor+journals?SGWID=0-1766314-12-1028462-0</a></p>

<p>So nevermind the fact it was posted in a not credible journal with an impact factor of fucking 0, that&#39;s right the journal in which your article is in has an impact FACTOR OF GOD DAMN 0.</p>

<p>To put that into view for you </p>

<p><a href="https://tools.niehs.nih.gov/srp/publications/highimpactjournals.cfm">https://tools.niehs.nih.gov/srp/publications/highimpactjournals.cfm</a> </p>

<p>Impact factor is how to see if a journal is credible, a 0 impact journal is in no way credible and the peer review isn&#39;t relevant.</p>

<p>The publisher for the article you linked even says this, seriously read the first page I linked the PUBLISHER FOR THE ARTICLE YOU LINKED says impact factor is what makes a journal credible.</p>

<p>So if the only thing you have is a paper published in a 0 impact rating journal then so be it.</p>

<p>You just lost the argument, you might not see it that way but anyone with a brain does.</p>

<p>Anyone with even a small amount of understanding of how peer reviewing works or how journals work knows you&#39;re beyond delusional.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to say this 1 more time and maybe something will snap into place in your brain.</p>

<p>A 0 IMPACT JOURNAL does not a credible paper make.</p>

<p>There is a reason why he had to publish in this journal and not a popular journal or one with any relevance and you know the answer to that.</p>

<p>Even if you don&#39;t want to admit you&#39;re wrong here and think a 0 impact journal matters.</p>

<p>He published it in a journal which has nothing to do with the topic, that&#39;s right he published it in a 0 impact off field journal.</p>

<p>And you think that means peer reviewed? really? are you lying to yourself or trolling.</p>

<p>&quot;The impact factor (IF) of an academic journal is a measure reflecting the average number of citations to recent articles published in that journal. It is frequently used as a proxy for the relative importance of a journal within its field, with journals with higher impact factors deemed to be more important than those with lower ones. The impact factor was devised by Eugene Garfield, the founder of the Institute for Scientific Information. Impact factors are calculated yearly starting from 1975 for those journals that are indexed in the Journal Citation Reports&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it&#39;s a controlled demolition, which means it needs to be safe right? which means more time needs to be put in to make sure the damage to buildings around the target isn&#39;t major.</p>

<p>You literally just debunked your own point in this comment.</p>

<p>The world trade centers coming down did over a billion dollars in damage to surrounding buildings which means it couldn&#39;t have been some controlled demo by professionals.</p>

<p>If these companies were just hired to destroy buildings and not care about damage they could probably do it pretty quickly.</p>

<p>You&#39;re entitled to your own opinion, I&#39;m going to use math and science to form my opinion rather than paranoia.</p>

<p>This is how skeptics work, in order to be a skeptic you need to question your own beliefs which is something conspiracy theorists just don&#39;t do anymore.</p>

<p>I used to believe 9/11 was an inside job and then I started getting into the math and the truther claims and it&#39;s really easy to see why the entire movement is bullshit.</p>

<p>The math does not add up to their claims, steel can in fact become weak when exposed to heat.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m guessing you believe it was thermite that did the melting? why the fuck would they use thermite and then swap to explosives? </p>

<p>The point of this is that every single claim put out by truthers has a counter claim that&#39;s even more likely and has better math.</p>

<p>You&#39;re free to believe whatever you want m8, it&#39;s good to question things but you literally debunked what you said in your own comment.</p>

<p>The more believable angle is that some higher ups knew the attack was coming and simply allowed it. A country that spends as much as we do on military knows how to protect airspace around its major cities.</p>

<p>Then again, the most believable theory I have heard was incompetence on the part of our military and intelligence. A fuck up of that magnitude is worth spreading disinfo to cover it up.</p>

<p>Is this a joke? Silverstein wanted the most cost-effective method of dismantling his asbestos-riddled towers. A disguised demolition that could be blamed on terrorists was chosen, and it returned a massive profit in bogus insurance payouts. It is blatantly obvious that &quot;safety&quot; was not a consideration at all.</p>

<p>This guy won around 4 billion dollars in the settlement, the total cost to rebuild is billions more than that.</p>

<p>He also only got like 60% of the bonds meaning he&#39;s lost a retarded amount of money.</p>

<p>Judging by the fact you linked the cost for... 1 tower and judging by the fact it uh...didn&#39;t update post 2004 with him losing the double claim and not collecting twice on the insurance policy.. which means he lost billions of dollars I&#39;m going to assume you&#39;re not the brightest bulb.

    <div class="md"><p>uh.. ok &quot;backs away slowly&quot; I wasn&#39;t aware I was dealing with an illiterate schizophrenic.</p>

<p>&quot;In December 2004, a jury ruled in favor of the insurance holders&#39; double claim&quot; the math they&#39;re doing is assuming a double pay out counting it as multiple attacks.</p>

<p>and it is literally talking about 1 building, you can read what you linked yourself and see it&#39;s talking about 1 building.</p>

<p>He lost the claim <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2003/09/26/cx_da_0926wtc2.html">http://www.forbes.com/2003/09/26/cx_da_0926wtc2.html</a></p>

<p>Which means he got around 4.1 billion dollars total for the insurance claim..the rebuilding cost was 6+ billion dollars.</p>

<p>It took him 6 years to win this claim, he was paying 120 million dollars a year rent during the entire time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Silverstein won the WTC centre bid, for $3.2 billion for a 99 year lease. <strong>That works out a mere $33 million per year over the period.</strong> Small change.</p>

<p>But the Silverstein consortium only actually put up $125 million collateral, and they got this money back from the Port Authority!</p>

<p>From the article. &quot;In December 2003, the Port Authority agreed to return all of the $125 million in equity that the consortium headed by Silverstein originally invested to buy the lease on the World Trade Center.&quot; </p>

<p>The cost of rebuilding the WTC has been high, but it was almost entirely covered by the insurance payouts, and Silverstein still has 85 years of the (absurdly cheap) lease remaining on which to maximise his profits.</p>

<p>There&#39;s probably only one person that I know who lies as much as you have, and that leads me to ask: are you Larry Silverstein?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How the FUCK is a 4.1 billion insurance payout going to cover the cost of a 7 billion dollar rebuild.</p>

<p>Nearly $3.4 billion in these bonds remains, with the mayor and the governor each controlling half...</p>

<p>The mayor has put Silverstein in an impossible position. Legally, the developer has the right to rebuild. But financially, he needs the Liberty Bonds to do so...</p>

<p>It will cost $4.3 billion for Silverstein to rebuild the World Trade Center and maintain his lease once insurance is exhausted. Like any developer, Silverstein (and his potential lenders) must determine if the project is worth more than its cost: Over the remainder of the lease, will the WTC bring in enough in rents to repay this $4.3 billion investment and earn a profit? </p>

<p>Part of the answer depends on future commercial rents Downtown. Bloomberg says he believes rents won&#39;t rise above pre-9/11 levels (after inflation), while Silverstein thinks they&#39;ll rise to today&#39;s Midtown levels. </p>

<p>Either way, Silverstein&#39;s looking at earning $300 million to $400 million (in today&#39;s dollars) a year, after operating costs and taxes (but before interest costs), for about 80 years - that is, from the time he gets all five towers built to the time the lease ends. </p>

<p>Here is where Bloomberg&#39;s intransigence matters. If New York actually uses its 9/11 rebuilding money at Ground Zero, and Silverstein gets all the Liberty Bonds (with their low interest rate of about 6.5 percent), his future income from the towers would be worth $5.7 billion to $7.5 billion in today&#39;s dollars. At those values, the project is economical even if rents never rise to Midtown levels. Lenders would invest in the project, so it wouldn&#39;t run out of money, as Bloomberg claims it will. </p>

<p>But if Silverstein wins only half of the Liberty Bonds, the finances become murky. The deal wouldn&#39;t be economical unless rents rose quickly, so it might fall short of lenders. </p>

<p>With no Liberty Bonds, the WTC project is not economical unless rents rise stratospherically, because interest costs would consume too much of the project&#39;s future rents. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll just copy paste this here, but you have literally no understanding of how any of this works period.</p>

<p>Nothing I say to you will change your mind, I&#39;m trying to reason with someone that spends most of his time posting anti-jewish conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>Swiss Re shows how Silverstein first tried to buy just $1.5 billion in property damage and business-interruption coverage. When his lenders objected, he discussed buying a $5 billion policy. Ultimately, he settled on the $3.5 billion figure, which was less than the likely cost of rebuilding.</p>

<p>another interesting part, mad profit was made friend. mad profit.</p>

<p>I would love to see a real report/investigation that could look at some of these issues, unfortunately the government stonewalled <em>any investigation whatsoever</em> for almost a year and it was a little too late for good forensics to be done.  I wonder why they did that...</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting then that both FEMA and NIST still insist that the lower sections of the towers offered zero resistance to the collapsing floors, which is physically impossible.  They have not put forward any evidence for why this would be so, presumably because no explanation is better than whatever absurdity they would have to concoct to defy basic physics.  </p>

<p>There are plenty of other facts that have not been explained, like how the hijackers managed to not show up on any airport security cameras while boarding.  The only explanation I can think of for that is that they weren&#39;t there or the tapes were destroyed to benefit a cover-up.</p>

<p>Yes, it&#39;s a very pretty animation.  There&#39;s no actual way of knowing how much damage the plane did though, all we know is that the beams would have destroyed the plane much more efficiently than the plane could destroy the beams considering the strength of the materials in question.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what passage you are referring to so far as the freefall article is concerned, but I haven&#39;t found any information to debunk Chandler&#39;s work on the topic or the study that showed there was no way the weakened core columns could have generated sufficient momentum to negate the entirety of the building below.  This is because weakened metal sags and crumples slowly in different areas; it does not suddenly fail simultaneously among sever floors at once, which is the only way to generate the kind of momentum that would produce a near-freefall collapse (although I do think that even in that scenario it would have taken longer).  There is actauly a good <a href="http://911speakout.org/wp-content/uploads/Some-Misunderstandings-Related-to-WTC-Collapse-Analysis.pdf">paper</a> showing this point mathematically.  It&#39;s also a bit silly that they claim that even explosives couldn&#39;t have brought the towers down, while trying to defend the theory that an airplane did.  Pretty much very easy stuff to debunk if you think about it for a second.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A &#39;bit&#39; of jet fuel is an understatement. 90,000 L was the total amount. Weighing in at 1/3 of the aircraft. However, the fuel was not capable of &#39;melting steel&#39;. It is actually believed that what gave way is the Angle clips which held up the floor between the outer perimeter box column and the inner core. </p>

<p>The towers actually survived the loss of several exterior columns which were damaged due to the aircraft impact. </p>

<p>Each floor was designed to hold 1,300 T above it&#39;s own weight. The floor joists started to give way on the most heavily burnt floors, which caused the outer box columns to bow outwards. This allowed the floors above them to fall. The intact angle clips had to withstand approx. 45,000 T. Way above the specified 1,300 T. This in turn creates the collapsing domino effect you can see when watching the towers collapse.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve also got to remember the building is around 95% air, it isn&#39;t solid. The debris was basically in an unrestricted free fall. The reason for an almost vertical fall was 1) in part due to the weight of the buildings and 2) the limited time it took them to fall.</p>

<p>Generally skyscrapers are designed to last 3 hours when engulfed in flames. The WTC&#39;s didn&#39;t last that long due to the special circumstances. </p>

<p>You also need to remember when these were designed. They were designed to withstand a 707, the largest aircraft at the time of construction. And it was designed without taking the fuel load into consideration. It was hit by a 767 with 90,000 L of fuel. Big difference.
What happened that day surpassed what it had been designed to withstand. And it&#39;s amazing they lasted as long as they did. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t answer your question but I thought informing you on this might be a good thing, since you&#39;re still under the impression the fuel melting the columns was to blame.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>NIST’s findings do not support the “pancake theory” of collapse, which is premised on a progressive failure of the floor systems in the WTC towers (the composite floor system—that connected the core columns and the perimeter columns—consisted of a grid of steel “trusses” integrated with a concrete slab; see diagram).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe you should read the FEMA report or at least the FAQ.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Each floor was designed to hold 1,300 T above it&#39;s own weight. The floor joists started to give way on the most heavily burnt floors, which caused the outer box columns to bow outwards. This allowed the floors above them to fall. The intact angle clips had to withstand approx. 45,000 T. Way above the specified 1,300 T. This in turn creates the collapsing domino effect you can see when watching the towers collapse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yet the engineers who designed the building stated that: &quot;A design procedure that will be used for structural framing of the 1,350-ft high twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York City gives the exterior columns (perimeter columns) tremendous reserve strength. Live loads on these columns can be increased more than 2,000% before failure occurs.&quot;  Since only 23 out of 213 perimeter columns of the affected floors in the South tower were taken out there was obviously plenty of load-bearing strength left over (33 in the North tower were destroyed).  This leaves us to the unavoidable conclusion that the core columns were somehow compromised if the planes did indeed cause the collapse.  Yet FEMA&#39;s own results, while inconclusive, show that it was most likely the plane that was destroyed by the massive steel core columns rather than the other way around.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A &#39;bit&#39; of jet fuel is an understatement. 90,000 L was the total amount</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, FEMA&#39;s own report contradicts your statement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If one assumes that approximately 3,000 gallons of fuel were consumed in the initial fireballs, then the remainder either escaped the impact floors in the manners described above or was consumed by the fire on the impact floors. If half flowed away, then approximately 4,000 gallons remained on the impact floors to be consumed in the fires that followed. The jet fuel in the aerosol would have burned out as fast as the flame could spread through it, igniting almost every combustible on the floors involved.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The remaining fuel burned off in about three minutes or so, according to FEMA, so we are basically supposed to believe that a paper and carpet fire weakened thousands of tons of steel to collapsing point.  I wouldn&#39;t say the story is impossible, but it is quite improbable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;ve also got to remember the building is around 95% air, it isn&#39;t solid. The debris was basically in an unrestricted free fall. The reason for an almost vertical fall was 1) in part due to the weight of the buildings and 2) the limited time it took them to fall.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is just bad physics.  The building had a lot of spaces for debris to fall through (although that debris would be slowed down by the force of crashing through concrete and metal floors), but that doesn&#39;t negate the fact that the core columns were not air and should have offered a great deal of resistance.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nX8xt5YOjg">Chandler</a> goes through the physics in this video.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>90,000 L was the total amount of fuel the jet could store onboard, it was not the amount of fuel that burned inside the building, or even onboard the aircraft at the time. A lot of it was burned in the initial impact.</p>

<p>Edit: Apparently the aircraft, did a mid air refueling so that it could be completely full of fuel so that it&#39;s tanks would be able to deliver the total fuel payload and bring down the tower. This happened for both aircraft. I mean it&#39;s not like you need to burn some fuel to take off and travel to your destination. Oh I know the terrorists brought extra fuel onboard!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>actually quite the contrary.</p>

<p>The buildings were indeed rigged with explosives which is why they came down. </p>

<p>The &quot;hijacked&quot; planes were just cover for the controlled demolitions.</p>

<p>It is documented that Donald Rumsfeld changed the protocol for intercepting hijacked planes just before 9/11 so that the only way they would intercept was to contact him personally but he was unreachable. He changed that back after 9/11. Similarly, Mineta was in the war room with Dick Cheney who would not let them shoot down the planes. An officer told Cheney, &quot;Mr. Vice President, the plane is ten miles out, do the orders still stand?&quot;</p>

<p>These show involvement from our dear leaders. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very few people are claiming that it wasn&#39;t possible, mostly they say that a steel-frame collapse from fire is unlikely and if it was to happen it wouldn&#39;t happen at essentially free-fall speed.  The oddity of the speed of the collapse has never been debunked, indeed the government reports on the collapses do not address anything beyond the initiation-point of the collapse.  How a building that large could fall straight through itself with practically nil resistance from the lower (more robust) sections while generating enough heat to create molten steel for weeks is something physics is not capable of explaining.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So let me ask you this, if thousands of engineers all agree it was possible, and a very small minority say it wasn&#39;t who is right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, thousands of engineers and terror experts thought it was impossible before it happened.  This is why the NYFD sent hundreds of men into the buildings while the 911 operators told everyone not to evacuate.  Either way, you cannot deny that the experts can easily get it wrong.  </p>

<p>Since the stories below the level of collapse initiation provided little resistance to the tremendous energy released by the falling building mass, the building section above came down essentially in free fall, as seen in videos. As the stories below sequentially failed, the falling mass increased, further increasing the demand on the floors below, which were unable to arrest the moving mass.</p>

Y&#39;all argue that finding the truth is paramount and that that will ultimately respect the dead... But the truth is, a bunch of horrible men, hijacked several planes, crashed them, this was the result.</p>

<p>Picture if you will a middle eastern man flying an aircraft he&#39;s never flown before. Now picture this man making a perfect landing, ground level, into one of the five most heavily guarded buildings on the planet. Further picture that this man, who has never flown or landed a jet liner before, perfectly hits the building where during the previous week an investigation into a couple missing billion dollars was just getting under way.</p>

<p>Look at the photos of building 6 directly after the &#39;collapse&#39; and before there was any removal of debris (all exterior walls are still standing - they would have had to have removed the debris with a large crane instead of just tearing down the walls if in fact that&#39;s where the debris went - this would have been ludicrous). There is no debris inside or on top of building 6. Nada. There is no logical explanation for it in the realm of the official conspiracy (government) story.</p>

<p>I see a completely open inner building. I see the garage below with a car that is not even crushed. I do not see what I think would be the debris from the collapse of that building. I guess you and I have a different idea of how much debris there would be from this collapse. I don&#39;t know what happened to building 6, but in my mind there is no way near enough debris in the middle of that structure.</p>

<p>Specious. You are assuming the only nuclear technology we have was developed over 60 years ago with no technological advance since. I&#39;m not stating anything definitive.

<p>Again, I make NO definitive statements. I only speak of open-minded possibility. The reason I question WTC 1/2 is because of the implausibility of Building 7. Physics dictates that the only way that roof line could have fallen at the acceleration of gravity is if there was absolutely zero resistance from ANY of the building beneath it. NIST issued a post report statement, once pressured, that the building did indeed experience a period of fall at the rate of the acceleration of gravity. I ask you, does it make any logical sense that every single support column failed simultaneously creating absolutely no physical resistance allowing for that fall speed? THAT is why I open my mind to other possibilities with 1 and 2. I draw no conclusions. I make no definite statements. I WOULD, however, like to see an actual investigation that actually wanted to find out what happened to the buildings. Too bad the evidence was quickly destroyed, which is against all criminal investigative protocols into building collapses. Did you know they didn&#39;t test for explosives residue, which is mandatory under criminal investigative protocol into building collapses? These protocols are LAWS. The ensuing clean up of the sites and destruction of evidence were actually criminal acts.</p>

<p>edit - I think you have it backwards. I believe in science. It&#39;s religion that makes people believe what they&#39;re told, even if there is no actual evidence to support it. Don&#39;t question the word - trust and believe in authority.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t remember any local tests for radiation. Hell, they declared the area safe and free from carcinogens including asbestos. We all know how that turned out.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Lucky Larry&quot; is even luckier than that!!</p>

<p>Thanks to his Israeli connections (none other than &quot;Bibi&quot; and an entire network of Sayanim) he not only knew the buildings were coming down months ahead of time--he bought these asbestos-filled white elephants for pennies on the dollar, insured them <em>specifically</em> against &quot;acts of terrorism&quot; (I think that was a first), made a <strong>fortune</strong> on the put options on the airlines (basically betting that the stock will go down), made ANOTHER fortune on the insurance that paid out hundreds of millions of times what the buildings were worth, didn&#39;t have to spend penny one on asbestos abatement (instead letting the first responders breathe that shit and DIE)--and then had the <em>chutzpah</em> to sue the airlines!!!</p>

<p>Say what you will about this fucking CRIMINAL...he has balls that are made of brass!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems that it is also true that no steel framed building had ever been left to burn - without sprinklers or fire hoses - as WTC 7 was, and none have been left to burn since (around 7hrs without water). </p>

<p>Also, WTC 1 &amp; 2 were hit by a Boeing 767-223ER and a Boeing 757-223 carrying close to 40,000 liters of fuel each and this had also never happened before. The majority of those fires were also left to burn due to destroyed sprinkler systems and terrible access issues for the firemen.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Larry Silverstein has to be the unluckiest man in history! He owned 3 skyscrapers..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lucky? He <em>built</em> WTC 7........</p>

<p><em>&quot;By 1978, Silverstein owned five buildings on Fifth Avenue, as well as 44 Wall Street, and a shopping center in Stamford, Connecticut. In 1980, he renovated the building at 11 West 42nd Street, and acquired the lease for the Equitable Building at 120 Broadway.In 1983, Silverstein sold the building at 711 Fifth Avenue to Coca-Cola for $57.6 million (equals $136.4 million in 2014), having bought the building in 1977 for $11.5 million ($44.8 million in 2014). Also in 1980, Silverstein bought the building at 120 Wall Street, which was constructed in 1930. In 1991, Silverstein set aside 20 floors of 120 Wall Street to be leased by non-profit organizations, as an Association Center, with tax incentives for the tenants and bonds for Silverstein to undertake building renovations. By 1994, Silverstein had signed up 14 nonprofit tenants for 120 Wall Street, and the building was nearly at capacity by 1997, with 38 nonprofit tenants including the National Urban League and the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America. In 1980, Larry Silverstein won a bid to lease and develop the last undeveloped parcel from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, to build the 47-story building 7 World Trade Center.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Also, he owned WTC 4 which is always glossed over. This was also destroyed beyond repair, along with 3, 5 and 6.</p>

<p><em>&quot;George Pataki became Governor of New York in 1995 on a campaign of cutting costs, including privatizing the World Trade Center. A sale of the property was considered too complex, so it was decided by the Port Authority to open a 99-year lease to competitive bidding. In January 2001, Silverstein, via Silverstein Properties and Westfield America, made a $3.2 billion bid for the lease to the World Trade Center. Silverstein was outbid by $30 million by Vornado Realty, with Boston Properties and Brookfield Properties also competing for the lease. However, Vornado withdrew and Silverstein&#39;s bid for the lease to the World Trade Center was accepted on July 24, 2001. This was the first time in the building&#39;s 31-year history that the complex had changed management. The lease agreement applied to One, Two, Four, and Five World Trade Center, and about 425,000 square feet (39,500 m2) of retail space. Silverstein put up $14 million of his own money to secure the deal. The agreement gave Silverstein, as leaseholder, the right and the obligation to rebuild the structures if destroyed.&quot;</em></p>

<p>That is one loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong game.</p>

<p>This is not true at all. Many steel framed buildings have been left to burn out. Look at the CCTV building in China for one. All that was left was a steel frame. The WTC 7 fire itself, according to NIST, was a small office fire.</p>

<p>WTC 7</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxl06jxfgRk">WTC 7 went into free-fall (click for a compilation)</a>, literally gravitational acceleration <a href="http://i.imgur.com/N23Y89K.png">(the official reports even admit this)</a> which is impossible in a steel framed building (without the use of explosives) </p>

<p>This violates basic Newtonian physics, IF, you choose to believe the official report that fires caused the collapse, obviously it is impossible for a building to go into freefall in any other scenario, this explains why NIST refuse to release there data for independent validation, the only relevant documents that support their theory that fire brought down a steel framed building (first time in history, still to this day) <a href="http://cryptome.org/nist070709.pdf">are classified for public safety</a>, they will not even release them to a <a href="http://cryptome.org/wtc-nist-wtc7-no.pdf">licensed NYC architect in regards a FOIA request</a></p>

<p>What and why are they hiding this? Likely because it is not based on any known science and engineering principles, if we have to go on what they have released so far, <a href="http://rememberbuilding7.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/NIST-collapse-model-building-7.jpg">a collapse model that bores no resemblance to the observed collapse</a> </p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/QyTbq5P">Page 3 and the architect&#39;s appeal over the remaining 3370 files</a></p>

<p>The acceleration of gravity in New York City is 32.159 ft/s2. WTC7 had 2.25 seconds of literal freefall, this is equivalent to approximately 8 stories of fall in which the falling section of the building encountered zero resistance. The collapse was complete in 6.5 seconds. Free-fall time in a vacuum, from Building 7&#39;s roof is 5.96 seconds</p>

<p>For any object to fall at gravitational acceleration, there can be nothing below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance. If there is anything below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance, then not all of the potential energy of the object would be converted to motion and so would not be found falling at gravitational acceleration (where did every single structural supporting columns go, instantly, at the exact same time?)</p>

<p>There&#39;s no exception to that rule, those are the conditions that must exist for gravitational acceleration to occur for the entirety of the duration of the time it occurs, this is basic Newtonian physical principles.</p>

<p>You either agree with this very basic concept, or you need to start making a case for a new realm of science that has never been witnessed before.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltP2t9nq9fI">Remember also that the BBC even reported that the building had collapsed 20minutes before it had</a>, remarkable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I simply cannot fathom someone having an issue understanding that 2 fully loaded and fueled jetliners can take down two huge towers which would also destroy surrounding buildings. It&#39;s amazing for people to not understand this simple truth. You can argue about if the US knew the attacks were coming and did not stop them. You can debate if the planes were flown remotely. All kinds of things to argue. But those buildings were brought down by the damage inflicted on them from those air craft. That&#39;s the dull truth of it. </p>

<p>Here is the picture of building 7 on fire just so you can see how massive it was

    <div class="md"><p>I knew you&#39;d link this website, let&#39;s talk about Gage.</p>

<p>Richard rage is an interesting guy and has some theories about building 7, Which I&#39;ll fully agree is weird some what but the guy is not really credible at all. first of all he&#39;s an architect, he isn&#39;t an engineer and he isn&#39;t an explosive expert at all.</p>

<p>This guy likes to brag about the fact he&#39;s a member of the AIA even though the AIA wants nothing to do with his website.</p>

<p>He even tried to act like they endorsed him even though that&#39;s 0% true, basically just lied to make himself seem more credible.</p>

<p>He&#39;s actually seen as kind of crazy by them, I wonder why.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s another cool fact about Gage, 31% of the architects and engineers for 9/11 truth go to paying his fucking salary.</p>

<p>That&#39;s right, this guy is paying himself nearly 100 thousand dollars a year for this non profit.</p>

<p>The evidence this guy has is also highly questionable, he&#39;s been caught lying multiple times.</p>

<p>Remember his thermite claims? remember when he got caught lying about the evidence of thermite? </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a video of him lying about the thermite.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDiAlMIJ8A4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDiAlMIJ8A4</a> and he still has this on his website claiming thermite was found when it never was.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.debunking911.com/thermite.htm">http://www.debunking911.com/thermite.htm</a> here&#39;s the debunking of the thermite claim backed with math that&#39;s very easy to check on your own.</p>

<p>He also claims the buildings fell at free fall speed right, that&#39;s also on his website and that&#39;s also been debunked.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.debunking911.com/freefall.htm">http://www.debunking911.com/freefall.htm</a></p>

<p>Seriously, don&#39;t believe me check the fucking math it&#39;s right there you can easily check it yourself.</p>

<p>Look, these people are entitled to their opinions and they do have around 2200 members but compared to the over whelming majority that&#39;s still a minority.</p>

<p>Literally every piece of evidence on this guys website has been debunked by people far more credible than him and that are actually experts in their field.</p>

<p>Be it explosives or be it engineers.</p>

<p>Either way we can&#39;t know for sure what happened, all we can do is look at the science the math and evidence and form an opinion.</p>

<p>And the over whelming majority of engineers agree that most of what richard gage has said has already been debunked.</p>

<p>That combined with the fact he&#39;s just shady as fuck and is using some 30% of the funds to pay his own salary makes it very questionable.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t that what we were talking about?</p>

<p>Did any other steel frame building got hit with a jetliner full of fuel since or before?</p>

<p>It seems to me you are doing your best to confuse the matter rather than try and figure out what happened.  Why is that?</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t make much sense that, if they were planning to covertly demolish it and pretend it fell on its own, he would publicly announce that they demolished it.</p>

<p>The WTC was a very light building in terms of dead weight vs structural support weight, theres no way jet fuel fires would weaken the beams enough for their to be such a catastrophic failure. At most it would have turned the buildings in giant flaming pyres.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, read through a lot of this discussion, and the narrative is mind numbing. Why would the amount of steel above the damaged areas matter? Look at the structures fully engulfed. The ENTIRE structure is on fire and did not fall. Your arguments do not hold merrit. And then you will say &quot;they gotz hitted by planes dough?!&quot;. And wtc 7 did not, and still collapsed. If one building was demo&#39;d they all were. I can&#39;t wait until we start lynching people over this issue</p>

<p>Again, I make NO definitive statements. I only speak of open-minded possibility. The reason I question WTC 1/2 is because of the implausibility of Building 7. Physics dictates that the only way that roof line could have fallen at the acceleration of gravity is if there was absolutely zero resistance from ANY of the building beneath it. NIST issued a post report statement, once pressured, that the building did indeed experience a period of fall at the rate of the acceleration of gravity. I ask you, does it make any logical sense that every single support column failed simultaneously creating absolutely no physical resistance allowing for that fall speed? THAT is why I open my mind to other possibilities with 1 and 2. I draw no conclusions. I make no definite statements. I WOULD, however, like to see an actual investigation that actually wanted to find out what happened to the buildings. Too bad the evidence was quickly destroyed, which is against all criminal investigative protocols into building collapses. Did you know they didn&#39;t test for explosives residue, which is mandatory under criminal investigative protocol into building collapses? These protocols are LAWS. The ensuing clean up of the sites and destruction of evidence were actually criminal acts.</p>

<p>edit - I think you have it backwards. I believe in science. It&#39;s religion that makes people believe what they&#39;re told, even if there is no actual evidence to support it. Don&#39;t question the word - trust and believe in authority.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I simply cannot fathom someone having an issue understanding that 2 fully loaded and fueled jetliners can take down two huge towers which would also destroy surrounding buildings. It&#39;s amazing for people to not understand this simple truth. You can argue about if the US knew the attacks were coming and did not stop them. You can debate if the planes were flown remotely. All kinds of things to argue. But those buildings were brought down by the damage inflicted on them from those air craft. That&#39;s the dull truth of it. </p>
