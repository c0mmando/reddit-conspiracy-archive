       So, about 12 hours ago The Daily Mail posted
       <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3033329/ISIS-execute-ten-doctors-bullet-head-refused-treat-wounded-members-terror-group-Iraq.html">
        this story
       </a>
       with the headline:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Killed with a bullet to the head: ISIS execute ten doctors after they refused to treat wounded members of the terror group in Iraq
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       If anyone’s been paying attention to the things I’ve been posting about the past 8 months, you’d know that a headline like that is certainly going to grab my attention. It also rose up in the
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       board, currently sitting at 3832 points (94% upvoted)
       <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/324fdt/10_doctors_shot_dead_after_refusing_to_treat_isis/">
        here
       </a>
       . Go reddit! From the Daily Mail to that reddit post, lots of people are gonna see this story.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the Daily Mail article (which I have archived
       <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150411013722/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3033329/ISIS-execute-ten-doctors-bullet-head-refused-treat-wounded-members-terror-group-Iraq.html">
        here
       </a>
       <em>
        just in case
       </em>
       ), they have
       <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/04/10/09/276C673000000578-3033329-image-a-6_1428655739864.jpg">
        this picture
       </a>
       , and thankfully they blurred out the faces otherwise we would see some nasty imagery, since the description reads:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Shocking: This photograph - taken in the battle-ravaged area 15 miles south of the extremists' northern Iraqi stronghold Mosul - captures the moment fighters killed several of the doctors with a bullet to the head
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Naturally, my morbid curiosity got the best of me, and I went hunting for at least this picture without blurred out faces, and at best, the video of this so-called execution (not the first, of course). So off I went.
      </p>
      <p>
       I first went to liveleak, and found
       <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=d07_1428578545">
        this post
       </a>
       (archived
       <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150411014408/http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=d07_1428578545">
        here
       </a>
       ) where I found
       <a href="https://cdn.liveleak.com/80281E/ll_a_s/2015/Apr/9/LiveLeak-dot-com-d07_1428578545-ISIL-Execute-620x330_1428578656.jpg.resized.jpg?d5e8cc8eccfb6039332f41f6249e92b06c91b4db65f5e99818bdd59e4a41dcdff8aa&amp;ec_rate=230">
        this picture
       </a>
       where I now have non-blurred out faces! Fantastic. Before we go any further down this rabbit hole, I want you to remind yourself what the Daily Mail said this picture depicted:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Shocking: This photograph - taken in the battle-ravaged area 15 miles south of the extremists' northern Iraqi stronghold Mosul - captures the moment fighters killed several of the doctors with a bullet to the head
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Now, look at that picture again. I see sand kicking up in front of them, but I don’t see any bullets in heads, blood
       <strong>
        anywhere
       </strong>
       , no pieces of people’s heads or anything after being shot in the back of the head. So,
       <em>
        at the very least
       </em>
       , the Daily Mail is not being completely honest with us about this picture. But let’s take a walk and go even further. I am obviously skeptical of this picture now, as its description in the Daily Mail (and on
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       ) does not compute with the reality of what it shows.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first time I found this picture published online that I could fine with a bit of research is on The Long War Journal
       <a href="http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2014/06/isis_photos_show_con.php">
        here
       </a>
       (archived
       <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140626070350/http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2014/06/isis_photos_show_con.php">
        here
       </a>
       which leads off with:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Islamic State of Iraq and the Sham's Ninewa Division released a set of photographs that details the attack on and capture of an Iraqi military command center, captured military hardware, and the execution of Iraqi prisoners.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Under
       <em>
        the picture
       </em>
       the caption reads:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ISIS fighters execute three Iraqi soldiers
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What’s
       <em>
        even more interesting
       </em>
       is the date,
       <strong>
        June 24th, 2014
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Movin’ on….
      </p>
      <p>
       It also shows up
       <strong>
        September 30th, 2014
       </strong>
       in Michael J. Totten’s piece in
       <a href="http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/blog/michael-j-totten/islamic-state-using-human-shields">

        archived here
       </a>
       titled
       <strong>
        Islamic State Using Human Shields
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Here’s the first two paragraphs. The emphasis is original, not my own.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Pentagon says Islamic State fighters in Syria are using human shields to protect themselves from American airstrikes. I can’t verify that claim, but it’s a little like saying the Islamists breathe oxygen.
        <em>
         Of course
        </em>
        they’re using human shields. It’s what terrorist armies in the Middle East
        <em>
         do
        </em>
        when facing a civilized enemy.
       </p>
       <p>
        It wouldn’t accomplish squat against a war criminal like Bashar al-Assad. His regime would happily take out a thousand Sunni civilians to kill a single Islamist fighter. He’d see the thousand civilians as bonus points. But the West doesn’t fight like that and the Islamic State knows it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Propaganda much?
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s only a few examples from my reverse image search via
       <a href="https://www.tineye.com/search/d9d6b9078467dec20ae7fe90e9d7bc29894e21d1?page=1&amp;sort=crawl_date&amp;order=asc">
        tineye
       </a>
       , which pulled up 22 results of the image, with the majority of the results not within the last 24-48 hours, but
       <em>
        months ago
       </em>
       . What did the Daily Mail describe that picture as again? Oh yeah:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Shocking: This photograph - taken in the battle-ravaged area 15 miles south of the extremists' northern Iraqi stronghold Mosul - captures the moment fighters killed several of the doctors with a bullet to the head
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So, if this post and this idea actually catches on and they change the photo - I don't want it to be hidden behind a 'oh, well, we picked the wrong picture.' Bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am reminded of a story from about 2 months ago, involving Senator James Inofe on the Senate floor using old photos and claiming Russia was invading Ukraine or something. Seriously, here’s a
       <a href="http://wtfrly.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ukraineinhofesenatefloorfp.jpg">
        picture
       </a>
       of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://freebeacon.com/national-security/exclusive-photos-show-russian-military-in-ukraine-arming-separatists/">
        Freebeacon
       </a>
       originally published the story but updated their story thankfully when people started calling him out for his bullshit. There's a good summary in that piece at least for you all if that went down the memory hole for ya 8 weeks ago. I still remember (and I bet Pepperidge Farm does, too).
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s happening here,
       <em>
        right now
       </em>
       , although I’m sure it’ll be washed away as a ‘mistake’ and a regrettable picture use once it gets retracted tomorrow. But it won’t matter, because everyone who saw that reddit headline and saw that Daily Mail article will
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       that ISIS executed 10 doctors, and fuck, man, we should ramp up some shit and take back Mosul.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you all think? I think you're seeing the media/propaganda arm ramp up a campaign to
       <em>
        manufacture consent
       </em>
       for an increased presence in the region over the next few days/weeks. And they appear to be desparate, because they're reusing old photos from months ago saying they are current.

       Here's what I don't get about this particular theory that you guys love. I'm assuming you guys agree that the US invaded Iraq in 2003 to install a puppet regime for &lt;insert shadowy global masters here&gt;. So why would the same intelligence services that played a role in that regime change create a group that has severely undermined the US installed regime while also severely destabilizing the area. It makes no sense.

       Oh I see so they expect the United States Governement to support them with nothing in return? I see the light now, that makes all the sense. Tell me though, if they destabilize the economies of the nations that they are using and they go into economic collapse where does that leave our shadowy overlords?

       Well can't deny the fact that a small margin of people really profited from the conflict.
Dick Cheney for one, all defence contractors, those all recieved hansom amounts of money.
Also recently well actually a while back, I saw a fun graph i thought the la times posted it.
Where it showed the stocks rising from the top military complex in the us since the bonanza raindance in ukraine and the middle east.

       Well, if you take the literal standpoint it is not. Supply and demand actually quite easy.
But the amount of lobbying for the sake of that profit is quite evil imho.

       That is a valid question and I am not sure that I have an answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you look at the macro view of US and Israeli involvment in the ME, it seems that we are working to destabilize the region rather than picking a side or group we want to win. The obvious exception being the Saudis. We also have a vested interest in a stable Pakistan due to the nukes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have read some Mossad officials comments that their view is that a terrorist organization such as ISIS is inherently a lesser threat than a hostile country with full spectrum military capability. All the more so if Mossad helped create said terrorist organization.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: that is not to discount Dusty's valid observation that war is profitable for the military industrial complex and ISIS got us back over there dropping $100k bombs.

       Good job man, you clearly took the unbiased side and questioned the official narrative. Keep it going.

       On a semi related note.
I once saw a isis video of them having a line of probably iraqy prisoners, and then executing them one by one by a dock of some sort.
Like a conveyor belt system one came upfront got a bullet in the back of the head and were dumped in the water.

       But a couple of weird things I've notice irregular recoil, as if the guy was faking it no visible muzzle flash, no entry wound/blood.
Might be the prehistoric camera or it was a set-up in order to ignite this shite conflict even further.

       What about the various "Ukrainian self defense militia" that have been funded and equipped by the Russian government? How do you think a bunch of militia got their hands on and were trained to use the SAM battery that brought down that civilian plane? Of course I'm sure you all assume that was a Western false flag or some other nonsense.

       Oh boy wow. Are you serious with this shit? So it wasn't a SAM battery, it was 2 SU-25s operating at 30,000 shooting at the plane from both sides with their auto-cannons? Why on earth would Frogfoots be up that high? Kudos to the author for noting their lower ceiling due to pressure issues but I guess he didn't bother to mention that SU-25s would barely be able to generate enough thrust to stay above the stall speed given the difficulty of the aircrafts' engines to suck in enough air that high.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.sukhoi.org/eng/planes/military/su25k/lth/">
        http://www.sukhoi.org/eng/planes/military/su25k/lth/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that the aircraft's ceiling is listed at about 23,000 ft- and that's when carrying no weapons or external fuel tanks.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's doable but a bizarre choice of aircraft. Not to mention the fact that it makes no sense to take down the craft with cannon fire if the cover story is going to be that it was taken down with a SAM.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, if this was Ukranian attack craft, why weren't they on radar? That close to the Russian border, those airplanes would be well within range of Russian early warning radars. SU-25's are the opposite of stealthy, they have a fairly large radar cross section. Considering the fact that the Russian government was being accused of supplying the SAM that took down the plane, why wouldn't they point out that they had picked up radar contacts closing on the civilian plane shortly before it was shot down? Given the extreme range of early warning radars, revealing the radar coverage of that area would not reveal anything about their air defense capabilities, so they would have no reason to not let people know about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Something else that I forgot to mention- what about ATC? I have a hard time believing that a couple of SU-25s could intercept a civilian aircraft and get close enough to use their cannons without crossing through at least one ATC radar.
      </p>
      <p>
       And of course all of this forces us to ignore the fact that US spy satellites took pictures of what looked like a SAM firing within range of the aircraft at the time it was shot down, ignoring the intercepted communications of panicked rebels realizing their mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, what is more likely, poorly trained militia shoot down a radar contact very similiar to a Ukranian military transport, or the Ukranian government dispatches highly visible ground attack aircraft to carry out an easy to uncover false flag operation that would leave them without any allies if discovered? Is it really so hard for you to believe that the Russian government irresponsibly supplied the militia with advanced weapons? You guys seem to have no problems believing that the US does such things (and it does). What is it about Russia that just short circuits your normal penchant for seeing nefarious plots behind everything?

       I don't mean radar tracking of the civilian craft, I mean the Ukrainian attack craft that supposedly shot it down. They surely would have been within coverage of Russia's early warning radars. And, if the civilian aircraft was tracked from the moment it took off by radar, why hasn't anyone said anything about unknown radar signatures converging on the plane shortly before it was shot down? Or is that part of the coverup?

      <p>
       Second edit: In looking for those photos I was reminded that the militia had bragged about shooting down a Ukranian military transport roughly the same size of MH17 (and thus would have looked similar on the radar of the SAM) shortly after it was shot down and then pulled their bragging posts shortly after news broke that a civilian aircraft crashed.
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And, there is circumstantial evidence that the fighter jet conspiracy claim comes from the Russian government. A state owned Russian media outlet got caught releasing (badly) photoshopped satellite photos showing an SU-25 shooting down MH17 with it's guns. Imagine that!

You source mentions holes in the cockpit section of the fuselage and claims an SAM wouldn't do this because: "No missile fired from the distance more than 30,000 feet down to the ground could have been that precise to target the pilot rather than the far larger target of the plane’s entire body." Here's the problem, the SA-17, like most long range SAMs, is radar guided. Radar guided SAMs don't actually "chase" their targets. They follow a path estimated to intercept the target at the front of the aircraft. If you read accounts of combat pilots, they note that they can visually tell when a radar SAM is actively tracking them because the missile appears to hang in place on their canopy- since it's continually adjusting its path to intercept the nose of their craft. So a radar SAM should be expected to cause damage towards the fore of the aircraft. An aircraft flying through a cloud of shrapnel released by a detonating SAM would easily explain the entry of objects from various sides of the cockpit. The evidence that this was a radar guided SAM is pretty overwhelming to be honest.

       Are you sure you're going to go with the fact that you have to zoom in (how much, by the way?) to find some pixels of
       <em>

       Actually I have been considering a website that makes it easy to dissect media stories to point out the bullshit but I just meant that when someone in this sub does just that, we could at least upvote their link to it on worldnews or whatever and of course we have to act fast before it falls off the radar.

       Well it doesn't mean ISIS didn't kill any doctors. Being a tabloid of dubious quality I would argue that the Daily Mail is using an old photo because they wanted a picture to help get some shock value out of the article. It may be thatthe govt. or editors are encouraging them to try and get people pissed at ISIS because support for a full on war against them is pretty vital (considering what happened when the US went to the ME last time or the Vietnam War shit storm) At the end of the day though this is pretty shady practice for a news outlet it seems like a harmless moneymaking ploy to me. Seeing as you only discovered this conspiracy because you wanted to look at photos of people getting executed it doesn't take much of a stretch to see why people might choose the DM over another paper because one has a picture to back up its clickbait as fuck headlines.

       And I think you're dismissing the impact a story (built on lies) can have in the age of retweets and social media, as well as it's impact in social psychology to condition the masses towards one thing or idea and another.

       The

        story
       </em>
       isn't built on lies though. It's built on facts that are yet to be disproven. The photo accompanying the story is a lie. Th impact it has is to enhance the feelings felt by people who read the article which as of right now ha not be proven to be lies.

       Wouldn't it be more work to fake murder, opposed to just finding some randoms to execute? I'm not saying I deny the plausibility,  it just doesn't make much sense.

       Never said it was fake, but the imagery used was not correct (as I have shown). It is entirely possible that those 10 doctors were murdered. But this picture does not depict that act.

       I thought that's what you were implying based on this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Now, look at that picture again. I see sand kicking up in front of them, but I don’t see any bullets in heads, blood anywhere, no pieces of people’s heads or anything after being shot in the back of the head.
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       But I see where you're going. You would think they would have them lined up numerically like that group of coptic Christians they executed.
