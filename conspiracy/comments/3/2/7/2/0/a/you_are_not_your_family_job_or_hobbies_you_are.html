       Once you identify with awareness you will know peace. The truth is actually right in front of you. It's just hard to see when your ability to discern and perceive is skewed because you are identified with various aspects of your 'life story.' Become comfortable with the state of pure awareness and directly perceive the truth, every moment of every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw this isn't some unobtainable goal reserved only for the greatest people in history, etc. It's actually not that hard. And, once you see it, is pretty damn obvious.

       This post is scratching the surface. Awareness has a source and can gain access to source.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice how you lose awareness when you go into deep sleep? Well the masters of awareness stay aware, even in deep sleep, and it takes practice to reach that sort of mastery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, awareness can exist outside of the body

       Afaik, source refers to the belief that consciousness and awareness have one source, and you are but one part of it.  The best way I've heard it described is it's like a river, and you are but one droplet from that river. This also leads to the idea that all are one.  We are all connected, every single living creature.  Which is completely true when it comes to DNA. Every living creature on this planet shares some part of their DNA with us and all other creatures.

       Just like u/Lonesurvivor has said, pretty much sums it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my case, I have experienced this. When consciousness no longer identified with ego or body, it sort of loosened from the head space and dropped into the heart, where there is the entrance in Oneness.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has also caused me plenty of OBE's as well as access to the,subconscious to certain degrees, which has allowed me to remember that I existed prior to being born in or as a body

       Who is the "I" that you are referring to (i.e. what, fundamentally, composes this entity you refer to as 'I'?) Is it your body - which consists of entirely different cells than it did last year? Is it your  personality, which constantly changes with new experience? Can't be. The only unchanging thing about 'you' is that you are aware!

       I have always thought  of internal paradigm shifts only truly occurring after extreme stress. Look at the story of the uni bomber. They subjected him to extreme social rejection during a critical period of development (trying to impress a senior role model) in a controlled environment which changed him for the rest of his life.

       Another thing I acknowledge is the nature of duality. Love/hate being the same thing for example and the true opposite of those being apathy. It's very easy to turn one into the other in a matter of moments. But you're not really adding or removing a part, you're just changing the filter through which it's expressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any other  sort of change is just an illusion (considering your younger self as dumber when you were actually smarter than you think for example) or not very much of a shift at all but perhaps a shift in freedom to express something that was always there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now forget paradigm shifts. What is truly strange is the nature of internal perception fundamentally. Someone reply with a solution for THAT quandary.

       Yes, that's been my perception.  Complicated mental change is precipitated by situations that require it, more or less.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that love and hate are two sides of the same "intense emotion".  It seems unfortunate that they are both capable of prevailing over one another, and I have not yet found an understanding of the circumstances that reliably lead to one's guaranteed triumph over the other.  There is quite a bit of difficulty in even enticing interested parties in such a conflict to even momentarily consider their situation from a different perspective.  Often people will feel a dramatic change based on which side "wins" at any point in their life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rather than illusion I feel it is more of a self-delusion in which most people feel compelled to engage.  It is an objective self-reinforcing truth of auto-analysis that we are always learning new information, however we often judge ourselves based on the premise that we do not forget old information.  It's hard to know at any one point what the complete picture is, let alone how that relates to our idea of others and the reality of their lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've heard it suggested that those who study it mentally emulate the equations of quantum mechanics based on mathematics and a basic understanding of the universe that we do not yet cognitively possess.  Maybe our "soul" is an artifact of the universe like other fundamental forces--some bosonic trapping of our fermionic construction that can only perceive its own existence without the aid of our biological machine capable of many different types of sensory perception.  In effect, some basic part of us enables the most reductive Cartesian observation.

       The "I" that you think is typing it is a fiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of it this way:  if a schizophrenic told you that he was a robot and was being controlled by aliens you'd probably think that was a pretty obvious fiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing most people don't get is that even our ordinary everyday egos are fictions.  They are just such a common form of mental illness that we don't pay attention to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       This might be hard to follow but think of a dollar bill.  No most people can't see that dollar for what it is - just a piece of paper.  The actual value of it is pretty low - you could write on it, wipe your ass with it etc., but you can't eat or drink it or do much else of actual value with it.  All the "value" it has is a fiction that your mind imposed on it.  It is just such a commonly held delusion that no one ever sees the money for the paper it is.  I think this same process is at work with our own minds.  Our minds themselves are just pure awareness, but we impose egos onto them.  These egos don't actually exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subtract our imposed delusions and:
       <br/>
       The money will always just be paper.
       <br/>
       The mind will always just be pure awareness.

       I think this is going one step further and saying that you are not even the internal self that you define.  Something that can change so dramatically over decades--even if you could identify the similarities between the beginning and end states--is independently defined by some other concept difficult to put into English words.  You are your own unique perception of the events of your lifetime.

       Descartes was wrong it turns out, "I think therefore I am" should simply be "I am"
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were only your thoughts you wouldn't be aware of them, you would simply be following every thought that pops into your head (I think a lot of people do live like this, I used to at least)
      </p>
      <p>
       "I can hear this thought in my head" What hears it? If it was simply the act of thinking that makes you something you wouldn't know it. There is something above thinking... this is awareness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your thoughts are clouds, your awareness is the sky. Just because its stormy and the sky is filled with clouds doesn't mean that the clouds are all there is.
