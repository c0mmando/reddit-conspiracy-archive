        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey folks, It&#39;s me again.  You might remember when I posted <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2qozgo/time_to_get_meta_comprehensive_overview_of_common/">this</a> little number a few months back.  It got some love, it got some hate, I don&#39;t care either way as long as somebody walked away informed.  That&#39;s what I do: try to inform people.</p>

<p>That might be why you don&#39;t recognize me.  I&#39;m not exactly a verbose member of the community here.  I don&#39;t comment unless I feel a particular need to.  But what I do just as much as any of you is <em>watch</em>.  And boy has the watching been excruciating for the last week.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s get down to it.</p>

<p>I know some of you will already know what I&#39;m talking about, but for the uninitiated, the newcomers, the reactionaries and the uninformed, here&#39;s your wakeup call, in no uncertain terms:</p>

<h2><strong>PodcastGate was a PsyOp.  You are being Manipulated.</strong></h2>

<p>Don&#39;t jump at my throat just yet, I am going to throw enough material in here to put the skeptic back in you.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/31dy9y/the_first_official_rconspiracy_podcast_is_now/">The Original Post</a> went up on April 4th.  It immediately put a bad taste in some user&#39;s mouths.  <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/31dy9y/the_first_official_rconspiracy_podcast_is_now/cq0qolr">Top comment goes to /u/-SPIRITUAL-GANSTER-</a>, who proclaims embarrassment at being associated with this subreddit.  <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/31dy9y/the_first_official_rconspiracy_podcast_is_now/cq0pvv5">The second highest top-level post goes to /u/3rdEyeNavigator</a>, who I will quote here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it&#39;s like this subreddit was actually gaining ground with great TILs, public exposure site wide, and no disruptive stickies or AMA — constant WTC 7 posts and even a post about HW bush that went viral on reddit — then BOOM you guys come in and make a decision that reflects on the whole user base, which coincidentally involves flytape wearing a fucking mask rambling about shit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These posts in and of themselves mean nothing, but it is interesting that the highest-ranked next-level comments for both of these posts are made by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/31dy9y/the_first_official_rconspiracy_podcast_is_now/cq0r7iw?context=1">these same two accounts</a>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/31dy9y/the_first_official_rconspiracy_podcast_is_now/cq0qubl?context=1">replying to each other</a>.  This is not proof of anything, but we&#39;ve still got a ways to go.</p>

<p><a href="/u/3rdEyeNavigator">/u/3rdEyeNavigator</a> takes it upon himself to make <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/31fl7t/psa_for_rconspiracy_last_night_a_controversial/">this post</a>, and PodcastGate is officially off and running.  <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/31fl7t/psa_for_rconspiracy_last_night_a_controversial/cq12pfr">Top comment here goes to /u/9-ll</a>, who reminds users of the Richard Gage AMA monstrosity that rolled through around October of last year.  No mention of the fact that Flytape and the mod team <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2nhd2n/happy_thanksgiving_everyone_we_need_more_mods/cmev4u3">kept transparency and were publicly humiliated</a> when it turned out to be a very sophisticated troll, just this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No matter how amazing he is, some people cannot handle the duty power and control brings....</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Highest child comment here is, understandably, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/31fl7t/psa_for_rconspiracy_last_night_a_controversial/cq17xvn?context=1">/u/3rdEyeNavigator</a>.  The karma train tends to favor OP, nothing sketchy about that.  But to anybody who knows how manipulation works around here, the <em>content</em> of his comment might set off some red flags:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This post was at +9 when I saw it last.</p>

<p>Now it&#39;s at 0?</p>

<p>Vote brigade most likely occuring to get this off the front page:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now I don&#39;t know about you, but the only time I ever believe someone who claims vote brigade is when I <em>see</em> the brigade in action.  78% upvote on a controversial sub like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is <em>not</em> indicative of a brigade.  <a href="/u/9-ll">/u/9-ll</a> and <a href="/u/3rdEyeNavigator">/u/3rdEyeNavigator</a> go on to comment many more times each in this post.</p>

<p>Moving on.  <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/31ig9j/the_unofficial_podcast/">/u/mr_dong tries to run cleanup next</a>.  Flytape is removed.  It goes over well with many respected names in the community.  After all, the podcast <em>was</em> poorly received by most of the long-time commenters around here.  <a href="/u/3rdEyeNavigator">/u/3rdEyeNavigator</a> inserts himself into the discussion, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/31ig9j/the_unofficial_podcast/cq24tjv">without his name even coming up</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you and pals going to apologize for your antics towards me?</p>

<p>All I want is for us as a community is to be united and represented responsibly — that&#39;s why I targeted flytape.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="/u/-SPIRITUAL-GANSTER-">/u/-SPIRITUAL-GANSTER-</a> makes a return as well, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/31ig9j/the_unofficial_podcast/cq25qul">stepping in to defend /u/3rdEyeNavigator&#39;s comment</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Account age is irrelevant when the up votes loudly and clearly show the community agrees.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remember, these are accounts that less than two days before were discussing vote brigading.  Votes go both ways, this isn&#39;t a one-sided street.  A brigade can just as easily upvote as it can downvote.</p>

<p>But I digress, because <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/31ig9j/the_unofficial_podcast/cq24kgo">/u/3rdEyeNavigator isn&#39;t done</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can&#39;t thank you enough for understanding the severity of the situation. I want to reiterate to the community that my approach was transparent and in no way was I ever accusing Flytape of being a shill. He and his friends constantly harassed me rather than addressing the issues everyone else was angry about.</p>

<p>Instead they took it out on me with constant threats in Private messaging, calling me a troll, shill, and a even going as far as saying I&#39;m manipulating all the votes. The worst part was one of the harassers was a moderator here, and he constantly accused me of being a paid government shill while attempting to bait me into a ban.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad the community&#39;s voice was heard and I hope we become more understanding and aware how <strong>important credibility and execution</strong> are when spreading our ideas and that moderators represent the community as a whole.</p>

<p>Flytape was irresponsible and aggressive. That&#39;s why I created the thread <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/31fl7t/psa_for_rconspiracy_last_night_a_controversial/">PSA for /r/Conspiracy: Last night a controversial mod here performed a major disservice to the community as a whole. Luckily my voice was heard and it was quickly removed. You may have missed what happened — check it out and let&#39;s come up with a solution together. [Serious]</a></p>

<p><strong>I did my best to entitle it responsibly but I do apologize for being very aggressive. I took it personally as a subversive act and felt like &quot;civil disobedience&quot; was in order.</strong></p>

<p>Edit: do not become divided and I hope there isn&#39;t any retaliation against me personally. Peace out and happy egg-bunny-zombie Jesus day! Mimosa time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is preening bullshit.  He self-promotes, for fuck&#39;s sake.  And he doesn&#39;t &quot;Peace Out.&quot; He comments another 18 times before the thread is unstickied and drops off the front page, most of which are attempts to defend himself against legitimate questions about his account age and post history levied by longstanding members of the community.</p>

<p>And that brings us to the endgame. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/31scko/flytape_has_officially_been_reinstated_as_a_mod/">Flytape is back on the modteam thanks to a public vote</a>.  Flytape wrote <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/31rh3e/my_apologies_conspiracy_for_the_dreadful_podcast/">an apology</a> for the podcast.</p>

<p>A note: this is a public vote in the <em>vote procedure</em> sense, not the everybody-gets-to-see-it sense.  Each mod got to see each others votes.  It is unnecessary to carry on about this.  We&#39;re not going to get to see how they went about this, they&#39;ve told us all we&#39;re going to hear.  And it&#39;s pointless to the issue at hand.</p>

<p>The main point to take away from this is the last paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, if you have anything to say about it say it here and now. Then we&#39;re going to move on and continue to try to make this sub what it was intended to be... discussions about conspiracies, actual or theoretical, real or imagined and, as always, controversial.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The comments in this sticky should have been the end of it.  Not so.  Aside from some <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/31scko/flytape_has_officially_been_reinstated_as_a_mod/cq4jrjl">very accusatory comments</a> levied at mods, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/31rxqd/wtftil_flytape_has_been_reinstated_as_a_mod_in/">/u/3rdEyeNavigator has continued his crusade in another post</a>.  It&#39;s full of vitriol and reactionism.  There&#39;s not even any text to the post, just a link to Flytape&#39;s post, which Flytape deleted thanks to the shitstorm of hate that came his way.</p>

<p>Three new names come in at this point: <a href="/u/Hatesies">/u/Hatesies</a>, <a href="/u/TheGhostInTheWeb">/u/TheGhostInTheWeb</a> and <a href="/u/DishonestCartooNIST">/u/DishonestCartooNIST</a> (<a href="/u/YouMayBeRight79">/u/YouMayBeRight79</a>, who it seems has actually has been active since the original podcast post, is also suspect).  Go look at their comment histories for the past day or so and you&#39;ll see what I mean.</p>

<p>The reason I point out all these names is simple: <strong>Each of the accounts listed in this post fit a very specific pattern:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Less than Three Months Old, in some cases less than a month</p></li>
<li><p>MAJOR shift in posting pattern, often away from normal posting/agenda posting (see: <a href="/u/DishonestCartooNIST">/u/DishonestCartooNIST</a>, <a href="/u/9-ll">/u/9-ll</a>, both <em>major</em> copypaste 9/11 enthusiasts) to largely/nearly-exclusively Flytape posts.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This could be dismissed as a circlejerk.  I am inclined to think it is deliberate.  The account age is too similar, the crossover between posts and the fact that a lot of these accounts seem to have each others back is too much to be coincidence for me.</p>

<p>But any agenda has to have a <em>why.</em>  And if you&#39;re asking yourself, &quot;But <em>why</em> would this be happening, <em>why</em> would someone/some group be trying to rabble-rouse and stir up a mod witch-hunt?&quot;  To which I provide two true statements:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Subreddits like <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> and <a href="/r/TopMindsOfReddit">/r/TopMindsOfReddit</a> exist.</p></li>
<li><p>We are rapidly approaching 300,000 subscribers.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now, ask yourself again: Why would someone want to divide the subreddit, now of all times?</p>

<p>But don&#39;t take my word for it.  Follow the links I&#39;ve provided.  Look for the patterns I <em>didn&#39;t</em> put here (and there is a <em>lot</em> that I didn&#39;t post).  And remember: at the end of the day, if we are coming here to fight amongst ourselves, the powers that be are winning.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to close by returning to one of <a href="/u/3rdEyeNavigator">/u/3rdEyeNavigator</a>&#39;s posts:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All I want is for us as a community is to be united and represented responsibly — that&#39;s why I targeted flytape.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If unity is what he wants, then causing a massive controversy and polarizing the community is the worst way to go about it, especially at a time as crucial as the leadup to 300k subscribers.</p>

<p>Stay skeptical.  Knee-jerk reaction is what we&#39;re here to fight against.</p>

<p>What do we even debate?  If we are both conspiracy theorist that is...</p>

<p>I&#39;ll do it.  You&#39;ll feel elevated until you realize that I&#39;m not here to carry your 9-11 message.  I&#39;m here to promote an environment where ANY message can be discussed regardless of how psycho it sounds to YOU or ANYONE else.</p>

<p>Can we also discuss why you feel like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is obligated to carry the A&amp;E4911truth banner when there are other perfectly conspiracy relevant 9-11 theories that are welcome to be discussed here?</p>

<p>For example, why should we not allow Judy Woods to do an AMA here?  Our users are perfectly capable of deciding for themselves if Judy Woods and her theories are credible or worthy of further discussion.  But you seem to be vehemently opposed to us doing an AMA with her.   So much so that you&#39;re even actively trying to sabotage other AMAs that we have lined up.  Is sabotage good for the community?</p>

<p>Uh, there was a fake AE911 ama conducted here and then axol attempted to host an unverified JFK Judyth AMA.

<p>I took a break one time (the first time) by my own choice and later decided to come back after the solidwheatstone drama where he was working with conspiratard users to decide how to manage this sub.</p>

<p>I was demodded because of a shadow banning for less than 24 hours until I cleared the issue up with the admins. (That was the 1st time I was demodded)</p>

<p>Then of course there was this recent incident where I was demodded for banning two people who were calling me a Nazi, obviously the majority of the mods agreed with my action there and I was added back.</p>

<p>So to answer your question I was demodded for abuse of power 2/10ths of one time.</p>

<p>The fake Gage AMA was unfortunate and we have learned from that mistake and require much more stringent verification procedures as a result of that mistake.  Axol apologized for that mistake profusely and the community has since moved forward.  </p>

<p>You might not have appreciated the David Cole AMA but a lot of users here did, that AMA had excellent verification and it was an interesting read.  Many people learned something that day, I&#39;m sorry you weren&#39;t one of them.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right that I didn&#39;t have anything to do with the James Corbett AMA, I haven&#39;t had anything to do with setting up any of the AMAs, the only thing I have done is to moderate people&#39;s behavior during those AMAs like I have done in every single one of them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You were involved in a fake AE911Truth AMA - That&#39;s why</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is a pretty poorly thought out reason.  Why are you avoiding saying here, what you&#39;ve said elsewhere?  You think Judy Woods is a crack pot crazy person and you don&#39;t want her message interfering with the A&amp;E4911 message.  And to clarify yet again... I wasn&#39;t involved with the fake Gage AMA.  Repeating a falsehood 100 times a day, doesn&#39;t make it any less false!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With this in mind, I can&#39;t help but recall an interaction with <a href="/u/3rdEyeNavigator">/u/3rdEyeNavigator</a> getting my opinion on the official podcast <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2okqh4/remember_the_time_fake_richard_gage_was_allowed/cmo56cl">here</a> in a 3 month old comment thread he said he found while &#39;researching Flytape.&#39; I also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409185342/http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2okqh4/remember_the_time_fake_richard_gage_was_allowed/cmo56cl">archived it here</a>. (a neat style I have seen over at TopMinds as I lurk there and thing it&#39;s a neat thing to add. Thanks guys!)</p>

<p>This happened 5 days ago, Saturday morning (and he was the user that notified me of it&#39;s existence, as I had a rare night out with some IRL buddies).</p>

<p>In retrospect, now, I feel I was being recruited for something, although I feel I reacted the same way I would have anyway. Despite my responses in the podcast threads, I have repeatedly asked the mods for clarification as to why <a href="/u/Flytape">/u/Flytape</a> was reinstated without the community&#39;s approval, since that&#39;s what we did a few months ago when we had mod openings/needs (which you linked above).</p>

<p>And since then, I have received PM&#39;s from at least two mods expressing their disapproval, which promptly have devolved into insults. </p>

<p><del>And this morning, I reported a post for Rule 6 six hours ago <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/31zlky/this_does_not_add_up_time_to_ask_some_hard/">it&#39;s still right here</a> and finally got a response, but it was <a href="/u/SovereignMan">/u/SovereignMan</a> deleting <strong>my comment</strong> for a Rule 2 violation, yet the post remains (I made the comment and reported the post at the same time as a fun experiment).</del> Thanks, buddy.</p>

<p>Looks like my point of view through the reddit is fun app didn&#39;t register the delete when another mod deleted the post, although I was certain I did a log off/log on to confirm before posting.</p>

<p>So, by just expressing my disapproval at <a href="/u/Flytape">/u/Flytape</a>&#39;s reinstatement <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/31rh3e/my_apologies_conspiracy_for_the_dreadful_podcast/cq4azb3">here</a>, and when you consider my main concern when <a href="/u/mr_dong">/u/mr_dong</a> posted a thread this weekend initially informing the community of his disapproval of the podcast and <a href="/u/Flytape">/u/Flytape</a>&#39;s quick bans was whether <a href="/u/WideAwakeNWO/u/George_Tenet">/u/WideAwakeNWO/u/George_Tenet</a> were reinstated <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/31ig9j/the_unofficial_podcast/cq1uvyp">here</a> in the now deleted post still found <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/31ig9j/the_unofficial_podcast/">here</a>, I received that kind of response from the mods (the PMs). When I didn&#39;t say anything critical about any user, just expressed my disappointment in the lack of community engagement. Nothing more.</p>

<p>So, I guess this is the part where I take my toys and go home, but am torn because that&#39;s exactly what I think is what I&#39;m supposed to do, and I&#39;ve tried to buck trends and zig when I&#39;m told to zag on this website. Let&#39;s see what happens. If anything, <a href="/u/shark_shank">/u/shark_shank</a> and I created <a href="/r/C_S_T">/r/C_S_T</a> for now, which is growing daily and I&#39;ve had a lot of fun with. Thanks to <a href="/u/Flytape">/u/Flytape</a> for the shout out in the aforementioned Official Podcast (1:41:00 for those interested) as well. </p>

<p>Good post, OP.</p>

<p>That&#39;s absolutely not true. In fact another mod removed that post <strong>before</strong> I added the comment that it was removed and also before removing your Rule 2 violation. </p>

<p>I have no problem with you commenting on the fact that it took 6 hours to remove but at least keep to the truth about what happened afterwards.</p>

<p>I did check before adding this comment and logged in and out and thought it was still up (an hour or so ago - 4PM EST).

<p>I too picked up on that sense of commonality between <em>some</em> of accounts. The general vibe is that they&#39;re an organized effort with the same agenda: causing shit between the moderators. Causing a rift &amp; distrust among the mods is an old trick. Divide &amp; conquer. </p>

<p>They&#39;ve been tying to make a mountain out of a molehill with this whole podcast thing dressing it up as &quot;racist, unfair, unreasonable etc <a href="/u/flytape">/u/flytape</a> is bringing this sub into disrepute.&quot; It&#39;s total BS.

    <div class="md"><p>Good job <a href="/u/ReturnOfMorelaak">/u/ReturnOfMorelaak</a></p>

<p>I actually watched the podcast. I thought it was half decent but should have been shorter (I made it to two hours). I usually don&#39;t bother paying attention to the meta stuff around here but <a href="/u/Flytape">/u/Flytape</a> had some good points regarding the mod clique and their tactics. </p>

<p>In no way did I get the impression he is anything like the drama queens around here suggest. Him wearing a mask didn&#39;t bother me at all personally.</p>

<p>Makes me wonder about shill tactics. Just a thought - So they know other then vote brigading this is a hard place to crack. People are pretty keen around here in spotting these types. </p>

<p>I&#39;m wondering about guys who spend a lot of time with personal type comments to gain friendships and trust. Then they wait for an opportune time to attack. </p>

<p>I also wonder about users who have built a good reputation being offered payola for their accounts?. I can recall <a href="/u/Greg_Roberts_0985">/u/Greg_Roberts_0985</a> suggesting <a href="/u/3rdEyeNavigator">/u/3rdEyeNavigator</a> was offering him bitcoin (wish he would have screencapped it as proof) in one of the drama threads. </p>

<p>Either or, the whole debacle was way overblown beyond any sensible reasoning. That&#39;s my thoughts.</p>

<p>Why is it pointless? I know they don&#39;t <em>have</em> to show us anything but it would certainly be a sign of good faith to the community that the mod team is committed to transparency and fairness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s end all this bullshit. </p>

<p>Sign me up for a video podcast debate with Flytape</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>No Masks</strong> </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Community Chooses the topics</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Real names</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p>These false accusations are getting out of hand and distracting from Flytape&#39;s terrible moderating history and abuse.  The guy is a derogatory meme on reddit now because of his irresponsible performance in the podcast + banning the dissenters.</p>

<p>I have nothing to hide.  Let&#39;s do it mods.</p>

<p>edit: Flytape will not accept the terms, so</p>

<p>How about this, you can wear your mask, disguise your background and smoke your vape -- and I will still agree to the podcast.</p>

<p>as you said</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I will gladly debate you with my mask on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There won&#39;t be another official conspiracy podcast if that&#39;s what you&#39;re going for.  There is no way to fairly and officially represent such a diverse group of people.</p>

<p>But we could easily do some Google hangout chat where you and I debate live and invite people to witness/comment on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am positive that the <a href="/u/TheGhostInTheWeb">/u/TheGhostInTheWeb</a> account was brought in to counter your defence of the podcast in the original threads. I saw you defending the podcast and then later thought you had done a complete 180, until I tracked down the user names.</p>

<p>Interesting!</p>
