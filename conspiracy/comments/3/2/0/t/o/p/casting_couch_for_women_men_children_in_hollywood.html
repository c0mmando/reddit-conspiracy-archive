       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roW238dfUUk&amp;t=1m05s">
        In this video Corey Feldman says pedophilia is the biggest problem in Hollywood
       </a>
       , and agrees with the journalist, when he mentions "
       <em>
        casting couch also applies to children
       </em>
       " (at 1:05 and 1:15). Actually the whole video is quite disturbing.

       3.) According to
       <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2011/12/14/are-hollywood-stars-enabling-sexual-predators-by-not-naming-names/">
        this article

       , Megan Fox, Charlize Theron, Gwyneth Paltrow, Olivia Munn, Lisa Rinna have all confessed to being targets of producers / directors looking for sexual favors.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is stated revealing names could very well = a career suicide. Excerpt from the article :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <em>
         “Other [actors] don’t want to be labeled a ‘snitch’ or feel nobody will believe them because it is such a cliché. Sadly, the cliché does perpetuate, probably because the creative process in and of itself can be a seductive process, and the temptation is non-stop in Hollywood.”
        </em>
        <br/>
        <em>
         Hollywood-based career strategist Suzannah Galland said she hears many horror stories from friends who are top actresses. These victims don’t name names “out of fear,” but she says code of silence can turn tragic.
        </em>
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       4.) If you still have doubts about abuse in Hollywood,

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Questions :
       <br/>
       Given the allegations coming from adult actors, can we suppose there are child / teenage actresses who have NOT been abused in Hollywood? Are male adult actors also abused?

       If we are to believe what whisperers and other self-proclaimed "Insiders" have told us, many of our biggest Hollywood stars for decades got their start as elite prostitutes, both male and female. Steve McQueen, James Dean, Rock Hudson, Keanu Reeves, Michelle Pfeiffer, Anne Hathaway, Thomas Jane, and so on. Many young starlets make easy money for sex, and B- and C- level starlets -- like Brittany Murphy, for example -- become playthings for Russian oligarchs or Middle East oil royalty for hefty sums that are not even a pittance for a multi-billionaire.

       What do you think Selena Gomez, Kendell Jenner and their posse were up to in Abu Dhabi and elsewhere a couple months ago?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sex and Satanism drive Hollywood. Keep an eye on Jared Leto; his actions, appearance and behavior in the past couple years has me  hypothesizing he's one of the top practitioners of Black Magick in Hollywood.

       Early on in his career, I really liked him. Requiem &amp; fight club were fantastic. He has been looking like a total creep lately; he likes to emulate Jesus, then he goes for the drag/ adragenous look. It wouldn't suprise me of he was a handler/ occultist. Look at his Instagram, I feel like he's a try-hard to look "unique".

       A fair comment.  In short, and not nearly as informative as I would like, but at least a taste that you can chase.
      </p>
      <p>
       As it relates to Leto: The home he purchased sits atop Laurel Canyon. It used to be a top secret military facility where they made all sorts of films for the government. It is documented that many movie stars shot classified films for the government there -- Marilyn Monroe, Henry Fonda, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       During this same period, Laurel Canyon became home to a large number of rock and movie stars, many of whom were involved in all kinds of shady occult shit, including rolling with Charles Manson and some pretty nasty drug dealers and satanists.
      </p>
      <p>
       The McGowan book is  almost impossible to put down, and roughly 2/3 of it has been aggregated from his website, where it was being gradually written before he sold the idea to a publisher. But here's the rough draft and there's lots of good stuff here.

       I truly have no idea what Jared Leto is genuinely up to, but everything he does -- from his "look," to his movie roles, to the choice he's made of a new home -- screams dark occultist.

       It all makes sense inside the twisted Hollywood world, particularly following the trend of transforming fresh-faced Disney stars into sluts.  Remember that Hathaway was once the star of "The Princess Diaries," then other family fare like "Ella Enchanted," "Nicholas Nickleby," "Princess Diaries 2," "The Cat Returns," etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       She disappears from the screen for a year, and when she returns she's  doing nude scenes and being a plaything for Latino gang-bangers in "Havoc," helping bring empathy to the lives of gay cowboys in "Brokeback Mountain" (with another nude scene), playing Red Riding Hood in "Hoodwinked" (hello Freemasons!), and being an underling for "The Devil Wears Prada." During this period, she also has her vagina photographed when getting out a car w/out panties. Take all that as you will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody can deny that her perf in "Les Miserables" is magnificent. The question becomes though, how much of the pain of her real life is she channeling into that anguish?

       Yup. The music industry is insanely corrupt too; I was just reading about how many artists are under extortion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Entertainment is a seedy business because it's all based on image and sex appeal. The system can make any above-average looking 18 year old famous. You get given stylists, image consultants, doctored photo shoots, and the hottest new clothes so you look more attractive. You get auto tune, song writers, and well paid producers so you sound more talented. Then you get an army of publicists, advertising experts, and media connections to make you seem more popular than you really are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously these stars are beholden to others behind the scenes; they are usually no more than a replaceable face. This line of work takes advantage of artists, sells sex appeal to young kids, and promotes an unrealistic/unobtainable lifestyle to the public all to make a quick buck. It's fake.

       It's quite simple to make these people lose power.  We simply boycott all forms of widespread entertainment from hollywood.  Give it 3 months tops before the entire thing crumbles (including the news agencys).

       If you are really interested in openining the first layer of the onion, hit up "crazy days and nights" blog, specifically the "blind items".  99% of the time, the blind reveals end up coming true in one form or another (I suppose depending on the level of protection the celebrity has).
      </p>
      <p>
       Celebrities are court jesters, so it would make sense that abuse is a pretty common theme for maintaining control.  A mind that is free isn't easily controlled, so behaviour patterns are installed at an early age in order to predetermine their destiny and shape their future.  Anyone that deviates off course can easily be set-up in a tragic death which relinquishes control to "shareholder".  Randy Q..uade actually speaks in painful detail about this process and provides on screen proof, but the media operates in tandem with the whole agenda.

       Would you provide a couple links, please? I've watched two of his videos, but didn't see anything like what you're describing. I can't tell if Quaid's crazy and sincere or crazy like a double-crossing controlled opposition fox, but even if he's the latter there is no doubt some truth sprinkled in.

       A fair comment.  In short, and not nearly as informative as I would like, but at least a taste that you can chase.

       As it relates to Leto: The home he purchased sits atop Laurel Canyon. It used to be a top secret military facility where they made all sorts of films for the government. It is documented that many movie stars shot classified films for the government there -- Marilyn Monroe, Henry Fonda, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       During this same period, Laurel Canyon became home to a large number of rock and movie stars, many of whom were involved in all kinds of shady occult shit, including rolling with Charles Manson and some pretty nasty drug dealers and satanists.

       The McGowan book is  almost impossible to put down, and roughly 2/3 of it has been aggregated from his website, where it was being gradually written before he sold the idea to a publisher. But here's the rough draft and there's lots of good stuff here.
