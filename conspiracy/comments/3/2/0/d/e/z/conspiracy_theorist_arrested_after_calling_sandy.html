        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://www.infowars.com/conspiracy-theorist-arrested-after-calling-sandy-hook-shooting-fake/">Source</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A conspiracy theorist was arrested and ordered to undergo a mental health evaluation after he called several schools in Newtown to claim that the 2012 Sandy Hook shootings were “fake”.</p>

<p>30-year-old Timothy Rogalski called the Sandy Hook Elementary School on Tuesday morning and left four messages on the school’s answering machine before speaking to an administrative assistant. </p>

<p>Using his father’s name, Rogalski said he wanted to enroll a child in the school but wanted to make sure no more “fake” shootings would occur.</p>

<p>After calling two other schools in Newtown, police traced the number back to Rogalski and arrested him at his home.</p>

<p>While Rogalski’s behavior was idiotic and his remarks will undoubtedly be offensive to many, the claim that the phone calls were “threatening” in nature is up for debate.</p>

<p>“I just wanted to make sure that there was going to be no fake shooting on the day that I enrolled him,” court records showed Rogalski said. “I just wanted to clarify that he wouldn’t get shot by a fake Adam Lanza.”</p>

<p>Rogalski subsequently gave his name as Dawn Hochsprung, the name of the deceased principal, before accusing the school of greed for taking charitable donations.</p>

<p>Rogalski apologized for his comments, but asserted that he never intended to threaten anyone.</p>

<p>“I know I may have offended people, but they were words, and I made no threats. I wasn’t going to do anything,” Rogalski said.</p>

<p>Rogalski is being held on a $50,000 bond and will undergo a psychological screening. He has been charged with harassment and will appear in court again on April 22.</p>

<p>There have been numerous instances of Americans being arrested and forced to undergo psychological testing for controversial political beliefs in recent years.</p>

<p>The most noteworthy example occurred in 2012 when former Iraq and Afghanistan veteran <a href="http://www.infowars.com/marine-kidnapped-over-facebook-posts-i-am-scared-for-my-country/">Brandon Raub was kidnapped from his home</a> by police, FBI and Secret Service agents and forcibly incarcerated in a psychiatric ward by authorities in Virginia in response to Facebook posts which the FBI deemed “terrorist” in nature. </p>

<p>Raub’s posts questioned the official story behind 9/11 and referred to corruption within the U.S. government and the Federal Reserve. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A documentary I watched, Sandy Hoax I think, said Sandy Hook was a CIA town. What is this guy doing in this town? He could be an actor for all we know to discredit questioning Sandy Hook. The important thing is we are talking about this. Makes me think a lot about the book &quot;Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television&quot; and how TV is a medium that cannot be reformed. Movies are a different thing according to the author, Jerry Mander, but suffer from some of the same pitfalls for being so distant from reality.</p>

<p>The Naval Recconaisance Office was running drills on planes being hijacked and flown into buildings on the East coast on the day of 9/11, confusing NORAD operators and preventing jet intercept teams from responding effectively.</p>

<p>Yes, it does.  They are currently in a school building in Monroe, CT that wasn&#39;t being used, and has been temporarily renamed Sandy Hook Elementary.  The original SHES building was demolished, and they are rebuilding another on that same site, which is scheduled to be open for the 2016-2017 school year.  Until it is, SHES is in Monroe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that his executive orders weren&#39;t earth shattering but I don&#39;t think the administration could fully capitalize from the crisis because too many people started realizing what was going on. </p>

<p>Sandy Hook has made a big difference in the way schools handle security. I teach in a public school and since Sandy Hook, security has been stepped up significantly in our nations schools. It&#39;s fucking annoying how obsessed they are with making sure kids are always wearing their IDs or which doors they are coming in and out of to prevent another &quot;Sandy Hook.&quot; Just more fear programming in the school system. </p>

<p>I know it sounds strange to some to suggest that these were crisis actors and that no one died but when you start looking into it, stuff gets very weird. Just my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fear programming or logical? Nothing REALLY changed. Why would the government go on - read hundreds of people onto a top secret program - and have them conduct one of the most gruesome massacres in US history, just for the sake of ID cards? Why would they foul it up with &quot;Crisis actors&quot; and all this bullshit. Why not just have one terrorist do it? Those kids were real. The parents real. The deaths real. Stop it. Stop the madness. Go talk to the parents. It&#39;s tragic. Kids died. Those parents exist. They can be reached. Go ask them for yourself. The Sandy Hook conspiracy has been debunked. It&#39;s tragic.</p>

<p>Do you really think Obama, or the US government is filled with these type of people - that would want to, and get away with massacring the children of their own country, in an affluent neighborhood none the less? You need to think of the logistics of doing stuff like this? </p>

<p>Nobody &quot;saw through it&quot;. Maybe less than 1% of the population think there was some sort of &#39;inside&#39; job to sandy hook. Do you live in some remote area or have some sort of paranoia issue? </p>

<p>Do you have any knowledge of that which you&#39;re making repeated incorrect references to?  It&#39;s more than one state, for example: New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act.</p>

<p>&quot;The New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act of 2013 commonly known as the NY SAFE Act is a gun control law in the state of New York. The law passed without a required debate period by the New York State Legislature on January 15, 2013, in the middle of the night under a &quot;message of necessity&quot;, and was signed into law by Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo on the same day.&quot;</p>

<p>Can you conduct like, I don&#39;t know, maybe 5 minutes of research so you don&#39;t look like a <em>complete</em> shill please?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see any kind of over-arching gun control or taking away of gun rights/changing 2nd amendment. Nothing like the kind of thing you would do if you just did a psy-op specifically to murder a bunch of children.</p>

<p>Surely, if you were going to go to the trouble of murdering children, or the far, far more difficult prospect of inventing them, their family and friends, etc. Surely you&#39;d bother to see if that was the kind of thing that would get important gun control legislation passed?</p>

<p>Seems like a weird thing to risk exposing yourself and all psy-ops ever just to pass some pretty minor gun laws that you could probably pass with actual political maneuvering if you felt like that.</p>

<p>The motive isn&#39;t substantial enough to justify this. It&#39;s not a terrorist attack - the US has largely said &quot;we don&#39;t care about school shootings and we&#39;re pretty much going to do nothing about them&quot; every time they&#39;ve happened before and since.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The truth makes you sick?  I&#39;m sorry. That sounds difficult.  Educate yourself.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxTafqejV6k">The Sandy Hook event is so suspicious in so many ways it&#39;s ridiculous to believe the mainstream narrative.</a></p>

<p>Downvotes for providing information?  Just trying to help people educate themselves.  Before getting mad and downvoting, try watching the doc first.  If you&#39;re so convinced that you&#39;re right and I&#39;m crazy, the doc must be really easy to dismiss after all. What&#39;s the harm in looking at some information?</p>

<p>Edit: there&#39;s a bot brigade operating on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> right now because of all the false flags being exposed.  Worse than I&#39;ve ever seen it. There&#39;s no way this comment would be negative on any normal day.  Keep posting info on false flags, ignore downvotes, repost downvoted comments and posts if they are informative and accurate.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not going to find photos of bodies and videos of blood splattered all over the place because most people think it would be insensitive and grotesque to show photos from a child massacre.  But here you go, indulge yourself.</p>

<p>I think the shill game is so crazy here right now because people have been posting a lot of really good information about false flag terror events.  The shill reaction is an indication that we are having an effect though so that&#39;s encouraging.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;they&quot;? The police officers that were certified paramedics attended to the victims, because the scene was not declared secure. As is standard procedure literally everywhere in the country: EMTs are not allowed in unsecured scenes. Ever. Anywhere. Again, your cult leader is a phony. You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that his executive orders weren&#39;t earth shattering but I don&#39;t think the administration could fully capitalize from the crisis because too many people started realizing what was going on. </p>

<p>Sandy Hook has made a big difference in the way schools handle security. I teach in a public school and since Sandy Hook, security has been stepped up significantly in our nations schools. It&#39;s fucking annoying how obsessed they are with making sure kids are always wearing their IDs or which doors they are coming in and out of to prevent another &quot;Sandy Hook.&quot; Just more fear programming in the school system. </p>

<p>I know it sounds strange to some to suggest that these were crisis actors and that no one died but when you start looking into it, stuff gets very weird. Just my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fear programming or logical? Nothing REALLY changed. Why would the government go on - read hundreds of people onto a top secret program - and have them conduct one of the most gruesome massacres in US history, just for the sake of ID cards? Why would they foul it up with &quot;Crisis actors&quot; and all this bullshit. Why not just have one terrorist do it? Those kids were real. The parents real. The deaths real. Stop it. Stop the madness. Go talk to the parents. It&#39;s tragic. Kids died. Those parents exist. They can be reached. Go ask them for yourself. The Sandy Hook conspiracy has been debunked. It&#39;s tragic.</p>
