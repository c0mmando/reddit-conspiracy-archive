       Celiac disease is a complex and multifactorial condition associated with gluten intolerance and a higher risk to thyroid disease, cancer and kidney disease, and there is also an increased risk to infertility and birth defects in children born to celiac mothers. While the principal diagnostic is autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase, celiac disease is associated with a spectrum of other pathologies such as deficiencies in iron, vitamin D3, molybdenum, selenium, and cobalamin, an overgrowth of pathogens in the gut at the expense of beneficial biota, impaired serotonin signaling, and increased synthesis of toxic metabolites like p-Cresol and indole-3-acetic acid.
       <strong>
        In this paper, we have systematically shown how all of these features of celiac disease can be explained by glyphosate's known properties.
       </strong>
       These include (1) disrupting the shikimate pathway, (2) altering the balance between pathogens and beneficial biota in the gut, (3) chelating transition metals, as well as sulfur and selenium, and (4) inhibiting cytochrome P450 enzymes. We argue that a key system-wide pathology in celiac disease is impaired sulfate supply to the tissues, and that this is also a key component of glyphosate's toxicity to humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       The monitoring of glyphosate levels in food and in human urine and blood has been inadequate.

       <a href="http://www.ithaka-journal.net/herbizide-im-urin?lang=en">
        http://www.ithaka-journal.net/herbizide-im-urin?lang=en
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “Spraying crops to death”, as desiccation should be more aptly called, means that herbicides are being sprayed directly on the crops shortly before they are to be harvested to facilitate the harvest by uniformly killing off all living plants (including the crops) on the field. If crops can not fully mature due to excessive rain, as was the case in the summer of 2011, herbicides are used to bring the crops to maturity by means of a “death-spray”. The method facilitates the drying of the crops as well as removing all weeds for the next sowing period, and has become common for the harvest of potatoes, cereals, canola and pulses. For potatoes, spraying herbicides on the field immediately before harvest (2.5 l / ha), hardens the skin and reduces its susceptibility to late blight and germination, which improved the potatoes shelf life. Active compounds of the herbicide directly enter the potato through the leaves; however, decomposition of the poison takes place in the body of the consumer.

       I have trouble with wheat. When I eat it I get symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis - pain in my joints and long bones so bad it feels like someone's taken a nutcracker to them. I get ataxia and slurring of my speech, and migraines. It comes on within an hour of eating anything with wheat from certain countries, even in very small amounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can eat wheat grown in Italy without a problem, though. Wheat grown in Canada, the US, or Germany will have me aching and suffering within an hour of exposure. Wheat grown in Argentina, Italy or Kenya won't. (Note: these are the only countries I've had opportunity to test this on.) I don't know what those guys are doing different from over here, but the results for me are marked. I used to think I was celiac. Now I suspect it's either a genetically modified variant I'm sensitive to or a routine farm practice. I only react to wheat, not barley or rye. I've started to wonder if it's the roundup but I can have corn without a noticeable problem (yes, I know, corn is the devil but it tastes so good).

       I hear you on the neurological stuff. The slurring and ataxia is scary as hells. Here's the thing, if you're an actual celiac you shouldn't be eating wheat or any other gluten grain, whether it's grown in Italy or elsewhere. And honestly, humans shouldn't be making wheat a staple part of our diet, period. But if you're not a celiac, then if you
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       choose to eat wheat, choose a less harmful source like Italy for it, and eat it sparingly. I can only get Italian flour in 1 kilo (2.2 lb) bags, which isn't enough to go around on a bread spree, but enough for a couple of pie shells or a batch of buns or other special small batch food. The fact that I have to go a considerable distance out of my way and it costs a lot more than local and I can only buy small amounts means that I use it very very sparingly for special occasions. That acts as a kind of built in limiting factor in my intake.  Additionally, I have to make whatever I'm eating
       <em>
        from scratch
       </em>
       which means that I have to invest the time and effort into making it, which further limits my intake :D. I love to cook and I'm damn good at it, but I don't always want to take the
       <em>
        time
       </em>
       to make a from-scratch pie or yeast bread. But when I do, it's delightful.

       The scariest thing for me was waking up one day and my vision was tilted like 45* for no reason.  Doctors couldn't figure it out, they thought i had a stroke.  Woke up a few days later back to normal.

       I never eat anything with gluten these days and go as far as not eating anything unless it's got the GF symbol on it.  I agree about wheat (and grains in general)...they're fine occasionally but not 3 squares a day.  I love cooking but i'm generally lazy and eating low carb is easy...meat and cheese lol

       Have you tried focusing on durum wheat solely?  Durum is tetraploid not hexaploid like the majority of american wheat.  I bet Italy is still using durum in the majority...

      <p>
       Hexaploid has more antigenicity and so more allergens...

       This is a good point. I've considered picking up some spelt, emmer, or einkorn grown here, especially if I can get some organic stuff, and see if there's a reaction. I'll have to see if there's a difference between durum and semolina too. Usually it's hard to find something that
       <em>
        specifies
       </em>
       this degree of granularity, though. Usually it just says 'flour' (might not even specify
       <em>
        wheat
       </em>
       flour), and the country of origin.

       This is extremely interesting, because I also get migraines and RA symptoms from eating wheat (with atypical digestion problems). Since I moved to a country where US wheat is not typically used, sometimes I can have wheat without much problem. Other times (anything processed or from the US) I get pretty sick. It never occurred to me until your comment to think about where the wheat came from.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you find out where your wheat came from? I don't think it's labeled here.

       In my country, the labeling laws require the country of origin to be published on the label of the product. It's not a 100% foolproof method since a manufacturer can import stuff to make something from and then export it to my country. But it's fairly reliable. In the case of places like Italy where they take pride in growing their own wheat for Italian export products, it's fairly safe. Germany was iffy I suspect because they import a lot of their wheat from Canada and the US. Same with China and Asia, most of those countries import from Canada and the US. Costa Rica gets all of its wheat from its neighbour Argentina, and Kenya produces its own and takes pride in this fact. I haven't had the opportunity to try others - I'm wondering how I'd react to Russian or Ukranian wheat for instance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course the best thing is to not eat wheat or grains at all, but there's a lot of specialty recipes and treats that are tastier and have the 'right' texture and baking/cooking properties with real wheat. I'm wheat-free most of the time, but I'll have treats made from import products on special occasions.

       You could stop eating wheat. The ketogenic diet has a ton of evidence in its favor, including boosting GABA levels in the brain. It is entirely unnecessary to consume wheat.

       Wait a minute here, I work on a farm and we legally have to wait 30 days from the last time round up is used and the day we harvest, we don't even apply the round up to the fruit we harvest, we apply it directly to just the weeds we want to kill.  If we were applying it directly onto the crop ( which we would never do because it would kill our crop) we would have to legally wait 45 days before harvest.

       I don't know where your farm is or what you are growing, but this PDF from Monsanto contradicts your claims:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <a href="http://roundup.ca/_uploads/documents/MON-Preharvest%20Staging%20Guide.pdf">
         Roundup - Preharvest Staging Guide
        </a>
       </strong>
       (PDF)
      </p>
      <p>
       Chances are, you eat Roundup (or generic) every single day.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Roundup is NOT just glyphosate, but includes a cocktail of chemicals (wetting agents, surfactants, emulsifiers, etc) that are added to improve the efficacy of glyphosate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the tests on the "safety" of glyphosate DO NOT include these added (so-called inactive) ingredients. Furthermore, most of these tests only measure glyphosate's ACUTE (short term exposure) toxicity, when in the real world we are exposed, LONG TERM, to low doses on a daily basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the significance between acute and chronic exposure?
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of it this way: Smoking a single cigarette will likely NOT give one cancer. Smoking a pack per day for several months will likely NOT give one cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       The damage from smoking largely comes from years of chronic, long term, low dose exposure.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you can't trust Monsanto for your health, who CAN you trust, right?

       As someone who does suffer from an IBD, why doesn't everyone else also have a similar disease if it's caused by something as ubiquitous as glyphosate?  I could say the same for asthma and other endocrine disorders.  Why do only some people become so sick if these chemicals are the direct cause?

       Genetics. Maybe you happen to be very sensitive and others aren't. Or, you notice it while others don't, or you happen to be eating a specific brand of pasta or whatever that sources their wheat from an idiot farmer who desiccates. There's lots of possibilities.

       If glyphosate is prevalent in produce from crops that are not sprayed as I have read, then I would think it would be unavoidable.  I believe that it's carcinogenic and teratogenic, but the widespread incidence of endocrine disorders has to have a more complicated explanation than a single responsible chemical, even if it's a slurry of responsible chemicals.  And if I can't avoid it, then how am I supposed to treat the condition that it has caused?

       A different credible theory about some cases of celiac disease is that it is related to exposure to genetically engineered enzymes (transglutaminases) used in food processing.  For example:

       I hear you on the neurological stuff. The slurring and ataxia is scary as hells. Here's the thing, if you're an actual celiac you shouldn't be eating wheat or any other gluten grain, whether it's grown in Italy or elsewhere. And honestly, humans shouldn't be making wheat a staple part of our diet, period. But if you're not a celiac, then if you
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       choose to eat wheat, choose a less harmful source like Italy for it, and eat it sparingly. I can only get Italian flour in 1 kilo (2.2 lb) bags, which isn't enough to go around on a bread spree, but enough for a couple of pie shells or a batch of buns or other special small batch food. The fact that I have to go a considerable distance out of my way and it costs a lot more than local and I can only buy small amounts means that I use it very very sparingly for special occasions. That acts as a kind of built in limiting factor in my intake.  Additionally, I have to make whatever I'm eating
       <em>
        from scratch
       </em>
       which means that I have to invest the time and effort into making it, which further limits my intake :D. I love to cook and I'm damn good at it, but I don't always want to take the
       <em>
        time
       </em>
       to make a from-scratch pie or yeast bread. But when I do, it's delightful.

       This is a good point. I've considered picking up some spelt, emmer, or einkorn grown here, especially if I can get some organic stuff, and see if there's a reaction. I'll have to see if there's a difference between durum and semolina too. Usually it's hard to find something that
       <em>
        specifies
       </em>
       this degree of granularity, though. Usually it just says 'flour' (might not even specify
       <em>
        wheat
       </em>
       flour), and the country of origin.
