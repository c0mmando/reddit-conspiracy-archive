        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">47</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2015-04-10 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/George_Tenet.html">George_Tenet</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For a supposed enemy of state, Snowden has received a strange amount of mainstream media coverage. Russel Tice, William Binney, Thomas Drake, Mark Klein, and others all blew the whistle well before Snowden (and in some cases released even more damning information than him), yet no one knows who they are. Check out <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2014/06/original-nsa-whistleblower-snowden-never-access-juicy-documents.html">this</a> interview with Russel Tice where he explains how he had access to systems that Snowden did not and admits to working in a &#39;black ops&#39; surveillance program way above what Snowden was doing. He also astutely points out that, at the highest levels, they don&#39;t make freakin&#39; power points about their plans to oppress people. Those go on record, could be leaked any time, etc. </p>

<p>Furthermore, William Binney worked for the NSA for thirty-six years and blew the whistle back in <em>2001</em>.  Binney said back then that the surveillance system is “better than anything that the KGB, the Stasi, or the Gestapo and SS ever had” and that the US government was &quot;just waiting to turn the key&quot; from democracy to fascism. Snowden&#39;s leaks revealed nothing that hadn&#39;t been known for a decade....</p>

<p>When you are a legitimate dissident you don&#39;t get heavily publicized by the media and star in movies like CitizenFour, guys. You are harassed (Binney and others have been raided by the FBI) and forced from public view. </p>

<p>Finally, if Snowden had access to all those documents did he really never come across any thing about false flag terror? Government drug dealing? 9/11? Or even more basic things, like why we really invaded Iraq, opium production in Afghanistan, or what&#39;s going on in Ukraine, etc? </p>

    <div class="md"><ul>
<li><p>the intended psy-op target audience for Snowden may in fact be intelligence community whistleblowers more than the general public;</p></li>
<li><p>Sibel Edmonds, herself a mixed bag &amp; a whistleblower, has attacked Snowden and Greenwald while standing by Tice, Binney &amp; Drake despite Drake presenting Snowden with an award.</p></li>
<li><p>We are continuing to overlook the multiple options:  As early as 1962, the CIA categorized &quot;collaborators&quot; as &quot;witting, unwitting, or partially-witting.&quot;  Even if Snowden (or Assange, or Obama for that matter) believe they are a double-agent, they may still be having an operation run upon themselves that inevitably leads to Oswald or Atta status.  Framing collaborators with posthumous evidence that they were &quot;working for Russia&quot; or &quot;secret Muslims&quot; or &quot;secret Cuban agents&quot; can be an integral part of a multi-purpose operation.  For Oswald, his &quot;secret Soviet operation&quot; status (alleged) hung the threat of WW3 over the heads of the Warren Commission.</p></li>
<li><p>We are also overlooking (and hence, the psy-op is successful, it seems) that the parameters of the &quot;secret operations revealed&quot; is excluding bigger secret operations NOT revealed by Snowden.  Snowden is regarded as &quot;having the keys to the Kingdom&quot; and therefore all speculation outside of Snowden&#39;s &quot;revelations&quot; is considered fringe.  From what we know about CIA coups, however, the next step is easy and obvious:  The Phoenix Program, a.k.a. Operation Condor, the well-practiced operation of identifying &amp; assassinating social leaders <em>en masse</em> -- Operation Condor resulted in up to 50,000 killed; 30,000 &quot;disappeared&quot;; and 400,000 arrested and imprisoned.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, Snowden&#39;s &quot;revealed secrets&quot; reflect nothing of such a program.  Binney says that &quot;every American has an NSA file&quot; which is what Operation Condor&#39;s planners could only dream of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a good point. However, those guys are out of government and thus don&#39;t have any more insight into whether or not Snowden is a limited hang out than we do. Furthermore I&#39;m not saying (this is a repost of a comment I made in a different thread btw) that Snowden&#39;s info is wrong in any way. Just that it overall has served to increase the federal government&#39;s power while getting no one in trouble. </p>

<li><p>the whole fleeing ordeal. Hong Kong. flys to South America but forced to stop and eventually stay in Russia ( &#39;America&#39;s biggest enemy&#39; ). This alone is like an intriguing spy story. Also a david vs Goliath aspect. Media jackpot. </p></li>
<li><p>He&#39;s quite young and very well spoken.</p></li>
<li><p>I think he portrays the feeling that Americans needed to know better than any others. </p></li>

<p>Also, maybe he knows the truth about 9/11 but he&#39;s trying to stay neutral. Focus on the problems at hand for now. Mention 9/11 and bam. lost credibility. You know the people...they refuse to believe it even when presented with cold hard facts. </p>

<p>the NSA would deny that and portray his as a loon. They cant deny the documents he has though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your first point - Snowden has been very smart about gradually releasing the information. However, points 2-4 don&#39;t do anything to dispel the notion that he&#39;s a limited hang out. Making it dramatic and newsworthy, choosing someone who&#39;s well spoken, etc. are exactly what you would do if you were organizing a limited hangout IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then what is the limited hangout keeping concealed? 9/11? Like....he found all this secret stuff but nothing on conspiracy X so therefore the official story is true?</p>

<p>Idk about that...they were spying on citizens and foreigners not themselves. Why would he find that kind of info? Also the people behind these conspiracies are people that would know about the spying programs. They would know how it worked and how to avoid it. They probably even have clearance to go into NSA and erase any incriminating evidence well before Snowden days. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are multiple factions within the government. Some of them are working to out the criminal faction that has taken over. The CFAA act and recent executive order are about giving the executive more power to protect the criminals in government from prosecution and sweep the leaks under the rug.</p>

<p>Snowden is just the first. There will need to be twenty more Swowdens before the public has the full scope.</p>

<p>Snowden has wide support from the public, but the media is controlled and they do the best they can to destroy him. Snowden revealed the source of their power and until that power is removed, the next step cannot be taken. People cannot organize without being infiltrated and monitored by the criminals.</p>

<p>This will be a very long process.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what I think about all this snowden stuff for a while now : </p>

<p>Mass surveillance has the same psychological effect as a rifle/whip on slaves (not an expert on slavery). Sometimes the owner need to remind the slaves he has a rifle, because they could start to think and organise for a mutinery . It&#39;s the same thing for mass surveillance, people need to know about it otherwise it has zero power.</p>

<p>In this context, the role of Snowden is obvious. </p>

<p>An implication of this idea, is that maybe, mass surveillance is not technologically so developped.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Snowden is just telling everyone what the government want told.  Namely - they have been watching you since birth, every search you have ever made, everything you have ever written and even your deepest, darkest thoughts are logged and known by the almighty, all-knowing, omnipresent Government.  You are powerless to stop them for they will expose all your secrets if you put one foot out of line.  The simple fact is he is spouting what the government wishes it could do, not what it actually can do (at the moment).  It is called fear mongering.  He is, was, and always will be a CIA operative.  Same as Alex Jones, just pumping out the message that you should all be afraid, that the gvt are all powerful, you have no power.  It&#39;s called bullshit.</p>

<p>The truth is the people hold all the power.  You could collapse the dollar tomorrow if you all desired it, you could reduce their fortunes to meaningless digits on a computer screen if you wanted it.  However, you and they both know that we are a part of nature and everything that is happening is perfectly natural.  The current system is dying, we are moving at a million miles per hour towards a global resource management based economy.  We are just in the winter of this two thousand year old exploitative economy, and like any creature&#39;s death, it is desperately trying to hold on to the remnants of the life it has left.  Tomorrow a new belief system will appear and a new way of thinking will emerge.  There will be no poor, starving or destitute, everyone will know they belong to the community of mankind.  Rest assured your great grandchildren will look back in sheer disbelief at this present time.  Either what I say will happen or the present powers that be will destroy this planet entirely in the next 50 years.  That&#39;s the choice they have - choose either fairness or turn the planet into a lifeless, whirling orb of dust, floating in the infinity of space.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would they hang him out instead of just continuing to deny existence of these programs? I find it hard to believe they would intentionally damage the revenue streams big govt supporters like Cisco, Microsoft, Dell etc. I think the reason he is getting more exposure is because he exposed concrete documents detailing how the technology works at the hardware / software level. Genuinely interested in why you think he&#39;s a limited hangout?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember it is not &#39;us vs. them&#39;. It&#39;s &#39;many factions, groups and interests competing and back-stabbing each other vs. us&#39;. </p>

<p>Could be stated Mr. Four is a ClA asset whose mission is to spread info and disinfo that hurts the NSA. If you think &#39;why would govt. agencies fight between them?&#39; remember that the black budget pie is finite. And all that data in the Utah servers is worth its&#39; weight in gold, also. </p>

<p>I think the main effect the SnowMan&#39;s tales has inflicted is that of heightened paranoia and self-consorship. We don&#39;t trust the tech, each other, authorities&#39; claims and think twice before saying something on the phone or posting anything in the net.  And this helps TPTB.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>@George, you are one of the better posters here. I would have thought this was well within your knowledge. Snowden has been given an incredible amount of coverage and told us nothing we didn&#39;t already know, while failing to tell us a whole bunch of things the sheeple do not know and refuse to believe (9/11 being the most obvious one).</p>

<p>Now are we to believe that he doesn&#39;t know about 9/11? Come on.</p>

<p>He has managed to put the chill effect into people who are suddenly now scared of their Orwellian government, while normalising the government spying apparatus in a classic boiling frog manoeuvre.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then what is the limited hangout keeping concealed? 9/11? Like....he found all this secret stuff but nothing on conspiracy X so therefore the official story is true?</p>

<p>Idk about that...they were spying on citizens and foreigners not themselves. Why would he find that kind of info? Also the people behind these conspiracies are people that would know about the spying programs. They would know how it worked and how to avoid it. They probably even have clearance to go into NSA and erase any incriminating evidence well before Snowden days. </p>
