        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Okay we all know it&#39;s a divided front on this sub as to whether what happened
in Boston was fake / real. Or whatever dynamic we wish to argue over on this topic. </p>

<p>For the uninformed and lazy here is a video timeline of the events I found most damning against Tsarnev.
This is from the surveillance video used at his trial. </p>

<p>Exact moment tsarnev enters frame with his backpack:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqaGJ50Cz7o&amp;t=3m38s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqaGJ50Cz7o&amp;t=3m38s</a></p>

<p>Standing by the tree sans backpack:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqaGJ50Cz7o&amp;t=3m58s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqaGJ50Cz7o&amp;t=3m58s</a></p>

<p>Where he is on the phone with his brother coordinating the timing</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqaGJ50Cz7o&amp;t=6m35s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqaGJ50Cz7o&amp;t=6m35s</a></p>

<p>Where he knows the first bomb is coming and starts distancing away from the crowd 
without his backpack. And looking left towards where the bomb will go off in anticipation</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqaGJ50Cz7o&amp;t=7m31s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqaGJ50Cz7o&amp;t=7m31s</a></p>

<p>Exact moment where first bomb goes off, he is the only person looking right and trying to 
get away from the crowd. While everyone else is looking toward the sound of the explosion.
Then he makes his hasty escape. And then the bomb going off exactly where his backpack
was left.</p>

<p>Edit: your argument that &quot;Tsarnev is guilty&quot; - we agree. This does not disprove that some of the people who were portrayed as heroes were planted and actors. The event is a small part of it. Now they get to go on tour and the people who want to sell us more fear get hundreds of hours of them and their sacrifice in the spotlight.</p>

<p>You agree he is guilty for his actions, yet at the same time say he is enlisted as on a payroll?</p>

<p>You are using the logic that just because something happened in the past, that this event 
is somehow connected to a past event. That&#39;s illogical and fueled by your own doubts and 
suspicions and views on life.</p>

<p>You are applying faith based evidence, which is really the opposite of evidence.</p>

<p>I have more evidence available to me that he is guilty for his own actions. 
And I have zero evidence that he was enlisted to do a job like you claim. </p>

<p>Logically....as a human..which one am I going to tend to side with? </p>

<p>I have tangible video evidence to form my opinion on. </p>

<p>But where is the evidence to claim he is enlisted? Hired by someone to do a job?</p>

<p>Mind you, once you remove the &quot;well because it&#39;s happened in the past&quot; there is nothing
that exists that could ever be called proof. </p>

<p>The burden of proof lays with you. </p>

<p>I really don&#39;t think calling me names and calling me a tool is going to aid in your argument.
Probably will serve to do exactly the opposite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You houdinis revenge link is pure speculation with not one shred of tangible evidence. </p>

<p>he uses Alex Jones as a source? That&#39;s really not credible at all. </p>

<p>From the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But I cannot emphasize how much conspiracy theorist energy was spent discussing the backpacks.  Tons of circles and arrows again.  Just teeming with arrows and circles.</p>

<p><strong>This theory has some legs because no one in authority will explain whether or not those men were Craft operatives</strong>, and, if they were, what they were doing there that day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the entire stories credibility in the authors mind is because no one in authority will explain who those men were? That is pretty thin evidence there. </p>

<p>And your other link is even dodgier and BS. </p>

<p>Crap like this: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/zWJX6IH.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/zWJX6IH.jpg</a></p>

<p>That is hands down the dumbest thing I have ever seen. I have video evidence
of Tsarnev planting his bomb, plenty of evidence to know for a fact he is guilty, 
and his older brother. </p>

<p>If you think that&#39;s evidence.....wow.....that&#39;s some insane cat lady shit there.</p>

<p>I have video, you have pictures with arrows. LOL</p>

<p>I take it you are misinformed, the backpack shown in court was the backpack taken from 
his dorm room along with his laptop. It was not the backpack used in the bombing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m all for the theory that the government were behind this. The one thing I don&#39;t understand is why they would resort to some kind of fake bombing? The same with the beheadings by the ISIS.</p>

<p>We know the U.S., Britain, Israel and so forth don&#39;t mind sacrificing lives or suffering of people, so why would they make these fake plays?</p>

<p>I think they are behind many of these things, but unfortunetly I think they implement them with real victims.</p>
