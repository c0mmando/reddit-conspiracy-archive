       Okay we all know it's a divided front on this sub as to whether what happened
in Boston was fake / real. Or whatever dynamic we wish to argue over on this topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the uninformed and lazy here is a video timeline of the events I found most damning against Tsarnev.
This is from the surveillance video used at his trial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Exact moment tsarnev enters frame with his backpack:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqaGJ50Cz7o&amp;t=3m38s">
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqaGJ50Cz7o&amp;t=3m38s
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Standing by the tree sans backpack:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqaGJ50Cz7o&amp;t=3m58s">
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqaGJ50Cz7o&amp;t=3m58s
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where he is on the phone with his brother coordinating the timing
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqaGJ50Cz7o&amp;t=6m35s">
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqaGJ50Cz7o&amp;t=6m35s
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where he knows the first bomb is coming and starts distancing away from the crowd 
without his backpack. And looking left towards where the bomb will go off in anticipation
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqaGJ50Cz7o&amp;t=7m31s">
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqaGJ50Cz7o&amp;t=7m31s
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Exact moment where first bomb goes off, he is the only person looking right and trying to 
get away from the crowd. While everyone else is looking toward the sound of the explosion.
Then he makes his hasty escape. And then the bomb going off exactly where his backpack
was left.

       There exists a reality which is between "all or nothing". He can be guilty but there can simultaneously be a carefully orchestrated campaign of media and inflated body counts to support the agenda of the people who enlisted him in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things we know and even people like you cannot dispute:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Government sponsored Propaganda is legal in the US now against US citizens.
       </li>
       <li>
        The FBI has been caught red handed fomenting plots [aka entrapment] multiple times now.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Your tactics are simplistic, it is a shame the only people you have power over are inferior to you. You accomplish nothing, because you do not struggle. You are a tool, and your worth is of something that can be put away and forgotten.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you use your mind you could be something more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: your argument that "Tsarnev is guilty" - we agree. This does not disprove that some of the people who were portrayed as heroes were planted and actors. The event is a small part of it. Now they get to go on tour and the people who want to sell us more fear get hundreds of hours of them and their sacrifice in the spotlight.

       You are using the logic that just because something happened in the past, that this event 
is somehow connected to a past event. That's illogical and fueled by your own doubts and 
suspicions and views on life.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are applying faith based evidence, which is really the opposite of evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have more evidence available to me that he is guilty for his own actions. 
And I have zero evidence that he was enlisted to do a job like you claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Logically....as a human..which one am I going to tend to side with?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have tangible video evidence to form my opinion on.
      </p>
      <p>
       But where is the evidence to claim he is enlisted? Hired by someone to do a job?
      </p>
      <p>
       Mind you, once you remove the "well because it's happened in the past" there is nothing
that exists that could ever be called proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       The burden of proof lays with you.

      <p>
       I really don't think calling me names and calling me a tool is going to aid in your argument.
Probably will serve to do exactly the opposite.

       My point is there is no proof not a shred of evidence that your assertions are correct. And that tsarnev brothers were victims of entrapment.

       And a mountain of evidence to the contrary of what you are saying.

       You houdinis revenge link is pure speculation with not one shred of tangible evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       he uses Alex Jones as a source? That's really not credible at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       From the article:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But I cannot emphasize how much conspiracy theorist energy was spent discussing the backpacks.  Tons of circles and arrows again.  Just teeming with arrows and circles.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         This theory has some legs because no one in authority will explain whether or not those men were Craft operatives
        </strong>
        , and, if they were, what they were doing there that day.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So the entire stories credibility in the authors mind is because no one in authority will explain who those men were? That is pretty thin evidence there.
      </p>
      <p>
       And your other link is even dodgier and BS.
      </p>

       That is hands down the dumbest thing I have ever seen. I have video evidence
of Tsarnev planting his bomb, plenty of evidence to know for a fact he is guilty, 
and his older brother.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think that's evidence.....wow.....that's some insane cat lady shit there.

       I have video, you have pictures with arrows. LOL

       You keep making the illogical argument that somehow your video of Tsarnev is evidence there isn't a greater plot. It's like you are saying you saw an apple fall out of a tree, proving gravity, and that means that magnetic attraction isn't real. You are stuck in an endless loop where you are unable to even process what I am suggesting. You just don't get it. I feel bad for you, but i'm done wasting my time with someone so stubborn. You believe the fantasy if you want, I will see reality.

       Let me break this down for you again:

      <ul>
       <li>
        Tsarnev is on video. He dropped a bomb. We agree.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       But the question is, who were the guys in Khakis who also dropped backpacks? Why doesn't the backpack that was shown in court photos match the backpack Tsarnev had?

       I take it you are misinformed, the backpack shown in court was the backpack taken from 
his dorm room along with his laptop. It was not the backpack used in the bombing.

       The torn backpack was not recovered from the dorm room, it was recovered from the scene of the bombing. And it does not match the backpack in your "video".

       I'm all for the theory that the government were behind this. The one thing I don't understand is why they would resort to some kind of fake bombing? The same with the beheadings by the ISIS.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know the U.S., Britain, Israel and so forth don't mind sacrificing lives or suffering of people, so why would they make these fake plays?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think they are behind many of these things, but unfortunetly I think they implement them with real victims.
