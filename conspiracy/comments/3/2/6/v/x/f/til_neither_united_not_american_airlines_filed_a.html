    <div class="md"><p>Lloyds of London, the insurance company,  sued the Royal family of Saudi Arabia for their role in 9-11. Lloyds of London paid out hundreds of millions to the families of the victims on the flights. The suit was issued in Pennsylvania a few years ago, on a Sunday night it hit the news. It was  settled out of court  by Tuesday I believe and withdrawn by Lloyds of London and Obama was in  SA on Friday to re-establish the special relationship the US has with SA. Lloyds said they had withdrawn their suit but their evidence filing, their dossier, they would allow anyone to use it in future suits. I recently heard it has been resurrected by some group in NY. </p>

<p>Well this is udder bullshit. </p>

<p>March 2001, senior in high school, I basically acquired the family cell phone that we had since 97. Upgraded the phone a week before flying to Florida. I made 2 successful calls out, and successfully answered one incoming call. All in flight.</p>

<p>Thankfully there have been people who tested the validity under real world conditions and found it was impossible at the altitudes claimed in 2001.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the link---</p>

<p>Given the cell phone technology available in 2001, cell phone calls from airliners at altitudes of more than a few thousand feet, especially calls lasting more than a few seconds, were virtually – and perhaps completely – impossible. And yet many of the reported cell phone calls occurred when the planes were above 25,000 or even 40,000 feet and also lasted a minute or more – with Amy Sweeney’s reported call even lasting for 12 minutes.</p>

<p>Three problems have been pointed out: (1) The cell phone in those days had to complete a “handshake” with a cellsite on the ground, which took several seconds, so a cell phone in a high-speed plane would have had trouble staying connected to a cellsite long enough to complete a call. (2) The signals were sent out horizontally, from cellsite to cellsite, not vertically. Although there was some leakage upward, the system was not designed to activate cell phones at high altitudes. (3) Receiving a signal was made even more difficult by the insulation provided by the large mass of an airliner.</p>

<p>Well-known Canadian scientist and mathematician A. K. Dewdney, who for many years had written a column for Scientific American, reported early in 2003 on experiments showing that these difficulties would have rendered impossible at least most of the reported cell phone calls from the 911 airliners. His experiments involved both single- and double-engine airplanes.</p>

<p>Dewdney found that, in a single-engine plane, successful calls could be counted on only under 2,000 feet. Above that altitude, they became increasingly unlikely. At 20,000 feet,</p>

<p>“the chance of a typical cellphone call making it to ground and engaging a cellsite there is less than one in a hundred…. [T]he probability that two callers will succeed is less than one in ten thousand.”</p>

<p>The likelihood of 13 successful calls, Dewdney added, would be “infinitesimal.” In later experiments using a twin-engine plane, which has greater mass and hence provides greater insulation from electronic signals, Dewdney found that the success rate decayed to 0 percent at 7,000 feet. A large airliner, having much greater mass, would provide far more insulation – a fact, Dewdney added, that “is very much in harmony with many anecdotal reports …that in large passenger jets, one loses contact during takeoff, frequently before the plane reaches 1000 feet altitude.” Dewdney concluded, therefore, that numerous successful cell phone calls from airliners flying above 30,000 feet would have been “flat out impossible.”</p>

<p>Such calls would become possible only several years later. In 2004, Qualcomm announced a successful demonstration of a fundamentally new kind of cell phone technology, involving a “picocell,” that would allow passengers “to place and receive calls as if they were on the ground.” American Airlines announced that this new technology was expected to be commercially available in 2006.32 This technology, in fact, first became available on commercial flights in March 2008.33</p>
