<blockquote>
<p>Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., an attorney-at-law, author, and vaccine investigator, spoke before the New Jersey State legislature regarding the oppressive bill that was introduced to do away with religious exemptions for mandatory vaccinations for children in that state. </p>

<p>However, before Kennedy’s presentation, he addressed the media with a dissertation that everyone in the USA needs to hear, especially every legislative body at any level of governance and, particularly, regulatory agencies dealing with health, healthcare and vaccines/vaccinations.</p>

<p>Kennedy explained that he is not against vaccinations per se, and his six children all are vaccinated. His vaccine research began because of his work with educating about mercury contamination from coal burning power plants. </p>

<p>At the lectures he would give, mothers would tell him about mercury being injected into their children via vaccines, and that he should investigate what that mercury does to kids, since many of them told of their children’s health problems after being vaccinated.</p>

<p>That was the beginning of his research, which ended in his book, <em>Thimerosal: Let the Science Speak.</em></p>

<p>As a result of all the research his team did, he came to the conclusion the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) “is a cesspool of corruption” and a “sock puppet” for the trillion dollar pharmaceutical industry! </p>

<p>As matter of fact, these are his exact words: &quot;a troubled agency, in fact, a cesspool of corruption.&quot; It’s pervasive and “hopelessly corrupt and dysfunctional.” </p>

<p>Based upon that, Kennedy contends that no one should be mandated to take vaccines because the science cannot be trusted.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Kennedy says, <em>“Today, there are 271 new vaccines in CDC&#39;s pipeline awaiting approval to be put on the schedule, and each one of those new vaccines could mean upwards of a billion dollars to the companies that own the patents. And Paul Offit has said that he believes that children can get as many as 10,000 vaccines safely. There&#39;s never been a study by the CDC of the cumulative impact of these vaccines.”</em></p>

<p>Kennedy went on to point out that there have been four federal studies done in 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2014 that all pointed out how dysfunctional the CDC truly is, but nothing is done about it! However, he does connect some of the dots when he points to “follow the money.”</p>

<p>According to Kennedy,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;It [vaccine pharmaceutical industry] contributes $2.6 billions a year in lobbying--twice what oil and gas spends...It gives $31 million a year to federal political candidates...The regulatory agency has been undermined. The CDC today, because of these financial conflicts, is a sock puppet for the industry it&#39;s supposed to regulate.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One issue he bats out of the ballpark, I think, is when he accuses the media, who were present, of not reporting on vaccine issues. I applauded when I heard those comments. This is what made me cheer:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;And then of course, you have the press...The pharmaceutical industry, I believe, is the number one advertiser. The pharmaceutical industry spends between 3.4 and 5.4 billion dollars annually on TV, newspaper and radio advertising. </p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s the number one advertiser. It targets the network news division. It&#39;s the number one advertiser on network news. And what I&#39;ve seen is that time and time again is that these stories do not ever make it into the newspapers and they do not make it onto the national press because of some other considerations.</p>

<p>&quot;The pharmaceutical industry has a very good scare tactic which is, if you say anything bad about the CDC vaccine program or you question the safety of vaccines, people will stop vaccinating and children will die. So journalists, and news divisions and editors often times will listen to that, and sometimes they&#39;re looking at the cash that&#39;s coming in, but they will not run these stories. And in the long run, that&#39;s a big problem because Americans are reading the science anyway, even if you guys aren&#39;t reporting it.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As an aside, scare tactics were used by Big Pharma to get the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-660) enacted. They threatened to stop making vaccines, if they didn’t get their “get out of jail free card.” Congress caved and U.S. children have suffered untold horrors from vaccines and vaccinations ever since.</p>

<p>Kennedy talks about the CDC’s epidemiologist Verstraeten’s 2000 study that found a correlation between mercury and autism, but was reworked to ‘prove’ there was no connection between mercury in vaccines and ASD; the CDC’s Bill Thompson, PhD, nightmare embarrassment wherein he names names as to who ordered the lies at CDC: Frank DeStefano and the former head of the CDC, Julie Gerberding! </p>

<p>Kennedy says that Thompson has 100,000 pages of damning documents and wants to testify before Congress. He also cites the MMR vaccine mumps active efficacy ratings fudged for years and about which Merck &amp; Company apparently lied to keep that vaccine’s license, according to two whistleblowers and a lawsuit.</p>

<p>Kennedy tells the cold, hard factual facts about vaccine science and politics. All those members of the U.S. House of Representatives who signed onto House Resolution 117 ought to be made to listen to Kennedy’s explanation of the science that was uncovered and to the constitutional attorney who followed him. Plus, retract that asinine resolution!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3LVtEMjwCQ">Here is the video of that outstanding presentation by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.</a></p>

<p>At 34 on the timeline, the Constitutional issues with any bill/law doing away with the religious exemption to vaccines/vaccinations are discussed. It’s an entanglement with religion that is unconstitutional. It amounts to a deprivation of due process, and as the attorney said, a “trifecta of violations” impacting fundamental human and constitutional rights!</p>

<p>Sue Collins, an activist, made remarks that religious freedom is paramount. However, the only religion that the bill will allow is pharmaceutical religion, which pharmaceutical companies dictate. She further emphasized that everyone not follow the only religion the pharmaceutical industry will allow citizens to practice—Pharma’s idea of religion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The sad part is most of the general public think the mercury is long gone from vaccines, they don&#39;t realize it&#39;s still present in trace amounts in some shots, or in &#39;bolus&#39; amounts in others such as the tetanus or flu shot. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love how most liberals (like myself) were up in arms over Dick Cheney&#39;s conflict of interest with Halliburton, yet when the entire CDC vaccine/drug decision makers have massive conflicts of interest by either owning stock in big pharma companies or going to work for big pharma with massive salaries after their government career through the revolving door between the CDC and big pharma, nobody bats an eye.</p>

<p>The &quot;pro-vaxxers&quot;/&quot;anti-choicers&quot; think they are rooting for science. It&#39;s fucking insane how hoodwinked they all are.</p>

<p>The big pharma industry is COMPLETELY  protected from lawsuits and now everyone is rooting for mandatory vaccinations. ITS AS IF EVERYBODY TOOK STUPID PILLS.</p>
