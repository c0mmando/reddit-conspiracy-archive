      <p>
       So, just a thought I had this morning.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the ramp up in all forms of media lately, from the
       <em>
        Russian Hacker Cyber Attack
       </em>
       , the Clinton email thing, all the cyber legislation that was passed in November and December, the presidential memoranda and addendums to cyber tools, the FCC net neutrality rules  (400 page document nobody has read), the NSA/Snowden stuff being in the spot light all the time, the
       <em>
        North Korea cyber attack
       </em>
       , and then combining these line of thinking with the electric blackouts and rumors of EMP/nuclear/NORAD relocation rumblings I've heard, I think the next one will be Stateside and it'll be cyber, knocking out electricity grids or something stupid, and the USG will be able to do another emergency drill for preparedness.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the past few years we've seen these exercises, with metropolitan mocks in Boston (thanks, Tsarnaev), as well as rural manhunts (Eric Frein, thinking of you).
      </p>
      <p>
       How about one on an even bigger scale? Who knows?
      </p>
      <p>
       We have CISPA back waiting in the House, too, by the way. Remember the coverage of CISPA in 2012?
      </p>
      <p>
       Democracy Now, 2012
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/stories/12729">
        CISPA Critics Warn Cybersecurity Bill Will Increase Domestic Surveillance and Violate Privacy Rights

      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/15/3022562/cispa-cybersecurity-bill">
        CISPA: Congress weighs privacy against 'cyber threats'
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Huffington Post, 2012
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/3109504">
        CISPA Vote: House Passes Cybersecurity Bill To Let Companies Break Privacy Contracts
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, CISPA was passed by the House both in 2012's session and 2014's session, but were never enacted (not votes on by the Senate).
      </p>
      <p>
       How fast do you think it will take to pass? The House loves it. It'll pass again. How long did it take for the PATRIOT Act take to pass? The answer may surprise you...
      </p>
      <p>
       So, maybe I'm from the future. But I can see the next Event be
       <em>
        cyber
       </em>
       related, affect electricity grids or other important infrastructure, and be blamed on a boogey man hacker group and they'll get their CISPA.
      </p>
      <p>
       It took a year to get Americans to be OK with bombing Syria through the ISIS beheading PR campaign. What makes you think another PR campaign hadn't been going on along side it? It's been 3 years and I've barely hear peep about CISPA, and there it sits in the House

       I think the game is over. They can play games and make their little circlejerk plans, but the Aquarian age is here baby. There's no killing the internet and you can't thwart human evolution, only delay. We're meant to be Star Trek status and we'll get there in due time.

       I want to believe that this viewpoint is true. I spent a lot of time in that category of information but I just can't decide if it's just a ploy to make us complacent or not. Got any sites or anything that might help me believe? I need to get back to the positive side of things.

       What work specifically in this avenue of thought? Most of it seems to say that we need to do inner work and that everything else will manifest around us. While I'm totally okay with that and understand it myself, I just don't know if it's valid information or not. Also a lot of that stuff, including the COBRA info, talks about some behind the scenes organization that is fighting the TPTB, says there are going to be mass arrests, all this great sounding stuff, but there is never any proof, they ask for faith just like any religion. While what they say has the possibility of being real, it could also just be an attempt to get us to sit back and wait for saviors. This breeds complacency. Not much of it talks about what we the individuals can do to actively change the world for the better. I just have trouble putting my faith in anything these days without some form of evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with you on the Internet though, I see it as one of mankind's greatest creations, it is the manifestation of our planets collective consciousness. It is our greatest tool against TPTB in my opinion. However it must be used wisely to be effective, same as any other tool, and it seems to me that most people don't know how to use the Internet in a constructive way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe I just haven't researched the right stuff, maybe there is something I missed. What are some of your favorite websites for this information? I'm always willing to learn more.

       I don't recall that name right now, I'll look him up. And I completely agree, if the free energy stuff is real, it could solve just about everything. We could actually create an efficient backbone to civilization and finally be free from the monotonous work many of us are forced to engage in our entire lives.

       Thanks. Checking that out now. The holographic fractal universe is the theory of the universe I resonate most with. Every time I indulge in a psychedelic trip I see fractalized patterns in and through everything. Getting goosebumps just thinking about it.

       Yeah. As you dig into it and discover that the flower of life is the interference pattern for the planck spherical units in his scaling unit of geometry, and that the same pattern was inscribed in a bunch of ancient sites by an earlier advanced civilisation (see Graham Hancock), it essentially validates ideas of monism, gnosticism, hermeticism, and terms like "as above, so below" really start to make more sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you realise that monism means that consciousness is integral to the whole equation and our thoughts are shared everywhere instantaneously throughout the hologram and form the collective subconscious, it becomes apparent that as more and more people start latching onto this idea, a harmonisation of thought will occur and become a source to draw upon for other people as they move through on their process of understanding.

       Anecdotally I've had an increasing number of friends experience spiritual awakenings, contact from their soul ancestors and instances of telepathy.

       Forgot to reply to this. I haven't witnessed any of those things happening to those around me sadly. Your experiences are definitely a good sign though, that gives me some hope. I have experienced several telepathic connections with my roommate recently. Several times I'll be thinking about something I want to talk to him about, and within minutes he'll walk into the room and start talking about the very same thing. It trips me out. He's the only person I know IRL that is "awake." I hadn't really thought of those instances in that context until you said that. Fascinating...

       Could the Russians cause a power outage at the White House? Quite possibly. Would they bother? Very unlikely. The Russians know the US is looking for excuses to re-ignite the conflict in Ukraine, an eventuality that Russia is keen to avoid.

       That's how you manufacture reality in America. Ask Karl Rove:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The aide said that guys like me were "in what we call the reality-based community," which he defined as people who "believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality." ...
        <strong>
         "That's not the way the world really works anymore," he continued. "We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you're studying that reality—judiciously, as you will—we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors…and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do."

       I'm wondering if the conflict in Ukraine isn't just a smoke screen put up so that we have someone to blame on domestic false flags that are soon to come...what other purpose does it serve?  Push NATO borders?

       Ukraine has (or rather, had) considerable resources - particularly the natural gas fields in the Black Sea off the Crimean coast. My belief is that US-led coup in Kiev was (at least in part) designed to facilitate the commercial exploitation of these gas fields by US companies, and more importantly, to NEUTRALISE Russia's principal political and economic lever over Western Europe. As I am sure you know, most of Europe is dependent on Russian oil and gas imports, and the exploitation of the Crimean gas fields by the US would really harm Russia's economy and its political power.
      </p>
      <p>
       So whilst I don't doubt that Russia was genuinely concerned for the fate of the many ethnic Russians in Crimea in the face of aggression from Ukrainian thugs, there were strong geo-political reasons for Russia to "reclaim" Crimea militarily. I don't think the US anticipated this and it screwed up their plans in the region.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US elite are now trying very hard to re-ignite the conflict in Ukraine (which the Russian-backed rebels have essentially won) by sending special forces trainers and heavy military equipment, but most Ukrainians don't want to be used as pawns in the game the US is playing.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, expect more false flags in the US, and more demonisation of Putin and Russia.

       I agree--I think the electric outage at the White House was a complete false flag designed to SPOOK. Think about the complete rehab the White House got after 9/11--you'd have to be an idiot to think they wouldn't upgrade the electric as they were fortifying it during the construction.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember seeing a photo of the WH with the front completely covered with a tarp. I think I remember something about the WH receiving the same type of material which the Pentagon had added (which was hit by a plane or missile on 9/11). I would assume some additional offensive weapon capability was added to the roof of the WH.  In any case, I just can't believe the WH would be connected to the same grid as the general public after 9/11 (obviously commercial and residential buildings are far removed from the WH at this point).

       Russia and the USA are 2 different sides to the same coin.

       The "YOU ARE GOING TO BE NUKED" fear mentality serves the purpose of forcing the people to look to the government for protection, so there's a much lower chance of a revolution.

       All these people saying Russia is going to bomb us just doesn't understand yet. In the Cold War, we were closer than ever from "being nuked", yet nothing ever happened.

       Didn't really want to say it, but the blackout - both electrical and cell towers. And then with little to no communication between the people, it's really the perfect opportunity to ...  go door to door with prizes while murderous and armed to the teeth.  Granted that may be a big longshot.  I just imagine, if we saw that little bit of jade helm, what does the other who knows how many pages have in it?

       Programmer's note: I think the other big ramifications need not be that serious, bit would not be surprised if the media doesn't hype up the Event as if it were so. Something like a 'what if' kind of coverage to get everyone scared.

       I think you're right, but I have a strong feeling it will be the stock market, not the electrical grid. That's my personal theory. "Russians hacked the stock market" is the perfect excuse to pop the extremely over-inflated stock bubble in a quick way, a flash-crash like
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Flash_Crash">
        the 2010 flash-crash
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This "Russia hacker" excuse gives the financial world an out from the corner they've backed themselves in to, so they can get more bailouts but not look like assholes because "it wasn't their fault it crashed, it was the Russians". And this Russian hacking DC power stuff is a perfect way to prime the pump of the public's minds for this to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could see something like a 20-50% crash, in one hour. Probably won't happen, but that's the scenario that makes the most sense to me. It would have to be very fast and big, to make it look like such a massive irregularity that it could be blamed only on hacking.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then they'll be able to push through
       <em>
        all sorts
       </em>
       of random cyber security garbage bills right after that because everyone's pensions will be fucked because everyone is now in a 401k that is tied to the stock market, usually index funds. People will be in absolute panic mode if this occurs... almost all people in the country would lose about 1/3 of their life savings in one day, if it were to play out this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I know the answer to your PATRIOT act question. 4 days. 1 day in committee, one day in senate, one day in house, one day signed by president. Bam, it's a law. They obviously wrote it all out long beforehand. And this was at the end of October, so not even 2 months had passed since 9/11

       I think you're probably right, mag. I guess I can't wrap my head around the blackout/electrical grid messaging.
Maybe it's a completely unrelated play.

       I mean if they are really going to do the fake russian hacker stock crash thing, I wouldn't be surprised to have distractor messaging like that. It's closely related, so anyone studying anything related to what I'm talking about is instead drawn to this more-talked-about new blackout/electrical-grid story. It's like a lightning rod, it draws all the attention and gives them cover. It's like informational fog of war while they carry out the plan. It's a decoy story, basically.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then it also has the nice benefit of priming you for a electric/hacking attack in the next month, which seems like a predictive programming kind of deal. So it nicely captures and primes anyone who would bother to look in to these things.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that would be my guess as to why that narrative is suddenly a "thing". And that's
       <em>
        only if
       </em>
       the planned stock market crash from the "russia hacker" is actually in the works, which I doubt.  But it's possible.

       Dear Community Leader,
      </p>
      <p>
       You have been given this brief so that you may understand what is happening now in regard to the closure of the banking system. We hope you will help maintain the calm and peace of your community during this short period of change. We also will encourage you to support those in positions of responsibility to help maintain the status quo in regard to the vital necessities of your local community.
We are hoping that food, water, electricity, internet, gasoline, transportation and phone service will not be disrupted during this banking system changeover. Furthermore this community leader brief has been created to help you understand what is transpiring around the world at this time. The person or persons giving you this brief are part of a worldwide network which is dedicated to a peaceful transition to a transparent financial system for our banking systems worldwide.
Who do we represent and who is behind this process?
      </p>
      <p>
       Our group is comprised of intelligent, aware individuals from all segments of society and we are dedicated to nonviolent change. We have been made aware of what is now transpiring by key individuals in the world’s secret service organizations and military. Top ranking members of the world’s political infrastructure are also supporting these lawful enforcements. These honest patriots in the CIA, NSA, FBI, military, sheriff and police forces have counterparts from around the world involved in a simultaneous sweep of financial criminals.
To summarize, there are large international multijurisdictional task forces who have uncovered large-scale corruption in the financial and political arenas and are now taking lawful actions to end this criminal behavior. Certain leaders of regional and national law enforcement agencies and police forces are aware of what is now taking place as well. We also anticipate military presence to be deployed in the cities to help maintain the peace. We are anticipating broadcasts over the emergency broadcast network to explain the situation very soon if they have not begun by the time you have received this document.
What is happening and why are the banks closed?
      </p>
      <p>
       What is happening at this time is a necessary financial reset of the global central banking system. Unfortunately this must necessitate the closing of every computer tied into the central banks. This will leave the entire planet without access to cash, ATM machines, credit cards or stock markets.
There will be no currency available other than what is already in circulation for a maximum time of possibly 2 weeks. The intent and plans of these lawful agencies in charge are hoping for is a best-case scenario of 3-5 days for the banking system to be offline. However with so many variables at play, the exact time it will take to effect this changeover in reality is unknown at this time. This lack of money amongst the world’s populace clearly may create some hardships in various locations as some may panic for not being able to access their money via the normal channels.
Your vital role in this process
      </p>
      <p>
       This is where our contact with you and your leadership is vital to maintain an open honest and transparent communication network with those in your community and those fellow community leaders who will possibly not know what is happening or be able to receive this brief in a timely manner. One of the most important actions we will ask you to perform is the monitoring of the local police forces that are not aware of this event and what is transpiring. They may see the people’s confusion and mistake this natural reaction as hostile or potentially violent. We ask that above all these forces remain vigilant, proactive and refrain from violence.
Important suggestions to maintain peace for a harmonious change
      </p>
      <p>
       We ask that food and water banks and local community groups be encouraged to begin to serve the populace if these bank closures result in disruptions to any of the following for too long: transportation, food, water, electrical grid, cell phone towers , internet, television, emergency services, hospitals and any other vital network that may be affected.
How did we know this is happening now?
      </p>
      <p>
       Our group has been contacted and we have been asked to act as an informational network and infrastructure to support you in your appointed tasks whatever they may be. If you are a mayor or a water district manager or the community’s liaison to the power companies we hope you will see to it that your responsibilities and services remain uninterrupted during the time while the banks are closed. We further ask that you provide a means to get these necessities to those who require them via your local community’s infrastructure such as soup kitchens on school grounds or distribution of water for those in need. We ask that hospitals and emergency services be given priority and support to protect the aged and infirm.
Why is this happening?
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately there has been criminal malfeasance within the world banking systems including the Federal Reserve for many years. These individuals in charge have corrupted many aspects of the world’s political infrastructure and greed and lust for power has thwarted the democratic process and caused much harm to our world’s ecosystems and societal and national relations.
Evidence to be presented to the public
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence is being held which indicates a system of financial fraud and corruption, which has resulted in the institutionalized theft of trillions of the world’s hard earned money. This is now ending as the evidence and the serving of indictments, and arrests of those responsible has now begun. These individuals involved in this conspiracy are very powerful and politically connected criminals. They have been repeatedly warned to follow the laws of their respective countries but some of them have refused.
Time to act
      </p>
      <p>
       This refusal to comply with the law has now forced closure of the central banks which is now affecting the entire world banking systems. This radical action is required to enforce the law and is now being implemented by a coordinated police force action around the globe. The reason this has not been done by alerting the populace beforehand is because the criminals in charge control the world media and have established censors worldwide. A policeman does not tell a criminal he is going to be arrested or he will flee.
Powerful leaders will fall
      </p>
      <p>
       This banking racketeering operation has included some very powerful public figures which when the dust settles will most likely shock many people. This is not a military coup or anything negative. In fact we feel this will allow for a more honest system of governance, which will find worldwide support as the truth is revealed to the public in the weeks to come.
Your right to question the truth of this brief is noted
      </p>
      <p>
       We understand you may not be aware or agree to this information that is being presented here but we ask you to consider that this brief was created on September 29th, 2013. This should help to act as evidence that what is now taking place was known by us who created this document beforehand. We further want to reiterate that this is not a military coup and there is no reason for panic and fear. Whether you believe us or not as to the nature of this worldwide event we ask that you do your best to facilitate calm and peace within your communities as efficiently as possible.
In conclusion
      </p>
      <p>
       We ask that you keep an open mind to this document and know we are supporting you in your position of responsibility and power as a leader of your community. Please know that this transition is intended to be for a short period of time only. You will be asked to think locally and to not wait for federal instructions as certain communication channels may be disrupted.
Please study this document and if possible talk candidly to the persons who bought this brief to your attention. They may have some very good wisdom to clarify what is happening and will share ideas that may benefit you and your community.
We also have a website (
       <a href="http://www.prepareforchange.net">
        www.prepareforchange.net
       </a>
       ) where you may access links to articles and evidence that what we are saying has been in process for quite some time. We will encourage you to educate yourself via these links. If the internet network remains open during the time of the closing of the banks these links will help you understand more. If the internet is down we ask you to interface with those who bought you this document.

       I mean if they are really going to do the fake russian hacker stock crash thing, I wouldn't be surprised to have distractor messaging like that. It's closely related, so anyone studying anything related to what I'm talking about is instead drawn to this more-talked-about new blackout/electrical-grid story. It's like a lightning rod, it draws all the attention and gives them cover. It's like informational fog of war while they carry out the plan. It's a decoy story, basically.
      </p>

       But then it also has the nice benefit of priming you for a electric/hacking attack in the next month, which seems like a predictive programming kind of deal. So it nicely captures and primes anyone who would bother to look in to these things.

       So that would be my guess as to why that narrative is suddenly a "thing". And that's
       <em>
        only if
       </em>
       the planned stock market crash from the "russia hacker" is actually in the works, which I doubt.  But it's possible.
