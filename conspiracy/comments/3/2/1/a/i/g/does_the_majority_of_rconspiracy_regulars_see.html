       Too much hyperbole. You can tell the real people with an interst in this and the ones who are in it for a buck pretty easily after some time based on their level of urgency. With Alex Jones everything is a sky is falling scenario and you're dead unless you buy some trinket he's selling. He also will push stuff that is long debunked. To me that shows that he doesn't give a fuck, he's just going for clicks.

       He said the Fat Bin Laden tape was real,  I don't see everyone going around ripping him to shreds over that shit,  AJ gets raked over the coals for far less.

       I really doubt he said that. I bet he said something closer to that he can't verify that it's fake. I've listened to a lot of Corbett and he doesn't tend to make absolute statements like that.

       I do doubt it but I can believe it if it's true. I just find that he rarely makes absolute statements like that, especially when it comes to something that has legs in the conspiracy community.
      </p>
      <p>
       I always feel like he's being careful and not trying to turn off people who believe the particular theory, so that's why I'd be surprised if he said it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said if he said it he probably has a good reason that he's fleshed out in one of his podcasts. I've neverd found him to be the type to comment like that on something he hasn't really looked into.

       Well yeah, i would represent myself about many things, but i am just not as knowledgeable (dont have the time to be) about some of these deep connections. I dont trust many media producers, but having spoken to him personally on a few occasions, and after looking into what he says, hes usually on point.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, no one is infallable (i agree with you about the OBL video for example) ... anyway, we can agree that jones is a shmohawk- and yes sir, we should be cautious about who we allow to "represent us"...
      </p>
      <p>
       im at the point of my life where i just dont have time to research and fact check like i used to... At this point, im trying to arrange my
       <strong>
        praxis
       </strong>
       and create organizations and businesses that can actually manefest change by simply serving as an alternative to the contradictions we allow ourselves to be subjected to. Im probably just spinning my wheels, but whatelse am I gonna do?
Each of us, uniquely, can work to make the Status Quo Obsolete.
Anyway, thanks for the reply my friend!

       Alex Jones, like most dark-web journalists, are a mixed bag of truth and misdirection.
      </p>
      <p>
       if they speak too much truth to power, they will end up like
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Hastings_%28journalist%29">
        Michael Hastings

       .

       not everything they say is truth.  but not everything they say is misdirection, either.

       I do think he's likely controlled opposition in certain areas or research subjects like Israel for example, but I don't think he's COINTEL.  He does way too much to bring way too many disparate voices onto his show/site, that's not the M.O. of COINTEL.  COINTEL would be the random 'truth' radio program that spends all their time taking potshots at everyone else in the 'scene' typically 'punching up' and not down.

       Back then Alex Jones was a thunderbolt of resistance to the new world order.  Here came this wild eyed crazy redneck from Texas yelling into a microphone telling everyone to wake the fuck up and fight.  He galvanized the resistance movement and at the time was pretty much the only platform for it.  Nobody else even came close in sheer velocity, passion, and dedication.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you've never heard one of his three to four hour shows from way back in the day of nothing but deep emotional reflective contemplating and moving heart poring feelings, well then you don't know Alex Jones.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't listen to the man in almost a decade so I can't say much about what he's become.  But the guy deserves respect as a pioneer of this all.  He woke up millions, and without him I don't think we'd have nearly the size of the community we have now.

       I'm fascinated by conspiracy theories, whether or not they are real. It's like a detective case to find out the truth, which can come a little from each viewpoint. However, sometimes I can't believe people's logic and reasoning. I think Dahboo77 occasionally has some good points but mostly he's just 'out there' in an entertaining way. What do you recommend for solid, well researched, and documented news? I mean consistently quality and not just fear mongoring from the schizophrenics?

       He releases a video every couple of days, they each get about 180k views on youtube. Should be more, it's an entertaining show that stays really focused, although much effort is spent lampooning Bill O'Reilly and Fox News. It's an easy target, but I suppose doing so provides a very easy-to-understand example of corporate/media corruption.

       I watch Alex Jones.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no idea if he's controlled opposition. In some ways, though, it doesn't matter to me since I critically analyze every source I come across. Just like with everyone else, I look up events, documents, and books AJ cites and then come to my own conclusions. I've learned a lot using this strategy. For example, when I first heard Alex talk about Operation Gladio I assumed he was exaggerating. I checked out Daniel Ganser's book about the topic, realized it was all true, and now I'm the one explaining to people how the West organizes false flag terror.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't have to buy into his more bombastic segments or fear mongering, just objectively analyze the information he conveys as you would any other source. Also, the idea that selling products makes him a fake is absurd imo. That's what you're
       <em>
        supposed
       </em>
       to do in a free country. In fact, if he wasn't trying to grow and expand his business (thus getting the word out to more people), I'd be suspicious.

       For me Alex Jones served as a very crazy introduction into the more extremist side of "conspiracy theories", and he's still a little too harsh for my taste sometimes. Although I had been lurking on this sub for a while and doing my own research, it wasn't until I watched one of his documentaries that I really started down the rabbit hole. I think he dramatizes things on purpose to make a point, but he encourages viewers to not take what he says as the straight truth but to look things up for themselves, so he's okay in my book.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also don't understand the hate for selling his own products, he's not backed by any major corp so he has to fund his show somehow.

       Either Snowden is part of a Russian conspiracy as a long-time sleeper agent who was trained inside the US and not in Russia.  Hence why Russia has continued to protect him for years 24/7, Russia doesn't protect people like that; usually Russia trades people in as bargaining chips in international deals. (Even John Oliver has to meet him in front of the FSB building and was probably searched).
      </p>
      <p>
       Or he's a limited hang out. Nothing like murder, kidnapping, torture, financial fraud, financial tax hoarding, domestic phone wiretapping, nothing like that was uncovered in anything Snowden revealed. Does anyone find that normal that his revelations were so underwhelming and involved only metadata and foreign communications (and communications of other nations' leaders). Is that not strange?
      </p>
      <p>
       It was so uncontroversial that no one even got fired or arrested as a result of the media reports. Like remember the Church committee and the scandals during the 1970s, the arrests and firings and prosecution... None of that happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Snowden talks about civil liberties but then goes to a nation that is full of legalized spying and polonium &amp; journalist murders? The state where the Interior Ministry can literally call a Taxi on his console radio?
      </p>
      <p>
       He's so damaging to the US, but the NSA responds to all journalists with "no comment" and doesn't even defend itself? They don't even try to out him as crazy or disturbed or claim he was getting fired, or lie about his credentials or anything to discredit him? They don't do any of that??

       Precisely why I'm on the fence. Russia doesn't play that shit. The whole thing is foo bar. Which is why I question, they wouldn't let him in if he was CIA, if he was, they'd killed him. None of this makes sense......

       I just don't understand anything that is going on. He could have been traded in for some sanctions relief on Russian banks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Certainly they wouldn't allow an ex-agent or "leaker" person to work in the Russian intelligence.  So what is he doing on a daily basis? Just interviews and writing on the internet? Just propaganda? He doesn't have a job or anything (I doubt they put him some place as a janitor or a tech support guy) so they must be clearly paying him a salary.

       This is why I'm on the fence. The kgb is alive an well so is the cia. I don't know, honestly. I'm not an insider, but something is off. If the CIA wants him dead, he is dead, if te kgb (yes they still exist) he will be dead. He serves a purpose for both? Dude, I'm just asking honest questions.

       I think at one point he was legit, but his appearance on Piers Morgan was his 'official' act of selling out. I used to listen to his show once or twice a week, and there is a marked difference between the tone of the show before Piers and the tone after Piers. He didn't used to rant and rave and carry on anywhere near the way he does now. He also looks like a bag of smashed assholes these days. He's sweaty and has huge bags under his eyes and just generally looks unhealthy.

       Yeah I agree he looks like shit, but he is in his 40's now. It's funny because he always talks about how viral and healthy he is thanks to his products that he sells. I still listen sometimes because the show can be entertaining and sometimes talks about interesting things.

       I think AJ is a provocateur--in it for the $$$$$$$$$$$.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think AJ is right about a lot of issues--and is harassed by the gov't on a daily/weekly/monthly/yearly basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think AJ has seen the writing on the wall--and has made changes in the way infowars covers issues. For example, infowars did not post any articles questioning the Tsarnaev conviction during the trial--because he knows the gov't will come down on his ass even harder.  It also seems like Infowars has also added more mainstream links to their mix over the last year (ex: cbs "news"). AJ also knows that google is fucking everyone and making independent articles vanish when people search for "9/11 WTC 7".
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think AJ is "controlled opposition" but I do think he is willingly changing the way infowars operates because he sees what the gov't and google are doing. In the end--it's not much of a difference (effectively the gov't has muted infowars).
      </p>
      <p>
       I would also note that AJ was most likely harassed "Extra Special" on his trip to NYC (which is when he did the Piers Morgan segment I think).  The authorities KNOW they can fuck with him--and it will affect his performance.  It does not excuse AJ making an ass of himself--but it does show a Reason as to Why he may have been wound extra tight the day he went bonkers on cnn. I think AJ even posted a video of him being bullied by NYPD on his way back to his room...
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        EDIT
       </strong>
       : Interesting that NOW THAT THE TRIAL IS OVER...infowars NOW at this very moment has as their lead story:

       I think to say he's 100% lying is a little absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
       He says maybe 95% truth with 5% lies.

       I wouldn't know about the Bilderberg group if it weren't for him.

      <p>
       I think it's designed that he look crazy, but to totally blow off everything he has ever done is dumb.

       I think Alex is legit, sincere and a hard worker. People just like to sneer at him because he's fat, loud, uncharismatic and not self-aware, but he has contributed more to the community than most. Top conspiracy people who aren't in it for their egos, like Aaron Russo, know that Alex is a good guy. That's good enough for me. I'm sure if Alex could be better at his job (more aware of his image, more charismatic, more convincing) he would be. He can be an idiot, he can be wrong (we should embrace the fact that conspiracy theorists will be wrong now and again) but his heart is in the right place.

       meh, I kinda see him as a guy cashing in on the whole thing.  He knows just how much truth he is allowed to say, but that he has to throw some misdirection in as well.  He will never speak out against zionism, because he doesn't want to die.
       <br/>
       He is sensationalist, and definitely makes us look bad, but that being said, everything makes us look bad.  Even when were proven right, we're still "conspiracy theorists".
      </p>
      <p>
       Is he controlled?  Of coarse.  Do you think they would have let him on CNN if he wasn't?
       <br/>
       But I don't think he's much worse than the rest of the talking heads.  Just a guy who wants to sell some seeds and water filters.

       i believe him to be a real guy who is himself on the air.
he is the guy yelling and screaming to get people's attention but not someone to 'follow' or 'believe in'.
i don't believe he's some kind of agent and the youtube videos that make clips together to make him seem stupid are the real disinfo.
my issues with him are his fundamentalist convictions, his abrasive yelling, and his own self-delight in his fame. i think he deserves props and respect for what he has done in this world and its a hell of a lot more than most anyone else. it does take a lot of money to create a media machine to stand against the mainstream so of course he needs to make money. the guy is legit.

       He avoids talking about Israel's involvement with 9/11 and his mantra "9/11 is an inside job" is nothing but a diversion to place all blame on US government and not on Israel.

       Yeah I agree he looks like shit, but he is in his 40's now. It's funny because he always talks about how viral and healthy he is thanks to his products that he sells. I still listen sometimes because the show can be entertaining and sometimes talks about interesting things.
