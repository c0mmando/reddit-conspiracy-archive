        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I was thinking about how a modern conspiracy minded person would fit into a tribal/village setting of say 5000 years prior. </p>

<p>I basically came up with this. The Conspiracy minded person would be sitting around the camp fire and he would hear a branch snap out in the darkness. </p>

<p>The normal tribesmen would think nothing of it. Its just a branch that fell on the ground no big deal. </p>

<p>But the CT would take into account the natural predators in the area, the way it snapped and whatever other information he had at the time and put two and two together. even though he might not have actual proof of a monster lurking in the darkness. He might alarm his tribesmen and they would get upset, because if a predator really was out there, they would all have to do something. Either defense up, or maybe even move to a different area. But, if they let their ignorance be their bliss, then they can continue just sitting at the fire. Its probably nothing anyways. </p>

<p>Maybe the next day they would scout the area and find the evidence of tracks and would be proven right, but until that evidence comes to light, they are just alarmist and paranoid. </p>

<p>Maybe there really are monsters out there to be paranoid about and our minds are still reacting and trying to cope with the stimulii. </p>

<p>What do you guys think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think some people make better CT&#39;s because they can think differently. Just like how two people can see a movie and one person just see&#39;s it at face value while the other sees the subtle hidden and secondary messaging. </p>

<p>Just like how some people can nerd out on math and others rather be acting in front of crowds. I think there is a spectrum where the CT mindset might be more intense than it is for others. </p>

<p>Ask them what happened on 9/11 and they might tell you about 19 muslims and hijacked planes... but they will never acknowledge that what they believe is itself a conspiracy theory...</p>

<p>You see, when they believe something, its because facts, reason, evidence, logic, and pleading to the majority... and anyone who believes anything different is just a crazy conspiracy theorist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are asking what would the tribe do in these situations? I have no idea what tribes did to people when they would deem that one &quot;has a sick mind.&quot; </p>

<p>I think it would depend on the situation. Is it happening once a month? Why not go make sure the area is safe. Once a week? Every day? Every hour? At this point you got ask yourself why is this person so on edge? Maybe they were attacked and now have PTSD. What if the person is correct <em>every single time</em>? But this post isn&#39;t about making up fantasy situations, its about trying to bridge modern day psychological reasoning with ancient survival of the fittest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are wrong about depression being of no value besides maybe with the creation of art. </p>

<p>I think you got to figure out what really leads people into depression? There are many things, but lets paint it with a broad brush and say lots of time its from the lack of accomplishments and feeling like you cant get any where in life or just feeling useless in this giant world. So one starts feeling depressed. </p>

<p>Now what leads people out of depression? Usually exercise and diet, I think the physical progress tends to help change ones view of their self and lifts their spirits. Also accomplishing something very rewarding. </p>

<p>Now what could possibly be more rewarding than saving your tribe from a dangerous animal attack? like a hippo attack or something equally dangerous like a herd of elephants or bulls coming thru. </p>

<p>To me, depression is the tool that lets people know they are not accomplishing enough in life. And if focused correctly that anxious energy can be harnessed into something productive and rewarding. Go build a house with your hands and try not to smile as you walk thru it. </p>
