       I love the idea of what we "had". The idea, the people. So many great people in the US. But so many just don't "get it". We live in a bubble, and I feel like an alien. I despise this shit. I do not consent to what we are doing. I hate it, and feel sick. I know (being young, not too young though, in 20's) we never truly knew what the founders imagined. People talk about going back to the "good ole days". Well when were they? Our history is based on falsehoods and lies. We know history based on the FED, the vampires of this nation. I know this goes way beyond that. I have some questions. What do you all think of George Washington? I know he was a Free Mason, but what are your thoughts? You think this nation was "planned for a bigger picture/chess game" or did the founders really want something "else"?

       George Washington was a Mason, but back then the Masons were actually a very respected group.  The Masons started as, basically, the first work union of stone masons and carpenters.  It became so respected (based on their demand for craftsmanship) that it slowly became a fraternal group of businessmen that used their respect for honesty and quality to promote their personal agendas.  This, in turn, allowed corruption to infest, which is the reason why the Masons are hardly mentioned today.
      </p>

       This country didn't really go to shit until the Federal Reserve was set in 1913.  We can thank Woodrow Wilson for that.

       To appreciate the Masons, you need to understand what they originally stood for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back in the day, houses and buildings collapsed all the time.  This typically caused many deaths.  The Masons built buildings that lasted.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were able to do this, because they not only insisted each member knew how to build, but they refused to cut corners.  Back in the day, if you hired a Mason to build you something, and you told him to cut back on safety, he would tell you to go to Hell, because that building would have the Mason stamp, and therefor would be a scar upon all Masons.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Masons became known with honesty and quality.  I you wanted a house built for for family back then, you wanted a Mason house.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were aware of corruption, and tried to prevent it, but it eventually came.  The Shriners (those old guys that drive the small cars in the parades) are a group that pulled from the Masons to escape the corruption.

       Thought the masons were all about the original masons that built solomon's temple.  It's more of a supernatural thing than a blue-collared worker thing.

       Washington was thought of as a bit of a nut, because he would wear his military uniform everywhere even though he was out of the military for years.  Truth is, his military uniform was the only formal suit he owned, because he was poor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, because he kept wearing the uniform, everyone assumed he must have been a brilliant, military strategist, which is how he was elected.

       Let's talk for a moment about how you feel, okay?  Some questions...
      </p>
      <p>
       Are other people amazed on how well you get along with animals?
Do you feel more at home when dreaming?
Can you feel hurtful words?
Do you sometimes just "know" what someone else is thinking?

       A great word I like to use when describing this (for me, perpetual) state is interloper - feeling as though you are an alien even in a familiar environment, seeing everyday things without comprehending any of it. Not to say that I'm unable to function in society, but feeling like an interloper makes it difficult to relate to others. I do not feel that I was meant to live on this planet sometimes.

       Teachers all over are talking about how there are kids now they have never known before.  Kids that question.  Kids that intimidate them.
      </p>
      <p>
       These kids also tend to get along very well with animals.  They have great abilities with empathy and the arts (writing. poetry, music, acting, drawing, etc.), but care little for money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Passionate in their actions, they fight for not only themselves, but for the expressive freedom of others.

       These are the Indigo.  The children of the future.  The sculptors of the new world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where are they from?  This is a good question.  We Indigo are typically disgusted with society, so it's hard to believe we are a product of such.  We hate to lie, which seems to be something these parasites do happily.
      </p>

       i dont know what starseed is, sounds like fallen angel or something. as for the "indigo child" thing, it originated from new studies of the color emitted from someones aura.  maybe look into the science and not the cult following and you might understand that the term represents a color matched with a personality.

       I've noticed there are a number of quite insightful kids these days. I've always attributed it to the vast trove of knowledge that the Internet now avails us. I can't imagine where I could have gotten had I had a magic tablet I could ask any question of. I was told I could throw a tennis ball into space if I tried hard enough (and I did) and that hydroelectric power had something to do with the crackling sound that water from a hose makes when it hits the pavement.

       Well....while I believe you're going too hard pigeonholing the aforementioned as "indigo"; something is happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder what type of commonalities "we" share.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, can someone verify the comment re: Shriners?
      </p>
      <p>
       My late father, was a 33rd at age 26. This, is well...something just doesn't sit well with me...also, he soon after became a shriner, and was really active.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record, he was a very skilled man, Mason, heavy equipment operator, mechanic, crane operator....and generally a straight badass.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just can't see him subscribing to any type of belief of anyone else's he didn't subscribe to.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do know when we relocated a decade later, he refused to continue in a neighboring state with any affiliate.

       Fuck all if "they" didn't do a land grab and fuck us out of our families estate.

       George Washington poor?
      </p>
      <p>
       Did some digging and found this:
      </p>
      <p>
       "George Washington's family was never poor --- they came to this country as land owning minor aristocracy --- considered Landed Gentry.
      </p>
      <p>
       George's father Augustine Washington was a slave-owning tobacco planter. 
The Washingtons were moderately prosperous members of the Virginia gentry, of "middling rank" , though not one of the "leading" families. 
They were wealthy people who actually worked --- gentlemen farmers, plantation owners, and business men. 
George's half-brother Lawrence married into the family of William Fairfax --- 1st cousin of English aristocrat of Thomas, Lord Fairfax and Virginia's largest landowner. 
George's father also inherited a great deal of land from other relatives --- making them quite land wealthy and politically influential in Virginia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Grandfather - Lawrence Washington, a military captain, planter, and a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses 
Great Grandfather - John Washington , an English Virginia planter, slave owner, and politician selected for the Virginia House of Burgesses. 
Great, Great Grandfather - Reverend Lawrence Washington, was a Fellow of Brasenose College, Oxford and an English Anglican Rector ( a college professor at Oxford University and academic, religious, political administrator for the Church of England)"

       Generally good info. Most Freemasonry is founding father's/enlightenment type ideology of equality and freedom. Grand Orient Lodge Freemasonry (also known as the Illuminati) was involved in the French and American Revolutions. RAW attributes to them the removal of monarchy from continental Europe.

       Well, you can't even lead these horses to water anymore, because they don't know they are thirsty. And it's time somebody reminded everyone how thirsty we really are.

       The founding fathers of America were a unique class of white Christians. The United States could never have been created by any other race, any other religion, or any other class of
       <em>
        men
       </em>
       . What they gave us is precious, and even more so now that it is under such a constant attack.

       Sure! I'm not trying to be ignorant btw, I did wiki the Treaty of Paris, but was still confused by what you meant. I really need to brush up on my American History. So the treaty was signed by King George III, ending the Revolutionary War, basically securing the colonies independence from British monarchy. Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown, which was the last major battle, yet the war still didn't end for 2 more years when the treaty was signed. Not sure about what took place those two years, thats where I'm still a little lost! I appreciate your response, I'm very curious!

       I used to feel this way. Still do in some ways sometimes. The US justice is functionally morally bankrupt. The US model of government seems like a chimera of totalitarianism, corporatocracy, and kleptocracy.  The US people seem largely brain dead and soulless.

       But then there's folks like you and me and hundreds of millions others who, if not illuminated, at least have enough of a nightlight turned on to see that there indeed are monsters in this world and they don't hide under the bed.

       My best advice is to grab a shovel and plant some trees. Build soil. Get involved in the survivalist, natchy, back to Earth, monistic mindset and find local groups that meet.
      </p>
      <p>
       MeetUp is a sweet resource. Lotsa survival/transition groups as well as permaculture, natural building, what have you.
      </p>
      <p>
       These folk are pretty awake for the most part and besides reminding you that you're not alone, they'll provide you with a peace of mind as they help you build your shtf plan.

       What you

       you know about history is based on what the ruling elite have told you all your life. You think that the white race is responsible for all the world's problems? Then you don't realize that you have been brainwashed.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I've said many times, the two most important factors in your life and my life and everyone's life are religion and race. America was designed to be run by white Christian men. As long as it was run by white Christian men, it did just fine for itself and its population. Now that more and more non-white, non-Christian, non-males are assuming positions of power and authority, the system based on the rule of white Christian men is breaking down. It can't handle the corruption of the Jews, the incompetence of blacks, the silliness and Utopian dreaming of women.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can put it simply. As white Christians go, so goes America. And as America goes, so goes Western civilization. We are in a death spiral and there is no sign that those intent on destroying America are going to relax their relentless campaign of racial extermination.

       The dominant issue in the world today is exponential growth in technology and increasing productivity making work unnecessary from a production standpoint, but people still needing money. This is leading us to a situation where most people will not have any way to survive, lacking any marketable skills.

       You could do what I plan to do, and leave the country altogether (I'm in my 20's as well). I know that probably isn't a tangible option, but if it is you should strongly consider it.

       I could leave the country, but I'd leave my love ones behind. Frankly, they are are the only ones keeping me here. I'd be happy living in Iceland with a fine Icelandic girl or in South America with a fine Spanish gal. I heard Putin is giving land away to farmers though, I'm from the eastern block and damn I love me some Slavic women (they have my heart). My family keeps me here, sigh...

       I understand your position but I cannot relate. I have no familial ties anymore, so leaving the country having no strings attached is relatively easy for me.
      </p>

       If your family keeps you here, I don't really have any suggestions. If I'm being frank, I think we're past the point of being able to take our country back peacefully. I wish there was more I could say for you that would be helpful, but we're all in a similar situation - we're all trapped.

       I completely agree. We have gone passed the point of no return.  You're not being frank but being honest. I don't think this will all go down "peacefully". There will be a civil war (imo). I don't wanna be around for that. My family is divided and I fear it will be like how it was in the original civil war, brother against brother :(.

       Every war is brother against brother. We are all one human family. Best of luck to you, friend.

       Wise words, I just meant more "hitting close to home". I know you are my brother/sister, and I love you. But my older brother shares a bond/love with me you cannot. May be simple minded, may be nature, but we share a "different" bond. I do not want to see the "whites of my brother's eyes". If you know what I mean. Gnite brother/sister, I'll see you in the global consciousness., peace..
