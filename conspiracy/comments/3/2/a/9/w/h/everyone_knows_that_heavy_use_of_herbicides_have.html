       Vaccines don't actually kill viruses. Vaccines are the viruses themselves, just weakened or actually dead, so they cause a reaction in our immune systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're not manipulating viruses, we're manipulating our immune systems, so there's no way for viruses to adapt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, antibacterials can create resistant bacteria, which is a somewhat-major concern, but it's being addressed pretty satisfactorily for the most part.

       But as we have seen, viruses can and often do afflict persons that have been fully vaccinated, which can mean one of two things: That the immune systems of the persons vaccinated did not properly respond to the vaccinations,
       <strong>
        OR
       </strong>
       that the viruses themselves have mutated to avoid being vulnerable to the immune response.
      </p>
      <p>
       In support of the latter, I would point to the FLU virus(es), for which a new vaccine
       <strong>
        must
       </strong>
       be developed every year,
       <em>
        because the viruses mutate
       </em>
       , making prior years' vaccines obsolete.
      </p>
      <p>
       We fully accept that life forms such as bacteria (and everything else) mutate (evolve) in order to cope with the stressors present  in their environment, why would we assume that viruses should be an exception?

       The flu is a special case. It mutates faster than most other viruses. Also there are just a bunch of strains of the flu. Think of it like this: The ball droids in Star Wars that make the shields? They can deflect fast moving matter and blaster fire, but if you can sneak up and gently slip a grenade through the shields you can destroy them. It's two different attack types and the shield protects against one and not the other.

       Viruses don't mutate. They come in different forms. Look at Hepatitis, which has three different types (A, B, and C.) While they're related, they're different enough so that while one treatment works on one, it won't work on the other two. Influenza (flu) is the same way.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many mutations or strains of the virus (these mutations were caused by introductions to new environments), and because they're different enough from each other that there's no one cure-all vaccine, the World Health Organization (WHO) has to predict which strain will be most common for a given year, so that pharmaceutical companies can develop the right vaccine. So while you may have had a vaccine for one strain this year, you can still become infected with a second strain. We're playing a guessing game with the flu.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, viruses can infect someone who's been vaccinated against them. I've had Chicken Pox twice, but that's because when I was in the process of the vaccinations, we didn't know that one vaccination against Chicken Pox wasn't good enough. Children now get two doses of the Varicella vaccination.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, in case you don't want to read all of that, here's a summary:
      </p>
      <p>
       There are different strains of viruses, which are different enough that one vaccine does not work for all of them. We are still learning about the administration of vaccinations, so there's possibilities that people may get infected with a virus even after being vaccinated against it.

       My understanding of how vaccines work is that they trigger our own immune system to identify and destroy viruses that may be harmful to us. Through dead or live virus exposure. Like your white blood cells need to go to school.Think of your own white blood cells as the "perimeter guards" that need to learn that "Crazy Larry" is 86'd from here (your body) and isn't allowed around no more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccines can train your perimeter guards that Larry is on the way without actually having to experience first hand the total drunken HAVOCK that Larry creates when he fucks around with you. It's just you and your immune system fighting against crazy Larry. Mostly you are not changing his DNA in this fight. Mostly. Shit can happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bacteria get their DNA changed ALL THE FUCKING TIME When we irresponsibly use antibiotics. It's like fucking thunderdome in there.

       you basically just proved my point.

       blind global vaccinations (much like hyper promoted antibiotics) do inevitably birth vaccine-resistant "super viruses".

       if you must make this a government ("for the common good") issue, we should be investing in "viral cures" -- targeting people who are actually INFECTED (instead of forcing UNINFECTED people to take medicine that they don't need / may never need).
      </p>
      <p>
       instead of free vaccines, free viral cures would obviously be a much better/cheaper/smarter approach.

       This is so idiotic the drug resistant virus happen after non vaccination. If you get vaccinated it teaches your body to produce the cure itself and vaccines are made using only dead virus cells and a non reactive liquid. To be fair I do see this discussion on vaccines as darwin theory of evolution in practice as eventually all the stupid people will die out at 21 from measles

       Super viruses arent the only concern, though I can definitly see that happening. The scary thing is, by using these vaccines we are essentially erasing all the evolution we have gone through to fight diseases. In this era even people with massivley horrid immune systems can live to pass their genetics onto their kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       So even regular diseases are going to pose huge problems in a couple of generations. We most certainly will die if we don't get vaccines then, because big medicine decided they were going to be our immune system. And then think about what happens after some sort of government collapse and we can no longer get ahold of our precious vaccines.

        If you listen to the actual interview (at around 2:15 in), you’ll see that it’s very clear that Hilleman, obviously aware of the conspiracy theories claiming that the AIDS virus derived from the virus used to make the early polio vaccine, was making a joke and that the people in the room during the interview realized it was a joke. That’s why they laughed. They were laughing at the conspiracy theorists. Those claims were clearly floating around in the mid-1980s, right at the height of the AIDS epidemic, before there was much in the way of effective treatment. So this part of the interview was cut from the show.

       Vaccinations can result in altered viral or bacterial ecology in geographic areas.  When Prevnar7 vaccine did not include the pneumococcal 19S serotype, it became more prevalent in the environment. It tended to be more antibiotic resistant than average pneumococci.

       It has been claimed that use of pertussis vaccine has increased carriage of parapertussis, which is not affected by vaccination.
      </p>
      <p>
       OTOH, FDA suggested that pertussis vaccination may also increase carriage of pertussis, if exposed following vaccination, in the baboon model.

       Yeah, parapertussis actually parties down in people vaccinated for pertussis. I've wondered, actually, if the "whooping cough" outbreaks were actually parapertussis as I have never seen it definitively stated that they tested for it, just patients report symptoms common to whooping, so it gets categorized as pertussis. Could you imagine any other scientific field playing so fast and loose?

       It's just not normal for humans to catch four strains of flu every year (even if you don't get the shot yourself, if you're around little kids, you likely get force-immunized against at least two flu strains due to FluMist).

       You are a colossal moron. Vaccines give your body a dead version of a bad virus, your body then fights and kills that virus. It now knows how to fight said virus when it actually attacks. If your conclusion is correct. Wheres that super polio that should have come around?  Answer: it's almost wiped out in the world. The only reason it's still around is because people either a) can't get access to it, or b)  they are anti-vaxers and are one of the scums of the universe.

       You should probably do some research before calling other people "collossal morons." Not all vaccines are "dead virii." Seriously, it would take ten minutes, tops, and you'd look like less of a knob AND might be able to tackle the topic with a bit more finesse.

       there are several efforts to develop stem-cell based viral CURES.  I think we should support these efforts -- something we need to do in any event.
      </p>
      <p>
       i realize that the chem companies make much more money when they can force (by law) everyone to buy.  but as you say... "focusing" on only those patience you are infected, and CURING them is A)  much less costly to taxpayers, B) eradicates the virus much more effectively -- and w/o causing vaccine-resistance super viruses.
      </p>
      <p>
       bottom line:  we are in agreement:  people shouldn't die from preventable (or curable) diseases.  but nor should we ADMITTEDLY/KNOWINGLY enable super viruses -- that would obviously be VERY counter-productive.  and vaccines are known / have been proven to do just that.
      </p>

        "viral CURES" are the smartest, most effective solution.

        what do you think we should do instead?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       there are several efforts to develop stem-cell based viral CURES.  I think we should support these efforts -- something we need to do in any event.
      </p>
      <p>
       i realize that the chem companies make much more money when they can force (by law) everyone to buy.  but as you say... "focusing" on only those patience you are infected, and CURING them is A)  much less costly to taxpayers, B) eradicates the virus much more effectively -- and w/o causing vaccine-resistance super viruses.
      </p>
      <p>
       bottom line:  we are in agreement:  people shouldn't die from preventable (or curable) diseases.  but nor should we ADMITTEDLY/KNOWINGLY enable super viruses -- that would obviously be VERY counter-productive.  and vaccines are known / have been proven to do just that.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "viral CURES" are the smartest, most effective solution.
       </strong>
       thanks for asking.
