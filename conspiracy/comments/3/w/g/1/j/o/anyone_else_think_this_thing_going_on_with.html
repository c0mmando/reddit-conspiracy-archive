<p>Why?</p>

<p>Just because he admitted to (illegally) buying firearms for people who feared they were unable to pass background checks... and then admitted to (illegally) planning terrorist attacks (crime of conspiracy) with Farook back in 2012...</p>

<p>And the FBI has not charged/arrested him?</p>

<p>Why would that be &quot;shady&quot;?</p>

Illegally transferring them. </p>

<p>I&#39;m still hung up on why though. Farook and Malik bought their handguns legally. Those are way harder to get than an AR. I don&#39;t understand why he had to be involved at all, and why they couldn&#39;t have just bought them themselves. </p>

<p>The most heavy handed picture they can muster is of the couple in traditional Pakistani garb, at the airport, from years ago. Nothing from the gun range, the regional center or police pursuit to corroborate the flimsy official narrative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the link I posted says that they planned an attack in 2012 but decided against it because of attacks being busted in the area. I don&#39;t know how much truth there is to that though because there&#39;s no proof other than his testimony and if you&#39;re a theorist then that&#39;s definitely insufficient </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s covered in the 2nd video in the playlist TeChina linked to me. </p>

<p>Supposedly he and Farook made bombs as a &#39;hobby&#39;. They&#39;re quoting him as saying: &quot;If I had anything to do with those bombs, they would have gone off&quot;</p>

<p>Edit: Your question is actually answered in this link OP provided. He admitted to plotting an attack in 2012.</p>
