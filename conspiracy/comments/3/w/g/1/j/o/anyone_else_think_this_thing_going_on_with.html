       I'm all for investigating conspiracies and I think there are a lot of issues with this one, but we have to be rational. You don't think that finding out that the guns that you purchased were just used in this huge attack that's all over the media, and your name is going to come out and second now, and your old childhood friend was the one that did it... You don't think that's enough to throw someone's life into just a
       <em>
        bit
       </em>
       of an upheaval??

       But checking himself into a mental hospital...? I don't know dude, that doesn't seem like the logical thing to do. If he didn't want the cops to get to him, he should've been on the run. If he just wanted to cooperate, he should've gone straight to the cops.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what happened to the guns being bought for police?

       All these links come out saying the guy looks like a photoshopped crazy person, and now today these interviews come out. It's almost as if the media waits a day or two to see what skeptics talk about and then they put these stories together using half measures.

       Why?

      <p>
       Just because he admitted to (illegally) buying firearms for people who feared they were unable to pass background checks... and then admitted to (illegally) planning terrorist attacks (crime of conspiracy) with Farook back in 2012...

       Legally buying firearms. 
Illegally transferring them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm still hung up on why though. Farook and Malik bought their handguns legally. Those are way harder to get than an AR. I don't understand why he had to be involved at all, and why they couldn't have just bought them themselves.

       There's no proof of the rifles ever being transferred. We would have seen a picture of the couple holding the rifles, if any such photo or video frame ever existed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most heavy handed picture they can muster is of the couple in traditional Pakistani garb, at the airport, from years ago. Nothing from the gun range, the regional center or police pursuit to corroborate the flimsy official narrative.

       Yeah the link I posted says that they planned an attack in 2012 but decided against it because of attacks being busted in the area. I don't know how much truth there is to that though because there's no proof other than his testimony and if you're a theorist then that's definitely insufficient

       It's covered in the 2nd video in the playlist TeChina linked to me.

       Supposedly he and Farook made bombs as a 'hobby'. They're quoting him as saying: "If I had anything to do with those bombs, they would have gone off"
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Your question is actually answered in this link OP provided. He admitted to plotting an attack in 2012.

       Friend is FBI plot-creator/informant? Gotta get those numbers up. Shades of Boston, sting gone pear-shaped, I say again and again.

       Heard lots of crap.  Seen evidence of nothing.   Meh.  Until I see some police dash cam videos with some people shooting back, I am done with this one.

       Yea, I keep waiting for this shit.  Why is it for other crimes besides the Chicago one, have the dash cam videos been released so fast afterwards?  Nothing for this?  There has to be multiple angles too.  All of it is nonsense.

       idk. Could've been for protection from authorities and his plan backfired... or he was admitted (without his consent) for this very purpose.. Who knows, tbh.

       I'm all for investigating conspiracies and I think there are a lot of issues with this one, but we have to be rational. You don't think that finding out that the guns that you purchased were just used in this huge attack that's all over the media, and your name is going to come out and second now, and your old childhood friend was the one that did it... You don't think that's enough to throw someone's life into just a
       <em>
        bit
       </em>
       of an upheaval??
