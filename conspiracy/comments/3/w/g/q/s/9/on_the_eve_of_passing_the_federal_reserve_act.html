        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;Very soon, every American will be required to register their biological property in a National system designed to keep track of the people and that will operate under the ancient system of pledging. By such methodology, we can compel people to submit to our agenda, which will affect our security as a chargeback for our fiat paper currency.</p>

<p>Every American will be forced to register or suffer not being able to work and earn a living. They will be our chattel, and we will hold the security interest over them forever, by operation of the law merchant under the scheme of secured transactions. Americans, by unknowingly or unwittingly delivering the bills of lading to us will be rendered bankrupt and insolvent, forever to remain economic slaves through taxation, secured by their pledges.</p>

<p>They will be stripped of their rights and given a commercial value designed to make us a profit and they will be non the wiser, for not one man in a million could ever figure our plans and, if by accident one or two would figure it out, we have in our arsenal plausible deniability.</p>

<p>After all, this is the only logical way to fund government, by floating liens and debt to the registrants in the form of benefits and privileges. This will inevitably reap to us huge profits beyond our wildest expectations and leave every American a contributor or to this fraud which we will call &quot;Social Insurance.&quot;</p>

<p>Without realizing it, every American will insure us for any loss we may incur and in this manner; every American will unknowingly be our servant, however begrudgingly. The people will become helpless and without any hope for their redemption and, we will employ the high office of the President of our dummy corporation to foment this plot against America.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This &quot;speech&quot; doesn&#39;t look genuine to me. </p>

<p>Even though the sentiments expressed in this speech may accurately reflect the intentions of those who created the Federal Reserve, my immediate feeling reading this was that Woodrow Wilson would have been appalled, and he would have tried to stop the plans for the Fed, if someone had flat out made this speech to him in the White House.</p>

<p>Also, when you analyse the text for the language used in it, I believe there are a number of obvious anachronisms which show the text to be a modern hoax. For instance, the expression <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability">&quot;plausible deniability&quot;</a> was only coined (by the CIA) in the 1960s. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The media [and the Machine behind it] want to discredit the concept of the so-called &quot;sovereign citizen&quot;.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t even use that term. I assert an older one: an <em>American</em> citizen.</p>

<p>I declare that my rights derive from God Himself (and not from any government) and that we as a society hold this truth to be self-evident. </p>

<p>No one can &quot;grant&quot; me rights. They&#39;re mine from the get-go.</p>

<p>The concept that the government &quot;gives&quot; you rights is false. That&#39;s a foreign idea. One rooted in Karl Marx, not in the US Founding Fathers.</p>

<p><em>We</em> are real. Government is a fiction. A made-up thing. An agreed-upon fairy tale. </p>

<p>Humans lose their sanity when they confuse reality for fantasy. When they start to see humans as fake, and governments as &quot;real&quot;.</p>

<p>The end-result of this delusion (on a large scale) is mass-murder by totalitarian regimes.</p>

<p>This can only happen when the people become, as a group, deluded. When they hand over their own power to a fiction.</p>

<p>So do I use the term &quot;sovereign citizen&quot;?</p>

<p>No. I don&#39;t have to. I use the term &quot;American citizen&quot; because that says all there needs to be said. That phrase means that 1) I am not a slave, and 2) I do not recognize the authority of any State to deprive me of rights that they didn&#39;t [and couldn&#39;t] create.</p>

<p>The State is terrified by the possibility of the people waking up. Of asserting their own natural power and dominance. Thus they have to strive, at great pains (and at great expense), to discredit and stigmatize free people.</p>

<p>&quot;Ew . . . that icky, stupid hick claiming to be a &#39;sovereign citizen.&#39; You don&#39;t want to be like that!&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s like in the movie &quot;Idiocracy,&quot; where the free man shows up from the 21st Century and finds himself in the dystopian society of the 26th Century--and a doctor he meets expresses terror that the time-traveler doesn&#39;t have a bar-code tattooed on his wrist.</p>

<p>Once he sees that the newcomer&#39;s not tagged and herded like an animal, he hits an alarm buzzer and screams: &quot;You&#39;re an Unscanable!&quot;--as if that term connotes a terrorist.</p>

<p>See the scene here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkPGlVqqEP0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkPGlVqqEP0</a></p>

<p>(That scene is instructive because it shows you how a totalitarian state convinced its populace that free people were &quot;scary and evil&quot; and to be &quot;good&quot; meant to be tagged and barcoded. With a compliant and dumbed-down population, the corrupt were left to run roughshod over the rest of the country. But the larger moral lesson of the movie is to show you where such a society inevitably ends up.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you should tell your <em>opinion</em> to this Supreme Court judge!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It turns out that your “personal bank account” is actually a “corporate bank account”. The “Colorado State Court” is actually the “Colorado District of Columbia Municipal Corporation Court”. </p>

<p>If you are shocked to learn these facts, you are not alone. So are millions of other Americans. These changes were made 150 years ago and tucked away in reams of boring meeting minutes and legalistic gobbledygook meant to be applied only to the internal workings of a private governmental services corporation and its employees.</p>

<p><strong>There was no public announcement, just as there was no public announcement or explanation when Congress created “municipal citizenship” known as “US citizenship” in 1868</strong>.</p>

<p>Properly, technically, <strong>even to this day, this form of “citizenship” applies only to those born in the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and other Insular States</strong>, so there was no real reason to educate the general public about the topic. As Congress was secretively using the labor and the private property assets of these “citizens” as collateral backing the corporate debts of “The United States of America, Inc.” there was plenty of reason to obscure this development.</p>

<p>From a comment I made earlier:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Basically, you must understand that we are all slaves, always have been. We simply have nicer amenities because it is easier to control people with simple pleasures and fear through propaganda. Please see the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZGAlUT6RTi1s7Qo9ce3huEA_GNVNT0Xt">Servant King series</a> for much more on this. Marcus puts it all (using his personal life as an example) into perspective. See also <a href="https://www.losethename.com">Lose the Name.</a> Keep in mind, it is incredibly difficult to actually stop using your legal name (especially if you use legal services), but the research they have done on this topic is valuable. Please also look into <a href="https://archive.org/details/pdfy-A3_v4SEVxCudIit2">The Crown Temple</a> and <a href="https://archive.org/details/pdfy-A3_v4SEVxCudIit2">Bill Cooper&#39;s Mystery Babylon Series</a> for more on the many lies we are taught.</p>
