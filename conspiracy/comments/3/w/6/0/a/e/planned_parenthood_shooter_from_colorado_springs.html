       "The man accused of killing three and injuring nine others at a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood clinic in November shouted "I'm guilty" during an outburst in court on Wednesday.
      </p>
      <p>
       Robert Lewis Dear, 57, shouted to those assembled in the Colorado Springs courtroom “There’s no trial—I’m a warrior for the babies,” prior to being formally charged with first-degree murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Colorado Springs police have declined to discuss a potential motive in the Nov. 27 attack, but there had been mounting evidence to suggest Dear was deeply concerned about abortion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Later, while Judge Gilbert Martinez was discussing the possibility of a gag order, Dear yelled “Seal the truth, huh? Kill the babies, that’s what Planned Parenthood does.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Dear also took aim at his lawyer, Dan King, during the proceedings. King had represented Aurora, Colo., theater shooter James Eagan Holmes earlier this year.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Do you know who my lawyer is?” Dear said in another outburst, “he’s the lawyer for the Batman shooter in Aurora Colorado who drugged him all up and that’s what they want to do to me.”
      </p>

       I have nothing to say about this guy or whether he actually did it, and I don't support crazy conservative radicals. But one things for sure, Holmes was definitely under heavy medication during his trial. This is the scary part of conspiracies like this. No one should ever be made to stand trial under the influence of psychiatric drugs. There were no outbursts from Holmes to justify sedating him. When someone is too insane to stand trial, they remove them from the actual proceedings so they don't interrupt them, and it's only justified once a person is declared legally insane(so it's not a matter of determining murder vs insanity, rather determining if the facts are true , ie did that person actually pull the trigger). You can't sedate someone and then roll them in on a wheelchair barely conscious and have a mock trial with the defendant nodding off during the proceedings. Oh wait, that's exactly what they did with Holmes...

       Its a tribunal. I assure you that courtrooms are not fair and do not have real justice in mind. Its a show to generate fake professionalism to be respected. The cartoon is so bad, it doesn't fool everyone.
