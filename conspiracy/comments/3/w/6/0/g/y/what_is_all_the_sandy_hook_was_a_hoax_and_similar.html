       This person is lying they have failed to identify one of the other parents who supposedly lost a child (Robbie Parker) and they claim their daughter went to a location other than where the media claimed the shooting happen and then went so far as to say that we should go easy on the media for getting the location wrong and never correcting themselves.

       No they did not. They found a teachers fingerprints on a gun. Or maybe the principals. An which guns were those? the ones they found in his trunk or the ones they pretend he had on them that were in his trunk? An back to Putins' first request. Who was your step daughter? An if a double blind. Why would the coroner say that it was so bad parents could not see bodies? If you really saw her would you be willing to go on TV an ask that coroner why he lied to the American people?

       Yep, this is what I remember, too. They wouldn't name the felon. Why not? Why the heck no further investigation into this? If only to prove that it was an old print or something. And wasn't that print/DNA also found on the greeting card found in Nancy Lanza's room?

       Exactly! I'm hazy on that at this point but I would appreciate an honest reply from OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       He stated there were multiple finger prints from Adam Lanza. Not factual at all!
      </p>
      <p>
       OP is claiming he's connected. Said he saw the girls body. Nobody has ever stated that in here, to my knowledge.

       NOT a statement that anyone would

       make about a step daughter of theres that got murdered.  This is a calloused comment that essentially dehumanizes the child.  The unthinking crassness of this remark on your part in reference to this supposed "step daughter" that you had is

       Practically every-fucking-body here answered your goddamn question, ass wipe.  You just kept asking it over and over again anyway regardless.  There's a BIIIG difference in those two things.  Matter of fact, I answered your questions in another response on here...and what was the response from you?  Nothing.  Crickets.

       You're a fucking troll, dude.  This is how trolls
       <em>
        act

       .  You're the type of troll that comes in and attempts to play the role of the "innocently oblivious" type that asks stupid, leading questions...and just
       <em>
        keeps
       </em>
       asking the same question over and over again after it keeps getting shot down...over and over again.
      </p>
      <p>
       And why do you do that?  It's because the script your given to try to troll and dissinfo with is apparently very shallow, and once you get met with the deep well of refutations that some on here have put on you, you have exactly zero response aside from "Well she died...and

       Dr H Wayne Carver? The states former chief medical examiner? The one who oversaw at least 7 of the autopsies? Did he show you the bodies before or after he told the public on national news that families identified their children by photos? I am not saying the bodies are fake. I am saying one of yall are lying. If it is him..then we now have further evidence that we were lied to about what happened there and more reason to question what we were told. If it is you what do you have to gain? An to play along with your defense. With all the advancements that have been made in special effects and real dolls. One can surmise it is not impossible to create a real looking fake dead kid. To play along even more of to where your step daughter went. Maybe this was a way to get more kids for the sex trade. Crazy idea right. But not impossible.

       I don't know what he said, or why. But my wife and I, as well as at least 4 other families went to the morgue. Again, my stepdaughter wasn't shot in the face, but I do know a few who did do the photo IDing. Possibly because they were much too gory to be seen in person ...?

       This is the full press conference given by the former chief medical examiner of CT. So if he is lying, then we have been deceived and if so what else did they lie about? Maybe you should examine the evidence that is presented that shows this was staged. Then you will gain an understanding of where we are coming from. You claim to be proof of a dead child yet offer none.

       He didn't lie. Many families IDd by photo. But some were also escorted to the morgue days later. At the time that quote was made, none of us had gone to the morgue, so if he did mention the morgue, that would've meant he could see the future...
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, sorry i didnt take a picture in the morgue so I could 'prove' myself to random strangers on Reddit years later.  (Guess I can't see the future either!)

       No one asked for a pic. maybe PM Putin_loves_cats with  the name of the child you claim to have seen. He is the first to ask for proof. An what you are confirming is that we were lied to by the media. Which begs the question what else about Sandy Hook did they lie about. Your kid could be dead, but I highly doubt it was Lanza..maybe it was the felon from NY or the military pants wearing guy in the woods. Maybe they are the same person providing cover fire this op.

       I agree that it could've been someone else, but some of you guys are saying no one was killed, and they're all in hiding. I mean. Really?!?
But can I ask what motive would it be for the government to do this? Haven't heard anyone answered that logically yet

       I cannot speak for those people. I gave you a scenario that is sadly plausible. The problem with hunters and rabbit holes, we see them we look for rabbits..then find them.So a crazy as it sounds those kids could of been taken to be the newest recruits in the pedophilia rings that plague this country and others. A big stretch I know. I am not saying it happened. I am saying I do not believe the story we were told.

       You're not understanding what a false flag really is.
      </p>
      <p>
       A false flag attack doesn't mean that an
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       attack didn't occur and that real people didn't actually get killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       A false flag attack means/can mean that an attack took place, but someone OTHER than the
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       perpetrators are blamed so that TPTB can manipulate and redirect the public's fear and anger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if your "stepdaughter got killed" (and it's seeming like you might be a bad troll that's lying about this, to be honest), it doesn't mean that the attack still wasn't a 100% false flag.

       Why what?  Why are people killed in false flag attacks?  Okay.  I'll explain it to you:
      </p>
      <p>
       People are killed in false flag attacks so that TPTB (the powers that be) can scare the shit out of the masses and cause the citizenry to agree with whatever "solution" TPTB respond to that false flag attack with (usually something the citizenry would otherwise
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       have agreed with).

       No, as I've explained already, the claim by the coroner about pictures came way before the bodies were even in the morgue. As I understand, many were just too gory to show in person, but we,  along with 4 other couples i know of went to the morgue. And now people are saying no one got killed there, that it was a stage show...? Wtf?

       There's a school in the same district here which was planning to be (and eventually was) demolished.  They're about  2/3 of a mile away from each other, so think you may have gotten confused by this.

       But either way, why would the government hoax something like that, if everyone in the area knows it was an abandoned building?

       So no one was killed? My wife and I had to go to the morgue to ID the body (it was my stepdaughter ). Are you telling me that what I saw was a highly sophisticated mannequin?! Then where the fuck is my stepdaughter if she wasn't killed???!!

I'm a millionaire and doctors hate me for my 9 inch cock.... Lying is easy on the internet! Here is another one, Putin loves cats and hates dogs because he was bit by one when he was a kid.

       If you are telling the truth, why do you feel the need to prove anything to us and if you've already accepted the official story as the truth, why would you come back around to open the coffin again? Makes no sense unless you feel uncertain about the official story now?

       Because it boggles my mind that you approached this in the way that you did and I was really curious about why you would want to do this. It would be different, if you didn't say you were connected to it and asked for answers, but now you're getting energy directed right at you because you say that you are. And it's not like there isn't already tons of resources out there about why people believe that the official story is a lie. I find it hard to believe that you don't already know the answers that we would give you. I thought maybe if you were telling the truth, then it would be possible that you are doubting the official story now, but that's not even the case.

       Hang on a second, I think rather than accuse this person of lying. Let's give them the benefit of the doubt. We don't know for certain that there wasn't a double-blind going on here. In other words, perhaps there was a real shooting, but everything that was reported was fake.

       Give us a break from your sob story that has no evidence.  Your complaining to anonymous skeptics, saying your stepdaughter was massacred, and that you IDed her "mannequin" body. Either your a troll loser, or a sadistic loser who needs to divert his attention elsewhere, because your making a fool out of yourself.

       Just to ELI5 OP, for example, the police dispatch phonetics on the "official" 911 tapes were such that they pronounced the
       <em>
        letters
       </em>
       of "Adam's" car and other IDs, and didn't use the proper protocol by using
       <em>
        words
       </em>
       to communicate the letter sequences (ie, Charles-Tango-Victor for CTV).

       No, I mean my stepdaughter was murdered there. And 2 days later we had to go to the morgue and ID her. And I know of 4 other couples who did the same. Most were thru photos tho.

       Checked in? What does that mean.  And I lost someone close to me in that shooting. And yes, we had to go to the morgue and identify.  So you're telling me that this person is still alive, and body in the morgue was  the most spectacularly realistic mannequin that anyanyone has ever seen????  OK....

       False. The Coroner/official heading the incident, said the family "confirmed" by photographs. They never went to see the bodies (according to him). If my child died in such a tragic incident, I would not accept only photographs. You'd have to fight me from getting into the coroner room where my child was. If the police had to taser me, so fucking be it. I'm getting in to see my child....

       Hang on a second, I think rather than accuse this person of lying. Let's give them the benefit of the doubt. We don't know for certain that there wasn't a double-blind going on here. In other words, perhaps there was a real shooting, but everything that was reported was fake.

       I believe there was a shooting, but I also believe that there was coverup after coverup going on there. I also think the only way we'll ever find out is via the parents pushing on the government (local and federal), when they are able.

       There are no photos or video of "Adam" in the school or outside the school - nothing. Even though new surveillance systems were recently installed at the school (which was promptly demolished to dust). The supposed only witness of "Adam" at the school was "Rick Thorne". He has since vanished from your matrix - and cannot be verified to even exist as flesh and blood. You good with all that? (serious)

       Zero evidence is enough for you to believe what former CIA agent Anderson Cooper tells you on the communist cable channel? Answer me this. Why would anyone think it's
       <em>
        real
       </em>

       Not all schools have streaming recording videos in every corner. Also, they didn't release all the footage, so how do u know what's on them all?
      </p>
      <p>
       Never head of Rick thorne, but so what he's a nutjob. Every tragedy has at least one person who tries to get involved cuz they're attention seekers. Happened during 9-11, WW2, the gulf war, etc etc. So because there were some wackos involved, then those things never happened either...?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have cable, sorry. I'm too busy of a person to need it, so I haven't been 'fed lies'.  However, I know who Anderson Cooper is, and just tried researching him more in depth, but (other than the fact he's a Vanderbilt, among the richest families in the world) there's nothing about him being ex CIA or any other org. Please show me your proof of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would anyone think its real? What are u asking me for? Proof that there are wacky psychos who have access to guns? We know there are. 
Why do u believe it was faked? What endgame?

       It doesn't matter if Anderson Cooper worked for the C.I.A. or not, your not answering any of the simple questions here and you just expect us to believe you while you accuse us of being insensitive to your loss. We want to get to the bottom of this as much as anyone, we're not denying it because we're jerks. We're denying it because the media reporting of the incident is very suspicious.

       Hate to say it, but...dude, have you read a news article recently? Media outlet A doesn't know their ass from a hole in the ground and then Media outlets B, C, and D cut and paste Media Outlet A's asshole in the ground in a bunch of ensuing articles. It's madness. Nothing but lies and mistakes and bullshit peddled by "anonymous law enforcement sources talking out their asses" in the days after any major news story (check San Bernadino for a complete self-contradictory shitshow) and they rarely go back and correct themselves. It's embarrassing.

       The school that was shot up (and I know because a bunch of the families were there as they were figuring it all out, and it was taped off, etc) was Sandy hook elementary school. Which is a real working, not going to be demolished, school.

       Bro, there's
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       footage. There were zero ambulances or air-lift on scene. There were FOIA requests BLOCKED that were simply looking for death verification. The FBI murder/fatality database clearly cites a number of deaths in that region in year 2013 to be way less than 26 (like 1 or 2). Mortgage records of the victims are fucked beyond words. The medical examiner is gone. The school is gone. Dawn Lafferty is still alive and working nearby. You have been hoodwinked, my friend, and probably experiencing a hefty measure of cognitive dissonance - no worries. It happened to me too. This is not the America you know.

       In keeping up with being the researchers that we are. I did some digging. The name associated with the phone number you provided is female. And not a female name associated with any of the victims of Sandy Hook. Now maybe your step daughter kept her fathers name. But why when i search the name associated with the the number you claimed was yours does she not exist either. Are you a low level disinfo provider? Maybe trying to raise money for injured rats. I get it we all have bills to pay. But to come here and make the claims you do without anything to back it up is bullshit. What are you trying to accomplish?

       You did. i went digging looking for any references to media or magazines in your history. I was wrong though. after I posted this message I went back to check the number and it came up that it is your business number. Not very active on fb anymore. I cannot release personal info on here so I will respect that. But does it sound familiar E?

       The one offered to someone to contact you anytime that comes up with a new haven area code. registered to a lady in new haven. Yet upon second search it comes with an animal rescue. Something you speak a lot about in your comments. Building wheelchairs for kittens and mice and shit. Or is this whole account your BS account where you hate peta, love music and animals and troll this sub? The number shared came with your name and said for the person you publicly shared it with to save for future use. So I did, for future research. If you are  the link that can show that Sandy hook was not a lie..I want to know so i do not waste my time here and can focus on other false flags.

       So you are a married man, who does not use media or magazines. Maybe your sister lives with you, so that may explain shared account but why? Is your wife happy to have your sister living with you. Or is your marriage falling part so you have to go to her house to come to visit reddit. i find it interesting that you do not use all these types of media and social networks yet you come to reddit. An what is has to do is I was doing my research, just i have done on the evidence that we have been lied to with Sandy Hook. I told you..we are hunters and when we see a hole we look for the rabbit.

       It is plausible.  But I am not buying it. What is XD?  "But Reddit is the only one I have an account on."
     So this is your account? An I understand what huge means without the extra u's. An you still have not given proof of your initial claim. I have insomnia and do this all night. Your family must share a lot since E than gets to use your step sisters account too. Why would she put his name with the number associated with that business name. Maybe you and your wife can offer her some money to get a real website for her animal wheelchairs. All the families involved got a nice payout from the government. Did yall waste that at Foxwood's.

       The website is bullshit and poorly done. do your sister a favor and help the business and animals..there are rats who need wheelchairs. You are a former lawyer right? You know the importance of evidence right? Or were you a defense attorney and work on making shit up to muddy the waters and get your client off? This all falls into place because you are here trying to make a claim you cannot back up. I am starting to think you are the little girl who has the rat wheelchair business.

       That is why I used the name in the open. it is no longer doxxing. You are the woman associated with the account. Men do not use XD whatever that shit is and they do not end sentences with smiley faces. You are still avoiding the question being asked here by everyone.  What is your proof you are the steppappy to one of the dead children? What did yall do with the 280k initial payout for? Or any of the other money made from having a child killed for an agenda.

       Look,. 1)what type of evidence show show that she is dead? I didn't take pics of after she died.   2) after taxes and shit we didnt get anywhere near 280k. But that's not  the point. Money comes and goes. My stepdaughter wont come back.   _3) what was agenda??. No one can answer that.....

       Do you have anyway to prove you are a stepfather of a young girl killed at SH? Again you could be the missing link that proves something actually happened. Instead you are here making claims you cannot back up. Does you stepsis date Ethan? why would he share his name and phone number on her account that you use as well? I am asking what is YOUR agenda? What do you think you are accomplishing making claims you cannot back up, when 99% of the people here have evidence to back their claims no one died.

       My theory is that it helps the pharmaceutical companies and the school system; that there's "black PR" happening, cynically pushing hoax theories to discredit anyone actually wanting to investigate the whys and hows of the tragedy.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were several warning signs and other issues related to Lanza before the shooting. There are family members pushing to get Lanza's autopsy and further information and are being stonewalled.
      </p>
      <p>
       And right now, if you go to question anything about Sandy Hook or ask for any detail about what happened (or, hey, why the Assistant AG said they wouldn't release what Lanza was taking because "It might cause a lot of people to stop taking their medications"), you get lumped into this batshit "it was all a hoax" disinformation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's really convenient. I don't think everyone who runs around screaming about it being a hoax is a pharmaceutical PR drone, but you only need one or two before other people run with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, if you are actually related to a victim and not just making it up to incite a bunch of bullshit on this sub, I extend my condolences. If you could, being close to the tragedy, please take it upon yourself to fight for answers that would help keep this from happening again (and similar events happen every day in this country, so any effort to discover and to educate will save lives, IMHO), the country (and I, personally) would appreciate it.

       Not surprising. I typically get attacked out of left field when I talk about medications dosage issues/withdrawal involvement in mass shootings, and virulently attacked when I talk about the hoax disinfo being spread to impede any real investigation into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't get it, kids are being killed every freaking day in this country and there are loads of people who know why, and no one will do anything. I am certain the President knows. I KNOW Congress knows. Yet they sit on their hands and babble on about guns (if it's not a gun, it's knives or drowning or cars driven through crowds - and anyway, people will get guns if they want them no matter what), but nothing, nothing will they do about the meds or even educating people about their dangers (if people knew quitting cold turkey could cause them to murder their own families, maybe they'd talk to a doctor first and find a safe way to taper down, right? Maybe they'd realize the dark thoughts and paranoia they're experiencing is a drug side effect - not themselves - not a "gangstalker" - but a drug side effect that is not their fault and they'd stop and get help before they did something evil). Maybe, if we could talk about it, if we were allowed to talk about it, we could find a way to fix it. To at least reduce the number of murders and suicides.

       Give us a break from your sob story that has no evidence.  Your complaining to anonymous skeptics, saying your stepdaughter was massacred, and that you IDed her "mannequin" body. Either your a troll loser, or a sadistic loser who needs to divert his attention elsewhere, because your making a fool out of yourself.
