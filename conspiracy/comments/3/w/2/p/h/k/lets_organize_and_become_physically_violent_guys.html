<p>Unfortunately you right.  But I don&#39;t think we&#39;re ready for an uprising.  It&#39;s my understanding that all violent revolutions were spiked by a new idea.  Not just knowing what needs to be changed and why.  That is where we are at right now.  People are becoming more aware of what is wrong, but if we strike now then what.  Some new boss steps in same as the old one.  As soon as we can all agree on what should come next, then uprising is really the only way we can move away from the current systems.  That sucks, but let&#39;s not jump the gun.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>Si vis pacem, para bellum.</em></p>

<p>If you seek peace, prepare for war.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right, in that anyone calling for open conflict at the moment is likely a plant, fed, cop, admin, or shill. To put it another way, <em>it&#39;s a trap.</em> However, do not discount either the potential or usefulness of armed rebellion.</p>

<p>You see, the argument you put forth is a trap in and of itself, just as bad as jumping the gun.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lay down arms, don&#39;t resist, just sit and &#39;spread the word&#39; while otherwise doing nothing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem with doing this is that, when and if the time comes to actually <em>take action</em>, we will be unprepared and out of place to do so. After all, </p>

<p><em>Those who hammer their guns into plows will plow for those who do not.</em></p>

<p>So, the best solution here is to find a balance, using your common sense. I realize that&#39;s almost an oxymoron, that if it were truly <em>common</em> it wouldn&#39;t be <em>called</em> &quot;common sense,&quot; but at least try. Prepare for when SHTF <em>within reason</em>, be ready, expect it to come--and if it does not, you&#39;ve got nothing to worry about. If it does, you&#39;re as ready as you can be. But don&#39;t jump at the first sign of some idiot on the internet saying &#39;time for revolution, guys.&#39;</p>

<p>Agree with 10% of the global middle class to not consume anymore than what is needed for housing, food and recreational drugs (so that you don&#39;t die of boredom if you can&#39;t do sports or hike in the woods). Agree on doing nothing for years. Watch the international banking cartel, insurance, JIT-crap-conveyor-belt, Trucking and everything else crunch beyond repair. </p>

<p>Switch then demand to sensible production. </p>

<p>Enjoy a new world without violent revolution. </p>
