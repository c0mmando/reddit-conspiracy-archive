       Its clear to everyone that Trumps role is not to become president of the US. There are many theories as to why he is running for president.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we take the stance that politics and governance in the US is a theatre for the masses. That there is in fact no real choice or democracy. Then ask yourself what is Trumps role?
      </p>
      <p>
       The media has been demonising Muslims and South Americans for decades now. Fear is running through the masses. The population has been normalised to love the military. Government is centralising power, eroding peoples rights and privacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now Trump steps in as a fringe political leader and vocalises what the media has been propagating for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trumps role isnt to become president but to widen the political frame, discourse and debate on the topics the media has been propagating for decades that mainstream politicians cannot touch. He is to make a political space for a future leader who can mobilise a growingly poor, fearful population and disfranchised section of society.
      </p>
      <p>
       We might dismiss him and his supporters today but in a future where the US hits a major economic crash. If poverty starts to hit the majority of US citizens. If you have nothing left to lose and are afraid for the future of your family then what happens when a leader emerges with his kind of rhetoric and policies?

       Got my own theory about DT. It goes like this. Clinton is the designated winner amongst the power elite. One quick look at her list of corporate power sponsors should tell you everything you need to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sanders is there to provide the illusion of competition for the Democratic nomination. People like him, but without the backing of TPTB he simply has no chance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's where Trump comes in. He's running a joke campaign. This is why he gets to say whatever crazy shit and he stays in the lead for the GOP nomination. Trump's job is to provide the illusion of choice in 2016.
      </p>
      <p>
       He keeps saying "he can't be bought". But I find that someone who really can't be bought doesn't have to keep on saying it over and over again. My guess is that Trump is no different than any other candidate. He sold out for power and fame a long time ago. It's no secret that him and the Clintons are all buddy buddy with each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       So he's running for President mainly as an ego boost. It won't matter if either he or Clinton wins. Either one will make one of the worst Presidents the USA has ever had.

       Along similar lines, if someone has to tell you they can't be bought... they probably can.

       If someone is defending an accusation that they are corrupt by saying they can't be bought, they probably can and are in the process of being bought.  But Trump is accusing his opponents of being bought off now or in the future.  It's a different scenario I think.

       I think you are absolutely correct. His positioning is so extreme that others can take some "middle ground" and look reasonable. Even Darth Vader Cheney can now say "this goes too far" : just kill Muslims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's chief "Islam adviser" is neo-con Jew Frank Gaffney from the Center for Security Policy (CSP), a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, which promotes Zio hawkish foreign policy views, particularly in the Middle East; advocates for higher levels of defense spending; and warns about the infiltration of the U.S. government by the Muslim Brotherhood.

       Yep. Read Jacques Ellul's Propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now everybody out there is saying "Definitely DONT ban Muslims from the US, never ever." Which only amplifies it and turns it into a "debate" that "intelligent" Americans should have because it's "out there" and "people are talking about it." Wait a few years, then people will ask, "What options do we have? Well, i guess there was that completely abhorrent option--has the situation changed? maybe we should reconsider it."

       You're a little late.

       The last president made it a requirement that you pay money to a crony corporation for the right to
       <em>
        exist,
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        now

       you're worried about fascism?  Oh please-- I hope the whole fascism thing comes stomping down on the "gimme free stuff" people who only worry about fascism when it might be their free stuff that gets threatened.

       Trump already has a comfortable life, he doesn't
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       want to be President, because being President is a really hard, stressful job with long days of frustration and compromise. when you are President you really can't do and say whatever you want. This why he really does not want to be The President of the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump wants the exposure of being a candidate where he can say whatever he wants, stroke his ego by reading about himself and watching himself on TV. I also think his outlandish policies serve to pave the way for more subtle and palatable xenophobic set of fascist policies, "proper" policies that Republicans in congress can enact in secret, as a rider or amendment to a  bill. Policies that are just slightly less fascist than what Trump says in public. A more reasonable fascism, if you will.

        Trump already has a comfortable life, he doesn't really want to be President

      <p>
       I hear you, and that makes sense on some level, but I believe Trump would love nothing more than to be president as would just about anyone else on this planet given the chance. He will be even more comfortable once he's the boss.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        when you are President you really can't do and say whatever you want

      <p>
       I think that Bush and Obama have now laid the framework in terms of flaunting laws and doing whatever they want, the Empire is going into it's final phases and someone like Trump will catalyse and accelerate that free fall by ushering in full Fascism made possible by fiat currency, a military gone wild and a people scared and stressed out of their witts.

       never paid much attention to him, but i find the longer he's in the campaign the more "crazed" he seems. he doesn't need to do commercials because he's getting free time whenever he gives a 'speech', that's very troubling;
       <em>
        as if
       </em>
       MSM doesn't want people to miss any of his rant.
      </p>
      <p>
       have to agree with you, i didn't expect him to act like this, hard to know if he's putting on an act or if he's being truthful -- doesn't matter now.

       Agreed.   And also looking at all the other candidates, they have completely prepped us for a much more authoritarian president.   Yes , even sanders.   No matter what, the iron grip will tighten.   They tell us we are a beacon of freedom.  We are actually the Empire

       Man not there at all.  Trump's success seems like media narrative and control breaking down more than anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not like he's going to blow the great conspiracy wide open or whatever.  He's clearly in it for himself.  I think he's just playing the game by rules no one ever thought existed.

       so much as questions the San Bernardino shootings.  So when Trump says "fuck this shit, no more Muslims until we can properly screen out the terrorists" he staking out ground conventional even conspiratorial wisdom thought impossible.  But I think it's actual ground and everyone is just wrong again.  I think Trump has tremendous intuition about human psychology and is schooling everyone.

       this is all clinton politics 101.  we have seen this before back when bill got elected.  they push a no chance republican candidate (last time it was ross perot) who takes just enough republican votes so that the democrat can win.  history is repeating itself.

       Trump is a nationalist. He wants the United States to be strong and free, and to retain its unique qualities as a nation. He's not going to try to save the world, he's going to try to save America. He doesn't believe that power should be held by appointed officials in Europe, he believes that the people of America should hold the power in America.

       The far-left whackos, shattered by the abject failure of their policies, are becoming increasingly unhinged now that people are waking up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe, that more than anything, people are enjoying the huge thumb Trump is jamming in the eye of the lunatic left.  On some level, I think most know that much of what Trump says isn't feasable, but it has served to expose the left's hateful idiocy.  Then, there is the realization that even if Trump were elected, the result couldn't possibly be worse than what we've experienced in government the last 15 years.

       Trump is for the patriot act, censoring the Internet, the MIC and government health care.  He thinks Snowden is a traitor.  He's anti immigrant and his selling points are fear and intimidation.  He also uses a 4th grade vocabulary so his supporters can understand him.

       The Higherside Chats. Its a conspiracy podcast. Fringey supernatural stuff but its a solid show and the host is a good person. Hadibov is some scifi-esque russian researcher that uncovered the true nature of our reality. Spoiler ancient alien spider beings mind control us all the sun and the moon are control bases. I dont subscribe to 90% of the shit on THC but I am supporter of the podcast because Greg is a super cool dude and is sceptical yet open to learning anything and everything.

       Ecer since r conspiracy has gotten so popular for general news all the controlling shills from news and politics have started coming over here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Theyused to ignore it becuase it was small but now there are more readers actually online in r conspiracy than in some bigger default subreds.

       This is truth.  The slack-jawed crew from
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics

       was happy to ignore this forum until it gained in popularity.  Then they searched for ways to exploit it, thus the change in the sub this last six month.
