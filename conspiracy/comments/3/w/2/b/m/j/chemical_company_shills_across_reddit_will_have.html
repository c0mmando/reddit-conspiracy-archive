          WASHINGTON -- A group of scientists at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday sent a letter to President-elect Barack Obama's transition team pleading with him to restructure the agency, saying managers have ordered, intimidated and coerced scientists to manipulate data in violation of the law.

          “Much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue. Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness. As one participant put it, “poor methods get results”.

         <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/jan/15/drug-companies-doctorsa-story-of-corruption/">
          “It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of The New England Journal of Medicine.”

         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_misconduct">
          In many scientific fields, results are often difficult to reproduce accurately, being obscured by noise, artifacts, and other extraneous data. That means that even if a scientist does falsify data, they can expect to get away with it – or at least claim innocence if their results conflict with others in the same field. There are no "scientific police" who are trained to fight scientific crimes; all investigations are made by experts in science but amateurs in dealing with criminals. It is relatively easy to cheat although difficult to know exactly how many scientists fabricate data.

          It took six years to get federal worker safety officials to issue warnings to auto mechanics that the brakes they're working on could contain lethal asbestos fibers. But it took only three weeks after the warnings were posted before a former top federal official with ties to the auto industry reportedly pushed to have them removed. John Henshaw, a former head of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, called Aug. 15 for the agency to make changes to its warnings, according to documents obtained by The Sun.

          A systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that around 2% of scientists admit to have falsified research at least once (1). Up to 33% admit other questionable practices such as plagiarism, duplicate publication, undisclosed changes in pre-research protocols or dubious ethical behavior (1). There can be no doubt that discovered cases of research and publication misconduct represent a tip of an iceberg and many cases go unreported (2).

          In a recent interview on C–SPAN's "Newsmakers" program, NIH Director Francis Collins announced that the agency would issue a "proposed rule" early this year that will require pharmaceutical companies to publicly disclose financial relationships with NIH-funded scientists. "I was shocked by that revelation—that people would allow their names to be used on articles they did not write, that were written for them, particularly by companies that have something to gain by the way the data is presented…. If we want to have the integrity of science preserved, that's not the way to do it," Collins said in the December 21 interview.

          It’s not news that drug companies have hired medical ghostwriters to assist physicians and scientists in preparing articles for medical journals. And we know that this practice became endemic and sometimes far overstepped any reasonable boundaries. There have been cases where researchers were given fully completed articles and asked if they wanted to sign their names to them.

       Corruption in research science is getting worse. The standards that were maintained by the great institutions of the West have fallen by the wayside. AGW is just one of the more obvious areas where science is not being done properly.

       How much fraud and bad science is there on the part of chemical companies?  Good lord.  I'll just show one very quick example.  The New York State Department of Environmental Conversation is one of the few regulatory agencies that actually do their job.  When Zenivex (Etofeneprox) manufacturers were trying to get it approved there, they submitted various information.  In short, NYSEC didn't buy it and it was banned there.  From the fuck you letter:
       <a href="http://pmep.cce.cornell.edu/profiles/insect-mite/ddt-famphur/ethofenprox/etofenprox_wth_0315.pdf">
        http://pmep.cce.cornell.edu/profiles/insect-mite/ddt-famphur/ethofenprox/etofenprox_wth_0315.pdf
       </a>
       on page 7:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "The stated results of the 42-day study are problematic. Having a LOEC (Lowest Observable Effect Concentration) that equals roughly 1.7X the LC50 for the same endpoints, survival growth, and reproduction,
        <strong>
         is irrational
        </strong>
        . "
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yes, the studies by these companies are SO BAD that their results are literally irrational.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, Zenivex has been approved in most other states and is now widely sprayed over populous areas for mosquito control.

       I'd add in any well-sourced articles describing science fraud from any side. I actually looked for a decent source showing fraud coming from global warming scientists, but nothing that would fit into my post. If you have anything, please share. I just don't want to ruin the credibility of the rest of my sources by associating them with a conspiracy blog.
