<p>I started off doing Adderall when I was 19, I would stay up for nights on end devouring books, news and documentaries, in a way it was the catalyst to my interest in conspiracies amongst other subjects. But harder drugs inevitably came along, and I feel in over my head</p>

<p>Deep down I know I use cause I feel isolated and unfulfilled, but I haven&#39;t been able to make sobriety seem worthwhile to myself, just wondering if anyone can relate or has any suggestions</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard cause you can&#39;t just say all of a sudden, &quot;I quit, I&#39;m not addicted&quot; those words are meaningless because without positive substitute activities to fill your time you remain trapped in that same routine or sleeping all day. </p>

<p>If I may...</p>

<p>Many of our problems (including addictions) stem from 2 things (out of many)...</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Our inability to accept things the way they are, right now.  </p></li>
<li><p>In the (loosely paraphrased) words of Gabor Mate, &quot;you&#39;re not an addict, you&#39;re sad.  Let&#39;s figure out why you&#39;re sad, and address that...&quot;.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Do a few magic mushroom sessions and think about the drugs and how they affect your mind and body. I will suggest exercise and a healthy diet. </p>

<p>Also it may help if you think of &quot;you&quot; as simply the present you, not the future or past &quot;you.&quot; Your entire body is replaced by other cells every few years, so you are literally a new human being with different thoughts, beliefs, etc. You want to be nice to others, so be nice to that future &quot;you&quot; by taking care of your current body. Imagine if your past self was a nice guy and took care of his body. What an asshole he was. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t really have a physical addiction to them. Psychologically you may want to do them more often after trying them because they are a really cool drug. </p>

<p>If you&#39;ve never tried them, you should try to understand that tripping on mushrooms, or acid, or any psychedelic, is a pretty consuming experience. You trip for about 7-12 hours on average depending on the drug and the dose. Your brain is in overdrive and you feel all kinds of emotions and think about so much more than you normally would. Physically you might sweat, pace around from the energy, feel restless to the point you can&#39;t sit or lay still. 
By the end of your trip your body and mind are exhausted. 
Afterwards you take a while to regroup and reflect on your trip. Most people I know trip maybe once or twice a year. You want at least two weeks between sessions. Even if you tried to trip sooner you wouldn&#39;t get the same effect and you&#39;d be wasting the drug. 
It&#39;s hard to abuse these types of drugs in terms of frequency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My advice as an opiate addict in recovery (clean 2 years) stop now.... Using once or twice a week, it is all mental you most likely very little or no physical withdrawl symptoms. I know you say it&#39;s not that simple but with no physical dependency is all comes down to your decision....I would get literally sick without painkillers and even then it still came down to me saying &quot;that&#39;s enough, I&#39;m done&quot;</p>

<p>I know it&#39;s not what you want to hear but it is all you. Even with the mental complex that comes with addiction, my decision was what it really took to stop. If you&#39;re not ready, i don&#39;t judge you. There are days I think its be more comfortable going back to drugs, because life sucks and I don&#39;t like facing our tucked up world sober.... I&#39;d rather be numb, poor and not think about it....but seriously, especially being a moderate user, it&#39;s all on you,</p>

<p>You really hit the nail on the head man. If I could just learn to appreciate how and why life would be so much better without drugs I&#39;d be golden but I suppose that&#39;s something that takes some people alot of time and self reflection to figure out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me personally, life is definitely better with drugs but a point comes when you need more and more drugs and your life ends being worse with drugs.... If it just stayed how it was for the first year of using, there would be no reason to stop. Idk what to tell you man... It&#39;s your choice and I&#39;ll warn you, it won&#39;t always feel good, eventually all it will do I is make you feel normal. I recommend stopping now. Like I said though, your choice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could try hiking if your in a region of the country that has trails through a national park or similar. </p>

<p>It would help you use your energy on something really healthy and fun instead of destroying brain cells. Hikers are usually some pretty cool people and there are hiking clubs all over the place. </p>

<p>I know nicotine addiction very well. I quit a 20 year habit 4 years ago. Exercise and staying busy keeping your mind occupied on something healthy. Find a hobby you would enjoy. If you haven&#39;t become introverted, get the fuck away from those people that connect you to meth. Meet new people or just hang with people that don&#39;t do that shit. </p>

<p>I wish you the best of luck man. My first wife unbelievably became addicted to meth through some douche bag she worked with. It permanently changed her personality from easy going, laid back, all natural hippy chick kind of girl to a hard faced, foul mouthed biker type personality. It destroyed the marriage. </p>
