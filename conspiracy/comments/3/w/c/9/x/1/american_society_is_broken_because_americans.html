       Have you ever noticed how you're allowed to have opinions about anything, as long as it's not something important? You can argue about which Lord of the Rings movie is the best, or what sports team should win and why, and everyone plays along and has fun.  But the second you start to talk about anything of actual real importance, many people suddenly clam up and shy away. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because we've been conditioned that we need to have a certain emotional tone at all times when conversing with other humans. Notice how it is
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       okay in our society for you to be openly angry about something? Even if you are 100% correct and
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be angry? Calmness is seen as paired with rationality, which ignores that passion can be rational sometimes. In our society, passion is generally discouraged unless you are profiting someone else. So you are allowed to have passion for your consumerism and for your job. But never for how bad the Fed is, or how we should end all these illegal wars the US keeps starting for profit. You mention those, and 95% of people will instantly be looking to change the subject out of discomfort. If you are overly passionate about these things, it pushes people away very fast. So the only good approach is to be "light" about it, and just mention it in passing or as part of a joke and then move on.
      </p>
      <p>
       You must always pretend to be calm, even if you are not and have no reason to be, or else you are seen as a "paranoid looney" who is "off his rocker" and "needs to calm down" and "could be a threat" so on and so forth. People love to think they're better and more logical than someone who is being emotional, especially if American government/corporate propaganda backs them up on their talking points.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to maintain this required facade of non-anger, people avoid reading and conversing about topics that make them angry, so they better fit in to society. Work gives them enough stress. They want to have friends and succeed in this human world and so on, so they play by society's rules. So they slowly close their mind off to anything controversial to their in-group. They deaden themselves to the ugly realities of the world, day after day. They see everyone around them doing it too, they see the consequences play out for people who got angry for a bit and said something they "shouldn't have". They decide it's the right choice, that being dead inside is what you're "supposed to do" and don't even consider alternatives, especially because those alternatives are very uncomfortable. Once you get to about 30 or 40, you're basically locked in to this mindset forever unless a big life event happens to change your mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why so many Americans are just quiet about all the terrible terrible shit that is happening. They are just keeping their heads down, trying to succeed. Not only financially, but socially too, which demands this calmness, which demands generally avoiding angry topics and not thinking too deeply about them (or else you might get worked up, someone might see/hear you, and that might hurt your social standing or your income).
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of it all, the genuinely important topics are so over-laden with emotion by the media to make conversing about them very difficult. For example, the Zionist sway over the US government is pretty important. But even the word "zionist" is so emotionally charged, people guffaw at the mere mention of the word even though they don't know what it means. Then to top it off, conspiracy forums are filled with hyperbolic garbage like flat earth and cern wormhole portals which they pay to upvote to the top, to discredit the sub and make everyone here look insane. That way people are afraid to come back here after seeing how it looks, and their minds remain closed. They may think it's all just "conspiracy garbage" and throw out the baby with the bathwater.
      </p>
      <p>
       The discourse about truly important topics is so polarized (by design or not) that it's often difficult to talk to your fellow human beings about it in a regular conversation. It only comes out at 3am after a lot of drinks, because we are all terrified of looking bad in each other's eyes, even though we mostly agree with each other! This is the trick played on us, that makes us each our own emotional island. We're scared that everyone is like the media tells us they are, dangerous and judgmental, so we each silently bear this burden of truth in our own minds. Few have the courage to overcome this fear and speak out in real life (or even online) and even fewer can do it in a way that conforms to the social norms of "calmness". George Carlin did it with
       <em>
        humor
       </em>
       , and that's why he is worshiped. The emotional packaging of ideas means a lot in our society, maybe more than the ideas themselves. Having our priories so backwards, placing our emotions first and the truth of reality second, is what is leading to the downfall of our nation. People are literally out of touch with reality, and no one ever "touches" them to bring them back in because generally speaking we're all so scared and offended of each other that we can't connect in a real emotional way anymore. We're each in our own bubbles of denial. So we create our own little echo chambers and cross our fingers that things will work out, which was basically the American mantra starting in the 1970s once our political process started being taken over by corporations. That "eyes wide shut" mentality worked for a few decades, but time is running out for being in denial.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the application of divide and conquer, expressed at its fullest. Emotions are much easier to manipulate than ideas and thoughts. Companies figured this out in the 50s and 60s and advertisements became about manipulating emotions instead of giving you facts about the product. We as Americans need to increase our IQ, but more importantly we need to increase our EQ and stop falling for the constant emotional manipulation coming from the media. And not only do we need to do it, we need to help others do it. It's time we awaken to our control structures, as a society, and be openly conversational about what is happening instead of hiding in the shadows because we're afraid. Only by learning how the control structures work can we learn to overcome them. And only by overcoming the programmed fear can we begin conversations about these things. This attitude needs to become part of our culture before we can really fix anything else. It's the foundation upon which everything else rests. I can't imagine anything more important than this.
      </p>
      <p>
       My worry is that everyone has their head so far in the sand that the only thing that will change the path we're on is a catastrophe that suddenly brings reality in to the limelight. If people
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       tried spreading the word as much as possible we might be able to wake up before the next catastrophe, but seeing as reality got hung to cheers at the end of that recent South Park episode and how accurate that feels, I don't know how much hope I really have.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       However, it's not all or nothing. A war may be coming further down the road, but the intensity of the war may be able to be mitigated for people who don't deserve to be entangled in it. It's a matter of degree. Perhaps one bombing campaign gets cancelled after public outcry about a particular issue. Maybe caused by a small handful of people daring enough to speak out and make a bit of a fuss. Perhaps the war doesn't last as long because people are wiser about what causes it and are more able to remove the causes, because they were better informed prior to the war.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in the end, I have come to realize, there are going to be bloodthirsty human beings who want to kill each other. And as long as that is true, there will be wars. I don't really mind if bloodthirsty psychos go kill each other in some remote country, but so many other people get caught up in the fray or tricked in to participating that it becomes a devastating situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I kind of look at it like this, war is the new natural selection since humans have essentially conquered nature. Now our culture does the job. If you join a war, you lose. It's a human garbage disposal of sorts, and everyone knows it on some level. Our culture is not our friend, our culture is an intelligence test, and the more you fail the closer you get pushed in to supporting and fighting wars.
      </p>
      <p>
       What really sucks is the civilians who had nothing to do with it, people who often make up the majority of deaths in wars. These deaths are on all the hands of the people who chose to participate in the war machine, regardless of capacity. Even if someone were just packaging the bolts sold to bomb companies, they are furthering the war machine. People love to pretend they don't have any involvement in the deaths of other people in other countries, when they are quite clearly participating. This is often a result of compartmentalization, they don't tell the bolt guy who the bolts are going to or what product they are used in, and the guy never tries to find out. Do this a million times over and that's how you make a million bombs with only a very few involved truly realizing what they've done. They don't think blood is on their hands, but it is. Ignorance is bliss, eh?
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's important to also remember this culture of pushing people towards war is not merely a mirage created by the "elite". People
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       war, and that's a big reason why it happens. If no one wanted war, it wouldn't happen. If everyone refused to participate, it would never even start. Let the warmongers carry their own rifles. Instead they trick poor people in to doing it for them, by guaranteeing to pay for college, which was made so expensive and necessary in the first place by the actions of those same people. If no one flew the drones, if no one made the bombs, if no one joined the military, wars wouldn't start.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, just remember, being honest with one person about one thing can start a wildfire effect that could end up waking up tons of people. Why not try? You scared?

       Agree, but I've noticed a potential refinement:
      </p>
      <p>
       Categorize emotion into 2 categories:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Constructive emotion, aka passion
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Non-constructive emotion, aka raw emotion
      </p>
      <p>
       Passion fuels societal change, creation, and progress.  Raw emotion is just raw emotion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice too that not
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       emotion is discouraged.  Women and children are allowed to be sad, to cry, to display raw emotion.  It is often encouraged, it's certainly supported.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just the constructive emotion that we've conditioned to be fearful of and resist,
       <em>
        especially
       </em>
       as it relates to meaningful societal change.  It's ok to be passionate about, say, your favorite football team.  It's not ok to be passionate about economic reform.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can immediately see why this would be the case...

       People DO argue about important things, but they base their conclusions on emotions over logic.  It's very difficult to be open minded.  That's true for conspiracy theorists too.

       Excellent post.  There's an unofficial disorder called Pragmatophobia. A fear of an immutable reality. I have a suspicion that a very great number of people in Western civilization suffer from it. From the Bible-thumpers screaming about invisible sky-people and Jesus riding a raptor, to the "Bruce Jenner is a woman" Social Justice Warriors and many many groups in between. I think the enormous sense of entitlement we have today has given us license to take reality as just another optional choice. To quote Ayn Rand; You can avoid reality but you cannot avoid the consequences of avoiding reality".

       When reading about this I came across this other word "symbolomania" -- An excessive use of symbols or having symbolical meanings attached to one's acts or words.
      </p>
      <p>
       Magick is an example.  Rites, rituals... as in
       <em>
        religion
       </em>
       , masonic traditions, etc.  And in politics / political framing, and certainly,
       <em>
        certainly
       </em>
       in advertising and logos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Symbolomania is a description of an activity employed very often among both conspiracy theorists in unraveling world events--specifically wrt occultism+semiotics=

       --but then again also employed obviously by secret societies.  But no, those two are completely unrelated (/s), esp to the  symbolically illiterate, 'pragmatophobic', lumpen masses.

       Thank you for taking the time to write this. Growing up, I was nicknamed "Mr. Intensity" because, well, the name speaks for itself. I'm incredibly passionate about everything I do, and am obsessive-compulsive nearly to a fault.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet despite excelling in my early school years and having a knack for picking up on things, my intensity and fervor for things was met with much discomfort and laughter, ostracizing me from the vast majority of my peers. This led me to doubt my instincts, lose self-confidence, and think something might be wrong with me. Granted, I had a severe concussion when I was 6. But was I really all that far out there, or has everyone else been pacified to the point that someone who shows such an interest in intellectual debates and challenges society's norm that they feel threatened? Threatened by the fact that there is someone who doesn't care enough about how they are viewed to embrace the power of the mind they were gifted with, which they know in their subconscious is something they are intentionally suppressing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of my complete disregard for what was "accepted" behavior in the awful wealthy school district I ended up in, I often drew the ire of people - not because I was ugly, or unathletic, or stupid, but because I was willing to step outside the box and ignore people who didn't matter to me. People don't like this. I didn't want anything to do with people's emotional and personal lives, and thus must not be suitable for a high position in society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of those wealthy kids have gone on to make a lot more money than me, and that's fine. I avoided a single day of college, am free of debt, and got to spend four extra years of my young adulthood doing what I wanted rather than listening to a lecturer explaining how you should think. I taught myself everything I know and am making a (currently) middle-class wage with a huge company. I think John Mayer has a song about this, haha. But it's extremely vindicating to look back on my time in school and think you know what, I was right - I didn't need that crap, and I really WAS ahead of my age. This has also further legitimized my chase for true knowledge, as any critical thinker can tell the news is obviously at the very least incompetent, and at the very most complicit with a global crime syndicate. So I have no problem challenging someone's beliefs to the point that they shut down, even if it comes at a cost.
      </p>
      <p>
       A small minority of people in this country have ever faced a real crisis and are unable to comprehend experiencing one in our comfortable, secure nation. For them to think it's a possibility they may one day have to release their possessions and fend for themselves, it's too scary of a road to travel down, so they do exactly what you said and look around, see how calm and happy everyone else is, and decide it's the easier way to go about things. But for those of us who give a rat's behind about our social status, it's our responsibility to get people thinking and doubting what they're told. Deep down, most people know there's something nefarious at work, but accepting this as truth brings forth a primal sense of fear that, unless you've overcome it before, is too frightening to accept.

       I think that's a great point. If you come at someone visibly angry or upset, it puts them immediately into a defensive position, and thus more likely to dismiss what you're saying without really trying to understand it. I even notice myself doing this when a person is yelling about something I agree with.

       Contrast Alex Jones and James Corbett. I've shared the latter's videos far more than I would ever consider sharing Jones'.

       I agree equanimity is a great thing to have.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing that helps me is the belief that 99% all over the world are similarly empathetic, rational, helpful, good natured humans that are deserving of love, rights and respect.  And that other 1% are assholes who need a good smiting by the holy light of the Truth.  This is why spreading awareness and building a criminal case against them is important.

       And so if that 1% can't beat us, our will to fight, then the next thing they do is destroy our information and access to the same.  That's what's happening now.  We need to shine a light on that too.

       Imagine if owned slaves in the early 1800s came to you, upset about being owned, and you told them "Don't worry about being slaves, you'll be much healthier and happier if you stop worrying about it and being angry about it."
      </p>
      <p>
       You're right, what you say is obviously true, but it is also keeping the underlying problem from being solved that is causing the worry and anger in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's appropriate to be angry
       <em>
        sometimes
       </em>
       . If you're angry all the time, that's a definite problem, but if you're merely expressing anger at actual injustice when it is contextual, then I see no problem with it. It is stressful, but it can also be useful to relieve the underlying causes of the stress if directed in the appropriate direction. Basically, I think people should say when they are mad and get it out, and then society would be more able to fix itself because it would be more aware of its faults. Instead we just sweep all the faults under the rug and are surprised when they blow up on us from neglect. We could be more pro-active toward fixing society if we had a society that was more tolerant of hearing its own faults.

       The problem, and I think you alluded to this in the post, is that the anger is often directed in the wrong direction. Take 9/11. The American people were filled with anger, rightfully so, and were allowed and encouraged to have that anger. Yet it was directed at the wrong people. Even if you take the official account as 100% true, the anger was used to justify PATRIOT and war in Iraq, neither of which were warranted.
      </p>
      <p>
       To extend your slave analogy, it would be like being angry at the slave in the next state instead of the power structure holding you in chains.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's not so much that we are not socially permitted to be angry, as it is that it is only acceptable to direct that anger toward our so-called enemies: Muslims, Russians, Republicans if you'r a Democrat and vice versa, gays, homophobes, whites, blacks. I see no shortage of anger online (though admittedly less so IRL), but it's usually structured in that divide-and-rule way that it just cancels itself out. Republicans mad at Dems and vice versa, but it just ends with a deadlock and status quo.

       Exactly. Guiding that anger of the public against inappropriate enemies, against scapegoats, is a stunningly common tactic. It's how Hitler was able to get the German public to agreeing to kill the Jews and gays so on. The people were super pissed at the state of the economy, and with good reason, and Hitler was able to capture that anger and redirect it away from the bankers causing it (who happened to be Jewish) and instead redirecting that anger towards the Jewish people en masse.
      </p>
      <p>
       The exact same thing happened with 9/11. America's outrage was expertly redirected toward "Muslims" and Saddam Hussein (who had nothing to do with it). So in 2002, we invaded Iraq and over half a million Iraqis died as a result.

       Just recently, the terrorist attack in Paris was used to justify the French Government bombing Syria.

       <p>
        “Naturally the common people don't want war, neither in Russia, nor in England, nor in America, nor in Germany. That is understood. But after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country.”

       This trick is played over and over and over and over, and we as a species just keep falling for it and falling for it and falling for it. It's kind of ridiculous. But now at least we have the internet to wake the world up to this trick, with posts like ours. That gives me hope. The info is out there now, it's just a matter of spreading it, and the internet makes a great vehicle for that. If everyone knows about the trick, and how it's a trick, no one will fall for it.

       This is a beautiful post and I appreciate you taking the time to write them out. I couldn't agree more and I've shared a similar sentiment concerning our emotional sickness as a culture which discourages impetus unless it is selfish, and encourages greed. Our media plays such a huge part in this, which is why it is important to teach yourself some fundamental psychology, and like you said -- IQ is important but in this day in age, EQ is equally as important, because people will attempt to manipulate you via strawmen that play on your emotions. It's a disgusting game, but it's the way it is done today.

       One thing I have noticed is that we are served up political left/right shooting matches on TV that
       <em>
        seem
       </em>
       to cover important topics, but in fact just treat them superficially and in an emotional (non-rational/non-informative) manner. So we are allowed to get all emotionally worked up, but not in a productive manner that would lead to action. We feel like we are part of an important discussion, but really we are parked in front of the TV, not interacting with anyone. This seems to be one of their tricks.

       I find it to be just cowardice. People are afraid of not comforming. That is why the shills do what they do. They manufacture a false consensus.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are also afraid of authority. This fear usually turns to anger towards the person trying to change their worldview. The shills will also throw lots of vitriol around to give other persons permission to vent their anger and engage their lizard brains.

       Another thought, riffing off your idea that Carlin was able in some way to "get away with" talking about topics most people find uncomfortable, is the use of art, including comedy, music, visual, or other mediums to get the message across. Hip hop particularly has produced a lot of artists willing to speak the truth, and people listen to them. They can be justifiably angry at the system and call it out, and it's acceptable there because of the medium.

       Right on, fantastic observation. I wonder if there are any other arenas beyond rap and stand up comedy where these truths could be said. That's why I like this sub, I guess, is because you can "get away with" saying that kind of stuff here. People are very open minded, and I love it.

       Stand up and hip hop are definitely where I've seen it done the most, I think at least partly because poking fun at and pointing out the foibles of the establishment and society in general played such a large part in the development of each.
      </p>
      <p>
       Documentary and film are possible avenues, but at least feature films require such capital investments upfront that it makes it hard to get a start in those. Oliver Stone has done some pretty good work in the mainstream, but I think it would be a lot harder to start such a career today; the barriers to entry are quite high. There's a number of good youtube docs coming out now, which can be produced decently without any real money.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen some pretty good satirical/political cartoons which have that ability to expose the contradictions inherent in American society quite succinctly and powerfully; they get posted here a good bit. Then you have people like Banksy doing street art. Other than that, though, I feel it's hard for visual art to get a wide audience today, but it always has been like that to an extent.

       All of them? None of them have any justifiable reasons to speak out over injustices or double standards? I'm not saying many feminists don't let emotions get the better of their logic, or that many feminist positions are untenable, but generalizing such a broad and historically diverse movement (actually more of a category of movements) is somewhat falling into the same trap you decry.

       The biggest and easiest to prove wake up call is the flat earth. Once people can get over their knee-jerk reactions to ridiculing the idea or the person trying to explain it to them we might have an honest discussion about it. Once flat earth really sinks in, the anger begins both at oneself for buying such bullshit, then again at the government who purposely and deliberately lie to Kindergarten aged children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat earth knowledge and acceptance of the true reality will break the bondage from this Satanic group that controls the minds of the masses.

       One huge step is turning the TV, off unplugging from the Matrix. It's okay to not be entertained (entrained) 24/7 98% of the news is falsified or doctored anyway. It's okay to sit quietly and contemplate that you are a slave willing or unwilling. Freedom can be had but it must be by facing the truths I have mentioned here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I  see so many damaged fearful minds in my travels, so many conformists that just parrot the news, jokes from the TV, or some bullshit trivia to seem like they are trendy. It is absolutely perfect to not fit into the herd, in fact it is what you were created for, to be a unique person with your own thoughts and ideas, not the collective.

       I watched a lot on flat earth theory and yeah, it's out there. I don't subscribe to a popular religion, so I'm sure it's much harder to convince me to begin with.
      </p>
      <p>
       But can't this be figured out quite easily? I can call my friend in Dubai right now and ask him if the sun is up. And he will say no. So how would that be possible if there was no bend to the earth? I mean, come on. Flat earth material is nothing but a repellent for people trying to seek truth.

       Yes, light experiments have been conducted that don't seem consistent with a round earth. But does it not occur to people that light is also affected by gravity, meaning a straight beam of light projected across the earth's surface would be capable of having a slight curve? This was the case when Chicago's skyline became visible from Michigan due to a unique mix of air and water temperatures. If it was a flat earth, this image would not have appeared upside-down. Plus, I've never seen this photograph taken on any other days - why isn't there more visual evidence of this phenomena from all over the globe? I'll just never buy it.

       Great response. Have you every looked at Saturn or Jupiter through a telescope?

       Edit: I'll take the downvote as a no, but try to find an amateur astronomy club near you. Most will have star parties where members will let the public use their scopes. Generally very friendly and encouraging people.

       You are assuming through CGI images provided by NASA that planets are A like earth, B spherical. I own a telescope and I have yet to see anything but a round light in the sky when looking at them, I see no spherical qualities. You assume first we are on a sphere due to severe and sinister teaching you received in your government funded school. You also assume due to shows like the Universe that space is some endless explosion with many more planets and "suns". Stars are not suns, the sun is a luminary as is the moon and all "planets" and stars are the same. There is a dome like object above us which is extremely simple to see if you go out and look up at the stars at night.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not a bible dude or any religion, I was atheist up until 3 years ago. I'm a science based person and was absolutely amazed and loved the old universal model we were taught because well, it raised so many questions that kept me up pondering throughout my life. However once I started to distrust information from the people who steal half my paycheck, I started looking at everything with a wipe the old model and start fresh and ONLY be concerned with what is true no matter how ugly it was.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I go to the beach with my telescope no matter how many miles away the ships are it is always flat no curve. When I travel the horizon always raises to my eye level even 8 miles up, the same is true when they send balloons up 20 miles. No curve no ball. The horizon would lower no matter how big the ball. I never see the curve and use the backs of magazines on airplane windows to validate the flatness. I  have yet to find the curve. Using spherical trigonometry and using the information they state 24,000 circumference there would be considerable curve everywhere but yet no one can find it unless of course they use fisheye lenses and fabricate the curve.
      </p>

       EDIT: Me not understand simple logic ME DOWNVOTE!!! ME like PAYING taxes to (30 billion a year to NASA) people that lie to ME. Me conform nice and good for MASTERSSSSSSSS....

       When we taxi (I plane travel almost weekly for my work) I sit up in a way where I sit fully erect and I mark the horizon line with a pen on the side of the window. When the pilot announces we reach cruising altitude, I sit erect again and the horizon matches the marking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only on a plane will the horizon stay at eye level. You can check art classes or dig into geometry to check this fact (the only math i really enjoyed and excelled at. Concave earth is just another lie in the opposite direction, I went down that rabbit hole too when I first became aware of flat earth.
      </p>

       Thank you for being so patient and inquisitive on this subject, I have come to the conclusion that this is my life's purpose now to spread the knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was so attacked during the start of this I became angry bitter and damn near suicidal. If it were not for my wife and daughter I'm positive I would have eaten a bullet from my .45. I used to be an amiable fun loving social creature that had about 200 people who I would talk to on a regular basis (2-5 a night for hours, like a girl I know) . After trying to help awaken people to this truth I can go a month before hearing my phone ring from a loved one or friend. My brothers and sisters no longer talk to me and all but one coworker have I converted. My best friend the smartest guy I know (partners with one of the creators of MRI) fought vehemently about it for over 4 months before he "got it". I will not waver in my stance as I have committed my life to truth, love and freedom of mankind. I am seeing a trend as the war drums are banging and false flags increasing to daily occurrences that people are starting to question their reality and becoming more willing to listen and for that I'm thankful.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand how painful the realization is as I myself went through it. Feeling like I lived a lie, the thing is I was a science minded know it all that really spent an inordinate amount of time on the big bang universe model. I probably pondered it every night for 3 decades. It's hard to admit that we are wrong,  and even harder when literally your entire worldview must change. I am absolutely thankful though because this knowledge allows me to see through lies and deception more so now than ever before and like the Who stated "we won't be fooled again".
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm speaking from the heart whether you believe me or not I just want you to seriously consider it. All I ask is that once you "get it" that you become brave enough to spread it to others. I feel time is running out as flat earth has spread so much this past year I fear that a huge deception is yet to come and only those who know the truth will make it. I have already accepted my other family members probably won't make it due to their ignoring communication with me . I have made peace with that as I did everything I could, it just really hurts to be so isolated.

       You are just so wrong, it's time to give this up and try to get some of the people who were in your life before you went off the deep end back. Your tiny experiments and observations are nothing. Nobody is going to be talked out of a universal truth because you take your telescope to the beach or look out the window when you fly.

Your "belief" in the scientific authority is your downfall, you are a slave. You are a slave, everyone you know is a slave and due to buying into authority, government, TV, media, books, newspapers. Think for yourself. If you do not think you are a slave you are not thinking properly. You are a part of the hivemind. I have through a very difficult process detached myself from this hivemind. I too was a part of this hivemind as well and I am telling you the truth. It is not a lack of understanding where I am or who I am or my purpose on this plane, it is an overstanding and KNOWING the truth. It is you who either does not know the truth or are perpetuating the lies. Unplug my friend or be a useless slave to a sick system that is filled with mind controllers.

       Why do we pay NASA all that money if there is no space to explore?  Creating CGI pictures and launching fake rockets shouldn't take that much money.  Why does so much money go to them?

       I am not certain we can ever know the real motivation other than hiding the creator? I'm absolutely certain this is spiritual warfare as much as physical, psychological and emotional. Just think if we got all our tax money back for all of the lies. We need to demand reparations. I  know I'm well into 6 figures in taxes that I cannot find the value for my money. I am certain that energy is free too and they hide that from us as well.

       I'm sorry but I'm going to have to disagree that the Canons of Dort are any more Divine Inspiration than the First Council of Nicaea. I think they are human inspired, especially if you are on the side that benefits...its narcissistic in my opinion.

       Thanks. I havn't looked enough into the nukes, but I'm definitely leaning towards them being a hoax. Have you got something good on that for me to look at?

      <p>
       Ofcourse the Holocaust is also a hoax.
      </p>
      <p>
       Major terrorist attacks and shootings are a hoax for pushing war and gun control.
      </p>
      <p>
       People fall for those hoaxes and mourn for the supposed victims, but the real outrage should be at the many real victims of these wars these bastards have unjustly launched in the middle east and elsewhere.

       Besides the manufactured diseases, the poisonous vaccines, and the toxins in the food and environment everything else is basically giving you a brainwashed world view and fear mongering to ultimately bring about a Technocratic 'Scientific' Luciferian Dictatorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end it's about controlling your mind, controlling everything you do, making money money from everything you do, making money from harming your health through diseases etc and ultimately making money from your death through one less carbon emitter on the planet.

       FDR was actually some what right on one thing surprisingly when he said "The Only Thing We Have to Fear Is Fear Itself".

      <p>
       Even Reagan had some gem quotes like "Within the covers of the Bible are the answers for all the problems men face."
      </p>
      <p>
       One last thing. What are your thoughts on chemtrails? I've moved to an unsure position on this, it's something I need to investigate further, but I'm now leaning to this being a psyop within the the truth movement, it just seems like something for people to fear.

       I agree equanimity is a great thing to have.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing that helps me is the belief that 99% all over the world are similarly empathetic, rational, helpful, good natured humans that are deserving of love, rights and respect.  And that other 1% are assholes who need a good smiting by the holy light of the Truth.  This is why spreading awareness and building a criminal case against them is important.
      </p>
      <p>
       And so if that 1% can't beat us, our will to fight, then the next thing they do is destroy our information and access to the same.  That's what's happening now.  We need to shine a light on that too.

       Imagine if owned slaves in the early 1800s came to you, upset about being owned, and you told them "Don't worry about being slaves, you'll be much healthier and happier if you stop worrying about it and being angry about it."
      </p>
      <p>
       You're right, what you say is obviously true, but it is also keeping the underlying problem from being solved that is causing the worry and anger in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's appropriate to be angry
       <em>
        sometimes
       </em>
       . If you're angry all the time, that's a definite problem, but if you're merely expressing anger at actual injustice when it is contextual, then I see no problem with it. It is stressful, but it can also be useful to relieve the underlying causes of the stress if directed in the appropriate direction. Basically, I think people should say when they are mad and get it out, and then society would be more able to fix itself because it would be more aware of its faults. Instead we just sweep all the faults under the rug and are surprised when they blow up on us from neglect. We could be more pro-active toward fixing society if we had a society that was more tolerant of hearing its own faults.
