<li><p>Kubrick was a meticulous filmmaker--I doubt if he would make his last impression in a dark room with his face half-lit while getting semi-sloshed on a glass of whiskey throughout the interview.  Why is Kubrick only shown in close-ups with bad lighting? Why would a filmmaker need anyone to interview him--he could literally just record himself and have the final interview delivered to a trusted media source for distribution?!?</p></li>
<li><p>No actual identification of exact location--there is a car seen driving onto an estate but the front of the house and the interior is never shown.  Interview seems like it was recorded in a dark basement--not in a mansion. Lack of any personal items or even the surroundings is a red flag.</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of evidence being presented by Kubrick:  A director this meticulous would be able to rattle off some specifics of how the moon landing was faked--but no specifics are mentioned beyond what we have seen in other online documentaries.  Very few insider details are given--wouldn&#39;t one expect some funny stories like &quot;they pissed their spacesuits once a week!&quot;???  </p></li>
<li><p>No mention of Vietnam:  In 1969, the country was in chaos--protests, the whacking of RFK and MLK...Kubrick never even mentions any guilt for (if true) what would have been a psy-op to promote nationalism and distract the public from the death and destruction going on in Vietnam and Laos.  </p></li>
<li><p>In the video, &quot;Kubrick&quot; claims to have written the Apollo 11 script. You really think NASA and the US government would let one man write the entire script without any oversight?</p></li>
<li><p>Kubrick does not mention the Final Cut of <em>EYES WIDE SHUT</em> being stolen as it was sent out for prints. If this was his final word--wouldn&#39;t Kubrick mention being forced to cut out parts of the film, too?  </p></li>
<li><p>Vocabulary:  Kubrick was brilliant and very well-read--the &quot;Kubrick&quot; in the interview doesn&#39;t use the proper language. Kubrick said of the novel <em>EYES WIDE SHUT</em>: &quot;A difficult book to describeâ€”what good book isn&#39;t. It explores the sexual ambivalence of a happy marriage and tries to equate the importance of sexual dreams and might-have-beens with reality. All of Schnitzler&#39;s work is psychologically brilliant&quot;. [179] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick</a></p></li>

<p>I watched the 45 minute version on disclose.tv (which gets the Most Annoying Audio Editing Award for a Documentary)...this afternoon I saw the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olg5RovKuF4">2 hour 10 minute version</a> (which was more of a straight interview--but still had some video/audio splices).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I only watched a twenty minute long version, because the 45 minute one was awful.  I also believe it&#39;s fake, and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s Stanley Kubrick.  It looks a little like him, but it doesn&#39;t sound like him.</p>

<p>Also, their is a discussion of Bart Sibrel&#39;s moon documentaries, which were released after Kubrick&#39;s death.  That doesn&#39;t mean Kubrick couldn&#39;t have heard about the doc (I don&#39;t know Sibrel&#39;s timeline for the shooting), but it&#39;s seems unlikely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.  Even if Sibrel took several years to film before his 2001 release, there&#39;s little chance Kubrick would have heard about it.  Especially given his health concerns and his movie work.  They even allude to Sibrel&#39;s physical confrontation with Buzz Aldrin, which happened in 2002.  I think this video is an obvious hoax to smear people.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Caveat: haven&#39;t seem more than a couple clips of this &#39;interview&#39; so far, so can&#39;t comment on any more than that (and what I saw seemed very badly staged and acted). However, what seems oh-so-curious about this is the current use of the Trump scandal to smear opinionated gtoups. The one detail I saw on the news that made me smile was some statistic about &#39;the overlap of Moon Landing deniers with Trump supporters&#39;. Ergo, wackos follow that clown, and are conspiracy nutjobs... Very convenient timing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is so obviously fake that anyone who believes it is a fucking moron, I&#39;m sorry. It looks nothing like Stanley (when did he have that white hair? Look at his DW Griffith Award speech before he died), it sounds nothing like Stanley, he says in the video he&#39;s &quot;nearly 70&quot; when, if this was filmed in 1999, he would&#39;ve been 70 already. He rarely gave interviews, so why would he give one to some pathetic fuck who clearly can&#39;t give interviews. Why the bad lighting, why ANY OF IT?! Stanley Kubrick was an incredibly intelligent man, and if you compared this to his Playboy interview he did in 1968 then you&#39;d know how utterly fake and poor this is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have some serious questions too, mainly because I found a link to this interview at the top of the &quot;New&quot; queue around 1:15pm EST today. I listened to the first part, left home for 5 hours, and I couldn&#39;t find it after I came back. I had even &quot;saved&quot; it under my account, and it&#39;s not there.</p>

<p>When I search either r/conspiracy or the net, what&#39;s replaced it are either shorter versions with just the moon landing part or 30-minute versions with fucked-up audio. With this in mind, I think you might be correct, and even my recounting my experience here is a waste of time. Did you see the version I saw?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kubrick put up with a lot of nonsense that interviewer <em>Scrappy-Doo off his adderall</em> was asking him.  This seems very un-Kubrick-like behavior.  Auteur Kubrick was known in interviews (I&#39;ve heard them) to be somewhat and expectedly arrogant, haughty at times, dismissive and generally someone who didn&#39;t take bullshit from anyone and always got his way.  That&#39;s the only way to be for someone like him.</p>

<p>So yeah, I have to agree with OP, that this video has a lot of problems.  Maybe he was trolling a mentally disabled person who was bothering him (12 letters) and just figured he&#39;d give the guy what he wanted  so he could get left alone.</p>

<p>This would also explain Kubricks tolerance to the guy.  Think about it a director <em>par excellence</em> seeing an alleged documentary person who was 1) a terrible cameraman shaking a handheld, 2) interrupting Kubrick constantly, 3) being a dick, getting in a shouting match and being annoying, 4) not understanding lighting whatsoever (was this even Kubrick or one of Saddam Hussein&#39;s lookalikes?)</p>

<p>The whole thing was fucked up.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imVp8tlecY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imVp8tlecY</a></p>

<p>From 12.45 the interviewer/director clearly coaches &quot;Kubrick&quot; in what to say, because the interviewee/actor hasn&#39;t got his story straight. If you want to believe this is real, you will have to rationalise away the fact that &quot;Kubrick&quot; apparently doesn&#39;t know that Apollo 11 was the first moon landing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re covering this on coast to coast am tonight, Friday.  They&#39;re agreeing it&#39;s fake and there are out takes that have also been released further crediting it was a fake.</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting that they&#39;re saying the out takes were released as an effort to ensure this interview isn&#39;t used to deceive the public any more.  They&#39;re saying the moon landings were absolutely faked and filmed by Kubrick and that this interview was a trap that was set to discredit the truth from coming out.  To discredit Kubrick and the truth hunters.</p>

<p>They&#39;re also saying that Kubrick has info in his will that more info will be coming out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Old film cameras often used film that was 4x5 inches, 8x10 inches, or even larger. And that&#39;s just the negative. The resolution was outstanding. Even better than 35mm film (which is a tiny frame compared to large format). I&#39;m short, old large format photography is often much higher resolution than new digital photography. </p>

<p>I&#39;m no expert on the moon landings, so I won&#39;t begin to debate you on that, but I know a lot about photography and can tell you for a fact that you are way off with that point you tried to make. Way off. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For a variety of reasons, but I have not done any research on this topic as I don&#39;t find it particularly fun or engaging. </p>

<p>One thing I can say is that any photograph you see online is digital. Even if it was originally shot on film, if you&#39;re seeing it online, it has been digitalized. Sometimes this process is done without much regard for preserving the original quality of the image. This could result in lower resolution/smaller size, altered tones, etc. It really is sad to see a good old print made by a master photographer and compare it to the same photograph on Google images. The online versions are often unfaithful to the original and of significantly lower quality. </p>

<p>Regarding this photograph in particular, I don&#39;t know when and how it was originally released. If it was originally released on television, it makes sense that the television versions of the photograph would be sized down and of shitty quality. </p>

<p>You can see this sort of thing when watching some old movies and other films such as musical performances. They were shot on film originally and would have been of exceptional quality. However, they were played on formats with horribly low resolution, and then ripped from there and digitized at some point, so the versions you find on YouTube now are not taken from the original film but rather the shitty television version. </p>

<p>The same can be said about newspaper prints of a photograph. If the images were released in newspapers and magazines, we may have had low resolution prints going out to the masses, and then copies being made of those shitty versions rather than from the original negative. </p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m not here to debate about the landings as I have nothing whatsoever to add to the discussiom. I have newer read anything about the landings since I was in grade school. As far as I know, the story is legit. This isn&#39;t to say there&#39;s not more to the story, but your point about the existence of a high resolution image from back then being evidence of deception just doesn&#39;t hold any weight as there is a preponderance of evidence that high resolution photography existed long before the space program.  </p>

<p>If you are interested, go on eBay and look up old prints from Associated Press. They are gorgeous 8x10 prints, often from the 30s-50s, that are very high resolution and oftentimes have been cropped in from even higher resolution images. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Back when digital cameras were new I recall reading something about how regular chemical cameras could have a resolution of over 25MP by quasi-comparison, depending on the quality and perfection of the lens used, which was the most important factor after other camera settings like aperature size.  So your typical digital camera now is more advanced in many other ways like software enhancement that make a better picture but the prosumer models (18-25mp) are just now rivaling a high end chemical camera in terms of physical capability.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The size of the sensor/film means just as much as resolution, if not more. A consumer camera these days will have a minuscule sensor. A full frame camera will have a sensor that is 35mm wide. Quite small. An 8x10 camera will be nearly 250mm wide. Large format prints are insanely beautiful. </p>

<p>Because it&#39;s a stupid question. Film can take great images. </p>

<p>Are you referring to a scanner as if it were some kind of magical device? </p>

<p>They&#39;re great for the average consumer. Ease of use, compact, cheap, no film costs and shooting capacity in the thousands of images. </p>

<hr/>

<p>But how does the digital revolution discount the quality of film? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you mean, but the details on HD film still have a different look than film.

    <div class="md"><p>HD hype had nothing to do with film, purely with digital tech. Film has always had a superior resolution. The only benefit to digital is that it&#39;s digital, you can preview, take as many shots as you like, and so on. Ease of use.</p>

<p>Today&#39;s moderately expensive DSLRs are Full frame meaning sensor size equals to 35mm film. Then there are the expensive cameras that are Medium format, absolutely stunning details and light gathering capabilities due to the size of the sensor. But, there are film cameras that use even larger films, that&#39;s large format, meaning anything bigger than  4 by 5 inches.</p>

<p>It is the sensor or film size that matters the most assuming optics are high quality.</p>

<p>If we talk about televisions, then HD hype had just to do with being able to show certain resolution footage. Film footage, something shot with movie cameras, not personal cameras (at that time), has all the resolution to fill HD and long beyond.</p>

<p>A good example is the remastered Apollo footage, some of that has been scanned from the original film and even the inside the cockpit videos from a smaller format camera produce great quality.</p>
