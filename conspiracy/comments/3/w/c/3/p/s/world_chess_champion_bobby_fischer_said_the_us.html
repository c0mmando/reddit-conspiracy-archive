       I agree. You'll note they do this to everyone who calls them out. Speaking the truth about the world is a type of mental illness. It doesn't matter if you're Albert Einstein.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way these guys rewrite history to exonerate themselves is shameful. Fisher's case is particularly bad, and I don't blame him for being bitter about it. Alright, he was fairly arrogant and demanding at times, but the US dumped him like a hot potato the moment they no longer needed him for their Cold War propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I remember rightly, he became homeless for a period. I recall watching him rant about the American system on TV just before he died, with his big bushy Father Christmas beard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kasparov is another player with highly-charged political opinions. I remember seeing him on TV a while back too, lambasting Putin and the Russian state apparatus.

       His mother, Regina Fisher, was Jewish. 
It's also interesting to note that nobody really knew (except her) who really was Bobby's father. He was born while Regina and Hans-Gerhardt Fischer (the father of Bobby's older sister, Joan) had been separated for many years. At the time of Bobby's birth, Regina was living in the US, while Hans-Gerhardt was in Chile. Regina vaguely mentioned a short trip to Mexico, where she met him during the war.
In fact, Bobby Fischer's biological was most probably Paul Nemenyi, a Hungarian Jewish Physicist, with whom Regina had an affair previously (looks don't lie)...

       Wrong, in every conceivable way, as usual. Have another gem from your "genius": "I think the Jews want to drive the elephants to extinction because the trunk of an elephant reminds them of an uncircumcised penis. I'm absolutely serious about that." LOL. What a hero!

        So you are saying this new quote of yours disproves the man as a world chess champion and invalidates everything he has ever said?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Just proving you wrong (yet again!). His obvious derangement does not hang on the "one sentence" you claimed. He was a paranoid, rabid anti-Semite who deserves pity for his mental illness. As does anyone who finds that aspect of Fischer's life laudable.

       I think you are very, very confused. Firstly, this is not my quote. It is Bobby Fischer's. Secondly, posting a different quote about a different topic that he said at a different time, and which has no relevance to the original quote, does not disprove the original quote.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are posting amazingly stupid and transparent lies.

       They can now, but a chess computer is only as good as the database it's loaded with. I used to be able to beat them regularly. The trick was to make your opening moves completely out of leftfield. Chances are it would have a weak analysis of the outcomes if the opening was irregular.

       By "superhuman" do you mean transhumanism? Because that's not about making super-humans it's about avoiding death and becoming something non-human.
      </p>
      <p>
       I for one am not willing to sacrifice my humanity because I'm afraid of dying. We've grown up watching X-men and DC comic book heroes... but we'd be fools to think it will be something like that. It will most likely look something like the Borg meets Gattaca.

       Chess computers are considerably more powerful now, too. I used to play Deep Fritz a lot and it regularly destroyed me. I tried Rybka too and that's just ridiculous. Haven't ever beaten it in even a single game.
