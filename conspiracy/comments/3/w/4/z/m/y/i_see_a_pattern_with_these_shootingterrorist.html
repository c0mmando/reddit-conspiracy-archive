       ISIS couldn't give a shit about America's guns. They want Americans to hate and fear Muslims so much that they start fucking shit up all over the Middle East so that ISIS can unify the Middle East and become recognized as the one and only true Muslim state, the Islamic State.

       To be fair, that info comes from I believe two witnesses at this point. I'll grant you that I haven't seen any witness statements fingering Farook and his wife at the scene, and do have serious doubts about the official narrative, but I think it's still premature to insinuate conclusively that it was 3 white guys based on what information we now have.

       If this continued I would have pointed out how those guns are

        already illegal in California

       anyway, or plenty of other inconsistancies with this

       There's eyewitness reports of

       I don't know of any three white guys in California. Yeah some on here speak of there existence. A little strange to me that someone in such a chaotic event could with absolute certainty identify the skin tone of someone covered head to toe or even the number of assailants.

       A different user said that. But it brings up a different point: why are they just components? I mean, if they did the attack and had all the components to make pipe bombs, why didn't they make the bombs and bring them to the assault?

       Thats not true. His Jewish coworker that he killed said different in earlier conversations he had with his friends about Farook. Also he left the party earlier in the day after he got in an argument. Yeah sounds like good relationships with his coworkers.

       Did you hear what the argument was about, though? His coworker was saying that Islam is a violent religion, and Farook was defending himself saying that it is a peaceful religion. I really doubt anyone would try to prove that point by shooting up the place in the name of Jihad.

       Seems like coworkers point was proven, sadly. Farook pledged allegiance to ISIS, that is exclusive of peace.

       Children (sandy hook), disability aids (san bernardino) concerts, movies other public events (marathon, theater, etc.) 
It's like they are saying, "who is going to question us when 26 children are dead"
      </p>
      <p>
       And I believe it's deeper than taking our guns. They have drones, tanks, rockets, don't forget nukes. Wtf are we going to do when they point their advanced weaponry and all we got are glocks?
It's about controlling perception and dehumanizing the populous.

       If a populace is armed to the teeth with small arms, shotguns, semi-auto rifles, etc., the government would need to use weapons an order of magnitude greater. If a populace doesn't even have guns, the government can fairly effectively subdue the populace with small arms. Even if the government can absolutely overpower the people, there's a psychological component which I think is key to this. The unarmed populace will be less likely to even try to rise up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do agree with your last sentence though, that controlling perception and dehumanizing the populace is a major part of this.

       I don't want to sound rude, but "concerts, movies other public events" could be anything. You basically said "anywhere with a lot of people", which is obvious. Otherwise it isn't a mass shooting.

       What I mean is the attacks occur at places that every American Will relate to, therefore making the people watching events unfold live more sympathetic and likely to believe what the msm tells them. In reality why would these attacks happen at these places? And why the overbearing media frenzy?

       You seem to be under the impression that the ONLY reason these shootings make the news is because there is someone behind the curtains orchestrating a media frenzy for these particular events.
      </p>
      <p>
       As it turns out, a mass shooting on a “soft target” is news because people want to hear about it. It’s news because it’s out of the ordinary. I’m sure shootings in gangland Chicago or Detroit (I’m Australian, I don’t know where the worst gun violence is) don’t make the news very often because it’s the norm. Mass shootings in populated areas aren’t the norm. People want to hear about these events when they happen, and that’s the media’s job.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know there’s plenty wrong with the way mass media works in America and worldwide, but it still serves the purpose of bringing news to people. Throw all the conspiracy theories you want at them, they’re still doing a job that billions of people rely on to hear about what’s happening in the world. These events make news because they’re big events, not because the FBI or whatever are making them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The smartest thing to do would be to shut up about mass shootings to prevent the spread of fear and the allure of being on the 6 o’clock news spreading the shooter’s message, but the news media has proved that views are more important than social good countless times. They’re a business.

       To be fair, that info comes from I believe two witnesses at this point. I'll grant you that I haven't seen any witness statements fingering Farook and his wife at the scene, and do have serious doubts about the official narrative, but I think it's still premature to insinuate conclusively that it was 3 white guys based on what information we now have.
