    <div class="md"><p>Let me start by saying that I do not have the necessary information available to say indisputably that he is, which is why I said &quot;in my opinion.&quot;  Also keep in mind that I am not able to link a CNN article to support my claims so people like you, u/Rockran, may want to just quit reading right now.</p>

<p>That being said, there is a decent amount of evidence to support my opinion:</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start with <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/.a/6a00d8341c630a53ef0115707152af970b-500wi">Michelle Obama.</a></p>

<p>This picture shows that his/her ring finger is longer than his/her index finger.  According to <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/09/110907-ring-finger-length-science-genes-sex-hormones-men-women/">National Geographic</a> and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200506/sexuality-your-telltale-fingertips">Psychology Today</a> your digit ratio is directly linked to the amount of testosterone present during prenatal development.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Between weeks 8 and 14, tiny fetal testes, ovaries and adrenal glands secrete the baby&#39;s own supply of sex hormones. These chemical messengers, particularly testosterone, cause chain reactions in the body, spurring the growth of the genitals, encouraging and inhibiting growth in brain regions and causing changes in the fingers. Many scientists believe relative finger length—or digit ratio—is a marker for brain differences molded by hormones. Like a bit of prenatal graffiti, <strong>a longer ring finger says, &quot;Testosterone was here.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So basically this means that Michelle Obama had more testosterone during his/her development than the average female.  That coupled with <a href="http://i1.wp.com/countdowntozerotime.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/obama-pennis.jpg?fit=1024%2C1024">photos like this</a> lead me to believe that there could be more to the story.  </p>

<p>Also, the Obama children were born in 1998 and 2001, yet there are zero photos of pregnant Michelle.  (If you can find one let&#39;s see it.)  There are unconfirmed reports that he/she was born as Michael Robinson, which to me would just be hearsay until I hear <a href="https://youtu.be/VG5kYKNVLhQ?t=53">this.</a></p>

<p>Now let&#39;s move on to the man himself.  We can start with this picture of him <a href="http://www.theblogmocracy.com/wp-content/uploads/ObamaandPakistanitGayBoyfriend1.jpg"><del>holding hands with</del> sitting awkwardly close to this strapping Pakistani fellow.</a>  That alone could be nothing, but then there is the <a href="https://youtu.be/5Lrf8DbrJH0?t=410">testimony of this other fellow.</a></p>

<p>This could all be coincidence of course, and rather than take my word for it, let&#39;s see what <a href="https://youtu.be/Et38_Ufv-Jw?t=12">Joan Rivers had to say</a> just 2 weeks before her untimely death caused by an emergency throat biopsy during an unrelated elective surgery.</p>

<p>Now, I feel that I have covered the <em>denotation</em> of the word, lets move on to the <em>connotation</em>:</p>

<p>I submit just <a href="https://youtu.be/ri8BOynRGnc?t=44">one exhibit.</a></p>

<p>This information has lead me to believe that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj3VphK9AMk">Barack Obama is gay.</a></p>

<p>Edit: Fucked up one of the links.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a photo of her pubic mound. </p>

<p>He&#39;s referring to Michael Mullen, not his wife. He&#39;s reading off of a speech. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree (although I do not necessarily endorse Bush.)  </p>

<p>Barrack Obama campaigned on free healthcare and pulling out of Iraq.</p>

<p>Since then he has signed a record number of executive orders, he has raised our national debt more than than every single preceding president combined, and has increased healthcare costs for virtually everyone.    In fact, some people that had free healthcare now don&#39;t.  He has not only failed to pull out of Iraq, military spending has sky rocketed.</p>

<p>The entire time he has had a historically low approval rating (yes even lower than Bush.)</p>

<p>We now have a conflict in Syria that could legitimately lead to a world wide conflict and he is simply not equipped to handle it.  </p>

<p>He is a talented speaker and a likable guy.  Beyond that he is the worst president at least during my lifetime. </p>

<p>I envy your ability to look around and feel that America is in a better place than it was a decade ago, but I just don&#39;t see it that way.</p>

<p>Bush comes in at 49%</p>

<p>But actually you are right that he isn&#39;t the worst. Harry Truman, and Jimmy Carter came in slightly lower.</p>
