    <div class="md"><p>TPP proves it. History proves it, the UN came after the League of Nations, what is next? Globalist corporation influence over government proves it. The fact <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3vwryz/isis_is_a_tool_of_western_governments_to/">ISIS is supported by western governments</a> proves it. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3w7bcg/what_does_freemasonry_have_in_common_with_zionism/">Zionism/Freemasonry</a> proves it. </p>

<p>They take ruling the world very seriously, and we&#39;re moving toward a global species with the advent of the internet. Globalization is here to stay. The only question is, what are we going to make it look like? Are we going to let the powerful run roughshod over everything, or are people going to stand up for their rights and the rights of others? Are we just going to be fancy cattle to these billionaire CEOs or are we going to call them on their power-grabbing bullshit more and more and keep their influence from spreading endlessly? </p>

<p>The thing is, a billion of us is way more powerful than one of them, regardless of how much money they have. The only problem is making sure the billion people are coordinated and on the same page about what needs to happen for the world to improve. The media is dividing people and making them scared of each other, and a lot of people buy in to that and become their own little islands, avoiding others out of fear. If we all connect and talk truthfully to each other, it doesn&#39;t matter what the media says. We can turn it off. It only has the power we give it, and right now our society gives it a lot of power, but people are giving it less and less. </p>

<p>The media is in large part a set of half-truths designed to make everyone scared of each other, and thus easier to control and sell products to. If we can just quit falling for this trick, we&#39;d be able to all be on the same page about who is ruling us, who is really hurting us, and what needs to change. If a billion people were focused on this single goal, it would be fixed in a month. Nation vs nation, men vs women, white vs black vs brown people, religious vs atheists, SJWs vs the overly-honest, republican vs democrats, etc. All designed to keep us from ganging up on the people <em>really</em> screwing us, the extremely wealthy and powerful, the people hidden in the shadows. So shine some light, and help humanity out.    </p>

<p>As long as we are divided, we are conquered. We have to share truth with others and also listen to the truths others have to share. If we did more of this, we could move toward a direction where we are more unified instead of more divided.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always wondered why many people assume that a one world government is intrinsically worse, in any way, than a world with many governments. </p>

<p>I think there is a big plan behind the curtains, but I don&#39;t think it is as I&#39;ll natured as some people fear it is. Take WWII for example. Japan and Germany were on the losing side, but they weren&#39;t completely crushed. Today they are both great nations who dominate several industries. Culturally the world changed, but every one of the major countries involved, on both sides, are doing alright. </p>

<p>I think the grand plan is an Africa and Middle East that people from the western world will travel to, for vacation, for business, etc. Bagdahd mah very well be a tourist hotspot in twenty years. </p>

<p>Those who run the show are, among other things, developers. And this is not necessarily bad. These are the sorts of people who build cities, develop previously undeveloped lands, make monuments, etc. </p>

<p>Its a narrative of destruction followed by creation. Bad and good. I just cannot get behind the idea that we are destined for some sort of dystopian world where we are all slaves. </p>

<p>To be completely honest I don&#39;t find things like TSA all that troublesome or inconvenient. If that&#39;s what it takes to live in the world, I&#39;ll take it. </p>
