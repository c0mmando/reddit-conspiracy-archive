       This is the first explanation everyone thinks of.  And some of the triangular craft sightings can probably be attributed to this.  But according to many credible witnesses like police officers, can any triangular military aircraft:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Fly absolutely silently?
       </li>
       <li>
        Hover in place?
       </li>
       <li>
        Are as large or larger than a football field?
       </li>
       <li>
        Make right angle turns without banking?
       </li>
       <li>
        Move straight up and down?
       </li>
       <li>
        Accelerate from a dead stop to thousands of miles an hour without creating a sonic boom?
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       These objects have also been reported well before any similarly shaped military aircraft had been developed.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you read the book I linked above, you will understand that these objects do not display typical flight dynamics of any known aircraft and are true UFOs.

       Copter drones can basically do all the things you describe.  It's just a question of scale.  I'm amazed at what a simple toy can do with a person controlling it.  Imagine what a lockheed martin copter drone can do with automated controls.

       They use a counter-rotating mercury engine. It generates an energy field that cancels the mass of the ship so it can be built on super-massive scales. The field also cancels inertia, thus the ability for extreme speed, acceleration and changes of direction.
      </p>

       I have heard several scientists talk about this technology in Disclosure Project videos. Since then I've found other references to it. The technology is real. Question is, is it terrestrial, extra-terrestrial, or both?

      <p>
       I can't say it was "absolutely silent".  But I did not hear it over the sound of traffic and it was very close.  If it had been a helicopter or airlplane, it would have been very loud at that proximity.

      <p>
       I can't say definitively how large it was.  I know it was larger than the car, because even at the height it was, it was bigger than my car.  My girlfriend says it was at least twice the size of the car.  I thought it was the size of a jet.  I can't find any information on a multi copter drone this size, but I would be surprised if they didn't exist.

       yes.  copter drones can absolutely do this.

       multicopters can accelerate incredibly quickly.  i think the figures you've cited are subjective.

       There was also a ton of triangle sightings in Belgium up in I believe the early 2000's. The Belgian government opened an investigation into it, so I don't think it was their crafts.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, after reading a lot about the UFO phenomenon, a lot of them definitely represent non-human intelligence, though in tons of cases we don't know.

       I was not the one who filmed that one in Maine but I came across it and it seemed to be legit and had a news story to back it up. Could be government or extraterrestrial, it looks just like the "triangle UFO" that has been sighted many times over the years.

       Well you do see hovering, because it was hovering.  You can see that it was port on approach and maintained its position as we passed it.
      </p>

       There were several of these hovering vehicles.  I wouldn't have paid any attention if one hadn't hovered directly over my car.

      <p>
       And yes, they all had red flashing lights.  It doesn't indicate landing, just that the engine is running.  There were several colored lights underneath them, with three bright white lights on the tips.

       that's fair.  I'm sure the videos could be analyzed to show that it was hovering, but i suppose it's not obvious from three crappy cellphone videos taken through the windshield of a moving car.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't post the video to prove anything, just give context to what I saw, which was several triangle shaped hovering vehicles that were clearly what has been described as "black triangles", one of which was hovering very low over the highway.

       Jets have red and green strobe on their wings and the white lights on a plane are at the nose, tail and base of the wings- not the end of the wings.  The red and green strobes on the drones were within the triangle, and they were perfectly equilateral.  These weren't even winged craft.  But the bottom line is that they were hovering and I watched several of them much closer than the one in the video.

       Navigation lights are not always visible from the underside of aircraft. Lighting arrangements vary to an extent based upon individual manufacturers and makes.

       Everything in that video screams commerical airliner on approach. I have a pilots licence and probably know a lot more about this than you. You filmed an aircraft landing, nothing more.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you had actually witnessed something unique there would have been dozens of reports, not just a few grainy out of focus cell phone clips. Remember the missile launch over LA a few months ago? Thousands of people saw it and immediately posted it. At least a few more would have reported drones or whatever over Brooklyn.

       Drones have been an issue at JFK.  There are videos of drones, but I challenge you to find two videos of the same drone.
      </p>
      <p>
       not only are you just wrong, but the foundation for your argument is blatantly falsifiable.  There are plenty of complaints from pilots flying into jfk that have no video footage or other sightings to go with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are two reports, two and a half hours apart.  they were only reported because they were right next to the planes.

      <p>
       The drones are being flown from the abandoned airport at Floyd Bennet Field which is exactly where my video was filmed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's frustrating arguing this, because I had an unquestionable experience.  If I'd only seen one drone at the distance of the one we filmed, I might be questioning it.  But the fact is that I saw one up close when I drove directly under it, and then saw several more hovering right next to the road before I even filmed this.  So you are telling me that I'm wrong because you're over confident in your own knowledge, but you don't have the knowledge to make that decision, and the logic you are using isn't even sound.

       A friend of mine who teaches disabled chirldren and is very respected saw a ufo that was in the shape of a baseball dimond with her mother and her father ran out back due to him bieng dressed only in his draws slipped and fell on the back deck and broke his coller bone and did not see it. My moms friend saw a giant triangle ufo over her in a parking lot she said it was silent ang friggen huge. I saw what looked like a star bounce around in the sky going super fast stopping and making right angle turns going at speeds that no air craft can possibly do. Saw that when I was a kid and it still scares me when im walking on countyr roads at night

       Looks like this might be the answer. 
"“The plasma, mercury based, is pressurized at 250,000 atmospheres at a temperature of 150 degrees Kelvin and accelerated to 50,000 rpm to create a super-conductive plasma with the resulting gravity disruption. “
Video posted on the internet shown below with stills, seems to confirm the hyperspace capability. The main central ring activates the hyperspace window - the 3 other spin sources control direction and velocity. This is a craft built for deep space operation.

       2013 seems to have seen a ground support spec rolled out, an updated AC-130H Spectre gunship if you wish. Military roll out is a clear indication the TR-3B platform is now old technology. This picture is from Virginia - another one circulating on the internet shows the same type offering ground support in Afghanistan for Marines. The long range and stationary loiter makes for an ideal gun platform. Presumably a stripped down airframe bill of materials for atmospheric operation only."

       I think what you saw was an airplane. I've driven on the Belt Parkway numerous times. And on occasion I'll see a plane just hovering waiting to land I believe. I think that was what you saw.

       I'm just letting you know it was not a "UFO" or "UAV". Planes can hover. I seen it. If you could take a better quality video with night vision next time that will be great. If it was a "UFO" there would be more people talking about it like the "UFO" in china and the swirling lights in sweden. I believe in extraterrestrials as much as the next person here. I just know that planes have and do hover over that airport. Sorry bro. Just telling it like it is.

       The difference in perspective and relative speed between you and it (when in a car) can make it seem like they are hovering, but it's physically impossible. Planes don't hover. At least not the ones landing at public airports. Sorry if my sarcasm meter is off.

       They can't.  There are vertical take-off planes that can- the osprey is a combination copter/ plane, and the harrier uses thrusters.
      </p>
      <p>
       High winds and a plane headed either direction on the same axis as line of site could give the illusion of hovering, but it's not actually hovering.  Jet planes really can't go under 100 mph.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, there IS a drone prototype called the Krossblade SkyProwler, which is winged multirotor aircraft capable of vertical take-off and cruising.

       yeah, I'm a skeptic and don't personally believe that UFOs are "alien spaceships".  Seeing this up close, I never questioned that.  I have problems with the concept that this would even be some sort of "secret technology", because it was very visible in a very populated area.
      </p>
      <p>
       I assumed it was a new DHS or NYPD program that I hadn't heard about.  The shock to me was when I couldn't find anything online about it.

       How would anyone see anything other than planes landing and taking off? One even has the flashing red strobe and the two forward facing landing lights. If it doesn't make a hard turn or stop suddenly and hover, you know, do something other worldly...

       I never claimed it was "other worldly".  I'm calling it a "black triangle UFO" because that's what it was.  I saw the first one up close and it was very clearly a drone aircraft hovering very low over the highway (maybe 30- 100 feet).  It was huge. I surmised at the time it was some sort of NYPD surveillance drone and that I'd be able to find a picture and some articles on it.  The one in the video is a few thousand feet up.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were plenty of planes landing and taking off.  They travel, at MINIMUM, 100 mph.  The drones were not moving at all.  You seem to think that the camera is tracking the craft in the video.  It's not.  We're moving at ~70mph and that's the same drone staying perfectly still from the 1st video to the 3rd.

       Thank's for your response. When a plane is flying straight at you it can look stationary and motionless, and the second video looks a lot like a pair of landing lights implying a forward facing plane.
      </p>
      <p>
       The third video looks very much like a plane landing imo, but it also looks like you are close enough to be able to tell the difference. Distance, size, altitude, all that, is so hard to tell at night, I'll take you're word for it. The one thing we can, imo, absolutely claim with certainty, is that the tell tale signature strobing pattern of the red led in the third video means it's ours.

       it's not a pair of landing lights.  there were three bright cylindrical lights on these, pointing down.  from that angle, you can only see two, but the others that i saw closer up made it clear.

       yes, there were lots of lights on the bottom and they all had the red strobe.

       Was it this fri-sat or last ... the weekend of teh 20th or prior. Because One of those weekends I spotted a giant purple mark in the night sky.  I came out drop my garbage on the sidewalk in queens. and now 2 old men were also staring at it, in the direction of JFK.

       yes.  It was that saturday.  between JFK and flatbush/ floyd bennet field. I didn't see anything purple.  They each had 3 large bright white lights, with smaller colored on the underside and sides.

       Apparently people fly drone copters in the park and off canarsie pier, but they aren't supposed to.  These were much larger than any copter drone I've ever seen.

       Unless civilians have triangle shaped drones than can fly like a thousand miles an hour. I dont believe anyone claiming to know it was a drone. my girlfriend and eye spotted a triangle with 3 lights, very high in the sky. We live in queens. On my left horizon is LGA, on my right is the direction in which south queens/ JFK is. The thing I saw went from the left horizon to the right horizon in about 2 seconds, while commercial airlines were flying over my place for a landing. I saw this a couple days after posting a story from my youth. This is nuts. I dont care what anyone says, no drones are flying thast fast. It was white. it was not a perfect triangle. THere was some sort of hole in the middle. It wasnt small either. This thing looked decent size and it was about 2k 3k feet over the landing planes that were around 1k feet.

       there are definitely skunkworks and phantomworks supersonic uavs and undisclosed "flying wing" usaf aircraft.  The Astra and Aurora project are probably operational aircraft.
      </p>
      <p>
       My grandparents saw something like what you seem to be describing while sailing in the caribbean in the 1980s. they had a friend who was a naval admiral close by and they asked about it.  He said that the aircraft had not been identified (who knows if that was true or not).
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't be shocked to see something like this at high altitude.  What shocked me was seeing multiple hovering at very low altitude. I'm being generous when I say this thing was 100 feet over my head.  At the time, I would have estimated it was 10 feet up, and according to my girlfriend it was at least 2x the size of the car, but in retrospect I'm thinking it was a little higher and much bigger.

       First off, it doesn't even look like its hovering. I can tell that it's moving even with your shitty video quality. Second of all, as someone who enjoys watching planes, I can tell you that you instantly diminish your ability to see relative motion of you're moving yourself.

       You're disputing a fact based on very limited information which you're choosing to misinterpret.

       I shared an experience and was looking for insights.  Unfortunately, your contribution is not insightful, it's just incorrect.  It's not questionable whether or not what is in the video was a jet plane.  It was not.

       Insights like what? Just people agreeing with you? If someone were flying a top secret aircraft, why would the do it right over a civilian population and light the thing up with?
      </p>
      <p>
       And how are you so sure you didn't see an airplane even though you were driving by an airport? It's obviously the underside of a 757 or 767 being lit up by its own landing lights. It's moving at 150 mph but it's very large and pretty far away, so there isn't much line of sight rate. Add that with the fact that it's dark so you lose visual cues, and you yourself are moving, and you see how all of that might make the illusion that it's hovering.

       I didn't say it was a top secret aircraft.  I asked the exact same question you're asking.  I'd guess it was a Homeland Security or NYPD drone.  The only reason I don't think it was a private hobbyist is because it was so large.  And I'm shocked I can't find any information about it online.

      <p>
       Because I drove right underneath one!  I don't think you understand, I was very close to it.  It was hovering in the middle of the street. And then after that, we started seeing more of them higher up over a stretch of about 3 miles.  The one on the video is the last and furthest away.  There were plenty of airplanes too, but they were very easy to distinguish.

      <p>
       No, it's really not.  You can hear me in the video saying that I think we're going to go under it when it's about a mile away.  I thought the road was curving to the left, and the others were hovering very close to the highway, so I figured that one was too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, if this was the only one we saw- I would be saying the same thing that you are.  I'm a skeptical and analytical person and I would be saying- either that was a drone or a plane that gave the illusion of not moving.  When I couldn't find any information on it being a drone, I would probably assume plane and that maybe I was possibly mistaken in what I thought I saw.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that video was taken probably 5 minutes after I'd already digested the first sighting.  After that one, I saw another hover just off the side of the road, about 2 or 3 times as close as the one in the video.  We were no longer caught off guard and had ample time to look at it.  The physical evidence I'm presenting is the smallest possible evidence of the experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which direction, relative to my car, would you argue this jet was traveling at 150 mph?

       Then how did these guys track the plane in those videos? They track across the camera so slowly it's a piece of cake. It's a large object and it's over a mile away from you. It isn't gonna zip across the horizon.

       All you have to do is whip out your phone in the same spot when an airplane is flying by. But you think it makes more sense for me to scour the Internet for shitty videos or airplanes flying by at night. It's obvious you won't do it because you know I'm right and you're being rediculous.

       I think you have an incredible case of narcissism to argue what you're arguing.  I can't clone the experience because I saw a number of drones and it was incredibly out of the ordinary.  YOU are the one who is trying to argue that what I saw was planes.
      </p>
      <p>
       If YOU were right, you should be able to find some evidence of it.  I can walk on my deck right now and film planes.  I'm sure you can find some evidence to back up your claims.  I've backed mine up, but if you're unwilling to accept it, I suppose that's up to you.  It's just frustrating to me when people are so oblivious, because it speaks to a broader problem.  The bottom line is that I have a a perspective for argumentation and you do not right now.

       The solipsism is strong with you. i had an experience and am not confused about what I saw- just who's drones they were and what they were doing. The video isn't the be all and end all of what I saw, it's just all you can see.  If you want to compare videos, then YOU find a video that looks like this one.

       Okay let's entertain your aluminum hat fetish for a bit. Say those were drones, why would the be hovering right next to a huge airport where they would get in the way of airplanes and everyone on the ground could see them? And why would they have big bright lights on? And a flashing red one too?

       I've already given you the information, but if you were trying to make an actual argument, you would have looked it up yourself. People DO fly drones in Floyd Bennet Park (It's an abandoned airport).  You can find videos of "ufos" taken from airplanes flying out of JFK.  It's become a problem.

       I think we're done, because you really aren't adding anything to this discussion.  I was really just frustrated that you are so willing to argue with me over whether or not it was hovering.  THAT'S not the question.

       You did not answer that question. That's obviously a very large object or else it's 10 feet away from you. That is not a quadcopter. So what is an extremely large, full-size top secret drone doing in DC airport's airspace with lights on and flashing?

       I think it was probably NYPD, military or Homeland Security and that they were flying out of the abandoned airport.  When I saw it, I assumed it wasn't a "secret" anything, because there were some hovering much lower.

       not a helicopter.  I saw multiple.  The first was hovering directly over the belt parkway under 100 feet.  It was either silent or at the very least quieter than the traffic din.  It was totally still and I thought it was a traffic drone or surveillance drone that was probably a known commodity in the area.  Then we started seeing more hovering to the side of the road.  The one we finally decided to record on video was much farther away and higher up than the others.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd seen one before in Penobscot bay, Maine and assumed it was a military drone.  I'm thinking at this point that that is what they are, but apparently they're very secret because there are many open records about sightings, but it seems like the news often does not cover it.

       This is like pulling teeth. No you do not have video evidence. The whole reason we're even talking is because the video isn't clear. You can't use that as evidence to your point. That's like saying you know OJ was telling the truth because he told you so.

       do you know it wasn't a helicopter? What about it that you saw told you that it wasn't a helicopter. Because all you've said is that it was hovering and it was big. And then you got all hissy when I challenged that.

      <p>
       YOU are welcome to doubt my experience. I've already deconstructed my personal experience.  I have another witness and a video to confirm what I saw.  AGAIN- the video doesn't tell the whole story.  But YOU can't find a video that compares with the one I posted- of a plane OR a helicopter- so your thesis holds no water over my experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order for you to believe it was a helicopter, you have to presume that I was wrong about seeing one of these flying directly over the road at a low height and not making any noise. That's fine that you want to be skeptical, but don't be stupid and presume that you know more about my experience than i do.

       Do you realize the major freakout that would have occurred if several large "drones" were hovering in Class B airspace at JFK? Pilots have eyes and so does ATC. If they were anything but aircraft on final approach someone besides you would have reported it.

       There very well may be hovering, but the videos don't show it. I'm just saying the videos are too short to show context. It looks like an airplane on approach to me. That's just my opinion.

       well you're wrong.  I saw several. they were not airplanes.  again, i wouldn't have paid attention to the one in the video if the first hadn't hovered right over my car.

       I'm just letting you know it was not a "UFO" or "UAV". Planes can hover. I seen it. If you could take a better quality video with night vision next time that will be great. If it was a "UFO" there would be more people talking about it like the "UFO" in china and the swirling lights in sweden. I believe in extraterrestrials as much as the next person here. I just know that planes have and do hover over that airport. Sorry bro. Just telling it like it is.

       The early concept papers were published, even patents issued, then it all disappeared in the late 1930s and early '40s.

       Yes, I think you're right. Listen to Steven Greer on YouTube for 4 hours. The ship was a US military anti-gravity faster than light aircraft.

       Go back out there to that same spot and film planes. I promise you it will look the same.

       Drones have been an issue at JFK.  There are videos of drones, but I challenge you to find two videos of the same drone.
      </p>
      <p>
       not only are you just wrong, but the foundation for your argument is blatantly falsifiable.  There are plenty of complaints from pilots flying into jfk that have no video footage or other sightings to go with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are two reports, two and a half hours apart.  they were only reported because they were right next to the planes.

       The drones are being flown from the abandoned airport at Floyd Bennet Field which is exactly where my video was filmed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's frustrating arguing this, because I had an unquestionable experience.  If I'd only seen one drone at the distance of the one we filmed, I might be questioning it.  But the fact is that I saw one up close when I drove directly under it, and then saw several more hovering right next to the road before I even filmed this.  So you are telling me that I'm wrong because you're over confident in your own knowledge, but you don't have the knowledge to make that decision, and the logic you are using isn't even sound.
