    <div class="md"><p>This is the first explanation everyone thinks of.  And some of the triangular craft sightings can probably be attributed to this.  But according to many credible witnesses like police officers, can any triangular military aircraft:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fly absolutely silently?</li>
<li>Hover in place?</li>
<li>Are as large or larger than a football field?</li>
<li>Make right angle turns without banking?</li>
<li>Move straight up and down?</li>
<li>Accelerate from a dead stop to thousands of miles an hour without creating a sonic boom?</li>
</ul>

<p>These objects have also been reported well before any similarly shaped military aircraft had been developed.</p>

<p>If you read the book I linked above, you will understand that these objects do not display typical flight dynamics of any known aircraft and are true UFOs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They use a counter-rotating mercury engine. It generates an energy field that cancels the mass of the ship so it can be built on super-massive scales. The field also cancels inertia, thus the ability for extreme speed, acceleration and changes of direction.</p>

<p>I have heard several scientists talk about this technology in Disclosure Project videos. Since then I&#39;ve found other references to it. The technology is real. Question is, is it terrestrial, extra-terrestrial, or both?</p>

<p>Fly absolutely silently?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can&#39;t say it was &quot;absolutely silent&quot;.  But I did not hear it over the sound of traffic and it was very close.  If it had been a helicopter or airlplane, it would have been very loud at that proximity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are as large or larger than a football field?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can&#39;t say definitively how large it was.  I know it was larger than the car, because even at the height it was, it was bigger than my car.  My girlfriend says it was at least twice the size of the car.  I thought it was the size of a jet.  I can&#39;t find any information on a multi copter drone this size, but I would be surprised if they didn&#39;t exist. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Make right angle turns without banking?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>yes.  copter drones can absolutely do this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Accelerate from a dead stop to thousands of miles an hour without creating a sonic boom?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>multicopters can accelerate incredibly quickly.  i think the figures you&#39;ve cited are subjective.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6sz8bquB50">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6sz8bquB50</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you do see hovering, because it was hovering.  You can see that it was port on approach and maintained its position as we passed it.</p>

<p>There were several of these hovering vehicles.  I wouldn&#39;t have paid any attention if one hadn&#39;t hovered directly over my car.</p>

<p>And yes, they all had red flashing lights.  It doesn&#39;t indicate landing, just that the engine is running.  There were several colored lights underneath them, with three bright white lights on the tips.</p>

<p>Yes it was, and there were several others.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No.  It wasn&#39;t.  It&#39;s not even a question.</p>

<p>Jets have red and green strobe on their wings and the white lights on a plane are at the nose, tail and base of the wings- not the end of the wings.  The red and green strobes on the drones were within the triangle, and they were perfectly equilateral.  These weren&#39;t even winged craft.  But the bottom line is that they were hovering and I watched several of them much closer than the one in the video.</p>

<p>Everything in that video screams commerical airliner on approach. I have a pilots licence and probably know a lot more about this than you. You filmed an aircraft landing, nothing more. </p>

<p>If you had actually witnessed something unique there would have been dozens of reports, not just a few grainy out of focus cell phone clips. Remember the missile launch over LA a few months ago? Thousands of people saw it and immediately posted it. At least a few more would have reported drones or whatever over Brooklyn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Drones have been an issue at JFK.  There are videos of drones, but I challenge you to find two videos of the same drone.</p>

<p>not only are you just wrong, but the foundation for your argument is blatantly falsifiable.  There are plenty of complaints from pilots flying into jfk that have no video footage or other sightings to go with them.</p>

<p>Here are two reports, two and a half hours apart.  they were only reported because they were right next to the planes.  <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/01/us/drone-airliner-jfk/">http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/01/us/drone-airliner-jfk/</a></p>

<p>The drones are being flown from the abandoned airport at Floyd Bennet Field which is exactly where my video was filmed.</p>

<p>It&#39;s frustrating arguing this, because I had an unquestionable experience.  If I&#39;d only seen one drone at the distance of the one we filmed, I might be questioning it.  But the fact is that I saw one up close when I drove directly under it, and then saw several more hovering right next to the road before I even filmed this.  So you are telling me that I&#39;m wrong because you&#39;re over confident in your own knowledge, but you don&#39;t have the knowledge to make that decision, and the logic you are using isn&#39;t even sound.</p>

&quot;“The plasma, mercury based, is pressurized at 250,000 atmospheres at a temperature of 150 degrees Kelvin and accelerated to 50,000 rpm to create a super-conductive plasma with the resulting gravity disruption. “
Video posted on the internet shown below with stills, seems to confirm the hyperspace capability. The main central ring activates the hyperspace window - the 3 other spin sources control direction and velocity. This is a craft built for deep space operation.</p>

<p>2013 seems to have seen a ground support spec rolled out, an updated AC-130H Spectre gunship if you wish. Military roll out is a clear indication the TR-3B platform is now old technology. This picture is from Virginia - another one circulating on the internet shows the same type offering ground support in Afghanistan for Marines. The long range and stationary loiter makes for an ideal gun platform. Presumably a stripped down airframe bill of materials for atmospheric operation only.&quot;</p>

<p>Got that from a fun website.</p>

<p>High winds and a plane headed either direction on the same axis as line of site could give the illusion of hovering, but it&#39;s not actually hovering.  Jet planes really can&#39;t go under 100 mph.</p>

I saw the first one up close and it was very clearly a drone aircraft hovering very low over the highway (maybe 30- 100 feet).  It was huge. I surmised at the time it was some sort of NYPD surveillance drone and that I&#39;d be able to find a picture and some articles on it.  The one in the video is a few thousand feet up.</p>

<p>There were plenty of planes landing and taking off.  They travel, at MINIMUM, 100 mph.  The drones were not moving at all.  You seem to think that the camera is tracking the craft in the video.  It&#39;s not.  We&#39;re moving at ~70mph and that&#39;s the same drone staying perfectly still from the 1st video to the 3rd.</p>

I dont believe anyone claiming to know it was a drone. my girlfriend and eye spotted a triangle with 3 lights, very high in the sky. We live in queens. On my left horizon is LGA, on my right is the direction in which south queens/ JFK is. The thing I saw went from the left horizon to the right horizon in about 2 seconds, while commercial airlines were flying over my place for a landing. I saw this a couple days after posting a story from my youth. This is nuts. I dont care what anyone says, no drones are flying thast fast. It was white. it was not a perfect triangle. THere was some sort of hole in the middle. It wasnt small either. This thing looked decent size and it was about 2k 3k feet over the landing planes that were around 1k feet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there are definitely skunkworks and phantomworks supersonic uavs and undisclosed &quot;flying wing&quot; usaf aircraft.  The Astra and Aurora project are probably operational aircraft.</p>

<p>My grandparents saw something like what you seem to be describing while sailing in the caribbean in the 1980s. they had a friend who was a naval admiral close by and they asked about it.  He said that the aircraft had not been identified (who knows if that was true or not).  </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be shocked to see something like this at high altitude.  What shocked me was seeing multiple hovering at very low altitude. I&#39;m being generous when I say this thing was 100 feet over my head.  At the time, I would have estimated it was 10 feet up, and according to my girlfriend it was at least 2x the size of the car, but in retrospect I&#39;m thinking it was a little higher and much bigger.    </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t say it was a top secret aircraft.  I asked the exact same question you&#39;re asking.  I&#39;d guess it was a Homeland Security or NYPD drone.  The only reason I don&#39;t think it was a private hobbyist is because it was so large.  And I&#39;m shocked I can&#39;t find any information about it online.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And how are you so sure you didn&#39;t see an airplane even though you were driving by an airport?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because I drove right underneath one!  I don&#39;t think you understand, I was very close to it.  It was hovering in the middle of the street. And then after that, we started seeing more of them higher up over a stretch of about 3 miles.  The one on the video is the last and furthest away.  There were plenty of airplanes too, but they were very easy to distinguish.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No, it&#39;s really not.  You can hear me in the video saying that I think we&#39;re going to go under it when it&#39;s about a mile away.  I thought the road was curving to the left, and the others were hovering very close to the highway, so I figured that one was too.  </p>

<p>Look, if this was the only one we saw- I would be saying the same thing that you are.  I&#39;m a skeptical and analytical person and I would be saying- either that was a drone or a plane that gave the illusion of not moving.  When I couldn&#39;t find any information on it being a drone, I would probably assume plane and that maybe I was possibly mistaken in what I thought I saw.</p>

<p>But that video was taken probably 5 minutes after I&#39;d already digested the first sighting.  After that one, I saw another hover just off the side of the road, about 2 or 3 times as close as the one in the video.  We were no longer caught off guard and had ample time to look at it.  The physical evidence I&#39;m presenting is the smallest possible evidence of the experience.</p>

<p>Which direction, relative to my car, would you argue this jet was traveling at 150 mph?  </p>

<p>I&#39;m shocked that someone can be so sure of themselves with so little information that they are willing to argue so confidently against someone with so much more information and a video that is consistent.</p>

<p>Then how did these guys track the plane in those videos? They track across the camera so slowly it&#39;s a piece of cake. It&#39;s a large object and it&#39;s over a mile away from you. It isn&#39;t gonna zip across the horizon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>not a helicopter.  I saw multiple.  The first was hovering directly over the belt parkway under 100 feet.  It was either silent or at the very least quieter than the traffic din.  It was totally still and I thought it was a traffic drone or surveillance drone that was probably a known commodity in the area.  Then we started seeing more hovering to the side of the road.  The one we finally decided to record on video was much farther away and higher up than the others.</p>

<p>I&#39;d seen one before in Penobscot bay, Maine and assumed it was a military drone.  I&#39;m thinking at this point that that is what they are, but apparently they&#39;re very secret because there are many open records about sightings, but it seems like the news often does not cover it.</p>

You can&#39;t use that as evidence to your point. That&#39;s like saying you know OJ was telling the truth because he told you so. </p>

<p><strong>How</strong> do you know it wasn&#39;t a helicopter? What about it that you saw told you that it wasn&#39;t a helicopter. Because all you&#39;ve said is that it was hovering and it was big. And then you got all hissy when I challenged that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This conversation is insane to me.  It&#39;s like you&#39;re a child who thinks the world disappears when you put your hands in front of your eyes.</p>

<p>YOU are welcome to doubt my experience. I&#39;ve already deconstructed my personal experience.  I have another witness and a video to confirm what I saw.  AGAIN- the video doesn&#39;t tell the whole story.  But YOU can&#39;t find a video that compares with the one I posted- of a plane OR a helicopter- so your thesis holds no water over my experience.</p>

<p>In order for you to believe it was a helicopter, you have to presume that I was wrong about seeing one of these flying directly over the road at a low height and not making any noise. That&#39;s fine that you want to be skeptical, but don&#39;t be stupid and presume that you know more about my experience than i do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just letting you know it was not a &quot;UFO&quot; or &quot;UAV&quot;. Planes can hover. I seen it. If you could take a better quality video with night vision next time that will be great. If it was a &quot;UFO&quot; there would be more people talking about it like the &quot;UFO&quot; in china and the swirling lights in sweden. I believe in extraterrestrials as much as the next person here. I just know that planes have and do hover over that airport. Sorry bro. Just telling it like it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Drones have been an issue at JFK.  There are videos of drones, but I challenge you to find two videos of the same drone.</p>

<p>not only are you just wrong, but the foundation for your argument is blatantly falsifiable.  There are plenty of complaints from pilots flying into jfk that have no video footage or other sightings to go with them.</p>

<p>Here are two reports, two and a half hours apart.  they were only reported because they were right next to the planes.  <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/01/us/drone-airliner-jfk/">http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/01/us/drone-airliner-jfk/</a></p>

<p>The drones are being flown from the abandoned airport at Floyd Bennet Field which is exactly where my video was filmed.</p>

<p>It&#39;s frustrating arguing this, because I had an unquestionable experience.  If I&#39;d only seen one drone at the distance of the one we filmed, I might be questioning it.  But the fact is that I saw one up close when I drove directly under it, and then saw several more hovering right next to the road before I even filmed this.  So you are telling me that I&#39;m wrong because you&#39;re over confident in your own knowledge, but you don&#39;t have the knowledge to make that decision, and the logic you are using isn&#39;t even sound.</p>
