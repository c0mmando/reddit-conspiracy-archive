       I am a veteran user of compasses.  Not only am I an Eagle Scout, and Army Veteran, but I have much experience doing navigation for sailboats and motorboats on charts.  Especially for sailboat racing, an accurate compass heading is very important.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the video that I made on the subject:
       <br/>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNQKfoiLNv8">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNQKfoiLNv8
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       My knowledge of how compasses work clashes with the claims of how our Earth is magnetized.  My claims come from the case that compasses are VERY sensitive equipment.  If the compass is not flat, it can "bind" and will not show the correct heading.  For this reason, it is important to hold your compasses flat.  There are marine and aeronautical compasses that are gyroscopic, but what I am discussing is mainly the handheld magnetic compasses.
      </p>
      <p>
       The compass points twoards the Northern magnetic field.  If this magnetism was from the spinning core, wouldn't the compass point down into the ground?  If the magnetism is from the north pole (on a globe), wouldn't the compass point slightly into the ground (depending on your location?).  If the magnetism is from the magnetosphere, wouldn't the compass be attracted up into the air?
      </p>
      <p>
       So my questions come from my belief that there is discrepancy in how compasses work and what "they" say the shape of the Earth is.  I believe this is just another clue of the lies that they have told us.

       So you're just confused at how a compass works. It aligns with the magnetic field.  It does not point to the source of the magnetic field, which is what you're wondering about in the original post).

       But, you see.... Magnetic North, and the deviation that is needed for that, does not coordinate logically with a "magnetic field".  This is just my understanding of it, and I've attempted to study every explanation of the magnetism.

       Actually, deviation is a change.  And yes magnetic north variation, is the amount of deviation of which you must compute for the difference between true north and magnetic north.  This doesn't prove a sphere, it just proves that true and magnetic are not at the same place.  And yes, that is a deviation.  Nice attempt to correct me, incorrectly.

       Yes it does. Magnets create a torus shaped field, NOT a spherical field. (This is easily demonstrated with iron filings and a magnet.)

       Why don't you just send a camera up into the air high enough to see the earth, and this entire "debate", if you can call it that, will be squashed, once and for all. However, it seems that no one either wants to do this, or just doesn't care enough to. IMO, it seems like the easiest and most reliable way to check. So since no one is really doing that, it leads me to believe this whole "flat earth" debacle is just a bunch of bullshit.  I dont care to do it, cause i don't believe the earth is flat. I have nothing to prove here. You, on the other hand..are desperate to prove your point. So get to it, and let us know..Okie dokie??

       cheap? Right.... nice joke.  You buy the balloons and camera gear, mail it to me, and I will do the experiment.  Until then, do not try and speak down at me because I don't want to purchase things that YOU think is best.  Those are idiotic assumptions, and are blatantly disrespectful.  Do you want my paypal to send me the money to?  I can get you a quote for the cost.

       Haha it's like a total of $500 kid. If you REALLY wanted to see this "theory" of yours to conclusion, you'd find a way to do this.

       send me the 500 dollars, if it's not such a big deal.  You calling me kid, then you must have plenty of money.  It's easy to make claims, and you really think that 500 dollars would get the altitude needed?  I can give you paypal, or you can keep running your mouth and acting like money is no issue.

       Hahah why on Earth would I do that, when I could just spend the money and do the experiment myself?
      </p>
      <p>
       Something as cheap as $500 shouldn't be that big of an issue if you're SO SURE you're going to prove the entire scientific world wrong by showing the Earth isn't a fuckin sphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       And of course it will get the altitude needed. Do a god damn basic  google search if this is something you're interested in. Not only do high-altitude balloons enter the stratosphere and generally attain between 60,000 to 120,000 feet you can buy one of those balloons here FOR ONLY 55 FUCKIN DOLLARS:

      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously though, what's $500 if it means putting your name in the history books by completely disproving everything science has ever told us? I think you just can't be bothered and you want to stick to what fits your narrative.

       You talking about money like it's nothing.  If you want me to do tphe experiment, then you do it.  I personally don't want to spend 500 bucks, to get a flat horizon, only to have people say ... 'you didn't go up high enough".  I've seen high altitude cameras (like red bull stratos), that show a perfectly flat horizon line. I don't need to do the experiment.  You sir, believe that it will prove something, and you expect that I do the experiment?  If it proves something to you, do it.  If you want me to do it, to appease someting, then send me the money and I"ll do it.  Otherwise stfu.

       You can't set aside $100 a month for 5 months? I work a minimum wage job and I do that easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for doing it myself, why? You're the one who has something to prove. Like many others have said, you can easily test this yourself but you have a refusal of doing so. I on the other hand believe that the world is round. I live in a coastal city so I can go to the harbour and watch boats disappear bottom first thus demonstrating a curvature in the Earth. I can also view a lunar eclipse and determine the shape of the earth that way. So I have nothing to prove.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, if you can completely rewrite history and wipe out everything science has ever told us was true and have your name in the books for all eternity and for generations to hail you as a hero then why is $500 dollars such a big deal? Hell look online for some used gear and maybe spend only half that. Surely you can afford to set aside $50 every paycheque for 10 paycheques.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or is all I'm going to get back "I don't want to be proved wrong and I want to stick to what fits my narrative LALALALALALALALA I CAN'T HEAR YOU"?

       No offense, but that experiment has been tried by both side and "debunked" by both sides. Maybe we should do a kickstarter to fund an independent exploration of Antarctica, with indie scientists/explorers/etc? Oh..Wait... We are not allowed to do that. Pesky governments...

       Mate, you are going to have to try harder. I'm not sticking up for FE, I'm calling out your bullshit and lack of understanding. Fish eye lens have been sent up and proven and "debunked". You want to sit at the adult table? Be an adult. You keep talking about the stratosphere, but what about metal not being to withstand the heat of LEO (Low Earth Orbit). Something, something the Van Allen Belts and LEO. Dude, step your game up. You are ignorant as fuck.... :)

       Tell me, what do you think has been debunked? The curvature of the earth? The stratosphere itself?

       Sigh. Have you looked into this at all?
      </p>
      <p>
       Cameras sent up proving curvature can be debunk by lenses.  Most are go-pro cameras, these are fish lenses. Look it up.

      <p>
       Also, look up the heat in LEO, scientifically and what we have. Dude. I'm not defending FEr's, but as I said you are ignorant as fuck.

       "Most cameras that go up are go-pros". The fuck is that? Certainly not evidence. Do you think not a single person has sent up anything other than a go-pro with fish eye lens?

       If metal couldn't survive LEO at all, we wouldn't have an international space station you idiot. Also, the balloon doesn't go up to LEO. LEO starts at like 160 km. And you're telling me I'm the one who needs to read up on stuff hahah.

       Independent exploration of Antarctica is not allowed? WTF are you talking about?
      </p>
      <p>
       Tens of thousands of people go to Antarctica every year. Not government scientists, but tourists. There is tourism in Antarctica. Ranging from sightseeing flights, to more adventurous walking or skiing to South Pole or scuba diving there (which I personally did)

       Einstein definitely understood the true nature of the multiverse. It's unfortunate that information has never been without the chains of government and those with the ability to enlighten are often suppressed. If Einstein could talk now I'm sure he would have a few words for tptb.

       I look for things that we can prove.  I can look at time lapses of the southern star trails, and see circles.  This means that there is simple rotation.  Now, that could mean that we rotate, or the heavens rotate above us.  There are two possibilities, but people often jump to conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       What the circular star trails prove to me, that we do not travel around the sun and our solar system is not going through the universe.  If we had any movement other than rotation, these circles would be elliptical.  They are not.  These are simple things seen in our physical world, that can not be denied.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, some look at that, and still say that we are hurtling around the sun at 66600 mpg, tilted at an angle of 66.6 degrees.  They think that is the logical story.  It's ridiculous.

       I don't see why the heavens would go through all that effort to rotate around us. Seems easier for us to rotate together as a unit and what not. But God damn it I protect your right to say and think that !

       I don't usually participate in these discussions since I was banned from
       <a href="/r/theworldisflat">
        /r/theworldisflat

       , but I figured I'd chime in this time because it's a slow morning.
      </p>

       The reason a compass doesn't point toward the ground or into the air is
       <del>
        due to the shape of the Earth's magnetic field.
       </del>
       In textbooks, magnetic fields are frequently depicted as 2D pairs of concentric ovals, but this is a simplification. In reality the field of a bipolar magnet is a 3-dimensional torus.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: My previous statement isn't as true as I thought it was. It seems like it has as much to do with the way the standard hand compass is designed. Using a spherical magnet,
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Yhf2Vy_M8">
        you can indeed demonstrate magnetic declination by rolling it on a level surface
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Your magnetic compass isn't pointing directly at the physical location of the magnetic north pole, it's aligning itself with the magnetic field running between the north and south poles. Since those field lines are a 3D torus wrapping around the earth, the field itself (approximately) follows the curvature of the Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field#/media/File:Geomagnetisme.svg">
        this diagram of Earth's magnetic field
       </a>
       and then mentally fill in additional field lines, you'll find they're approximately match the Earth's curvature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, IIRC, a typical magnetic compass is fairly flat anyway. The needle doesn't have much room to pivot vertically even if the field lines were pointing toward the surface.

       Thank you for your response, and I'm sorry that you were banned from a forum.  I say that I'm sorry, because your response is one of the most logical and respectful that I have seen.  This is the type of discussion that is necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your response is the one that science currently accepts.  I do not know if we have actual evidence of this field, or if people are assuming that this is what creates the magnetism.  I do have some issues with this field model (in my thinking).  If the field extends between the two poles, then there are many places on the globe where that "inner earth" magnetism would be closer to the compass than the poles.  I also view the same problem for the proposal that the field is above the atmosphere.  There would be areas on the Earth, where the field is much closer to the poles.
      </p>
      <p>
       The major problem that I have, in the inner earth model, with the field passing from pole to pole, then the magnetic declination doesn't make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are right, a typical compass is definitely flat, but that is one of the reasons that I don't see the field coming from internal or external sources. I "feel" (no evidence) that the compass would bind if it was really aligning to the pole to pole field, and that a pole to pole field wouldn't need different magnetic and true norths, or else the entire field would be off (because there is no Southern Declination), becuase this would mean that it goes from the exact southern pole to magnetic north.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would love a 3d compass and some more research into the magnetism of the Earth.  It seems like much of it is assumptions.  I still understand that my propositions can be incorrect, but it's just me attempting to verbalize what I don't believe makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would also like to see some studies about magnetism that don't make assumptions of it based on assumed shape of the Earth.  We should be able to test and prove our magnetism aside from these things.  I'm not sure if there are unbiased magnetism studies (where the researcher didn't base their evidenced on their preconceived notions).
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it interesting that our North pole is actually the southern pole of a magnet.  For this reason, I think that either our pole is wrongly named, or that we name magnets incorrectly.  Why?  Because a positively charged compass needle points to the north.  Since magnetism is opposites attract, doesn't this mean that the Northern pole is negatively charged?  This doesn't change anything other than magnetism terminology.  If our North pole is a southern magnetic pole, then are there other assumptions in science that are incorrect also?  I believe there is room for error, and so I would like to see much more research done.

       You are very wrong in your first paragraph already - there is no discussion necessary. At all! Science is not an outcome of "discussions", subjective arguments, feelings, opinions about what sounds more logical, etc. Methods and results of science are objective and are not, and should not be influenced by particular perspectives, bias, interests, abilities to grasp concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, science is based on measurable, quantifiable, repeatable evidence, experimentation, scientific explanation... And once there is evidence-based scientific explanation for something it is true whether it makes sense to you or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you "feel" strongly about this, the only real option for you then is to educate yourself and then through scientific inquiry and experimentation establish an alternative explanation.

       indeed science that is bigger than what we can measure or experiment is about discussions, because that is what a theory is.  Don't lie and act like science isn't also based in assumption, because it is.

       You obviously have no clue at all what science is.

       Of course it starts from some assumptions, but then those assumptions are tested, scientific explanations are developed and validated through experiments, etc. Educate yourself on the scientific method at least.

       The magnetic field isn't

       </em>
       above the atmosphere or absent from the Earth's interior, it extends everywhere from the Earth's core (or close to it, I don't know enough to say offhand) into space. It's similar to the grade-school science experiment with
       <a href="http://buildingengineertraining.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/magnetic-lines-of-force.jpg">
        a bar magnet and iron filings

      <p>
       Well, the terms "North" and "South" predate the use of magnetic compasses, so it's possible a bar magnet's "North" pole was probably named so because it pointed north, and vise versa. We didn't really come up with the idea of positive and negative electric charges until the 1700s.

      <p>
       Given how simple an error it would be, it seems incredibly unlikely for it to even make it to the experiment stage, never mind peer review. If things like encyclopedias are wrong, you should be able to run simple experiments to check their results yourself.

       I'm not sure that the North/South thing is a big difference, BUT if our north pole is negatively charged, would that change how people view magnetism?  I have seen the bar and filings experiment, but I have never seen that a magnetometer would align parallel to the bar magnet.  Everything that I have seen shows that it would point to the top of the bar, and not the field.  This is where the distance becomes the issue, and the stronger pull would be from the pole.  This is one of the reasons that I don't understand what actually compasses align to.

       I don't imagine it would, but then again I'm a nerd, so maybe a "layman" might have a different perspective. Most sources that explain how compasses work that I remember (HS or college level) mention that earth's magnetic north pole is equivalent to the south pole of a bar magnet.

       I haven't used a magnetometer since high school, so I'm not sure if/how it differs from a typical compass, so I can't really say, honestly. It may have to do with the shape of Earth's magnetic field compared to a bar magnet's, or the difference in scale making declination way more obvious, but that's just an educated guess. You'd be better off asking someone in
       <a href="/r/askscience">

The first problem with that, is that they were not able to measure accurately 500 years ago.  Second, Newton (an actual brilliant mathematician) evaluated the Greek globe math, and commented that it did NOT prove anything, just that it showed that it could be a possibility.

       You should look into the Pythagoras ancient mystery/magic schools and how the Free Mason's adopted much of their traditions. Also, look into how many NASA astronauts are Free Masons. Is the Earth flat? I don't think so, I entertained the idea. But, I do think they are holding back a huge lie about things. What? idk.

       Indeed, I have found evidence of lies.  Many people feel that it's true that NASA lies, but they don't think that the lie is the shape of the Earth.  That is what my research has shown, but each person judges that for themselves.

       Would you be surprised to hear that Masons developed our court system (known as Inns of Court), and that Masons in Scottish and York rite take an oath of obligation saying that they will never testify against a brother.  So, there is a complete undermining of the court system.

       Neil Armstrong said that the astronauts were parrots, because they didn't fly very well and .... then he laughed.  I believe he was hinting that they just repeat what they are told .

       So are all the planets and the stars flat too? Flat earth is ridiculous. I'm sorry dude but, really?
      </p>
      <p>
       So OP, why are you doing this? Are you and/or this nonsensical subject  part of a social experiment at university or a fed agency even??

       What do you mean why am I doing this?  I started my research 6 months ago thinking that we were on a sphere.  I have looked for physical evidence in this world, and have found many lies perpetrated upon the public.  I came to find that the solar system model was bunk.  You can see this by looking at the southern star trails timelapses, which show circular movement only.  This proves that we simply rotate, and do not move around the sun.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many other lies with this.  I believe that Magnetic North and compasses are another tell of the lie of the shape of the Earth.  I also don't judge myself by what I see around us.  I believe in the Bible, and we are told that we are special.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe what you want, but I would suggest that you look at the horrible CGI of NASA's DSCOVR moon transit, that was called EPIC moon transit. It is easily spotted as fake.  To me, it is laughable, because I deal with graphics and video creation daily.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can create better images in After Effects with Element 3d at a fraction of the budget that NASA has.  You are making some wide accusations against me.  It is as if this is the first time that you have heard of Flat Earth theory.  Considering your virgin status, I would suggest that you do some research, and attempt to find the proof of a globe.  If you can find that, I will commend you.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you try to quote Greek mathematicians from 500 years ago, which some have quoted a 16% degree of error, then I would suggest that you look for some more precise and accurate sources of proof.  Also Sir Isaac Newton evaluated the Greek math, and he decided that it did not prove that the Earth was a globe.  It only showed it as a possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why, in 2015 do the Globe supporters lean on this Greek math as the proof of a globe?  That is ridiculous.  Keep pointing fingers at me jimmyb207.  You really are pointing out your ignorance and the fact that you have not studied this topic slightly.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may be surprising, but to look at a topic scientifically, you need to look at both sides unbiased.  You are very biased, and haven't even looked at the other side.  Good luck with that.

       So you're just confused at how a compass works. It aligns with the magnetic field.  It does not point to the source of the magnetic field, which is what you're wondering about in the original post).

       Actually, deviation is a change.  And yes magnetic north variation, is the amount of deviation of which you must compute for the difference between true north and magnetic north.  This doesn't prove a sphere, it just proves that true and magnetic are not at the same place.  And yes, that is a deviation.  Nice attempt to correct me, incorrectly.
