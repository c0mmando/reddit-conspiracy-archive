<p>We&#39;re not even in the battle to begin with, unfortunately. The TPP is a very secretive topic to international governments so I&#39;m not surprised you can&#39;t find anything on it.</p>

<p>If anything, it may be passed unofficially while we are busy dealing with international conflicts and fearing terrorist/extremist attacks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;we&quot; the people of the world got thoroughly fucked over becoz &#39;we&#39;were <em>not allowed to know about</em> 27 of 29 of the &#39;pacts&#39; made <em>until after</em> the fact.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the beginning of the end folks when shit like TPP&#39;s happen ... e.g. it &quot;allows&quot; for companies in countries <em>outside the US</em> who are &#39;participants&#39; in this &#39;pact&#39; to be charged under US trade laws etc etc ad naseum!</p>

<p>idk why you can&#39;t find any information about that, it&#39;s been in my news re: copyright infringement shit that it allows and &#39;internet controls&#39; etc FUCK!</p>

<p>everyone was too busy on FB to care</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The negotiations between the trade ministers/divisions of the 12 countries has concluded, and the  <a href="https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/trans-pacific-partnership/tpp-full-text">text</a> of the agreement has been finalized.  </p>

<p>What is left is for the governments of the individual countries to approve it.  The U.S. is among those nations that is waiting for approval.  Basically, the bill to approve the TPP hasn&#39;t been introduced into Congress yet, and so the TPP won&#39;t officially be in effect until this happens.  </p>

<p>Former Prime Minister of Canada, <a href="http://ottawacitizen.com/news/politics/historic-trade-deal-set-to-be-announced-sunday">Stephen Harper</a> said he expects the deal to be ratified in all of the countries within 2 years, and <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/trade-trans-pacific-partnership-214807">Politico</a> has said that they expect U.S. Congress to decide sometime during or after the Summer of 2016.</p>

<p>So you haven&#39;t &quot;lost&quot; the battle.</p>

<p>I actually support the TPP and if you would like to debate its merits, I would be more than happy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok, debate the merits please.</p>

<p>how will this benefit the people? the average people? the average salary workers?</p>

<p>and don&#39;t tell me, the job creators will save money and hence make us more jobs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, however I&#39;m not sure why you don&#39;t want me to tell you that benefits to job creators are good.  Before I begin, I want to address this issue:</p>

<p>Right now, in the status quo of global trade with the U.S., there exist tariffs, and other barriers to trade.  The TPP is meant to eliminate many of these barriers.  So by and large, American products will be more affordable for consumers in the other 11 countries and products of the other 11 countries will be more affordable in the U.S.</p>

<p>This is important for two reasons:</p>

<p><strong>1) It allows for businesses that rely on complex supply chains to operate at lower costs.</strong>  Imagine that you own car plant, or some other sort of manufacturing plant.  You buy tires, mufflers, spark plugs, etc. from tons of different parts of the world and assemble them to make a car.  The fact that there exist a large amount of export tariffs means that it costs more than it should for you to buy these products.  Your ability to buy them at lower cost will enable to you build more cars, operate more efficiently and expand, which includes hiring more workers and paying them better.</p>

<p><strong>2) Higher demand for American goods.</strong>  Many countries have restrictive import tariffs on American goods, such as Japan which has huge agricultural tariffs for the purpose of protecting their own domestic industry.  You&#39;ll have a hard time selling the cars you made to customers in Singapore and Malaysia because the tariffs on the vehicles are very high.  With many restrictive tariffs and other trade barriers eliminated, there will be higher demand for U.S. goods like agricultural products and cars in the other 11 nations because they will be cheaper.  This means that businesses that manufacture these products will make more money, and again, be able to hire more workers and pay them better due to the increased demand.</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/TPP-Overall-US-Benefits-Fact-Sheet.pdf">many other economic benefits</a> to this trade deal (as well as flaws), but besides economic benefit, there are <a href="http://blogs.cfr.org/renewing-america/2015/10/05/the-tpp-agreement-big-things-are-still-possible/">political/diplomatic benefits</a>.  I don&#39;t have time to write a full report right now, but if you have any questions about this or rebuttals, I&#39;ll be happy to address them.</p>

<p>I support the TPP because I have weighed the benefits versus the costs, and I believe that we stand to gain a lot from this deal.</p>
