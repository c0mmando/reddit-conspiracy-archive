       I'm not sure about Canada, but I don't think we "lost" the battle.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're not even in the battle to begin with, unfortunately. The TPP is a very secretive topic to international governments so I'm not surprised you can't find anything on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything, it may be passed unofficially while we are busy dealing with international conflicts and fearing terrorist/extremist attacks.

       You could try searching again using "TPP."

       It is going to take something spectacular to prevent the TPP from passing.  It will be interesting to see how it plays out.

       In case your using Google as a search engine I would recommend using a search engine that is less involved and in bed with the establishment because it is my understanding that they filter
       <em>
        certain things
       </em>
       out of your search results. I'll provide a link to an article about other search engines that may be useful, hopefully.

       The negotiations between the trade ministers/divisions of the 12 countries has concluded, and the
       <a href="https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/trans-pacific-partnership/tpp-full-text">
        text
       </a>
       of the agreement has been finalized.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is left is for the governments of the individual countries to approve it.  The U.S. is among those nations that is waiting for approval.  Basically, the bill to approve the TPP hasn't been introduced into Congress yet, and so the TPP won't officially be in effect until this happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Former Prime Minister of Canada,

        Stephen Harper

       said he expects the deal to be ratified in all of the countries within 2 years, and

        Politico

       has said that they expect U.S. Congress to decide sometime during or after the Summer of 2016.

      <p>
       Sure, however I'm not sure why you don't want me to tell you that benefits to job creators are good.  Before I begin, I want to address this issue:
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now, in the status quo of global trade with the U.S., there exist tariffs, and other barriers to trade.  The TPP is meant to eliminate many of these barriers.  So by and large, American products will be more affordable for consumers in the other 11 countries and products of the other 11 countries will be more affordable in the U.S.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is important for two reasons:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        1) It allows for businesses that rely on complex supply chains to operate at lower costs.
       </strong>
       Imagine that you own car plant, or some other sort of manufacturing plant.  You buy tires, mufflers, spark plugs, etc. from tons of different parts of the world and assemble them to make a car.  The fact that there exist a large amount of export tariffs means that it costs more than it should for you to buy these products.  Your ability to buy them at lower cost will enable to you build more cars, operate more efficiently and expand, which includes hiring more workers and paying them better.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        2) Higher demand for American goods.
       </strong>
       Many countries have restrictive import tariffs on American goods, such as Japan which has huge agricultural tariffs for the purpose of protecting their own domestic industry.  You'll have a hard time selling the cars you made to customers in Singapore and Malaysia because the tariffs on the vehicles are very high.  With many restrictive tariffs and other trade barriers eliminated, there will be higher demand for U.S. goods like agricultural products and cars in the other 11 nations because they will be cheaper.  This means that businesses that manufacture these products will make more money, and again, be able to hire more workers and pay them better due to the increased demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are
       <a href="https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/TPP-Overall-US-Benefits-Fact-Sheet.pdf">
        many other economic benefits
       </a>
       to this trade deal (as well as flaws), but besides economic benefit, there are
       <a href="http://blogs.cfr.org/renewing-america/2015/10/05/the-tpp-agreement-big-things-are-still-possible/">
        political/diplomatic benefits
       </a>
       .  I don't have time to write a full report right now, but if you have any questions about this or rebuttals, I'll be happy to address them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I support the TPP because I have weighed the benefits versus the costs, and I believe that we stand to gain a lot from this deal.
