    <div class="md"><p>It’s certainly true that Marvin Bush and Wirt Walker III both worked for a company called Securacom (later Stratesec), and that company did do some security work for the WTC. But even without researching this, you might wonder about the claim that they were “in charge of security for the World Trade Center”. After all, the WTC had its own security head, John O’Neill, who took up the job on August 23rd and died when the towers collapsed. And at least some of the security was provided by the Port Authority: David Lim, a Port Authority police officer, was stationed at the WTC with his bomb-sniffing dog Sirius. In fact Lim told the 9/11 Commission that the Port Authority police were responsible for the safety of those at the complex.</p>

<p>Your statement is the one which is untrue. The company changed its name and was given the fresh contract under its new name.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Stratesec was founded as Securacom (formerly the engineering firm Burns and Roe Securacom). It was reinvented shortly after the first Gulf War, and thereafter marketed large security contracts to big clients, including the World Trade Center, Washington’s Reagan National Airport and Dulles International Airport, various municipalities and airlines...</strong></p>

<p><strong>The investment company, called the Kuwait-American Corporation (KuwAm), backed and largely controlled a security company named Stratesec and an aircraft company named Aviation General. Both Stratesec and Aviation General convened their annual shareholders’ meetings from 1999 through 2001 in Suite 900 at the Watergate, then rented by the Saudi embassy...</strong></p>

<p><strong>Marvin P. Bush, the youngest brother of George W. Bush and a director of Stratesec, was reelected annually to his directorship there, near the Saudi Arabian Airlines offices. In 2002, the companies moved their shareholders meetings to the Watergate’s Suite 500, held by the Kuwaiti embassy...</strong></p>

<p><strong>Stratesec and Aviation General shared top executives, including Wirt D. Walker III, a distant relative “in the Walker branch of the Bush family,” according to a former colleague, and Mishal Yousef Saud Al Sabah of the Kuwaiti ruling family. Walker and Al Sabah also headed KuwAm, the backer of Stratesec and Aviation General.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it didn&#39;t, Stratesec had an ongoing contractor to handle security at the World Trade Center </p>

<blockquote>
<p>up to the day the buildings fell down - CEO Barry McDaniel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is also a fact (according to SEC filings) that this company also provided security for Dulles International Airport and United Airlines between 1995 and 2001. Two of the commandeered flights on September 11th were United Airlines&#39;, and one took off from Dulles</p>

<p>Marvin P. Bush, brother of George W. Bush, was a principal in the company between 1993 and 2000, again, this is a fact, he was a past principle.</p>

<p>So op is correct, WTC security <strong>WAS</strong> provided by company linked directly to the Bush crime family.</p>

<p>I think the confusion/dishonesty arises because Stratesec was previously called Securacom until the 1999/2000 fiscal year.</p>
