       Yes. And along with it, the religion of scientism. Not actual science, but the worship of the scientific establishment's theories, which may be warped by their funding and papers published and edited by biased gatekeepers. Science is great, but it's not a bulletproof way to understand the world like many seem to be under the impression. A long time ago people had this conviction about religion too, that it was a bulletproof way of understanding everything. I think what you say is very true.

       Without doubt, the scientific method is a great and valuable tool helping make sense of the universe and how it works. What I find so problematic about the current  popular understanding of "science" is that it has become shorthand for "absolute truth" and replaces critical thinking skills, by externalizing thinking processes. "All experts agree", "what is your degree" - $cience has become a cult complete with high priests, saints and believers unable to understand the language of their holy scriptures. No real opinion on things that matter can be formed anymore because "the topic is too complex". This development is utterly undemocratic and tyrannical.

       Then maybe ya know, like educate yourself on the matter. There's soooo much information in the world. To be able to sift through and actually employ critical thinking skills you need to know what is going. Boasting of ignorance does not bolster your argument.

       That is the point I was trying to make, though. Have you ever had a discussion about the "collapse" of the Twin Towers, for example? "There were no demolition devices because a.) planes (post hoc ergo propter hoc), b) the experts said so (appeal to authority), c) structural dynamics is more complicated than Newton's Laws of Motion (appeal to complexity), d) I don't believe the government would so such a thing (strawman, appeal to personal incredulity), e) I don't understand the experts and so you don't either (argumentum ad ignorantiam)."
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence, your LPT is of limited value, as it premises critical thinking as a given. That this skill is actively discouraged in our education system and academia, and even frowned upon by society, is a very dangerous, antidemocratic development and the matter of this discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what I'm saying is "scientific method, critical thinking, knowledge yeah - $cience, externalized thinking and ignorance boo" and that makes me a conspiracy theorist. Who, btw, survived the Prussian education system

       My premise is that the abundance of video footage is the strongest evidence. All else follows from the assumption it shows what happened and was not CGI. After that, I take your advice and inform myself on the laws of motion. Then I compare the various analyses by different experts. I also perform an experiment or two or more to try and falsify or verify the allegations. Now I consider my opinion well-founded and
       <em>
        supported
       </em>
       by experts - but it does not
       <em>
        rely
       </em>
       on them, as in, I don't have to appeal to their authority to make my case. But I know I could be wrong and am even looking forward to be proven wrong, because each time I learn something new.

       This Prussian system was brought to assimilate the large numbers of rural people and immigrants of the time into the rapidly urbanizing country.  Yes, it's also true that the system was designed primarily to make them good workers.

        In our dream we have limitless resources, and the people yield themselves with perfect docility to our molding hand. The present educational conventions fade from our minds; and, unhampered by tradition, we work our own good will upon a grateful and responsive rural folk. We shall not try to make these people or any of their children into philosophers or men of learning or of science. We are not to raise up among them authors, orators, poets, or men of letters. We shall not search for embryo great artists, painters, musicians. Nor will we cherish even the humbler ambition to raise up from among them lawyers, doctors, preachers, statesmen, of whom we now have ample supply. We are to follow the admonitions of the good apostle, who said, "mind not high things, but condescend to men of low degree."

       Frederick Gates sounds about as smug and psychotic as they get. This world has truly been hammered on by evil, not in a religious sense, but by its very definition, for a very longtime now.

       I feel intellectually lobotomized at the same time as feeling, honestly, like I'm smarter than many of the people that I meet on a daily basis, which to me is very sad because I am not by any means extraordinary in any sense other than the fact that I have an open mind. Really -- our awful education system compounded with what is a poor excuse for modern culture has left me feeling slow, regretful, and most of all unable to explain the choices I make on a daily basis because I make choices based on emotion rather than rationality, as I have been taught to since I was a child. Now I do as much as I can within my power to change this -- mostly by educating myself about the world around me, but in the end neuroplasticity is greatest during adolescence and because of the state of our underwhelming education system I feel I haven't met my potential because as a young boy I was confined by the inherent structure of modern education.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, have you ever read the thoughts of a layperson of merely a century ago? Their diction... their capacity for language and just overall competence makes me sad and wonder about the future of humanity. In another century will we have digressed even more from whatever our natural state is? I know every generation ever recorded in history thinks that the following generation is going to shit, but even so I can't help but agreeing.

       Almost everything, EVERYTHING these shit heads says sounds right at home in r/iamverysmart. Every time I hear a quote from these douche licks, it always gives me this same reviled feeling in my stomache. I'm wondering what the fuck is going with these people, I mean, honestly, are they actually human? I feel like more they are just beasts.

       Obedient workers are good for the nation's elites and today our nation's elites are industrialists. They want workers, to steal a quote from George Carlin,
       <em>
        just smart enough to work the machines and do the paperwork
       </em>
       but not smart enough to know they are slaves and not in any position to take control of their lives. Creativity is the biggest enemy and that's why rote is used. They want memorization, not critical thinking.

       The peace revolution podcast has a bunch of stuff on the trivium and Prussian education. They draw HEAVILY from Gene Odening and have even got a marathon interview with Gato (it's like six or twelve hours long or something crazy like that, quite a few gems). They're pretty Ayndroidy, but if you're into that sort of thing they spend a lot of time on objectivism as well.

       America is a gigantic corporation attempting to constrict the world. Of course it wants a one world system with alot of plebs, few middle class as govt workers/corporate desk jockies and a dynastic upper class. It is plain to see.

       Op left out the story behind it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Originally prussian education focused on common sense and fostering the ability to think for yourself. Sadly it worked too well.  At war soldiers would break formation and rather try to save themself than follow orders wich caused much heavier losses than necessary and ultimatively defeat . After a shocking defeat that should have been a clear victory they decided that they had to change education to get soldiers that would follow orders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clearly we still have people who think for themself today but the goal was as stated.
