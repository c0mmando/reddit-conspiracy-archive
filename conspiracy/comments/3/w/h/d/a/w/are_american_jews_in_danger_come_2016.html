        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have noticed a lot of blatant (what I believe to be antisemitsm) in the mainstream media which has been becoming more and  more blatant as we reach 2016. YouTube rewind for 2k15 made it really obvious that Jewish people were &quot;rats&quot; and we&#39;re not welcome at the party with virtually every other race present. There was also a lot of emphasis on Flula and other German yoitubers, and yoitubers around the world yelling things that really echoed the vibe of Hitler. Also, I am getting a very eerie feeling from ads and mainstream adverts, talk shows bad YouTube videos with obvious repetitions of numbers and nose touching gestures. Not to mention, how obvious it is that people don&#39;t like Jews in the first place. I believe people are going to be hired and screened to become Jew hunters hidden through advertisements stating they want people to sign up for something as simple as being a valet parker, yet the requirements say something that sounds more like a recruit to the military. Also, no one is even mentioning Jews in a casual way and I am wondering where the Jews are at. Are they just retarded? What is the significance of a cat and putting people to sleep? I am so curious because I feel like everyone is aware of something but not openly admitting it. What&#39;s going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.</p>

<p>There is virtually no &quot;anti-semitism&quot; in America and Jews are one of the wealthiest and most powerful ethnic groups in America.</p>

<p>&quot;Anti-semitism&quot; is simply a slur word used by Zionists to distract from Israel&#39;s crimes.</p>

<p>If anything, the real problem in America is Europhobia, ironically, often coming from the same Jews pretending to be worried about &quot;anti-semitism.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People denying the obvious ostracizatiom of Jews are exactly what I&#39;m talking about, most of you are holocaust deniers who like Hitler and openly admit it, anyway. Just because Jews are wealthy doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t being targeted for social scrutiny, which is being heavily perpetuated by the media. Obviously there is a collective consciousness that is all about being &quot;saved&quot; and talking about cats, sleep, cigarettes, etc. It&#39;s painfully obvious, I just can&#39;t believe no other Jews in my direct knowledge have caught on. Anyways, I believe every other group that is being mentioned openly in the media is a diversion from the true targets. Jews have already faced slavery in more than one point in history yet are the only people who barely get empathy or acknowledged for it. I don&#39;t think we should victimize ourselves but I do think we need to open our eyes if we don&#39;t want social ostrqcixation to become actual banishment </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The media is very close to flay out saying that they want Jews dead, especially if you watch Conan and other Talk shows. They aren&#39;t targeting black people at all, in fact I also believe that they are trying to perpetuate that black people are rising to the top (of course this is also a game being perpetuated by the people behind the scenes) right now in amrrica, black people are being used as uncle Toms and helping the wasps in targeting jews. Many black people are interview hosts with the same intention as the white ones, and I keep hearing the mention of Beyonce and Chris rock. This may sound racist on my end, but I do think that there is a generation of &quot;neo nazi nigg♡♡&quot; and that they are playing the role as messenger for the higher ups. If you watch Pharrel interviewing Henry Rollins than you will see the obvious intention in trying to get him to say sit about, what I believ3, are jews. Also, the people that the media have openly called anti semis such as Walt Disney and Mel Gibson are actually the only people I believe who weren&#39;t actually anti semites and because of that they were trying to pin them as that. Just watch Mel Gibson interview with Barbara Walters or one of those white chick&#39;s where they are trying to bring him out as an anti semites and he&#39;s just like &quot;oh yeahhhhh... definitely&quot; just to get through the interview. Literally, there is a code being used by everyone in the media in every video that gets published by a large corperation. Notice the celebs who mention specific numbers gratiutously, touch their nose,etc. And then notice the ones who keep their hands glued to their legs and try to be vague with numbers and dares . Of course, I believe each celebrity who is on television fornappearances has to do these codes at least once but the cool ones do it very sporadically just to get it out of the way. This is the illuminati happening right before our eyes, illuminati meaning &quot;enlightened&quot; which is now meaning christian. The pentagram looks like a Jewish star and the new world order refers to christianty . Muslims are being targeted as a diversion because Conan went to tucking Armenia and
 was very nice to the people making their food, aren&#39;t Armenians muslim? When do u ever hear a Jew in Hollywood be talked about positivrly. You guys are in denial and it&#39;s pissing me off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im not in denial. I agree with some of the things you said, im just saying I dont see it as much as you say it happens. Also, armenians are VERY MUCH CHRISTIAN, infact armenia is <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Armenia">93% CHRISTIAN</a></p>

<p>Also, i think its neccesary you make the distintion between news/talk shows and hollywood. Many news/talk shows are run in new york and elsewhere and are not usually run by hollywood. Also, hollywood has many large and famous jewish directors and jewish company owners who i doubt would let people tak bad about jews in their productions. the anti-semitism I see is in the talk shows and the news, not so much the movies.</p>
