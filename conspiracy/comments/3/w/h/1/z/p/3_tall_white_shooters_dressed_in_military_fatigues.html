       Why has Sally and several other eye witness accounts not been discussed in the media? The only eye witness accounts I have found describe 3 shooters, tall with athletic build, and white.  Not a single eye witness account describes two shooters, one short and 90 lbs.

       This is bothering me a lot, too. Almost all evidence against the two couple has been questionable at best. Gun range for practice? Takes out a loan? -- because they thought they can pass that loan through inheritance without passing along the liability?
       <em>
        That's their planning?
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, it scares me how nonchalant people are to dismiss the problem of all this evidence.
       <em>
        Well, yeah, but they did it. This is just more evidence...
       </em>
       Where is the proof that they did it? An unknown source confirmed they
       <em>
        recognized
       </em>
       a voice of a masked man?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no faith in the media or the government anymore. And there's no one to talk to about this because everyone lashes at you for talking about a conspiracy.
       <em>
        Why would the government do that?
       </em>
       To start a war? I have no idea.
       <em>
        That's insane; you're insane.
       </em>
       That's it? I'm insane for suspecting the military / intelligence departments for being corrupt? Why?
       <em>
        You have no proof!
       </em>
       We have no proof against it either!
       <em>
        Yeah, but you're the only one who is asking questions; you're the odd one.
       </em>
       I know. I've never felt more alone.

       And what's worse is that it appears that someone encouraged all those reporters to go trash the couple's house to destroy any evidence that might have been used to exonerate them.

       Yeah, I'm curious as to what evidence the state has provided that either of these two were actually at the site of the shooting. Let's assume the pipe bombs at the apartment and the police chase and shootout went exactly as described, none of that is evidence that they were at the shooting. And conveniently, having no living people to try means there will never be an official record in the courts. But the information, at least what is being released, is certainly lacking here.

       It's so bazaar to me how people turn in their Tvs and immediately start chatting around the water cooler about the things those "official" reporters said. I guess the "dumbing down" of America makes much more sense now.

       Does it? Because the shit seems pretty evenly distributed among all corporate media. It's all distractions and/or lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just pick which micro-agendas matter to you more (gun rights, gay marriage, immigration, even legal weed, dude...), then pick your favorite distractions. All of that guides you to a party to follow (one of two viable options in this country, both are just as shitty and are controlled by a lot of the same businessmen and scums with inherited wealth) and will also lead you to the proper media to ingest and likeminded friends to hang out with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pick a political team, a sports team, a side in Counter Strike, and don't worry, it doesn't matter which ones you pick. You're still a slave and a whore at the mercy of our 'capitalist overlords' and their brainwashed mercenaries (domestic and overseas) who are our brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, parents and friends...assimilated by what we call "civilized" society, and ready to lock us up, drug us up, or shoot us if we don't conform well enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now don't get me wrong, I don't believe in freedom without limits in society, total anarchy, but I don't like the way we seem to have been made into (born into), at our own expense and suffering, a moneymaking machine for a selfish minority.

       Lol, he even said "I didn't do it!" as they caught him in the woods, not even knowing what all the police were there in the first place.   Cause when I'm in the woods and a bunch of police surround me and I'm dressed in cammo gear, the first thing I say I is, "I didn't do it."  Uhg, the police are worthless.

        [Camo pants man] was heading there Friday morning to help make gingerbread houses with first-graders when he heard popping sounds and smelled sulfur.He ran around the school trying to reach his daughter and was briefly handcuffed by police. He later found his child, who had been locked in a small room with a teacher.

       Thank you. Also, he smelled sulfur? The extent of my experience is gun ranges &amp; shooting in the fields behind our house, but this seems odd to me. How close must he have been to smell sulfur and if he was that close wouldn't it have sounded a little worse than 'pops'??

       It's pretty easy to tell the difference between a swat officer and what they described.
      </p>
      <p>
       The men that were described had tan boots, which isn't swat gear. Doesn't swat also label themselves on their uniforms? It'd be hard to miss the big white letters that say SWAT

       In victim psychology it's often noted that witnesses who face armed suspects fixate on the weapons the suspects were carrying, and have difficulty recalling other identifying features, which could easily account for misidentifying the number of suspects and the generic descriptions they provided.

       One of the eye witnesses saw the three men before LE was anywhere near the scene, from what I understood listening to her tell it she witnessed the three shooters at the very beginning of the event.

       My question is what is the conspiracy "angle" to actually have 3 shooters, then try to fool everyone into thinking it was really only 2? Even assuming the "official" shooters were patsies, wouldn't you want to frame them by sending out the same number of people to do the shooting? I can't conceive of any reason to add this huge loose end and extra complexity to a false flag attack.

       Maybe (just maybe) it was actually two shooters and we're giving WAAY too much credit to one witness (out of dozens) who only saw the masked shooters, fleetingly through a window during a high stress moment?

       Are there interviews with the other (dozens of) witnesses which contradict the three shooter scenario? Not a gotcha question, I genuinely haven't read of any.

       Yes there are quite a bit. Paula Harold for example saw one shooter "blacked out" to the point of not being able to see skin color. Nearly every other witness is saying it was impossible to tell skin color. My phone is shite or Id link you some more interviews. I understand this one particular witnesses story is different so it's exciting to the subreddit, but if we're going off eye witness reports (based on faulty human memory during a high stress moment); Im more inclined to believe the reports that match.

       I'm not inclined to believe anything without proof or at least compelling evidence. So many extraordinary claims being made by "officials" and nothing to back up their assertions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why can't we see CCTV from the Riverside gun range, the Inland Regional Center and/or police dash cams? We've seen photos and videos quickly released under very similar circumstances in the past, including active shooters and rolling gun battles with police.

       Security cameras? If the video corroborated the narrative, it would have been released by now. Show me one picture of the couple, in possession of the rifles or IEDs.

       There's zero proof of any claims by investigators. The neighbor, in the booby hatch, is the 'reliable source' for several of them.

       No, that's not true at all. In cases like this law enforcement only releases still pictures or rarely video to help identify the suspects. As the suspects had already been captured hours later, there was no need to release anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       All video and photos and other visual evidence is almost always not released because it will be used at trial.

       It's not that they are hiding the truth, its that the video footage is being used to prepare a criminal case, and releasing it would jeopardize the case.

       Yes, it is.  But probably reasonable.  Police investigate eyewitness reports.  Reporters ask police about such rumors/statements.

       Maybe they heard about one anothers stories, and converged on a common story.  Or reporters heard the story from one witness, then went around asking other people "did you see 3 white guys ?"

       I'm pretty sure the police have lots of evidence supporting the case that the Muslim couple did it.  They did have a car-chase where they shot at police and then were killed, their apartment was full of stuff, etc.  More reliable than witnesses.

       I pulled this from your link. This is what you say proves the couple were the ones shooting at police?
      </p>
      <p>
       I could just as easily say that it shows a carjacker holding the couple hostage. (it's evidence of neither)

       Well, if shots come from a car, police shoot the people in the car, then pull the bodies out and ID them, is that evidence ?  I assume the police will do gunpowder-residue tests on the hands and faces, fingerprints, etc.  All the usual stuff.

       Have you seen any of this evidence? How do you know there was a car chase with a shoot out?  Reporters destroyed any possible evidence when they were let into the house 48 hours after the attack. What evidence do you have that the rest of us dont?

       No, of course you and I haven't seen the police evidence.  Does that mean it doesn't exist ?  Don't police routinely collect evidence ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Police got to the apartment first, so there probably was no relevant evidence left when the reporters got to it.  How did the reporters destroy evidence ?  They would have broadcast anything relevant that they saw (weapons, manifestos, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem to be in the classic conspiracy theory trap: you have jumped to a desired conclusion, you have no evidence, lack of evidence in your hands must be evidence of a conspiracy.

       For one, this is the first time in recorded history that police opened a crime scene to reporters after less than 48 hours.  Also, this was the most violent, deadly attack of "terrorism" since 9/11, according to the media.  You say there was "no evidence left when reporters got to it". You can look up reporter footage, there are ID cards, passports, financial papers, etc etc, you dont think any of those items would be evidence in such a high profile terrorist case? Are you fucking stupid? When there is a report on a street murder or robbery we are always shown photos of the crime scene, the victime, the attacker, etc.  Why not in this case? Not a single clip from a security camera? We all know the building had cameras all over the place, but magically that is all off limits or destroyed.  If you are going to honestly sit there and say there is nothing strange about the media rampage of the crime scene, then you have absolutely zero credibility.

       Three things wrong with that:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Probably far from the first time police searched a scene and then told occupants/landlord "okay, we're done" and removed the crime-scene tape and such, in 48 hours..
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The police didn't open the scene to reporters, the landlord did that.

       <li>

         Most violent, deadly attack of "terrorism" since 9/11 ?  Wasn't even the most violent, deadly attack of "terrorism" THIS MONTH; Paris attacks get that award.

       Also possible that person 1 said "I saw three white guys", person 2 repeated it to person 3, who then said "yeah, I think I seem to remember seeing them too".

       Several problems with the eyewitness testimony:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) It seems very rehearsed. "Military fatigues" is an oddly specific way to identify that style of clothing. There are many other phrases that could have been used, like "camo clothing," "body armor," "military clothes," and many more. The fact that all of the eyewitnesses whose testimony differ all share the same key phrases is suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) In victim psychology it's often noted that witnesses who face armed suspects fixate on the weapons the suspects were carrying, and have difficulty recalling other identifying features, which could easily account for misidentifying the number of suspects and the generic descriptions they provided. It's a high-stress situation and they likely only got a peek at the suspects for a split-second hiding.

       Only the "military fatigues" language was not consistent. The witness also described "black cargo style pants with puffy pockets", " some sort of vest", "extra ammo clips", "White skin", "Tall, athletic build". 
The language between eye witnesses varied quite a bit.  Also, the eye witnesses didnt just focus on the guns.

       It seems like you're grasping at different explanations to back your opinion, but they slightly contradict themselves, imo. Either she was under too much stress to make a reliable statement or she's full of it and telling a rehearsed story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I would personally use the word 'fatigues', I might say 'Army fatigues' or some very close variant, but I would personally describe them as fatigues without being coerced into doing so. I'm not trying to devalue your opinion because I have no concrete evidence to do so, but a proper debate makes room for all views.

       Why? I mean, I'm not just trying to argue here, I just don't understand the generalization of why middle aged ethnic women don't use that term? This is Southern California, I'm 45 mins from there personally but there's a huge military community here with so many big bases close to us. She could have a son in the military, or a teen who plays a lot of military themed video games, or just heard it on one of the various TV shows. Again, no disrespect, imo there's so much misinformation out there adding to the confusion.

       Oops posted wrong place....
I would not think a woman would use the word fatigues at all. And that possibility would go down farther if English was a second language like a lot of our mothers (I'm not far from San berdoo also). There's a lot of immigrants here, and for example, the 14 victims of the shooting, most had "foreign" sounding (not European based) names. I think even with a kid I'm the military few people would pick up on properly calling a military uniform 'fatigues'. If it was dialogue in a movie, it would not ring true to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       But,I'm totally speculating of course.

       I definitely hear you &amp; you have valid points. Unfortunately in a chaotic event like this reported by media &amp; gov't who are next level untrustworthy the full truth is never known. But speculation is healthy, not questioning leaves a lack of accountability &amp; that's no bueno. 
I do have a lot of access to LE &amp; military in my life. Friends in high school starting in Explorers, some becoming cops &amp; some joining military. My best friend and also my sister married marines so you could say my view on using that term is a bit biased. Fatigues or camos are what I've always known then as. And yes, the population of immigrants, most who don't speak Spanish at all, are less likely. Thank you, I honestly wasn't arguing but just saying she wouldn't because she's an older foreign woman didn't sit right. Thanks again.

       It looks like it comes from their family's lawyer primarily, David Chelsey, as part of his effort to cast doubt on the official story.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to see some real documentation on her size. (My guess is the pig was at least 120 lbs).  But even if it was 90 lbs, does that preclude the possibility that she could fire an assault rifle?  After all, there have been "ISIS" videos lately that depict young boys, as young as 8, and certainly under 90 lbs executing Syrian rebels with similar weapons.

       How is doubting the official story "his effort to cast doubt on the official story"? Do you understand the difference? Just because someone questions the many oddities with this case does not mean they are trying to spread propaganda, it just means they have doubts. I think blindly believing the official story with all its holes, is way more dishonest and dangerous.
