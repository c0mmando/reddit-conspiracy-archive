    <div class="md"><p>This is bothering me a lot, too. Almost all evidence against the two couple has been questionable at best. Gun range for practice? Takes out a loan? -- because they thought they can pass that loan through inheritance without passing along the liability? <em>That&#39;s their planning?</em></p>

<p>Seriously, it scares me how nonchalant people are to dismiss the problem of all this evidence. <em>Well, yeah, but they did it. This is just more evidence...</em> Where is the proof that they did it? An unknown source confirmed they <em>recognized</em> a voice of a masked man?</p>

<p>I have no faith in the media or the government anymore. And there&#39;s no one to talk to about this because everyone lashes at you for talking about a conspiracy. <em>Why would the government do that?</em> To start a war? I have no idea. <em>That&#39;s insane; you&#39;re insane.</em> That&#39;s it? I&#39;m insane for suspecting the military / intelligence departments for being corrupt? Why? <em>You have no proof!</em> We have no proof against it either! <em>Yeah, but you&#39;re the only one who is asking questions; you&#39;re the odd one.</em> I know. I&#39;ve never felt more alone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;m curious as to what evidence the state has provided that either of these two were actually at the site of the shooting. Let&#39;s assume the pipe bombs at the apartment and the police chase and shootout went exactly as described, none of that is evidence that they were at the shooting. And conveniently, having no living people to try means there will never be an official record in the courts. But the information, at least what is being released, is certainly lacking here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does it? Because the shit seems pretty evenly distributed among all corporate media. It&#39;s all distractions and/or lies.</p>

<p>Just pick which micro-agendas matter to you more (gun rights, gay marriage, immigration, even legal weed, dude...), then pick your favorite distractions. All of that guides you to a party to follow (one of two viable options in this country, both are just as shitty and are controlled by a lot of the same businessmen and scums with inherited wealth) and will also lead you to the proper media to ingest and likeminded friends to hang out with.</p>

<p>Pick a political team, a sports team, a side in Counter Strike, and don&#39;t worry, it doesn&#39;t matter which ones you pick. You&#39;re still a slave and a whore at the mercy of our &#39;capitalist overlords&#39; and their brainwashed mercenaries (domestic and overseas) who are our brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, parents and friends...assimilated by what we call &quot;civilized&quot; society, and ready to lock us up, drug us up, or shoot us if we don&#39;t conform well enough.</p>

<p>Now don&#39;t get me wrong, I don&#39;t believe in freedom without limits in society, total anarchy, but I don&#39;t like the way we seem to have been made into (born into), at our own expense and suffering, a moneymaking machine for a selfish minority.</p>

<p>In victim psychology it&#39;s often noted that witnesses who face armed suspects fixate on the weapons the suspects were carrying, and have difficulty recalling other identifying features, which could easily account for misidentifying the number of suspects and the generic descriptions they provided. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My question is what is the conspiracy &quot;angle&quot; to actually have 3 shooters, then try to fool everyone into thinking it was really only 2? Even assuming the &quot;official&quot; shooters were patsies, wouldn&#39;t you want to frame them by sending out the same number of people to do the shooting? I can&#39;t conceive of any reason to add this huge loose end and extra complexity to a false flag attack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes there are quite a bit. Paula Harold for example saw one shooter &quot;blacked out&quot; to the point of not being able to see skin color. Nearly every other witness is saying it was impossible to tell skin color. My phone is shite or Id link you some more interviews. I understand this one particular witnesses story is different so it&#39;s exciting to the subreddit, but if we&#39;re going off eye witness reports (based on faulty human memory during a high stress moment); Im more inclined to believe the reports that match.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not inclined to believe anything without proof or at least compelling evidence. So many extraordinary claims being made by &quot;officials&quot; and nothing to back up their assertions.</p>

<p>Why can&#39;t we see CCTV from the Riverside gun range, the Inland Regional Center and/or police dash cams? We&#39;ve seen photos and videos quickly released under very similar circumstances in the past, including active shooters and rolling gun battles with police.</p>

<p>No, that&#39;s not true at all. In cases like this law enforcement only releases still pictures or rarely video to help identify the suspects. As the suspects had already been captured hours later, there was no need to release anything.</p>

<p>All video and photos and other visual evidence is almost always not released because it will be used at trial. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not that they are hiding the truth, its that the video footage is being used to prepare a criminal case, and releasing it would jeopardize the case. </p>

<p>I pulled this from your link. This is what you say proves the couple were the ones shooting at police?</p>

<p>I could just as easily say that it shows a carjacker holding the couple hostage. (it&#39;s evidence of neither)</p>

<p>Police got to the apartment first, so there probably was no relevant evidence left when the reporters got to it.  How did the reporters destroy evidence ?  They would have broadcast anything relevant that they saw (weapons, manifestos, etc).</p>

<p>You seem to be in the classic conspiracy theory trap: you have jumped to a desired conclusion, you have no evidence, lack of evidence in your hands must be evidence of a conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For one, this is the first time in recorded history that police opened a crime scene to reporters after less than 48 hours.  Also, this was the most violent, deadly attack of &quot;terrorism&quot; since 9/11, according to the media.  You say there was &quot;no evidence left when reporters got to it&quot;. You can look up reporter footage, there are ID cards, passports, financial papers, etc etc, you dont think any of those items would be evidence in such a high profile terrorist case? Are you fucking stupid? When there is a report on a street murder or robbery we are always shown photos of the crime scene, the victime, the attacker, etc.  Why not in this case? Not a single clip from a security camera? We all know the building had cameras all over the place, but magically that is all off limits or destroyed.  If you are going to honestly sit there and say there is nothing strange about the media rampage of the crime scene, then you have absolutely zero credibility. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Several problems with the eyewitness testimony:</p>

<p>1) It seems very rehearsed. &quot;Military fatigues&quot; is an oddly specific way to identify that style of clothing. There are many other phrases that could have been used, like &quot;camo clothing,&quot; &quot;body armor,&quot; &quot;military clothes,&quot; and many more. The fact that all of the eyewitnesses whose testimony differ all share the same key phrases is suspicious. </p>

<p>2) In victim psychology it&#39;s often noted that witnesses who face armed suspects fixate on the weapons the suspects were carrying, and have difficulty recalling other identifying features, which could easily account for misidentifying the number of suspects and the generic descriptions they provided. It&#39;s a high-stress situation and they likely only got a peek at the suspects for a split-second hiding. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oops posted wrong place....
I would not think a woman would use the word fatigues at all. And that possibility would go down farther if English was a second language like a lot of our mothers (I&#39;m not far from San berdoo also). There&#39;s a lot of immigrants here, and for example, the 14 victims of the shooting, most had &quot;foreign&quot; sounding (not European based) names. I think even with a kid I&#39;m the military few people would pick up on properly calling a military uniform &#39;fatigues&#39;. If it was dialogue in a movie, it would not ring true to me.</p>

<p>But,I&#39;m totally speculating of course.</p>

I do have a lot of access to LE &amp; military in my life. Friends in high school starting in Explorers, some becoming cops &amp; some joining military. My best friend and also my sister married marines so you could say my view on using that term is a bit biased. Fatigues or camos are what I&#39;ve always known then as. And yes, the population of immigrants, most who don&#39;t speak Spanish at all, are less likely. Thank you, I honestly wasn&#39;t arguing but just saying she wouldn&#39;t because she&#39;s an older foreign woman didn&#39;t sit right. Thanks again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, he even said &quot;I didn&#39;t do it!&quot; as they caught him in the woods, not even knowing what all the police were there in the first place.   Cause when I&#39;m in the woods and a bunch of police surround me and I&#39;m dressed in cammo gear, the first thing I say I is, &quot;I didn&#39;t do it.&quot;  Uhg, the police are worthless. </p>

<p>So it&#39;s a lone wolf scenario now?</p>

<p>Im more inclined to believe the reports that match.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not inclined to believe anything without proof or at least compelling evidence. So many extraordinary claims being made by &quot;officials&quot; and nothing to back up their assertions.</p>

<p>Why can&#39;t we see CCTV from the Riverside gun range, the Inland Regional Center and/or police dash cams? We&#39;ve seen photos and videos quickly released under very similar circumstances in the past, including active shooters and rolling gun battles with police.</p>
