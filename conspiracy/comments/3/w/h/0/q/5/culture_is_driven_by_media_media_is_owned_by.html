        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://cdn.ientry.com/sites/webpronews/article_pics/Media_consolidation.jpg">Infographic about headline</a></p>

<p>Our culture is owned by a very powerful few, it is not generated by us. Many of you know this, but it needs to be repeated again for those who are unsure or do not know. </p>

<p>This is how we are controlled, because we do not even control our own culture. </p>

<p>CNN does not deliver news, it delivers propaganda. MSNBC delivers Democrat propaganda, Fox News delivers Republican propaganda. Both have endless material of the other being idiots, because they <em>are</em> both idiots. Statist, pro-coporate, anti-american fear-mongering idiots who are all told what to say by AP and Reuters. 5 of the 6 media companies in the infographic as well as AP and Reuters are controlled by Zionists, which is a religious ideology that believes that Jews have a special right the land around Israel, which gives them justification to keep attacking Palestinians. Basically Zionism is a religious shield behind which the Israeli government hides behind while it commits atrocities. It really has nothing to do with religion or race, just with power.</p>

<p>Even TV channels that seem innocuous have an agenda simply because they&#39;re run by corporations which are profit and power-seeking entities, run by power-seeking people. BET strongly guides African-American culture by creating a culture that African-Americans see as organically African-American, but it is corporate and consumerist. Perfectly materialist. It also controls how <em>white</em> people perceive blacks in America. It does not empower them or us. It is divide and conquer, it drives a wedge between the races. Because blacks in America do not own the media, they do not own the culture. So it is corporate culture, it is consumer culture. Almost all our media is, I&#39;d guess 95%. This isn&#39;t to say it&#39;s without entertainment value, or that it isn&#39;t good drama or good comedy or what have you. This isn&#39;t about that. This is about the bias within those shows, certain ideas being unrelentingly omitted, creating a blackout of information in certain areas of knowledge in American culture. Like Noam Chomsky says, “The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum.” </p>

<p>Humans control other humans not with physical fences, but instead fences of the mind, wherein certain areas of thought are cordoned off. If we buy in to the ideologies given to us by the powerful, we end up believing these cordoned-off areas are that way for our own good and so we never explore them out of fear or &quot;respect&quot;. Christianity and many other religions are also very guilty of this. We may be afraid of talking about these ideas in public. We may be afraid of thinking them to ourselves, even in the privacy of our own minds! Who needs a physical fence when you can control what a person is afraid to think about, and therefore do? Reinforcing a culture of anti-intellectualism also strengthens this attitude, it makes people fear the cordoned-off areas more.  </p>

<p>Disney Channel, Fox News, MSNBC, HGTV, Golf Channel, ESPN. It is corporate media and therefore promotes corporate culture. There are occasional bright spots like The Simpsons or The Daily Show, but even these things are controlled to some degree by the censors and by what is needed to maintain their high paychecks. </p>

<p>Buy this, buy that. Feel bad for x (your hair, your lawn, your friends), fix it by buying y (shampoo, lawnmower, alcohol). The strategy of Problem-Reaction-Solution. Create a problem (or the appearance of one), people react in a negative way, then you sell them the solution to fix it. It&#39;s a predictable and profitable pattern of human behavior, and boy do they know it. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duCSoK4F6Dc">Create your own culture. Create your own music. Create your own YouTube channel. Share it with everyone. This is how humanity advances, by simply outgrowing corporate culture. Aren&#39;t you tired of it? I am.</a></p>

<p>Let&#39;s step outside the boundaries created for us by all this fear, and be who we want to be. Say the things we really wish to say, even if it&#39;s &quot;socially improper.&quot; The truth is powerful, and the powerful don&#39;t want us to say the truth. Too bad. I&#39;ve had enough beating around the bush, haven&#39;t you? This is real life, and we only get one shot. There&#39;s no previous save files to load. This isn&#39;t a dress rehearsal. This is it. I&#39;m not going to spend it being afraid of reasonably stepping outside the perceived boundaries of our American corporate-owned culture. Are you? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We keep hearing this--mostly from Jan Irving of Gnostic Media--but I disagree with it.  As much as I just love love love Jan Irving&#39;s pleasant and open nature.</p>

<p>Jan based his conclusion on a combination of 3 unrelated things: 1) associations with people through Esalen which he connects to the Huxleys via his &#39;brain&#39; mindmapping software, but this is a very weak connection.  If I knew a mass murder 20 yrs ago before he began, you can&#39;t say I had anything whatseover to do with it.,  2) on the idea that nothing happened to TM when he returned to the States from China for a parent&#39;s funeral, following a FBI/DEA investigation of his drug trafficking, 3) that the CIA did not respond to his FOIA request on Terence.</p>

<p>However, what Jan refuses to acknowledge even now is something I posted in a comment in his thread about TM as a CIA agent, which is that the statute of limitations on drug trafficking at the time of his investigation / the loss of his shipment to authorities was <em>5 yrs</em>.  This five year period had long expired as TM had spent time in various asian countries and latin america during that time.  I did research on this and I&#39;m right about it.  Sorry.  But I&#39;m right.  FBI/DEA may have nabbed him, questioned him, but they couldn&#39;t keep him or leverage him as the statute had expired.  Terence was smart enough to know that, but it&#39;s pretty clear he didn&#39;t want to talk about it, probably from an arragement to &#39;not make the government look foolish again&#39;</p>

<p>Regarding point 1) sometimes it&#39;s valid to implicate someone by their associations, especially if those are within secret societies.  I think it&#39;s more important what they say though.  I <em>do</em> see McKenna pushed a gnostic (globalist) agenda by alchemy.  In contrast, I <em>do</em> see that Mckenna denied the idea of a world conspiracy, but did push the spectacle so maybe he was confused as to what created the spectacle or maybe he began to believe his own disinformational / misdirection schtick because he sure was convincing sounding.  I can usually pick up on people bullshitting, especially after listening them for a whilel.</p>

<p>Regarding point 3):  I&#39;ve made FOIA reqests on myself,  8 of them to different agencies.  All but CIA say they have no records responsive to my name.  CIA says that my record is classified.  I do not believe I am particularly important, I just wanted to know what they know if anything, and I had a specific thing I wanted to know.  They claimed they cannot claim or deny that they know anything and if they did know anythign they are reserving their rights under various rulings that they may not disclose this to me.  I immediately appealed this and my appeal was denied.</p>

<p>So FOIA requests are not what Jan thinks.  He&#39;s wrongheaded if he thinks that just because he made the request that there&#39;s something that they are willing to say or not say.  That&#39;s their thing.  They want you to know this one thing: <em>Fcuk you, we have the info (or don&#39;t) and you can&#39;t have it (and we don&#39;t care / there&#39;s nothing you can do about that.  /notsorry)--yours truly, entitlement jesuit imperialists with all your money and information.</em></p>

<p>Keep in mind also, 9/11 destroyed a clandestine office in building 7 with documents.  Who&#39;s to say those documents weren&#39;t there?  The fact is: we don&#39;t know what they lost and they&#39;ll never, ever say, no matter how many FOIA requests we sent because &quot;it&#39;s protected under national security efforts&quot;.  Also, we can&#39;t assume that they had all been scanned into computers because we&#39;re talking about the government here and it was 1991 when scanning was still shitty and time consuming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are failing to take into account that the vast majority of programming fails. I think it is more about the money. They don&#39;t care what sells, as long as they get to profit from it. If cop shows suddenly went out of favor they would simply fill that void with whatever happens to curry favor at the time. They will throw anything at that wall to see what sticks. It is not so much as creating culture, it is all about creating profit. The peoples tastes and choices are the drivers behind which cultures appear on the media. Which ever one draws the most eyes wins. It&#39;s all about the money. </p>
