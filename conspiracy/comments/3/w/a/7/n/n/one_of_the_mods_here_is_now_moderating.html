        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2015-12-10 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/WeAreTheResistance.html">WeAreTheResistance</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I made a pretty controversial post the night of San Bernardino shooting, informing <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> that I had contacted the Sherrif&#39;s office, and the FBI letting them know that I knew they were lying about the official story, and it quickly got downvoted and buried. Which is completely fine, and I simply counted it off as a bad post that wasn&#39;t accepted well by the community here.  </p>

<p>My alt account was then hacked and my password was changed which I also made a post about.  It was only after this post that did <a href="/r/TopMindsOfReddit">/r/TopMindsOfReddit</a> picked up on the 6 day old post of me contacting the FBI and Sherriff&#39;s Office, and have since stickied it over there yesterday.</p>

<p>I was surprised to see <a href="/u/FlyTape">/u/FlyTape</a> removed the now 7 day old post this morning, after doing nothing about it for 7 days, until <a href="/r/TopMindsOfReddit">/r/TopMindsOfReddit</a> stickied it.</p>

<p>So now the moderators of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are allowing the little children of <a href="/r/TopMindsOfReddit">/r/TopMindsOfReddit</a> to dictate the content posted and removed here.   </p>

<p>Let that sink in for a minute.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re wrong on multiple accounts.</p>

<p>The post I removed was one where you were asking people to call the SB sheriff office.  Pretty lame.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t notice for 7 days because our community down voted it so it was already pretty invisible, I removed it because it was an awful post and not a good idea.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t browse TMOR and the only reason I saw the post over there is because you username mentioned me in the comments section.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you would love it if conspiracy got quarantined for being a base of harassment and pissing the admins off, which is what posts like that will eventually lead to.  Let that sink in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not even going to argue with you about whether or not it was a good idea to post that post.  It&#39;s debatable, I&#39;m am simply arguing with you about the fact that you just magically found the post, 7 days later, on your own, without being alerted to it by either the admins or the post in TMOR or IRCR.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s no way that you&#39;re going through the hundreds of posts made since then and just magically stumbled across it.   It&#39;s highly suspect that less then 24 hours after it was stickied in TMOR, you then go back and remove the post.  In fact I&#39;m going to call you out as a liar, it&#39;s just not possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is very good analysis imo - Flytape is covering for TMOR, they are (largely, there are some genuine commonplace bullies as well) controlled opposition of reddit.  Anyone who has dealt with them more than a few times knows it - they blatantly use multiple sock puppet accounts and obviously witch hunt anyone who dares stray from official narratives.  If you ever need a new conspiracy thread to follow, just go see what top minds are brigading - chemtrails, intelligent design, vaccines, secret societies, the occult, spirituality, homeopathy - their agenda is clear - they are an enormous hub of controlled opposition activity on reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That makes perfect sense, though.  </p>

<p>It is against the rules to organize a &quot;witch hunt&quot;, despite whether or not you&#39;d call it that.  I&#39;m sure that if one of the mods read your post on the initial day they would have removed it themselves.  They didn&#39;t, nor did they receive a report about it, so it slipped under their radar.  <a href="/u/flytape">/u/flytape</a> monitors <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a> to make sure there&#39;s no brigading (or a similar situation to this one), realized that your post needed to go, and did so to protect the sub.</p>

<p>I honestly do not believe he&#39;s in cahoots with them.  Why do you think otherwise?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flytape doxxed Orangutan as the creator of 911blogger.com and made a whole big stink until the Mods decided to remove orangutan from modship despite his overwhelming popularity as the only democratically elected moderator of this sub.</p>

<p>Orangutan stepped down without a fight b/c fighting ain&#39;t there style, but most of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> wanted flytape removed for doxxing and stirring up shit but nothing came of that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually yes they did push their own site and even the sales page of a sister site that is on record giving their site &quot;grants&quot;.</p>

<p>They also protected certain users from mod actions that were being abusive to our mods and users who believed a different 9-11 theory than their site supports.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You called the sheriff&#39;s office and the fbi to tell them that you &quot;know&quot; they&#39;re lying and blah blah? Who did you talk to? Likely some low on the totem poll desk jockey guy who answers the phones, and you call and yell nonsensically about how San Bernardino is a conspiracy and you know they&#39;re lying blah blah.</p>

<p>What is that supposed to accomplish? You&#39;re an asshole and a fucking child. You make us all look bad and you should stfu forever please.</p>

<p>OH and then you encourage everybody else to harass these poor phone guys and then whine about it when your post gets removed for really, really obvious reasons. What are you, 14 years old?</p>

<p>Which is where I found the post.  Maybe the comments there currently (made hours ago) are a side effect of the TMOR post... I don&#39;t know or care.  The post was shit and thus I flushed it.</p>
