      <p>
       So I made a pretty controversial post the night of San Bernardino shooting, informing
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       that I had contacted the Sherrif's office, and the FBI letting them know that I knew they were lying about the official story, and it quickly got downvoted and buried. Which is completely fine, and I simply counted it off as a bad post that wasn't accepted well by the community here.
      </p>
      <p>
       My alt account was then hacked and my password was changed which I also made a post about.  It was only after this post that did
       <a href="/r/TopMindsOfReddit">
        /r/TopMindsOfReddit
       </a>
       picked up on the 6 day old post of me contacting the FBI and Sherriff's Office, and have since stickied it over there yesterday.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was surprised to see
       <a href="/u/FlyTape">
        /u/FlyTape
       </a>
       removed the now 7 day old post this morning, after doing nothing about it for 7 days, until
       <a href="/r/TopMindsOfReddit">
        /r/TopMindsOfReddit
       </a>
       stickied it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now the moderators of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       are allowing the little children of
       <a href="/r/TopMindsOfReddit">
        /r/TopMindsOfReddit
       </a>
       to dictate the content posted and removed here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let that sink in for a minute.

       You're wrong on multiple accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The post I removed was one where you were asking people to call the SB sheriff office.  Pretty lame.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't notice for 7 days because our community down voted it so it was already pretty invisible, I removed it because it was an awful post and not a good idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't browse TMOR and the only reason I saw the post over there is because you username mentioned me in the comments section.

      <p>
       I'm sure you would love it if conspiracy got quarantined for being a base of harassment and pissing the admins off, which is what posts like that will eventually lead to.  Let that sink in.

       I am not even going to argue with you about whether or not it was a good idea to post that post.  It's debatable, I'm am simply arguing with you about the fact that you just magically found the post, 7 days later, on your own, without being alerted to it by either the admins or the post in TMOR or IRCR.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no way that you're going through the hundreds of posts made since then and just magically stumbled across it.   It's highly suspect that less then 24 hours after it was stickied in TMOR, you then go back and remove the post.  In fact I'm going to call you out as a liar, it's just not possible.

       It is possible and you have no idea what you're talking about.  People are still currently talking there and I often browse the subreddit comments untied with this link

        https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/

      <p>
       Which is where I found the post.  Maybe the comments there currently (made hours ago) are a side effect of the TMOR post... I don't know or care.  The post was shit and thus I flushed it.

       You're so full of shit FlyTape, it's rather comical.  You missed this post for 7 days, and only removed it after TMOR stickied the post, admit it.  That's still your right as a moderator here, but you're lying about just magically finding it 7 days later, and not acting on it only after TMOR posted and stickied it.

       This is very good analysis imo - Flytape is covering for TMOR, they are (largely, there are some genuine commonplace bullies as well) controlled opposition of reddit.  Anyone who has dealt with them more than a few times knows it - they blatantly use multiple sock puppet accounts and obviously witch hunt anyone who dares stray from official narratives.  If you ever need a new conspiracy thread to follow, just go see what top minds are brigading - chemtrails, intelligent design, vaccines, secret societies, the occult, spirituality, homeopathy - their agenda is clear - they are an enormous hub of controlled opposition activity on reddit.

       That makes perfect sense, though.

      <p>
       It is against the rules to organize a "witch hunt", despite whether or not you'd call it that.  I'm sure that if one of the mods read your post on the initial day they would have removed it themselves.  They didn't, nor did they receive a report about it, so it slipped under their radar.
       <a href="/u/flytape">
        /u/flytape

       monitors
       <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">
        /r/topmindsofreddit

       to make sure there's no brigading (or a similar situation to this one), realized that your post needed to go, and did so to protect the sub.

       You are so full of shit you're ridonculous. Orangutan stepped down without a fight while you acted like, well the only way you ever act around here, in a way that is a huge disservice to the rest of this community.

       You called the sheriff's office and the fbi to tell them that you "know" they're lying and blah blah? Who did you talk to? Likely some low on the totem poll desk jockey guy who answers the phones, and you call and yell nonsensically about how San Bernardino is a conspiracy and you know they're lying blah blah.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is that supposed to accomplish? You're an asshole and a fucking child. You make us all look bad and you should stfu forever please.

      <p>
       OH and then you encourage everybody else to harass these poor phone guys and then whine about it when your post gets removed for really, really obvious reasons. What are you, 14 years old?

       He stood up for his beliefs and spoke truth to authority and you're trying to shame him for that - you need to examine yourself

       That is not "standing up for his beliefs." You're a retard if that's what you think that is, it is you who needs to examine yourself. Harassing people who have nothing to do with the "authority" you speak of is childish and fucking stupid. Grow up

       If someone is trying to lie to you and you call them up and tell them you know they're lying, how is that not standing up for yourself?

       It is possible and you have no idea what you're talking about.  People are still currently talking there and I often browse the subreddit comments untied with this link
      </p>

       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/">

       Which is where I found the post.  Maybe the comments there currently (made hours ago) are a side effect of the TMOR post... I don't know or care.  The post was shit and thus I flushed it.

       Nope. I didn't notice it the previous week.  If I had I would have removed it then.
