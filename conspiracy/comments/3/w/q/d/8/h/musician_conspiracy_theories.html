    <div class="md"><p>Any of the links will lead you to the author &amp; the topic.  There are dozens more better interviews on YouTube with the author, who died last month of a rapid-onset cancer that took only 5 months to kill him.  The book itself is the best resource on the topic, which includes musicians up to the 1980s.  About 90% of the New Wave acts were linked to the Copeland family and Miles Copeland, a CIA bigwig.  Miles Copeland&#39;s son is Stewart Copeland, drummer for The Police.</p>

<p>Almost any U.S. musical act from the 1960s that you can name can be found in the book, linked to Laurel Canyon and its military-industrial-intelligence ties.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are supposed to be still alive, living among the common people, doing ordinary things, under different names. The same is true of Elvis. It&#39;s a modern version of the resurrection myth. When an individual is greatly loved and respected, his followers won&#39;t let him die. They put forward various reasons as to why he may still be alive. There are witness sightings of the honored individual. Elvis was sighted working in a car wash. Jesus was seen standing outside his tomb.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. The faking their deaths theory (Same with Tupac). I&#39;ve heard about that, never really looked into it. Seems like they would need immense help/assistance in this. Also, what would their goal be in this theory? Just fuck it all or were they hiding from a certain group of people? Like I said, I really have done no research into things like these. I look into other things, but need a new direction based on a former lead. Thanks for the comment!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there are business clauses which cause certain types of famous people to &quot;retire&quot; their name as a corporation, and move on. Or maybe it was predetermined when they signed a contract. OK I&#39;ll be famous until I turn -- years old then I&#39;d like to die, in a way that is either glamorous or helps a charity in that name, and then move to a nice quiet warm place with my money and only the couple people closest to me. </p>

<p>I think the young celeb deaths trend is a trend of Grand Closings in business, not the death of an actual person, just the end of the Actor(TM).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup steez got burned. Their done negotiating with conscious rappers. I will be surprised if b.o.b and killer mike make it through the year. I think the Tupac thing is a dead end not enough freedom of information when he was gunned down. but these forces are getting sloppy and the steez situation reeks of hidden hand bull shit. He was probably the most talented young rapper to come out In a long long time. Makes you wonder why the ignorant rappers live so long and have such illustrious careers. I&#39;m lookin at you diddy, jay, dre, Lil&#39;wayne, snoop. Ect ect. Fuckin Gucci can record an album from jail wtf is that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My aunts second husband was James Dean&#39;s father. None of this is on the record, so take it for what it&#39;s worth, but James Dean&#39;s father was named Kyldred Drew Bean. James was born Jameson Bean. </p>

<p>Kyldred, who went by his middle name, Drew, founded the precursor to the space program that was born after WWII. Bear in mind he did this in 1935. He was in the Navy from 1916 to 1934 at which time he was transferred to NAAS (North American Aerospace Squadron), which contained scientists and airmen from the U.S. And Canada. Prior to 1916, Drew was in West Point, alongside Eisenhower, Patton, and others. </p>

<p>Drew used to get drunk at family gatherings and would ramble on about his life. He was in his seventies or eighties but was still sharp as a tack, albeit quite drunk. </p>

<p>One of the things he mentioned over the years is that his son was raised primarily outside of their home and in a joint Canadian/US military facility to which the Bean family had no access. Tensions grew between Drew Bean and NAAS and eventually Drew reached out to a friend of his in Hollywood, whose name escapes me, and together they devised a plan to kidnap young James. </p>

<p>Drew successfully kidnapped James, but the plan didn&#39;t stop there. Prior to the kidnapping, Drew, along with his Hollywood connection, made a film about James&#39; upbringing and after the kidnapping they threatened to release it. </p>

<p>A deal was made that James could pursue a safe life as a movie star in Hollywood if the film was destroyed. Well, Drew said he destroyed the film but he never did. As a result, James was killed and Drew spent the next thirty years of his life in an insane asylum. </p>

<p>I still think of Drew every year at my Quinceañera. This fictional story brought to you by the estate of James Bean. </p>

<p>These are songs off of a brand new album, released this year.</p>

<p>If you listen to the radio, none of it is real, even people who love &quot;pop&quot; can&#39;t name the pop songs from 5 years ago, because their only purpose is to control what you think, but there is certainly more music out there than radio music.</p>
