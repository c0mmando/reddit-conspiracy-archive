<blockquote>
<p>Avraham ben Elazar, alias Dr. Henry Kissinger, (2) who was probably the Jewish satrap in charge of supervising the government in Washington. This seemed to indicate an internal struggle among our rulers, possibly a struggle between two factions of the ruling race.</p>

<p>(2. The real name of Kissinger was disclosed by the Supreme Rabbinic Court of America when he was excommunicated from Jewry on 20 June 1976. The real reason for the excommunication has not been disclosed, and it would be a waste of time to consider conjectural explanations.)</p>

<p>(3. We must remember that although God&#39;s Race presents a united front against our race, which they both despise and hate, there are often violent disagreements about the expediency of some policy and consequently frequent, if not constant, quarrels between factions within the Self-Chosen People. For a good example, see Lenni Bremmer, The Iron Wall: Zionist Revisionism from Jabotinsky to Shamir (London, Zed Books, 1984). Needless to say, the &quot;revisionism&quot; mentioned in the title has nothing to do with the &quot;revisionism&quot; of honest historians who are now trying to expose the Jews&#39; great Holohoax. Zionist &quot;revisionism&quot; deals with changes in policies for putting and keeping the goyim in their servile place. Bremmer particularly reprehends Shamir and his party of Zionists for attempts to enter into a military alliance with Adolf Hitler to expedite his &quot;ultimate solution&quot; of the Jewish problem in Germany by transferring the Jews in Germany to Palestine. Cf. Liberty Bell, March 1991, pp. 1-3; April-May 1991, pp. 108-114.)</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kissinger">Wiki:</a></strong></p>

<p>Kissinger was born Heinz Alfred Kissinger in Fürth, Bavaria, Germany, in 1923 during the Weimar Republic, to a family of German Jews [...] <strong>The surname Kissinger was adopted in 1817</strong> by his great-great-grandfather Meyer Löb, after the Bavarian spa town of Bad Kissingen.</p>

<p><strong>1817</strong> was long before the days of the Nazis, friend.</p>

<p>And since when did Kissinger try to hide the fact that he is Jewish? It was common knowledge when he was National Security Adviser under Nixon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that&#39;s not what happened here. I brought up an anecdote about last names in the holocaust that didn&#39;t have anything to do with current Israel conflicts. It was a reply to a comment that claimed Kissinger changed his last name, and you immediately attacked it just for the fact the holocaust was brought up. Sorry, but it&#39;s completely relevant to the topic, no matter what you want to think about the holocaust.</p>

<p>Is it because all witness are always 100% reliable? And we should not ever question any claims made from <em>hearsay</em>? </p>

<p>Far from me to say that Kissinger and his Nobel Peace Prize is an angel above all reproach, but that bold claim sounds like it should come with some assurance it actually happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure that I explained my thoughts as best I could. Let me try a little better:</p>

<p>Daniel Estulin wrote a a book, from which you plucked a quote attributed to Kissinger about the Trilateral Commission. There&#39;s no source material, no named witness to that quote and no background about anything. Not even a date of that meeting. All we know is that Carter was president at the time.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a pretty big bold claim that Kissinger made. Who is/was the witness? How reliable is that person? Why should anyone believe any of what you posted (or any of what Estulin wrote)?</p>

<p>Please be assured that I am not defending Kissinger or attacking your character. I&#39;m just really curious about the context.</p>

<blockquote>

The Trilateral Commission represents a skillful, coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power political, monetary, intellectual and ecclesiastical.

Now it&#39;s not zany to believe in them, rather it&#39;s zany to believe they have influence. Sure, a lot of powerful people are members of both groups, but we can&#39;t assume that just because almost all of the worlds top bankers and government officials are members of these groups that they somehow influence policy or anything.............</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a diagram that&#39;s been posted here a few times showing how all the really rich organizations are linked to each other. Think of it as the <em>real</em> world wide web.</p>

<p>The point is, this is a web made of the connections between people who are really rich and powerful. Take a guess at what kind of people they are and how they operate.</p>

<p>So what does this have to do with the Bilderburgers or Trilateralists? Well, people are always posting about how this or that group are the ones who are secretly in charge. What I think is that it&#39;s all of them. It&#39;s rich people who are essentially operating gangster style. They&#39;re corrupt like gangsters. They cooperate, or fight with each other like gangsters do. They operate behind the scenes and outside the law (when it suits them) just like gangsters do.</p>

<p>The only real difference is that most of them don&#39;t have Italian surnames... or jail records.</p>

<p>So when you&#39;re watching the news and you&#39;re wondering why the world seems like such a weird, fucked up place... just think of it as being run by hundreds of different groups of gangsters. </p>

<p>Trust me, things will suddenly make a lot more sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually most of the real elite do have Italian surnames except they are also mostly Jewish due to interbreeding over the years a key example is David de Rothschild married Princess Olimpia Aldobrandini. The Rothschilds are completely insignificant to the real elite. One of the richest most powerful elite families possibly even the most is the Pallavicini family. It&#39;s the rich Venetian Nobility of crypto-Jewish ancestry who sit at the top, who believe they are the Chosen Ones to rule this world. The Jewish chosen mentality is at the heart of the problem.</p>
