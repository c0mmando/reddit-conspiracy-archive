       Ron, when he ran, seemed to give young and/or informed people hope. I watched a 25 minute video today posted in this subreddit,
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_WBo4sfmi4">
        here
       </a>
       and it shows how Ron was snubbed from the media and basically robbed of the presidency. Well, it got me thinking. The same thing seems to be happening to Bernie. He is immensely popular with many people but fails to gain the MSM respect he deserves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could these two have the same thing in common? To give us (internet/social media users) hope that there is someone looking out for us and not their corporate donors?  To keep us busy while the real narrative plays out, aka Hillary winning. And when they don't get elected we don't bat an eye because of all of the brainwashing/media manipulation that has been playing out for months on end?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is Bernie the next Ron Paul in this sense?

       Yes, but only on how the media treats him. They were the fringe in their parties. That being said, Bernie is a wolf in sheep's clothing (imo). Ron Paul would've made a great president. Bernie, not so much. Our country doesn't need his "ideas/ideologies".

       God damn it. I was going to put my two cents in who I believe was better in the OP but I thought that would discourage discussion. Seeing the downvotes I'm thinking I should have now. With that said, I agree with you on most points.

       As Alex Jones (yes, he's a fear monger but he says the truth sometimes and can't always since he has a cousin in the CIA and they would have him dead so he has to play ball) has stated in the past is that the Congress will always have Their Controlled Opposition both from Democratic and Republican side. In my opinion if Bernie wanted to make a real statement he would've stayed true to being an independent and while still being able to fundraise the money he did.

       Alex Jones isn't just a fear monger, he's a transparent shill. Look at the things he doesn't talk about. Here's an example, did you watch the Trump interview? The whole time he's complaining about how democrats are just socialists trying to take over the world, and then mentions essentially every democratic candidate EXCEPT the only self identified fucking socialist. Do you know why? The same reason most major news companies do the same thing, it's because any coverage is good coverage. That, and because Jones is owned by the same people the news corporations are owned by.

       I have long not watched Alex Jones videos for a year, because he went full blown shill. Everyone knows that, and I'm not denying it but he did make a good point about control opposition. They prop up all these candidates making them seem like the Champions of freedom and liberty but for a couple grand they'll throw us under the bus. That's my only point, THAT ALEX JONES WAS ONLY CORRECT ON THE CONCEPT OF CONTROLLED OPPOSITION TO MISLEAD THE POPULACE AND THAT IS ALL. I'M NOT PRO ALEX JONES BUT HE DID MAKE A GOOD POINT. Ps I HAVEN'T WATCHED HIA VIDEOS FOR A YEAR COS I KNOW HE'S A SHILL. I PUT IT IN CAPS, JUST IN CASE YOU MISUNDERSTAND. Goodnight and may our creator bless you all.

       If he stayed independent, he wouldn't have been able to fundraise the  way that he did.  People are supporting him because as a democrat, he at least has a shot.  A socialist independent would be a much harder sell and his fundraising would reflect that.

       Well its just a thought but we will have to wait and see. Unless some massive false flag occurs which would cause Obama to become dictator under martial law and have no elections. Many things can happen. I know it's a long shot but I personally stand as a Libertarian, although there are no free and fair elections hope that Gary Johnson can pull through.

       Bernie is certainly getting the Ron Paul treatment from the media.  Sanders fans won't see it that way because they think that Paul was a joke with no chance of winning.... which is exactly how the media is treating Sanders.

       Even Rand Paul is a grim reaper, dark cursed shadow of his fathers downfall. Went behind closed doors with Bent-On and rinse pubes, threw his father under the bus.

       IMHO, Rand could have walked out of that meetings and thrown down for his father, busted shit wide open and Ron Paul would have been the nominee.

       As I said in another post: I'll be here to the very end of reddit. I've nothing to lose, nothing to fear. Came here when I finally had breathing room and internet (LOL!) to look at 9/11. The original commenters were rightfully strict, succinct and incredibly helpful, even if blunt! It took me some time to figure out how to best
       <em>
        navigate
       </em>
       so my time is closer to five years here...
      </p>
      <p>
       I've never wavered in my ethics. When I'm wrong, I admit it. We might not agree all the time but that is what communication is all about!
      </p>
      <p>
       I felt like such a
       <em>
        sucker
       </em>
       when I gave scarce money to Ron Pauls final money bomb, only to have his kid puke his endorsement of Mitt hours later.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, my sincere apology. Nice to have your honest reply!

       They are the same in that they captyred the hearts of middle-to-upper-middle class white kids, with no real world experience, and ran knowing full well they didn't have a chance in hell because of it.  Sanders is a fullblown communist in socialist's clothing.  His ideologies are completely unrealistic as are his economics.

       That was the idea, but unfortunately, Sanders doesn't have the principled integrity that Paul has.

       You have all been decieved by the controlled opposition. Stop voting for The Whores that are the Republicans and Democrats. Honestly, doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result is insanity! A lot of people probably were thinking Obama was going to be the best next thing before he was into power, fast forward to near the end of the second term the dollar has been devalued a lot more plus getting the nation into TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO debt but people believe his bullshit. The fact that we have many discussions about the cancer to our country which is the Duopoly that controls our country and the world. For anyone in their right mind to believe into any of those 2 parties, I don't mean to sound like a dick but most of you have fucken brain damage if you still believe all that stupid garbage lies they tell you.

       Communism is not the same thing as socialism. Sweden is socialist, Russia is communist. Also, being a socialist basically means you want taxes to go to the people instead of the war. Do you think someone else's war is more important?

       Left wing fans of Bernie Sanders spent years calling Ron Paul and his supporters "nazis" and "racists" and "bigots" and "haters" and all the rest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because Ron Paul wanted to reform the Federal Reserve.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, Bernie Sanders, a radical far more out of step with American tradition, is getting the soft-touch treatment from the corporate media, and the left-wing socialists and communists expect Ron Paul fans to get behind this pseudo-populist candidate - who is, in fact, a Zionist - far more "racist" and "fascist" than any Ron Paul supporter - and get butthurt when they get some opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       It ain't going to work. Bernie Sanders - like his communist, left wing nutjob fans - are not going to ride Ron Paul's coattails.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no reason why we should be friendly with you bigots.

       First of all, I supported Ron Paul when he ran because he was obviously a man of the people. I support Bernie Sanders because he is a man of the people. I even admire Trump a little, not for his policy which is awful, but because he is trying to be a man of the people. Bernie wants to reform military spending so that less money falls through the cracks and so that we can give our people the things they need. Does that make him a nutjob? Also, what makes Bernie bigot? I mean what specifically. Why do you consider him a Zionist, I've heard almost no talk of this prior to your claim. I'd love some evidence, that's all. You're just saying shitty empty words, and it sounds like you're recycling garbage. Some evidence, please jacks.

       Sanders is getting the soft-touch treatment from the left-wing media, like salon.com, even the New York Times.
      </p>
      <p>
       The exact OPPOSITE treatment Paul got - the left-wingers called anyone who voted for Paul a "racist" and a "bigot" and a "nazi" and a "fascist" etc., etc., etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So don't expect Paul fans to be all lovey-dovey with socialist/communists like the Sanders fans now - you made it clear you would side with Wall Street against "right wing conservatives" like many Paul fans.
