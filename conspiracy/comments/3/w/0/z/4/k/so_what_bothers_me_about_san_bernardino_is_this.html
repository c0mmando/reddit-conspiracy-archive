       I have a lot of feelings, many not good, about the recent shootings. One of them is the complete lack of video footage of the shootings, all of them. Nobody had a cell phone inside, no security cameras, no aerial footage of the SUV shooting, nothing. How can that be possible when EVERYONE has a camera on them via their cell phone?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, here is my list that I find odd/bothersome about the details that unfolded:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Witnesses say 3 shooters (and I have seen two videos of different witnesses saying 3 shooters).
       <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/witness-describes-the-san-bernardino-shooting/">
        http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/witness-describes-the-san-bernardino-shooting/
       </a>
       (in video... the text has since been removed... i.e.
‘You’re certain that you saw three men?’ the news anchor asks.
‘Yeah,’ she replies, as she continues to describe the THREE WHITE MEN, their muscular build, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Why was the female suspect de pants?
       <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user3303/imageroot/2015/12/20151202_SB1.jpg">
        http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user3303/imageroot/2015/12/20151202_SB1.jpg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Why does it look like the windshield of the SUV was shot from the front?
       <a href="http://ogpdn1wn2d93vut8u40tokx1dl7.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/thumbRNS-CaliforniaShootingDec.4.jpg">

       </a>
       (bullet holes through tilted windshields moving "horizontally" leave an elongated hole in glass. The closer to perpendicular the bullet enters glass, the rounder the hole)
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Touching on #3 above... how were armed forces in front of the vehicle to bombard it with bullets?
      </p>
      <p>
       5) Why are there massive red cut/bruising marks on the male suspects wrists?
       <a href="http://www.sott.net/image/s14/287274/large/Farook_bound.jpg">
        http://www.sott.net/image/s14/287274/large/Farook_bound.jpg
       </a>
       (like he was trying to get out of handcuffs)
      </p>
      <p>
       6) Why was there a big poof of smoke from the rear of the black SUV during the slow speed chase yet the officer behind did not slow a tick when following?

       </a>
       Ever seen an ar-15 rifle cause so much smoke and not deter, at all, the target?
      </p>
      <p>
       And I have more but I think those are my main wtf's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh... and this is the guy who supplied the ar-15 rifles years ago but the two suspects recently got a 28.5K loan to buy the old rifles.

       I'll add another interesting fact that I figured out today... Their home in Redlands is too far away for them to have left the party, gone home to "suit up" and return to do the shooting within the time frame reported (under thirty minutes). That means they must have gone to the party with guns and change of clothing in the car. So that goes against any narrative that it was a spur of the moment job brought on by getting mad and storming out. And yet other evidence indicates it was spur of the moment, such as the purchase of clothes on-line to be delivered to the house the next day, a new treadmill with the tag still on it, no clear exit plan (apparently they just drove around town for a couple of hours and in the end even drove home).

       I know a lot of people find it a little hard to accept but the news just another show. It's just that the writers and producers work for the government and go uncredited.

       no. 1 - This perplexes the shit out of me. There are many accounts that are certain there were 3 shooters.
      </p>
      <p>
       no. 2 - perhaps they were verifying that the suspect did (or did not) any explosives strapped to the body.
      </p>
      <p>
       no. 3 - those holes could very well be from bullets that struck from the rear and exited out the front thru the windshield.

       I read the 28.5k loan was taken out by Farook and his wife but not sure on that.

       1... yes it does. It almost seems impossible to not have any circulation of pertinent videos. There must have been 30 choppers in the sky and NONE could get the slow police chase?

       I assumed all this barrage of gunfire happened once they stopped the car. The only video I've seen from the helicopter gets there after its already over and the one body is already laying across the street from the car.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also saw a few photos where an MRAV (or similar) is pulled up against the front of the SUV but I haven't seen it again. I'm not sure if that's how they forced the SUV to stop or if the MRAV was doing some other maneuver to see inside the car or something????

       Don't forget the killers were reported to have GoPro's that they wore during the attack. Yesterday, they said they didn't use them and today they found a second car owned by the mother that had empty GoPro boxes in it.

       I'm just going off what I've seen on the news channels at the time of the shooting. I looked quickly for mention of it but the webpages I got mentioning it were a bit shady.
      </p>
      <p>
       The article I read today about the the empty GoPro box in the car. It's the NY Post but still, it's mainstream.: [(
       <a href="http://nypost.com/2015/12/08/thousands-of-dollars-deposited-into-california-terrorists-account-before-massacre/)">

       </a>
       ]
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a blurb about the GoPro's being used during the shooting and how it was false at the end of the story. [(
