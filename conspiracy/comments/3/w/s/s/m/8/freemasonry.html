       I think you only need to look at the structure and historical membership to see that it is a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       A very large number of prominent public figures (such as US presidents) have been freemasons.  This is true in the private sector as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a club whose members are in public positions of influence and power, that has meetings where the proceedings are secret.  The structure of freemasonry is international.  It is questionable how members rank their loyalty to freemasonry as compared to their other obligations.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, just examining this structure, without getting to any specific evidence, casts enormous doubt on democratic institutions.  When the leaders of your political parties debate eachother as opponents, then retire to a secret club to have drinks together it makes it hard for democracy to be legitimate.  To accept the idea that it is just a harmless club requires incredible naivety.

       Do you have data to back that up?

       There have been 14 US Presidents who were Freemasons.

       Not really. There are 6 million Freemasons throughout the world, today. That might sound like a lot, but in terms of global population it's 0.08%

       Other than the Dole/Clinton debate (Clinton was DeMolay, not a Freemason, but let's count that just for sake of argument) I can't think of a recent example of two candidates from different parties in a major US debate. Which ones are you thinking of?

       I don't think there's anything to defined. Private meetings are private. If you want to have a private meeting, you're free to do so, and I respect your right to do so as a fundamental virtue of free association, privacy and speech.

       Nonsense. I'm not "guilty of something" when I don't tell you my social security number. I'm not "guilty of something" when I don't disclose my company's proprietary source code to you. I'm not "guilty of something" when I don't post on reddit about my friend's unrequited love. We all keep dozens of secrets, often without even thinking about it!
      </p>
      <p>
       But Freemasonry really doesn't keep any secrets. Anything we've ever considered secret has long since been published and re-published over hundreds of years. There is nothing that you can't just pick up a book and read about.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we don't talk about our initiations, not to truly keep them secret, but because that's a part of the initiatory experience.

       The founding fathers included many freemasons. Yes most had slaves too, did other bad stuff. Did revolutionary war for making cash and taking land not freedom and all that. Still they were an improvement to other rulers of the day.

       They take a lot of oaths when they become freemasons. I don't know what these oaths are for. Once I asked the purpose of the group he told me infiltration of governments and taking control.

       There are three degrees in Freemasonry. Each has its own "obligation" much like that of any public office's swearing-in ceremony. There's nothing unusual or shocking about that aspect of the degrees.

      <p>
       George Washington was a popular person in the US (immensely so, in a way that we probably couldn't imagine today) but that had little to do with his being a Freemason. If anything, the fact that Washington and Lafayette were Masons boosted the popularity of Freemasonry for many decades (until the anti-Masonic period in the US). But he was never really all that influential in Freemasonry outside of his general popularity and the clout that carried everywhere. He wasn't Grand Master of Virginia and I could be wrong, but I don't even think he was ever any Grand Lodge officer.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if by "top" you mean "people who are independently well-respected or influential in society and also happen to be Freemasons," then I'd have to ask, why bother even talking about their being Freemasons if they aren't actually part of the administrative organs of the Fraternity?

       You're probably referring to the Great Seal of the United States, which it turns out isn't actually Masonic in any way, but understanding that requires understanding some history...
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people point at the Eye above the pyramid as evidence of Masonic elements in the Great Seal. But this symbol was
       <em>
        extremely popular
       </em>
       at that time in the 18th century as a generic symbol of divine providence. In fact, its proper name is the Eye of Providence. Freemasonry uses this symbol, as it also uses the symbol of the square-rule, but not all square rules are Masonic and neither are all Eyes of Providence.
      </p>
      <p>
       What the Eye actually refers to in the seal is apparent if one carefully reads the Declaration of Independence and understands the historical context. At the time, all governments of Europe and its colonies had previously been instituted on the notion of divine right of rule. This is a notion that says that monarchs are monarchs because God made them better than other people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The alarmingly innovative (at least to the monarchies of the day) part of the Declaration of Independence was to acknowledge this divine right, but to assert that this right was bestowed on
       <em>
        the people
       </em>
       and that it was they who were empowered to select their form of governance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today we see this as a quaint but uninteresting assertion, but at the time, it was a shot across the bow to every monarchy in the world! The Eye of Providence, therefore was a reminder of that poke-in-the-eye (pun intended) to the existing monarchies.

      <p>
       Well, you'd have to clarify what you mean by "occult". Most of what we mean when we use that word refers to notions that came about in the 19th century and re-used many symbols and concepts that had been around (within many philosophical institutions including, but certainly not limited to Freemasonry) for centuries with very different meanings.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, the five-pointed star had been a symbol of Christianity for centuries before it took on additional meaning in the 16th and 17th century, representing the whole of creation, but its orientation was never considered interesting in and of itself. In the 19the century, Eliphas Levi, one of the progenitors of what we, today, consider "the occult" suggested that its orientation was, in fact, important and that when facing with point-down, it was a symbol of darker forces. This was then capitalized on during the 20th century by huckster and pseudo-occultist Anton LaVey in founding his Church of Satan where he used the point-down star as the symbol of his movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       But long before that and before even Levi used the symbol the Order of the Eastern Star, a US Masonic group for Masons and their families (especially wives) used the symbol as their primary logo.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, today, conspiracy theorists look at the OES logo and assume there's something nefarious there, but it wasn't even a symbol of 19th century occult studies at the time it was selected!

       Several of my elderly relatives are Freemason.  Their wives are members of The Order of Eastern Star.  A few of these relatives are not very smart which is why I do not believe they are in an organization that controls the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Freemason membership is declining.  An organization that allegedly intends to indefinitely control the world  would do better at managing membership for future presence.

       I'm sorry that you know some poor examples. I assure you that there are some very intelligent Freemasons out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Numbers have been declining since 1960 (1955 if you measure by per-capita membership rather than raw numbers) but the decline has leveled off a bit in recent years and although there are still more older members passing away than there are new members coming in, that ratio is beginning to swing, and the average age in Lodges is dropping fast!
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm above the average age in my Lodge, in terms of the people who show up, and I'm only in my 40s. I've seen other Lodges that are even younger. The millennials are definitely taking a serious interest in what their parents ignored, and Freemasonry is just one example of that.

       Freemasonry has had it's share of bad actors, and different lodges at different times have certainly concentrated power. In the 21st century though I have good reason to believe they are any more than a social club, for both people of influence, but more importantly, buffoons wishing to associate with such people and share in the limelight themselves

       There is certainly more to it than that, I merely meant that, at least in my experience, there is hardly anything conspiracy worthy about it. I have seen many different sides to it, some where the club aspect would be quite valid, but have gained far more from my brotherhood than I ever expected
