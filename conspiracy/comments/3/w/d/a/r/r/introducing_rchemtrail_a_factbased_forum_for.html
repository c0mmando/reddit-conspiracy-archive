       As we all know, it is a historical fact that chemtrails existed. The debate on chemtrails today should really be a debate about whether or not chemtrails
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       exist, not whether or not they are a possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.livescience.com/23795-large-area-coverage-dangers.html">
        During the 1950s and '60s, the U.S. Army dusted chosen American cities from coast to coast with a fine powder of a fluorescent, potentially toxic chemical. And now one scientist says, at least in the case of St. Louis, that powder may have contained radioactive material.

       Another issue I see with the chemtrail crowd is the possibility of wasted time and energy. Let's assume chemtrails don't exist. Now, the factories which pollute the world's air are given a free pass because potential candidates for environmental activism are busy chasing ghosts. That is the secondary purpose of this subreddit- to steer some of that energy towards
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       environmental activism and awareness.

        One important environmental exposure that may be related to anxiety is air pollution. Specifically, exposure to particulate matter air pollution may induce or exacerbate anxiety through increased oxidative stress and systemic inflammation, or through promotion or aggravation of chronic disease.

       Geoengineering has nothing to do with the military spraying populations with bacteria and chemicals. "Chemtrail" is a decent term to use which includes a lot of things.

       I'm not trying to be rude here, I just think that the chemtrail community could benefit from coming together and investigating what these supposed chemtrails actually do. Convincing people of your cause is going to take more than just pointing out lines in the sky. You'll have to describe exactly what it is these chemtrails do and how they do it. Keeping to vague definitions that don't tell people what chemtrails are even used for is just going to make you look like you don't know what you're talking about.

       I am trying to boost the reputation of the "chemtrail" crowd and making the theory more palatable for average people, while also showing people that their concerns are currently a reality (aerial pesticide exposure). And you have an issue with that? Of course a 9 day old account will have an issue with that!

       I think the real issue here is that you have nothing to attack from my post, so you are just fabricating a reason to argue here. Please go away.

       I get that, but saying that  Operation Large Area Coverage was real, thus chemtrails were real is a bit disingenuous in my opinion. My reason is that while Operation LAC was real, that does not provide a basis for the reality of the types of chemtrails typically discussed today on

       . Operation LAC and the types of chemtrails discussed today are completely different and one having existed in the past is not evidence that the other ever existed. If you want to define Operation LAC as a chemtrail operation, then go for it. Just understand that that comes with the caveat that the chemtrails used in Operation LAC are completely different and unrelated to chemtrails discussed today.

       You are completely misunderstanding the point. People dismiss chemtrails because they believe such a thing is so outlandishly crazy it is not even worth considering. By highlighting historical examples, it's much more difficult to dismiss the idea. Now you cannot say "that is so crazy, the government would never do that." Why do you have an issue with me correcting a myth?!

       Using your logic, the "chemtrails" discussed today shouldn't be called chemtrails. That is known as "possible geoengineering."

       No, but it's still just as easy to say "this is so crazy, because there is no evidence for it." Operation LAC being real does nothing to provide legitimacy to other chemtrail theories. I think that's the point that you're missing.

       I don't have any issue with you correcting any myths. My issue is with you saying that chemtrails were a historical fact. If you define operation LAC as chemtrails, then you can technically say this, but I think it's misleading because Operation LAC being real does not in any way provide evidence for the historical or current existence of chemtrails as most people understand them.

       That's great. I'm really confused as to why you would make a subreddit about chemtrails then. I do really like the emphasis you on air pollution. As you stated that's a very real problem. I just don't understand why you wouldn't instead make a subreddit about air pollution.

       I don't understand why this is so hard for you to get. It breaks down a few myths that are used to dismiss the idea. Go ahead and dismiss the idea. I have no issue with that, but don't dismiss it by calling it whacky, outlandish, impossible, etc because it's not. The only part of the debate is whether or not they are still doing this in some capacity. What you are doing is attempting to completely separate the individual chemicals and claiming that since the government sprayed the population with chemicals and bacteria A through X, that has nothing to do with whether they are spraying us with chemical Y and Z. Obviously the previous spraying incidents are evidence that it is possible that it is still happening.

       Previous instances of the government spraying chemicals is not evidence they are doing it today. That's not how evidence works.

       An analogy would be if you believed a certain person had been murdered by Ted Bundy. You can't use the fact that Ted Bundy murdered people in the past as evidence that he murdered that specific person. That argument  wouldn't hold up in court. It's not that Ted Bundy wouldn't be capable of murdering this person, it's just that there isn't any evidence he did.

       No but you are saying that operation LAC makes the idea of chemtrails sound less crazy. This may work on someone who isn't well versed in logic, but it won't work on someone who is. This is because operation LAC provides no evidence for chemtrails, so the "craziness" level for chemtrails stays the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think most people who call chemtrails crazy don't call it that because the government had never done anything wrong. We call it crazy because there's no evidence. So until you provide some evidence of chemtrails, I will continue to call them crazy.

       Well what "reality" are you trying to steer people towards. That chemtrails aren't "that crazy?" I have a problem with that because I don't really care where you think it falls on the crazy scale. What's important, and what you seem not willing to admit, is that there's no evidence of chemtrails. You seem to think that chemtrails are somehow "less crazy" than people think they are, but there is still no evidence for them.

       Great idea! There's a TON of disinformation floating around here about what makes contrails form and such. Hopefully your sub can educate some and bring them up to speed on atmospheric issues!

       Yeah like the difference between a naturally occurring Condensation Trail which dissipates relatively quickly and a Chemical Trail which, in the case of cloud seeding, lingers and develops in to a haze.

       Who told you that contrails must dissipate quickly, and why did you believe them? Because there's almost a full century of documentation that states otherwise.

       It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see a criss-cross pattern of exhaust that lingers.  After watching it develop in to full blown cloud cover on an otherwise clear day time and time again, no made-up debunking theory is going to change that belief.

       So you think regular contrails disperse quickly, instead of hang around sometimes?

       Which article are you referring to? You understand there are multiple articles in my post, correct?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: This person will not specify which article because they want to "sow a seed of doubt." Anyone else who looks at the thread may read his bullshit comment and think my post has unproven claims.

       No

        proof

       it was

      <p>
       It is a historical fact that zinc cadmium sulphide was sprayed all over the country. There is
       <strong>
        evidence
       </strong>
       that some of it was radioactive, but that is a small issue compared to the overall point that the chemtrailing took place.
