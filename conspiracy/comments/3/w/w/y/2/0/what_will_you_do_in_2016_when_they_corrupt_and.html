<p>Please do share on a new thread/post when you start to develop and have some success with any decentralized projects. I&#39;m in 100% agreement with you on this.</p>

<p>Non-taxable bitcoins, decentralized everything, solar/electric/battery tech, buy land, cash everything, go minimalist, work in your community at ground level and get as many involved as possible in trade/barter, etc</p>

<p>As for 2016 presidency, fuck it, the machine is currently too big unless you weasel your way into it. Its better to start a new ground level machine and keep watching as more and more people stop messing around with MSM and stop believing in the current illusion.</p>

<p>Its going to be generational and a slow awakening </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont know what your purpose is, but the best way to stop something from happening is to <a href="http://www.commonwealths.org/divest">stop supporting it</a>. 
That is what I am attempting to do. Im shifting my attention over to responsibility instead of making others responsible. Thats what voting, politics and government is: refusing to own up and be responsible for what you helped create by your inaction or ignorance. When you dont want to work for change yourself its easier to follow along with the rest of the crowd by asking government for permission or crying like a baby until you get what you want. (Protesting)</p>

<p>At some point you are going to have to grow up and make your own way. It might be shut down, but thats not the point. The point is the momentum that comes as a byproduct in acting towards righting a wrong in your own way instead of what society tells you is the only way. Nothing can stop an idea whos time has come. Centralization of power is not the answer, community driven projects with the help of people accountable to the people is the answer. Politics, government, voting, democracy, and capitalism are all self-interest control systems that strengthen the few at the expense of the many.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would be phenomenal if as many people as possible could take some time off work and stand on the Mall in D.C. on Election Night to demand a change in voting systems. Or, more logically, an earlier date to ask for a revert to the old paper trail method.</p>

<p>Problem, of course, is two-fold. The mainstream candidates will get the most votes either way. Second is - what odds do we the people really have of triggering a change? Personally, I&#39;m very tired of people thinking the problem is too big. There will never be change, or a reason to even worry about politics, so long as nobody who knows what&#39;s happening does anything about it. We&#39;re just as guilty as everyone who is ignoring everything, by virtue of our inaction, barring perhaps being an extra voice to our representatives.</p>

<p>Getting the word out would be incredibly difficult, given that you can forget about anything being on TV. More people are defecting to various social networks, and who knows which of those might try to censor it. The biggest goal is what I mentioned up top - getting people to take their vacation time for the greater cause of our nation. It&#39;s no coincidence we have some of the least time off of work in the civilized world; there is no doubt this is partially intended to keep us out of politics and entrenched in our own personal lives so the elite can do whatever they want.</p>
