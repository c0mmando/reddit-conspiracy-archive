<li>H. L. Mencken</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p>At the Nuremberg Trials, as the Nazis were examined and tried for their war crimes, Nazi Luftwaffe commander Hermann Goering said the following.</p>

<p>Göring: Why, of course, the people don&#39;t want war. Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece? Naturally, the common people don&#39;t want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship.</p>

<p>Gilbert: There is one difference. In a democracy, the people have some say in the matter through their elected representatives, and in the United States only Congress can declare wars.</p>

<p>Göring: Oh, that is all well and good, but, voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.</p>

<hr/>

<p>These 3 quotes together explain an awful lot. They also highlight the fact that the main battle is actually authoritarians vs anti-authoritarians. Those who want to control or be controlled, and those who don&#39;t want to get involved with all that. The anti-authoritarians are split across different political parties so they have reduced unity and therefore reduced impact on the people in control. The government is largely a shield for the military and for industry to hide behind while they start wars and gain power over people. Government waxes and wanes between being for &quot;We the people&quot; or being for the greedy megalomaniacs, it has all throughout history. We&#39;re at a bad point in history in regards to this, and I wonder when the pendulum will begin to swing the other way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t it amazing the state can get <em>hundreds of millions of people</em> to agree (or at least tacitly agree) to a trillion dollar war that doesn&#39;t help our lives at all, and arguably makes them worse? And we do this every 10-20 years, on the regular for the last few centuries. It&#39;s stunning from a logistical standpoint, if you think about it. Thousands of years of research by the elites went in to refining these techniques that are passed down from generation to generation to control the emotions of hundreds of millions of people at a time. It&#39;s quite a feat, to control 350 million cattle that can talk, and make them do reasonable work and fight our wars. That&#39;s how they view us, like some kind of fancy cattle livestock that can use a computer and make industrial linens. Which is why everything sucks so much, because they don&#39;t actually care about making things good for us, they just want us to stop rocking the boat. </p>

<p>The system of obedience was created through the Prussian Schooling System which made school mandatory by law to make for more efficient and nationalistic soldiers and workers, the basis for the American schooling system. Here is a great mini-documentary about it: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3nVwrSk1p4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3nVwrSk1p4</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was a fantastic article, thank you for sharing it. So basically Carter&#39;s cabinet was mostly trilateral commission people. How much influence do they have these days, I wonder? And their objective is clear from that article. I like this snippet from the wiki on the Trilateral commission:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Noam Chomsky has described the Trilateral Commission&#39;s goals in less glowing terms:</p>

<p>&quot;Essentially liberal internationalists from Europe, Japan and the United States, the liberal wing of the intellectual elite. That’s where Jimmy Carter’s whole government came from. [...] [The Trilateral Commission] was concerned with trying to induce what they called ‘more moderation in democracy’ – turn people back to passivity and obedience so they don’t put so many constraints on state power and so on. In particular they were worried about young people. They were concerned about the institutions responsible for the indoctrination of the young (that’s their phrase), meaning schools, universities, church and so on – they’re not doing their job, [the young are] not being sufficiently indoctrinated. They’re too free to pursue their own initiatives and concerns and you’ve got to control them better.[12]&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>edit: They still have a lot of control. There are 84 trilateral commission members in the US, and 10 have been appointed by Obama to the current government. Also George W Bush is a member. <a href="http://www.augustforecast.com/2013/06/06/trilateral-commission-continues-to-dominate-obama/">http://www.augustforecast.com/2013/06/06/trilateral-commission-continues-to-dominate-obama/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Might be truth to this.</p>

<p>I know at my former university, the first two years courses were deliberately difficult, to weed out people who wouldn&#39;t put in 100% at all costs.</p>

<p>Plus, I have personal experience, maybe I&#39;ll post it here someday, with the notion of American public schools being very shitty.
It&#39;s my anecdotal example, but it convinced me of all the implications surrounding American public school. I&#39;ll post it when I&#39;m on a computer not a cell phone and if ppl are interested.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m trying to say at the moment is the idea of the cards being stacked against us and the would be sources of information being full of jargon and distractions are not impossible, they are very possible and likely in fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Huh? The Dictionary?</p>

<p>The TL;DR if you&#39;re not of the reading type is basically this: </p>

<p><em>Democracy</em> refers to the fact that citizens of a state can vote and/or participate/be represented in the governing bodies of said state. </p>

<p><em>Republic</em> basically indicates that the head of state is an elected/selected position and not an appointed &quot;for life&quot; or hereditary one. </p>

<p>I think the issue is that a lot of people in this sub have the misconception that <em>Democracy</em> refers to the European parliamentary systems, and <em>Republic</em> implies the winner-takes-all brouhaha show we have in the US. </p>

<p>In that case, Russia is a democracy.</p>

<p>The Pledge of Allegiance includes the phrase: &quot;and to the republic for which it stands.&quot; Is the United States of America a republic? I always thought it was a democracy? What&#39;s the difference between the two?</p>

<p>The United States is, indeed, a republic, not a democracy. Accurately defined, a democracy is a form of government in which the people decide policy matters directly--through town hall meetings or by voting on ballot initiatives and referendums. A republic, on the other hand, is a system in which the people choose representatives who, in turn, make policy decisions on their behalf. The Framers of the Constitution were altogether fearful of pure democracy. Everything they read and studied taught them that pure democracies &quot;have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths&quot; (Federalist No. 10).</p>

<p>By popular usage, however, the word &quot;democracy&quot; come to mean a form of government in which the government derives its power from the people and is accountable to them for the use of that power. In this sense the United States might accurately be called a democracy. </p>

<p>In the strictest sense of the word, the system of government established by the Constitution was never intended to be a &quot;democracy.&quot; This is evident not only in the wording of the Pledge of Allegiance but in the Constitution itself which declares that &quot;The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government&quot; (Article IV, Section 4). Moreover, the scheme of representation and the various mechanisms for selecting representatives established by the Constitution were clearly intended to produce a republic, not a democracy.</p>

<p>To the extent that the United States of America has moved away from its republican roots and become more &quot;democratic,&quot; it has strayed from the intentions of the Constitution&#39;s authors. Whether or not the trend toward more direct democracy would be smiled upon by the Framers depends on the answer to another question. Are the American people today sufficiently better informed and otherwise equipped to be wise and prudent democratic citizens than were American citizens in the late 1700s? By all accounts, the answer to this second question is an emphatic &quot;no.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes but Hitler was ruling over a homogeneous nation. So calling him a supremacist at the time means nothing to the conversation. You&#39;re attacking a strawman.</p>

<p>Hitler was voted in before turning the government into a dictatorship. Democracy won. The people wanted a leader. He made sure he could lead by utilizing a certain political model best suited for recovery.</p>

<p>Dictatorships are fine under the right person with the right vision. This has been evident under multiple middle-Eastern regimes that brought nations out of the ashes and were then promptly attacked by the West. It was evident under Chavez for a time. Hitler turned a slave state into the world&#39;s greatest power technologically and culturally. </p>

<p>Parliamentary governments are never good because the majority rules and the majority is corrupt and panders to itself and outside forces. Thus you can never have progress and votes are only superficial.</p>

<p>Assuming that the ovens in the crematoriums could out-perform modern day cremation ovens (they couldn&#39;t) and assuming they could run 24/7 for 80 weeks straight (they couldn&#39;t): 6 bodies a day in 52 ovens for 80 weeks, 312 bodies per day multiplied by 7 days per week = 2184 bodies a week multiplied by 80 (2 years of body disposal &#39;42-&#39;44) = 174,720 maximum. This number drops when using the official number of ovens (46 ovens at Birkenau) and taking into account that ovens couldn&#39;t possibly run full time for 2 years of operation. The number then becomes <strong>less than 154,560</strong>. 1.5 million bodies were disposed of?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They were real. They weren&#39;t murdered. Maybe instead of regurgitating jewish religious doctrine and show trial stats, you should try some independent investigation.</p>

<p>The only genocide in Europe at the time was the once carried out by the jewish NKVD under the Bolshevik Stalin of the 7 million Ukrainians.</p>

<p>The Red Cross inspected Himmler&#39;s POW camps and found towns with public access and decent living conditions until &#39;44 when Germany was no longer able to supply camps with medicine and food and thus Typhus broke out killing millions. About 1.4 million in total of the major camps.</p>

<p>If anyone killed the people in those camps it was the Allies who kept the war going after Hitler had already won in Europe and asked for peace when Churchill refused because he was being lobbied by The Focus group which was a group of industrialists half of which were jewish.</p>

<p>Assuming that the ovens in the crematoriums could out-perform modern day cremation ovens (they couldn&#39;t) and assuming they could run 24/7 for 80 weeks straight (they couldn&#39;t): 6 bodies a day in 52 ovens for 80 weeks, 312 bodies per day multiplied by 7 days per week = 2184 bodies a week multiplied by 80 (2 years of body disposal &#39;42-&#39;44) = 174,720 maximum. This number drops when using the official number of ovens (46 ovens at Birkenau) and taking into account that ovens couldn&#39;t possibly run full time for 2 years of operation. The number then becomes <strong>less than 154,560</strong>. 1.5 million bodies were disposed of?</p>

<p>In my opinion the media is just extremely good at swaying public opinion so that the people who pay the most get the most exposure and win. Recent example is how public online polls of who wins debates, the public polls never correlate with what the media reports. They falsely inflate public opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once Kingdoms went out of style, and king-worship went out of style, they replaced it with Nation-states. </p>

<p>Nationalism/statism is such a small step away from kingdom-worship, but the messaging techniques are so much more refined. It&#39;s a small wonder people fall for it, we&#39;re surrounded by it and it dominates our culture. Our culture could be so much more, but we fall for these fairy tales of nationalism and party affiliation and religion and so on. We get carried away by these ideologies and lose our ability to see things impartially, from all different angles. This warps our minds. Certain thoughts become off-limits. This is the death of true thinking. The death of mental freedom.</p>

<p>But people drink it up, because they are scared, and because they desperately want to succeed both financially and socially.  </p>

<p>The mechanics of this are endlessly fascinating to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, objective reality doesn&#39;t care about whatever structuring principles we invent in our heads to enable the functioning of society--concepts like morality, ownership, etc. These have to be enforced through the one thing that objectively exists-- physical force. That&#39;s the only thing that gives them any real relevance outside of our heads. </p>

<p>So, either we leave it up to each individual to enforce these things for himself, which leads to very chaotic, unfair results, or we collectively choose to delegate that to a supposedly impartial third party-- the government.</p>

<p>The government, when it functions correctly, is, in my opinion, a necessary restriction on personal freedom that enforces the fair cooperation among people that allows us to construct the kind of society we live in today-- something greater than what could be accomplished in a more fragmented, but unrestricted, organization scheme.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t seem to understand what government is.</p>

<p>&quot;So, either we leave it up to each individual to enforce these things for himself&quot; - which would mean free will choice of the individual to participate or not, which government doesn&#39;t allow. You are forced to participate at the point of a gun or the threat to leave your place of birth to go fend for yourself under another government somewhere else.</p>

<p>&quot;which leads to very chaotic, unfair results&quot; -would love to see the evidence for this assumption.</p>

<p>&quot;or we collectively choose to delegate that to a <em>supposedly</em> impartial third party-- the government.&quot; I love that even the defender of government couches the idea that government is impartial with &quot;supposedly&quot;. Government is impartial to its citizens like the mafia is impartial to those it extorts money from. We don&#39;t &quot;collectively delegate&quot; anything to anyone unless being born counts as a vote. Everyone born here is supposedly under contract to the government without ever having signed anything or agreed to anything. The constitution is the only legal document I&#39;ve ever heard of that could be signed by a room full of men and could be legally binding on everyone born on a given land mass into the future forever. </p>

<p>If government actually was collectively chosen there would be nothing immoral about it, however government is enforced, not chosen. Only minor details are chosen while your money and your obedience are are expected and you are punished or killed for disobedience. If something isn&#39;t voluntary it isn&#39;t a service and if something is forced on you against your will it is violence, these are objective facts.</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">1</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/TheObserverO2O.html">TheObserverO2O</a> 2015-12-15</p>
    <div class="md"><p>Sorry about the incoming wall of text.</p>

<p>Basically, when you get right down to it, reality doesn&#39;t care about our ideals. We generally try to adhere to ideals that we call &#39;good&#39;, avoid ones we call &#39;bad&#39;, and create concepts like ownership to help keep control over resources fair (in concept). Society&#39;s cohesiveness is fairly dependent on people&#39;s adhering to these. However, there is no physical basis to these, and, as such, there is literally nothing fundamental in the universe that stops someone from simply rejecting these concepts and acting in a way that completely contradicts them, which would cause some degree of destabilization of society.</p>

<p>You say that without the government, the individual would have the choice of participation or not. Not true. If someone decides that he likes your house and that he doesn&#39;t subscribe to society&#39;s way of doing things, the universe isn&#39;t going to intervene for you when he decides to put a bullet in you and then move his stuff in. If this kind of behavior was typical of human interactions, I can&#39;t imagine society would function smoothly. Again, people generally act in a way that is conducive to cooperation, but not always, and you can&#39;t just opt out of getting your stuff stolen.</p>

<p>So how do we deal with these exceptions to ensure that society&#39;s principles of cooperation are upheld? Ultimately, the answer is that these concepts have to be backed up with physical force. If there were no government whatsoever, it would be the responsibility of the individual to protect his life and property, but that leads to a cutthroat system where the strongest individuals or groups are mostly free to do whatever they want unchallenged. Honestly, it isn&#39;t even always about strength or numbers. Maybe I&#39;m just a trigger happy nutcase that shoots you on sight because I don&#39;t like your skin color; in that case, I&#39;m pretty sure I wouldn&#39;t ask you if you wanted to go along with that or not.</p>

<p>The point is, even if everyone mostly has the goal of getting along with everyone else, there will be conflict. The solution to which is some codified set of laws that is supposed to settle these kinds of issues impartially (provided it is implemented properly). However, once again, laws are intangible and can&#39;t enforce themselves. You need a government with the physical means to enforce its decisions, which, again, are supposed to be impartial in theory. </p>

<p>Of course, it is near impossible to get people to agree on one thing, let alone an entire governmental policy. At some point, you simply have to start enforcing the system, and pretty much no one will agree with all it. In a way government is simply the most powerful group in a society. Such is the reality of living in a society composed of people that aren&#39;t all clones of each other.</p>

<p>Honestly, I am not a humane person. I know myself well enough to say that if I had the physical means to overpower someone else without fear of repercussions, I would not respect people&#39;s claims of ownership, especially regarding land. Frankly, I don&#39;t want to deal with people like myself.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a &#39;defender&#39; of government only because I&#39;m being honest about the physical brutality of reality. Even if society implemented some kind of eugenics program to domesticate the human race into a nearly completely docile species, all it would take is one individual that simply decided not to play along to demonstrate the virtue of a governing body.</p>

<p>This is my fairly anti-human worldview as of this moment, but I&#39;m ambivalent about almost everything, and my opinions change on a whim. If you disagree, I would legitimately like to hear your worldview. Seriously.</p>

<p>No one has authority over you ever, they can only coerce you to do their bidding using the threat of violence, or you can cooperate. If you choose not to cooperate and they still try to assert their authority that is called violence, and it&#39;s the only way the state can act and make things happen.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, and like you say it&#39;s in the mind. Thier control is in 2 places, media and in social influence, that is people acting on their programming to self-police thereby making it unnecessary for everyone to engage in direct media manipulation. Once you realize most of the concerns of our society is just trickled down bullshit, it&#39;s easier to avoid the programming. Just live and laugh at those who say you shouldn&#39;t be laughing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post, OP! Thank you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They also highlight the fact that the main battle is actually authoritarians vs anti-authoritarians.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s very interesting you point that out, because I&#39;ve been discovering recently that my primary orientation to the world is as an anti-authoritarian. While that stance was always part of who I am, I still identified as &quot;left&quot; or &quot;social democrat&quot;. Over the years since 9/11, I am less identified as &quot;left&quot;, and most certainly not &quot;right&quot; or even &quot;libertarian&quot;, but now I am firmly anti-authority. I think it was when I was first exposed to Hannah Arendt&#39;s  concept of the &quot;banality of evil&quot; that I started realizing how insidious authority can be. Then when I got into reading about the Milgram authority experiments and the Asch conformity experiments, it became very clear to me that an informed position against authority is a good starting point when it comes being critical.</p>

<p>I find it interesting that most arguments of so-called sceptics and debunkers is one of pro-authority, while only being sceptical of those who question authority or established orthodoxy.</p>

<p>What? He seems extremely anti-authoritarian from every single interview I&#39;ve ever seen of him. I have never heard of him supporting military action, anywhere.</p>

<p>The only connection is that his dad was in it. There&#39;s no proof he supported it at all. If anything, it seems like he rebelled against that ideology and his father&#39;s path. </p>

<p>No, he isn&#39;t disinfo. Far from it. I&#39;ll re-read and let you know why he came to the conclusions he did. I would agree with you that Zappa was anti-authoritarian, but there&#39;s more to the story. It has to do with the large amount of young people from military and intelligence families who converged at the same time at Lauren Canyon. It&#39;s a great read.</p>

I&#39;m sorry, but that&#39;s delusional. They give you the illusion of choice, but everything is already going on behind the scenes. It doesn&#39;t really matter who is going to end up sitting in the white house.<br/>
I have not given up hope, as you suggested. I merely accepted that the game is rigged, and voting doesn&#39;t change shit. If you want change, you have to look for it elsewhere. I am hopeful more  people will realize this, since it is so blatantly obvious to me.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s a problem with this, especially if you live in the U.S. (I don&#39;t): you only have two parties to choose from at the national level. The system has been rigged, and it seems to me that voting in a system that is rigged gives it legitimacy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From a guy who&#39;s done LSD... It can go either way. It can turn you into a frolicking hippy running through a field with a big fucking grin on your face, or it can be the most terrifying fucking experience you&#39;ll ever go through. To the point where you&#39;re considering ending your life right then and there. Could definitely see why the CIA would play around with it with regard to mind control. But I could also see them finding that the subjects&#39; behavior is too erratic and uncontrollable to be useful in that regard. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, they found it wasn&#39;t useful in any way toward mind control, at all. There are much better drugs for that, like this one shown in this Vice video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToQ8PWYnu04">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToQ8PWYnu04</a></p>

<p>I assume they use drugs like those instead, ones that actually give a person some control over another. Psychedelics generally <em>undo</em> educational/media programming, they don&#39;t enforce it or deepen it. This works to their disadvantage, which is why the psychedelic mind-control programs where discontinued in the 70s. </p>

<p>Get the fuck out, kiddo. Scopalamine is nothing more than a deliriant that makes you more out of your mind and crazy than any other drug in existence, and if you had actually done any research you would know this instead of knowing what vice told you.</p>

<p>&quot;They&quot; invented the hippy movement.  I&#39;ve been following this thread, and I&#39;m so embarrassed for you right now.  You need to google Vito Paulekas (and the freakers).</p>

<p>Dave McGowan was recommended to you, but you&#39;re so protective of your sacred hippy cow that you would rather suggest he (Dave M) was &#39;disinfo&#39; and dismiss him outright without even looking at his work.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hilarious saying that I &quot;bought into the CIA disinfo&quot; because what is really obvious to anyone that knows the history of the CIA and their use of LSD that it&#39;s you that has bought into the disinfo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Disagreeing with you is not &quot;trolling.&quot;</p>

<p>As I said, I&#39;m extremely well read on the subject of the CIA and LSD, and have, in fact, written extensively about it.</p>

<p>Your knowledge of the subject seems to be &quot;I dropped acid a few times.&quot;</p>

<p>Frankly, you fell for the disinfo.</p>

<p>Certainly, the CIA is still powerful, and the hundreds of thousands of people who took CIA-sponsored LSD have done fuck-all to oppose them.</p>

I don&#39;t expect any replies to this in the morning as it will be downvoted/shadowbanned. My other comment in this video is already getting downvoted 5 minutes later at 6am in the morning.

    <div class="md"><p>First I&#39;ve read all into the Laurel Canyon/Zappa/CIA connection, and I don&#39;t buy it. I&#39;m one of the biggest conspiracy theorists out there, and the stuff this guy wrote was so factually incorrect in certain areas, I didn&#39;t buy it. I suppose I should mention that Frank was apparently a Mason too. I guess that&#39;s part of the whole CIA thing?</p>

<p>With regards to LSD, yes it was used as a chemical weapon of sorts. It also passified lots of young people. But that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s bad. I know lots of people who have used hallucinogens and they&#39;re fine. Keep in mind, Frank often talked about how pot &quot;causes brain damage&quot;</p>
