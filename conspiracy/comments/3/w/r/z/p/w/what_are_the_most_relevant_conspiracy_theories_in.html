    <div class="md"><p>How much trust do you put into user reviews online? How about opinions and other information you see on forums? </p>

<p>The internet is one of the most powerful propaganda tools ever created. Years ago when you watched television, you would see government propaganda on the news and corporate propaganda on commercials. This lost some of its power. Those generations grew to understand that you have to be cautious before adopting a piece of information from the television. Then came the internet. Now, a government or corporate stooge can simply create a Reddit account and insert talking points as if they were a regular person. This is particularly powerful propaganda because your guard is down. </p>

<p>The only thing protecting us from a full-blown Orwellian propaganda nightmare is the cost of spreading the propaganda. A government or corporate stooge can only submit so much propaganda online. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2015, we will see the emergence of more automated computational propaganda -- bots using sophisticated artificial intelligence frameworks, removing the need to have humans operate the profiles. Algorithms will not only read the news, but write it. </p>

<p>These stories will be nearly indistinguishable from those written by humans. They will be algorithmically tailored to each individual and employed to change their political beliefs or to manipulate their actions.</p>

<p>But, powered by rapid advances in artificial intelligence, propaganda bots will soon run on genetic algorithms that let their ideas and messaging evolve, based on the resonance and effectiveness of previous messages. We are likely to see versions of these bots deployed on US audiences as part of the 2016 presidential election campaigns.</p>

<p>No. I think it&#39;s extremely childish and ignorant to assume that literally every line in every single article is controlled by a tyrannical entity. You think every journalist is in on it? You think the editors catch 100 percent of the lines to be censored?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The United Nations and socialist groups pursuing the formation of a global centralized government under the guise of environmentalism and climate change.</p>

<p>Quote from the UN&#39;s Own &quot;Agenda 21&quot;: &quot;Effective execution of Agenda 21 will require a profound reorientation of all human society, unlike anything the world has ever experienced a major shift in the priorities of both governments and individuals and an unprecedented redeployment of human and financial resources. This shift will demand that a concern for the environmental consequences of every human action be integrated into individual and collective decision-making at every level.&quot;</p>

<p>Quote by Ottmar Edenhoffer, high level UN-IPCC official:  &quot;We redistribute de facto the world&#39;s wealth by climate policy...Basically it&#39;s a big mistake to discuss climate policy separately from the major themes of globalization...One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with environmental policy anymore.&quot;</p>

<p>Quote by Club of Rome: &quot;In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill....All these dangers are caused by human intervention....and thus the “real enemy, then, is humanity itself....believe humanity requires a common motivation, namely a common adversary in order to realize world government. It does not matter if this common enemy is “a real one or….one invented for the purpose.&quot;</p>

<p>Quote by Maurice Strong, a billionaire elitist, primary power behind UN throne, and large CO2 producer: “Isn&#39;t the only hope for the planet that the industrialized civilizations collapse? Isn&#39;t it our responsibility to bring that about?” </p>

<p>Quote by Gus Hall, former leader of the Communist Party USA: &quot;Human society cannot basically stop the destruction of the environment under capitalism. Socialism is the only structure that makes it possible.&quot;</p>

<p>Quote by Daphne Muller, green-progressive-liberal writer for Salon: &quot;This moment requires we the people to rethink democracy as a global mechanism for enacting policy for and by the planet.&quot;</p>

<p>Quote by Christiana Figueres, leader of the U.N.’s Framework Convention on Climate Change: “This is probably the most difficult task we have ever given ourselves, which is to intentionally transform the economic development model, for the first time in human history.”</p>

<p>Quote by David Brower, a founder of the Sierra Club: &quot;The goal now is a socialist, redistributionist society, which is nature&#39;s proper steward and society&#39;s only hope.&quot;</p>

<p>Quote by UN chief Ban Ki-moon: &quot;Now it is the least developed world who are not responsible for this climate change phenomenon that bore the brunt of climate change consequences so it is morally and politically correct that the developed world who made this climate change be responsible by providing financial support and technological support to these people.&quot;</p>

<p>Quote by David Rockefeller, heir to billion dollar fortune: &quot;We are on the verge of a global transformation. All we need is the right major crisis...&quot;</p>

<p>Quote by Judi Dench, famous UK actress: &quot;The need for a global structure of control in the form of a world environment court is now more urgent than ever before.&quot;</p>

<p>Quote by Naomi Klein, anti-capitalism, pro-hysteria advocate of global warming: “We cannot change the laws of nature. But we can change our economy. Climate change is our best chance to demand and build a better world.”</p>

<p>Quote by Thomas Stocker, IPCC &quot;scientist&quot; and climate modeler: “We need to devise a plan where all sectors of society contribute to the grand goal of de-carbonizing society.”</p>

<p>Quote by Club of Rome: &quot;A keen and anxious awareness is evolving to suggest that fundamental changes will have to take place in the world order and its power structures, in the distribution of wealth and income.&quot;</p>

<p>Quote by Mikhail Gorbachev, communist and former leader of U.S.S.R.: &quot;The emerging &#39;environmentalization&#39; of our civilization and the need for vigorous action in the interest of the entire global community will inevitably have multiple political consequences. Perhaps the most important of them will be a gradual change in the status of the United Nations. Inevitably, it must assume some aspects of a world government.&quot; </p>

<p>Quote by Gordon Brown, former British prime minister: &quot;A New World Order is required to deal with the Climate Change crisis.&quot; </p>

<p>Quote by Club of Rome:  &quot;Now is the time to draw up a master plan for sustainable growth and world development based on global allocation of all resources and a new global economic system. Ten or twenty years form today it will probably be too late.&quot;</p>

<p>Quote by Lester Brown, founder of the Worldwatch Institute, and founder and president of the Earth Policy Institute: &quot;Nations are in effect ceding portions of their sovereignty to the international community and beginning to create a new system of international environmental governance.&quot;</p>

<p>Quote by Dixy Lee Ray, former liberal Democrat governor of State of Washington, U.S.: &quot;The objective, clearly enunciated by the leaders of UNCED, is to bring about a change in the present system of independent nations. The future is to be World Government with central planning by the United Nations. Fear of environmental crises - whether real or not - is expected to lead to – compliance”</p>

<p>Quote by UN&#39;s Commission on Global Governance: &quot;The concept of national sovereignty has been immutable, indeed a sacred principle of international relations. It is a principle which will yield only slowly and reluctantly to the new imperatives of global environmental cooperation.&quot;</p>

<p>Quote by David Shearman, an IPCC Assessor for 3rd and 4th climate change reports: &quot;Government in the future will be based upon . . . a supreme office of the biosphere. The office will comprise specially trained philosopher/ecologists. These guardians will either rule themselves or advise an authoritarian government of policies based on their ecological training and philosophical sensitivities. These guardians will be specially trained for the task.&quot;</p>

<p>Quote by John Holdren, President Obama&#39;s science czar: “A massive campaign must be launched to restore a high-quality environment in North America and to de-develop the United States...De-development means bringing our economic system (especially patterns of consumption) into line with the realities of ecology and the global resource situation...Redistribution of wealth both within and among nations is absolutely essential, if a decent life is to be provided for every human being.&quot;</p>

<p>Quote by Al Gore, former U.S. vice president, mega-millionaire, and large CO2 producer: “Adopting a central organizing principle means embarking on an all-out effort to use every policy and program, every law and institution, to halt the destruction of the environment.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not really saying anything with certainty but just that there are theories out there that suggest something along those lines. </p>

<p>I personally believe that there is free energy tech that has been suppressed and the oil wars are basically just a front for ensuring which currency is being used. This is because every time you use a currency, you endorse the hierarchy around that currency. These hierarchies are spiritual in nature with the USD validating the US corporation, which in turn is a subsidiary of the Crown, which in turn answers to the Vatican. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a sane position to claim to know anything. The ultimate position of sanity is to realise how much you don&#39;t know and that essentially the universe runs off paradox. Find your own truth within as to what resonates and works for you. The best thing you can do is to not be afraid, because that&#39;s what those who are dominating us rely upon. </p>

<p>The BRICS movements appear to be trying to install a new world reserve currency, which will lead to an entire restructuring of international power dynamics and massive woes for the domestic American economy, but I&#39;m not yet sure as to whether those bringing in the currency are doing so as part of the NWO one world government/currency etc or whether it&#39;s actually going to lead to the liberation of the planet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Global warming was made up...by the oil companies.</p>

<p>The &quot;father of climate change&quot; is Maurice Strong. 11th grade drop out, moves to New York and happens to be offered room and board at 18 by a friend of the Rockefellers. Gets to know the Rockefellers and goes into the oil business. Sells oil for his young career and then sets up the IPCC and the terms of their existence:</p>

<p>Determine man&#39;s influence on climate.</p>

<p>The goals of global warming match those of the Rockefellers to the crossing of Ts and Exxon publishes 53 peer-reviewed papers all saying &quot;OMG CO2&quot; while being used as the scapegoat &quot;boogey-man&quot; while controlled by the biggest global warming proponent in the world.</p>

<p>So, yes, they pretend.</p>

<p>No.  Not at all.</p>

<p>But not the point (s)he thinks.</p>

<p>Now you&#39;re moving the goalposts.  (S)he mentioned the more generic &quot;climate change.&quot;  That said...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>unless you think global warming is made up and a hoax </p>

<p>Ok, you see, now there is an actual false choice.  I know the climate has been changing as long as earth has had a climate just as time has been moving forward from the day it began. (Assuming of course that time is linear. Please don&#39;t go all Cat in the Hat on me.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>maybe oil companies just pretend to cover it up </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe that&#39;s just a bit of spin on a bit of spin.  Entrenched oil interests stand to gain most from both the carbon credit trading schemes and the new artificial limits placed (read: barrier-to-entry, decreased competition and further solidification of the present energy oligopoly) on drilling/production permitting.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If power and control are the concerns, then the real question you should be asking yourself is if governments and their lackies can be trusted not to lie with so much money, power and control on the line.</p>

<p>that question doesnt arise naturally from what <a href="/u/Horus_Krishna_2">/u/Horus_Krishna_2</a> said (he in fact answered his own question while u setup a new one for no reason). i think we all on this subreddit know the answer to the question u recommend to ask ourselves. its blatantly obvious in fact. so why would u bring it up at a tangent to an argument? writing long wellformed replies which are at a tangent, while someone else says the right on-topic things in kiddy form doesnt make them less legit. my verdict - ur derailing the discussion, consciously ornotherwise.</p>

<p>p.s - i think everyone understands climate change, from the context, to mean alarming and unnatural global warming rather than slower worldwide eternal climate processes. that wa honestly very childish of u and what alerted me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There needs to be a better term for profiteer banker networks than capitalist / socialist / statist, etc.  All of these political terms and systems are irrelevant, because those who are making money in this poisonous world don&#39;t care about politics except to the extent that they can kontrol them.  They are apolitical, fashionable, agnostic--they care about money alone and will do anything, even warp our minds to get it.  </p>

<p>There are those that blame monopolists (rockafellers, dynasties, oligarchs), then there are those that blame cryptosocialists (frankfurt school, critical theorists, etc); neither side is really getting to the core of the problem and it&#39;s with the elite shadow operators who don&#39;t care about socialism or capitalism--they care about money.  In socialism, they&#39;ll be the citizen comptrollers responsible for overseeing the disbursement of resource, be it money, housing, food, etc.  Under capitalism, the&#39;ll be majority shareholders of various large finanicial institutions like barclays&#39;.  </p>

<p>So we have to stop falling into fear tropes over <em>socialism</em> or <em>capitalism-gone-amok</em>, it&#39;s not about that.  IT&#39;s about bankers and those who hold the true power of purse.  Those with the power to make up money at will by <em>spelling it into existence</em> (infinity QE). And if it&#39;s not money, then it&#39;s power itself.  Who wields it and from where, and on whose authority.</p>

<p>There is one inconvenient truth in this: it&#39;s that the people itself who participate in such a system are to a large degree culpable for maintaining it&#39;s power, so we need to look at anarchic alternatives such as agorism and peer-to-peer money systems, communication systems (&quot;our own damned internet&quot;) and any kind of syndicate-based (shareholders) technology that is transparent and open to everyone.  This was as capitalism was intended.  Not this insider trading including perpetrating false flag events and the foreknowledge gained by intelligence community ingroups, elite access to high frequency tradition prioritization horseshit</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not so sure that they really care about money. They can about power in all of its forms. So, money, sure! But also about connections, information, control of the police force, army, pols, etc. </p>

<p>We can&#39;t blame the people too much. They are born into the system that they live in. It is like water to the fish. They can&#39;t even understand that it exists in many cases. </p>

<p>Bitcoin, some sort of alternative net, co-ops, worker-owners,  there are a lot of possibilities out there. But it will take a lot of work on our part.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While there are alternative theories why water is fluoridated, it&#39;s a fact that public water fluoridation does not offer significant health benefits.  </p>

<p>It is argued that it prevents tooth decay, but the fluoride already found in toothpastes makes that argument moot. </p>

<p>Also, imagine all the fluoride that is literally flushed down the toilet.  Probably 99 percent of fluoride is wasted in household uses like washing the car or watering the lawn.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s just scratching the surface.</p>

<p>It&#39;s in the water so not only do we drink it, we bathe in it, we cook with it, we brush with it... people like to argue that it&#39;s only parts per million but neglect to realize how frequently and unavoidably we interact with this industrial waste product. The accumulation over many years is where the real negative health effects derive from (dental fluorisis, thyroid complications, etc..)</p>

<p>Even if you wanna ignore the fact that this is a hazardous waste product that we pay phosphate fertilizer companies to poison our water with (it&#39;s a very costly byproduct to deal with otherwise, but now they&#39;ve turned it to a profit). Even if you feel, despite evidence to the contrary that fluoride is needed for healthy teeth, why then are local government officials allowed to do what a doctor can not, i.e. indiscriminately drug people without their consent? People of all ages and sizes, tell me how you&#39;re supposed to adjust dosage for a baby vs. A full grown man?</p>

<p>If people want fluoride, great, go get some tablets and take all the fluoride you want, but don&#39;t poison my water</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But not the point (s)he thinks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>went completely over my head.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If power and control are the concerns, then the real question you should be asking yourself is if governments and their lackies can be trusted not to lie with so much money, power and control on the line.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that question doesnt arise naturally from what <a href="/u/Horus_Krishna_2">/u/Horus_Krishna_2</a> said (he in fact answered his own question while u setup a new one for no reason). i think we all on this subreddit know the answer to the question u recommend to ask ourselves. its blatantly obvious in fact. so why would u bring it up at a tangent to an argument? writing long wellformed replies which are at a tangent, while someone else says the right on-topic things in kiddy form doesnt make them less legit. my verdict - ur derailing the discussion, consciously ornotherwise.</p>

<p>p.s - i think everyone understands climate change, from the context, to mean alarming and unnatural global warming rather than slower worldwide eternal climate processes. that wa honestly very childish of u and what alerted me.</p>
