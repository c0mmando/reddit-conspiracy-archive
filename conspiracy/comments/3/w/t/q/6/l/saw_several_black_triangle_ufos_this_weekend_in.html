       I can't find any information about this online and I want to know what I saw.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was driving on the Belt Parkway, through Brooklyn, with my girlfriend.  It was around 11PM on Saturday night.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw a set of three lights up ahead, off to the right side of the road as I perceived them (the road curved slightly, so I may have been wrong).  My first reaction to the lights were that they were a drone.  I don't know why, but there didn't appear to be a building attached.  I was going to point it out to my girlfriend, but figured it might just be a crane or something.  It's hard for me to estimate how high they were, but I'm going to say two or three times higher than the street lights, so anywhere from 50-300 feet up, depending on how high the street lights were.  I'd say I initially noticed the lights somewhere between a half mile and a mile away, simply based on the time it took to get to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       As we got closer, I took my eyes off the lights to pay attention to the road and did not notice them until we were about to pass directly underneath them.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Holy Shit!!!  Did you see what that was!?", as I passed underneath the object with the lights.  At this point the object was directly over the car and more on the Driver's side, so I suppose it was probably in the middle of the parkway between both lanes of traffic.  Now, I looked up as we were passing under it, but not long enough to completely register a perfect image in my mind.  It was definitely above the streetlights, but very low in the scheme of vehicles in the sky.  It was also silent, at least under the noise of traffic.  I can't say that I heard any sound at all as I passed underneath it.  We were just all of a sudden under a huge hovering object,
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we were very close to JFK airport- I believe we were probably between JFK and Flloyd Bennet Field (home to many airplane hangers and runways) at the time.  The experience of seeing the aircraft overhead was similar to driving by an airport and seeing plane fly low over the highway to land.  It was difficult to estimate a height because I have no idea how large the vehicle was.  But I can say for certain that it was not moving, or at the very least, was moving extremely slowly.  It was also triangular with three bright white lights and several smaller colored lights underneath it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I assumed it was a traffic drone, because of where it was positioned over the highway.  My reaction once I confirmed that my girlfriend DID see it, was to explain astonishedly that what we saw was very clearly what UFO witnesses have been claiming for years as "
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_triangle_%28UFO%29">
        Black Triangle UFOs
       </a>
       ", only we were way too close to an airport and NYC for this to be anything non-sanctioned.  I exclaimed something to the effect of "when did these things go from being the stuff of myth to being openly used for surveillance?".  I assumed this must either be NYPD or homeland security.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         it seemed to large for a hobbyist project and I can't imagine someone without official clearance would be allowed to fly this over traffic
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         a "secret USAF government project" (skunkworks/ phantom works) would probably not be so daft as to flight test low flying vehicles right by the most densely populated and heavily monitored airspace in the US.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         this was a man made uav with green and red running lights.  Not some alien interdimensional orb that made me feel like I was hallucinating.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       But the problem I had with this hypothesis, was the size of this uav/ drone.  It was way larger than one would need for simple video surveillance.  I'm pondering this all outloud and my girlfriend is still sitting somewhat shocked at what we just drove under.
      </p>
      <p>
       I look up in the sky. There are clearly planes flying over head.  I think I saw a helicopter as well.  But further up the parkway, there are more of these hovering sets of triangularly arranged lights.  We drive by another, which is a bit higher up and not directly over the parkway as the first.  It's very distinguishable from a plane as it's just hovering. Also, whereas a plane has red and green lights strobing at the ends of the wings to designate the direction it's flying, the red and green lights on these were within the triangle formed by the white lights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once we passed the second and had time for a longer look at it (albeit from farther away), we really started looking around and realized that there were several more up ahead of us.  My girlfriend did manage to get one on video.  It's higher and father off the highway,  so I can't prove that the object itself is framed and triangular, but it is very clearly hovering and looks exactly like videos of black triangle UFOs filmed at night that I can find online.  Photos did not come out as we were traveling 65 mph and filming through a windshield.
      </p>
      <p>
       I expected to be able to find information about these UAVs, but cannot find any.  If anyone has info or can tell me why I'm incorrect in what I believe I saw, please let me know.  I'll probably upload the video when I get a chance and I'm sure most people will say it's a tricopter drone.  It may be, but someone has to have information of why they were there and who was flying them.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: videos of one of them.  i uploaded them in reverse order by accident.  this one was much higher than the first and farther off the parkway.  I'd hoped it was going to be right over the road, so we started filming farther out as we approached to give some perspective.  Tried to take some still pictures,but they didn't some out.  the video is not very good, and we go under an overpass, but you can still see what it is.  This was hovering and not moving at all.  There is time between each of the videos- the object is not moving towards us.

       I'll post the video later.  There is a video from further away that just shows the hovering lights, and then a video that is very clearly a hovering "black triangle" with three white lights and some colored lights inside of them.  It's short and not well filmed, but it's undeniable that this was a large drone at the very least.

       I live in pa and the other night I saw two floating lights a over the sunset. They definitely weren't airplanes and just sat still for a bit. I was driving and my view was blocked and they disappeared.

       an airplane. i've only seen an UFO once, early morning in NJ, it was dark, was driving by myself going to work. Just happened to look up, to the right &amp; saw a large
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       flying silently, the car had automatic windows, so i know it was silent. i know it was huge 'cause it blacked out the sky. at that time of morning wasn't much traffic, i pulled up to a 7-11, but it was gone.

       Look up the TR-3 aurora project and see if it looks anything like that.  They are alleged to not exist, but there are a lot of places to read about them.

       Yes, I am familiar with the aurora project and actually have friends who work for phantom works that I've asked about it before.  I was under the impression that aurora was a high altitude uav that could potentially be used as a "space plane"

       I saw something in New Jersey years ago that looks exactly like what people claim the aurora looks like and it was flying absurdly low. It was almost completely inaudible until pretty much directly overhead, I probably wouldn't have even noticed it had visibility conditions not been ideal (full moon, very visible profile against lit cloudy backdrop).

       Shit man, that third one is pretty clear.  I wish I could have seen that.  I wonder what it was doing there.  More priming for the fake alien invasion?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:  I thought maybe it was for surveillance but they already have
       <a href="https://theintercept.com/2014/12/17/billion-dollar-surveillance-blimp-launch-maryland/">
        blimps for that.

       Edit 2:  You know man, people will brush this off and say the footage is fake, but if you were there and you saw it then you
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       that the military has the technology to hover without the use of propellers.  That means that our military understands propulsion/energy in a way that is not accepted by our current model of physics.

       I don't know that there weren't propellers.  I do know that there werent jets propelling it up, though, because I drove right underneath one that was very low and very large.  As far as I'm concerned, it was silent.
      </p>
      <p>
       I talked to my girlfriend about it and neither of us are completely sure how to describe what we saw up close.  she says it was at least twice the size of our car and probably 30 to 50 feet over our head (whereas the one in the video is probably over 1000 feet up).  I thought it was significantly larger.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I know for sure is that these were hovering vehicles and that there were several of them around JFK airport and Floyd Bennet field, including one that was right over the highway.  The one in the video was the 3 or 4th one we saw as we were driving, and was the farthest away.
      </p>
      <p>
       I expected to be able to find information about them and I can't find any at all.  People have gotten in trouble for flying drones in that area so I would think it would be in the news as it's protected airspace and a very populated area.  I'm a skeptic.  I believe aviation technology is much more advanced than the public knows and that there are almost definitely drones in space at this point.  Nothing that I saw was outside of the realm of what I'm sure exists- I'm just curious as to why it was there and who it belonged to.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was a hobbyist- how and why were they allowed to fly over the highway where it could have caused an accident?
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was a small company testing, taking video or doing marketing- ditto?
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was for surveillance, why was it so large and why were there so many?
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was weaponized, why was it in new york?
      </p>
      <p>
       If it belonged to the NYPD, FBI or Homeland Security- why can't I find any information about it?
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was part of a secret USAF program, why was it flying in such a populated and controlled airspace?

       I have not read it but I am familiar with the book.  It is interesting that he calls the secret government agency "Majestic," which is very similar to the Majestic 12, which reportedly exists.

       I postulate that if we knew it existed then we would realize that oil is not the most efficient method of propulsion which would undermine the oil moguls that have their hands in everything.  How could the military industrial complex convince people to wage wars for oil if there was technology that rendered oil obsolete.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the technology was harmless quad copter/drone technology then there would be no reason for the owner of that drone to keep it a secret.  I believe that the nature of this craft would shatter the current paradigm of energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first assumption of economics is the concept of scarcity.  Scarcity exists, so we must determine a way to allocate these scarce resources to where they are most needed, which leads to supply and demand, etc.  If it turned out that scarcity is a lie, and there IS such thing as free energy, then the entire basis of our capitalist society could come into question and that is undesirable for the fat cats that are currently dominating the current state of affairs.

       I think you're making a lot of assumptions and leaps here to back up your belief.  That doesn't mean you're wrong, just that there's not a ton of evidence to back up your point and I can't justify following you on this one.
      </p>

       You should read that book though.  It's good.  And the fact that it's written by Skull and Bones member and son of the famous pundit- William F, makes it even more interesting.

       The only assumption I am making is that this drone/craft is not using propellers or jets.  The propellers required to make a helicopter fly are loud and so are jets.  Perhaps it is very lightweight and is using some quiet props but I doubt it.

       You probably should have held back on posting this until you could also post the video. I'm very interested in seeing what you captured on your camera. I saw something unusual in the sky some time ago and figured it was a military drone. When I started looking up military drones on Google Images, I found that the only thing that looked remotely similar to what I saw was referred to as a "black triangle UFO."
      </p>
      <p>
       For what it's worth, I would imagine that these aircraft, as well as many other unidentified aircraft spotted over the course of the past seventy years, are related to USAF/NASA. I would also venture to guess that in fifty years it will be public knowledge and not a military secret anymore. Perhaps your grandchildren will be flying to Beijing in 15 minutes on a large commercial black triangle aircraft. Plenty of exciting things to come, as far as I can tell!

       I'll post the video later.  There is a video from further away that just shows the hovering lights, and then a video that is very clearly a hovering "black triangle" with three white lights and some colored lights inside of them.  It's short and not well filmed, but it's undeniable that this was a large drone at the very least.
