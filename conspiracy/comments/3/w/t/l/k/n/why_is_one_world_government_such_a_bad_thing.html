Plus, you&#39;ll never find a someone in power who is honest and for the people.  Mainly because people choose to get into politics, they want the power.  Honestly I don&#39;t think people should choose to go into politics.  People should have to serve for a short period of time, like jury duty.  Because I don&#39;t trust anyone who wants a career in politics, all that means is they want power.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.</p>

<p>They. <strong>ALL.</strong> Are.</p>

<p>A politician is someone who feels like they should have an impact on policies and wants to govern people or spread memetic information that leads to changes, innovations or tries to revert changes that have been made.</p>

<p>People who decide they should govern/rule over any amount of other people necessarily do so because they have a psychological disposition to seek power.</p>

<p>Power is their motivation. People who don&#39;t have a power-motive usually don&#39;t try to become the boss over anybody or anyone.</p>

<p>What you probably mean is that some have &quot;nobler motives than all those other guys&quot;, but even that is problematic, because how do you go about determining whether somebody is noble or not? For the most part, people have different ideas about different things.</p>

<p>And totalitarianism has almost never been the solution to the big problems. Discussion, Pluralism, Reason, Debates, Participation on the other hand are fairly reliable for the most part. And even those come with flaws. I don&#39;t see how totalitarian crap could fix that in a way that does more damage than good.</p>

<p>That would be great! The only problem with that idea is that there has been zero evidence that it will happen. You should check out the works of George Orwell. Power corrupts, it always has done and i cannot see that changing. A united Humanity is a wonderful notion but all i have seen in the vast majority of my adult life is government manipulation and the rich feeding the rich. </p>

<p>Do you believe the tiny elite minority currently have our interests in mind? If so, what makes you think so?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I find most conspiricists are always expecting the worst.</p>

<p>I wonder why? I&#39;ve been around a long enough to know to expect the worst from the &quot;tiny elite minority&quot;. However, I remain optimistic about most of humanity. We just have to free ourselves from the propaganda that blinds us.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our concern and the subject of this discussion is the WHO/UNICEF sponsored tetanus immunization campaign launched last year in October ostensibly to eradicate neonatal tetanus. It is targeted at girls and women between the ages of 14 – 49 (child bearing age) and in 60 specific districts spread all around the country. </p>

<p>The tetanus vaccine being used in this campaign has been imported into the country specifically for this purpose and bears a different batch number from the regular TT. So far, 3 doses have been given – the first in October 2013, the second in March 2014 and the third in October 2014. It is highly possible that there are two more doses to go.</p>

<p>Giving five doses of tetanus vaccination every 6 months is not usual or the recommended regime for tetanus vaccination. The only time tetanus vaccine has been given in five doses is when it is used as a carrier in fertility regulating vaccines laced with the pregnancy hormone - Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) developed by WHO in 1992.</p>

<p>When tetanus is laced with HCG and administered in five doses every 6 months, the woman develops antibodies against both the tetanus and the HCG in 2 – 3 years after the last injection. Once a mother develops antibodies against HCG, she rejects any pregnancy as soon as it starts growing in her womb thus causing repeated abortions and subsequent sterility.</p>

<p>WHO conducted massive vaccinations campaigns using the tetanus vaccine laced with HCG in Mexico in 1993 and Nicaragua and Philippines in 1994 ostensibly to eradicate neonatal tetanus. The campaign targeted women aged 14 – 49 years and each received a total of 5 injections.</p>

<p>What is downright immoral and evil is that the tetanus laced with HCG was given as a fertility regulating vaccine without disclosing its ‘contraceptive effect’ to the girls and the mothers. As far as they were concerned, they had gone for an innocent injection to prevent neonatal tetanus!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hitler is only Hitler when you&#39;re looking backwards in time.  In Hitlers prime he was seen as a hero by the German people.  So you&#39;re right, people wouldn&#39;t elect a Hitler, but they would elect the next guy who will become even more notorious than Hitler.  </p>

<p>Its kind of weird to me that you actually think the German people knew they were electing the most notorious leader in the history of the world.  </p>

<p>The people absolutely would elect a Hitler, they do it over and over again throughout history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because humans are flawed and history teaches us that the trend into tyranny is reciprocal. Having nations is like having a firewall against tyrannical force. Why do we need a one world government? Whats wrong with multi-nation cooperation via treaty? That gives nations flexibility to disagree or agree based on certain circumstances. Putting humanity&#39;s governmental eggs into one basket is not a good idea. </p>

You made a post describing an extremely unlikely hypothetical situation and you don&#39;t like the answers you&#39;re getting. Just curious, what are you expecting should get done?</p>

<p>Having a central govt doesn&#39;t even work for 50 states and 300mil people in the USA. A world govt would be multitudes more complex than the USA. How do you ensure that benevolence, prudence, fairness and compassion guide the system and not corruption and psychopathy as has been the case with almost every society humans have made thus far? &quot;Ridiculously unfeasible&quot; is about the tamest phrase I can think of to describe it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.matercare.org/news-publications/medical-news/catholic-doctors-speak-tetanus-vaccination-campaign-is-all-about-population-control/">Really?</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our concern and the subject of this discussion is the WHO/UNICEF sponsored tetanus immunization campaign launched last year in October ostensibly to eradicate neonatal tetanus. It is targeted at girls and women between the ages of 14 – 49 (child bearing age) and in 60 specific districts spread all around the country. </p>

<p>The tetanus vaccine being used in this campaign has been imported into the country specifically for this purpose and bears a different batch number from the regular TT. So far, 3 doses have been given – the first in October 2013, the second in March 2014 and the third in October 2014. It is highly possible that there are two more doses to go.</p>

<p>Giving five doses of tetanus vaccination every 6 months is not usual or the recommended regime for tetanus vaccination. The only time tetanus vaccine has been given in five doses is when it is used as a carrier in fertility regulating vaccines laced with the pregnancy hormone - Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) developed by WHO in 1992.</p>

<p>When tetanus is laced with HCG and administered in five doses every 6 months, the woman develops antibodies against both the tetanus and the HCG in 2 – 3 years after the last injection. Once a mother develops antibodies against HCG, she rejects any pregnancy as soon as it starts growing in her womb thus causing repeated abortions and subsequent sterility.</p>

<p>WHO conducted massive vaccinations campaigns using the tetanus vaccine laced with HCG in Mexico in 1993 and Nicaragua and Philippines in 1994 ostensibly to eradicate neonatal tetanus. The campaign targeted women aged 14 – 49 years and each received a total of 5 injections.</p>

<p>What is downright immoral and evil is that the tetanus laced with HCG was given as a fertility regulating vaccine without disclosing its ‘contraceptive effect’ to the girls and the mothers. As far as they were concerned, they had gone for an innocent injection to prevent neonatal tetanus!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.</p>

<p>They. <strong>ALL.</strong> Are.</p>

<p>A politician is someone who feels like they should have an impact on policies and wants to govern people or spread memetic information that leads to changes, innovations or tries to revert changes that have been made.</p>

<p>People who decide they should govern/rule over any amount of other people necessarily do so because they have a psychological disposition to seek power.</p>

<p>Power is their motivation. People who don&#39;t have a power-motive usually don&#39;t try to become the boss over anybody or anyone.</p>

<p>What you probably mean is that some have &quot;nobler motives than all those other guys&quot;, but even that is problematic, because how do you go about determining whether somebody is noble or not? For the most part, people have different ideas about different things.</p>

<p>And totalitarianism has almost never been the solution to the big problems. Discussion, Pluralism, Reason, Debates, Participation on the other hand are fairly reliable for the most part. And even those come with flaws. I don&#39;t see how totalitarian crap could fix that in a way that does more damage than good.</p>
