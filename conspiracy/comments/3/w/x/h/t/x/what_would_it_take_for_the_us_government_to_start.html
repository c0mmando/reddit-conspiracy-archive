In other countries people protest their government, but when things like the TPP happen here everyone just accepts it and moves on. How long will this continue? Is there any hope?

    <div class="md"><p>I think when the US Dollar s no longer oil reserve currency, this could lead to a break up of the U.S. which I&#39;m all for. Break up into 4-5 separate republics. The mini republics which have budget surplus, good economies, decent resources can get a leg up on universal basic incomes.</p>

<p>Then the movements have to be at the ground level. Think co-ops, trade/barter, 3d printing, solar and electric cars, break away from the federal reserve and start a separate gold backed currency, create a strong import/export economy with China and others.</p>

It doesn&#39;t help though, that the rocerfellers Carnegie&#39;s and Rothschild&#39;s Have their finger on the us economy&#39;s kill switch.  It was them that caused the Flash Crash of may 6 2010, where they tanked the markets to the tune of a trillion $, because congress was deliberating an audit of the FED including the OMC branch.  Then congress backtracked and excluded the OMC from the audit, and the stocks miraculously recovrred., and the whole thing was nefariously blamed on some idiot of HFT, which is a complete utter bull shit lie.  So if the USS does break up, the winner states will be the ones that give wall st a real hard fucking kick in the balls!  Like kick them wall st. nuts so hard that its gonna hurt them for the next 200 years .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>in a UBI, there is still a currency system in place initially, so instead of making a Fiat Currency UBI, it would be a gold back currency UBI that would still be tied into jobs, selling/buying, services, and the governing body having its trade and economy.</p>

<p>There are thick ass volumes of books that discuss this stuff super in dept and get very technical. But basically, going back to Gold back and hedging bets against the eventual dropping of USD as reserve dollar for OIL needs to happen or there will be a massive collapse here without it.</p>

<p>When A.I. and robots take all jobs in 50 years, then we&#39;ll probably shift to some block chain UBI digital currency, but something like that is above my current level of basic understanding.</p>

<p>Give <a href="/r/ethereum">/r/ethereum</a> a glance. They&#39;re attempting a sort of decentralized internet of things using block chain and all sorts of cool future implications if you can wrap your head around it</p>

So they tried again with a more centralized, more powerful federal government, and here we are today. They even formalized the use of state militias by the federal government so suppress insurrection, most obviously manifested in the 2nd amendment. That government is still intact and this country is the most powerful force on the planet. Just saying, the founding fathers get misrepresented way too often.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ding! Ding! Ding!  </p>

<p>What you&#39;re looking for is called the &quot;Psychology of Power.&quot;  Here&#39;s a great quote on the topic from <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/201401/love-and-power">an article in Psychology Today</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The possession of power changes powerholders—usually in ways invisible to them—by triggering activation of the behavioral approach system, based in the left frontal cortex and fueled by the neurotransmitter dopamine. It’s automatic. Nevertheless, it makes powerful people quick to act on appetites, to detect opportunities for material and social rewards such as food, money, attention, sex, and approval. They think about sex more and flirt more flagrantly. Poorly attuned to others, they pay little attention to others’ feelings and assess their attitudes, interests, and needs inaccurately. Politeness be damned, they act rudely, indulging their own whims. “Having power,” Keltner reports, “makes people more likely to act as sociopaths.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article is on romantic love, but this principle applies in any kind of mismatched power dynamic, whether in love, business, or politics.  Even better is the following paragraph, looking at what happens on the other side:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The biological obverse marks the powerless. Their lack of power activates the brain’s inhibitory system, centered in the right frontal cortex, which directs attention to threat and punishment and sets in motion avoidant behavior. It also ushers in negative feelings, notably anxiety and depression, virtually hallmark emotions of those denied power. If the thwarting of identity isn’t distressing enough, add in the lack of partner responsiveness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Boom!  Doesn&#39;t that explain a lot?</p>

<p>When you give people power over others, you turn them into sociopaths.  The answer to our problem is therefore quite obvious to me.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not obvious to me. Hierarchy is a natural human tendency. You cannot eliminate it, and cannot therefore eliminate the power-sociopath construct. Even if you did not have institutionalized power, natural hierarchies would form in ways that I suspect would be very similar. When I think about it, I don&#39;t see an easy solution at all. If you&#39;re sitting on one, I&#39;ll certainly at least hear you out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anarchy, of course.  :)  Obviously, anarchy doesn&#39;t actually work, since (as you said) hierarchy seems to be a natural human tendency.</p>

<p>However, if we set up power structures with explicit goals and <strong>explicit expirations</strong>, then perhaps we can avoid the current situation of institutionalized sociopathy that endures for many generations, killing billions of people.  If power causes sociopathy, then we should recognize this on the face of it, and construct extreme limitations on power.</p>

<p>Anarchy should be a goal that we strive towards.  We&#39;ll never get there -- and that&#39;s OK -- but we should recognize the price that we pay as a society for any sort of power hierarchy.  We should minimize that price by minimizing power structures to the absolute smallest possible extent.</p>

As though all you need to do is flush it out and everything we&#39;ll be fine. As though the 300 million people who elected the last government wont vote this time around. Maybe if it involves redistricting everything, but then again fair redistricting would mean Democratic wins for decades, so Ron Paul guys probably wont be too into that idea. Maybe if they&#39;d propose a new voting system altogether, like a proportionate representation in congress, then I&#39;d say, &quot;That might go somewhere.&quot; But all I hear instead is, &quot;We have a revolution where all of my policy objectives are complete and then everything will be fine.&quot; which sounds like bitterness that democracy gets in the way of their guy winning.</p>

<p>Ah, not quite! Actually, the majority of full nodes must agree to the changes proposed by the developers, otherwise those changes do not go into actual effect.</p>

<p>Now, yes, it is true that <em>currently</em> the developers are well-respected and their proposals are taken seriously by the world&#39;s full node users, but that could very well change if their conduct is no longer up to par.</p>

<p>I suppose there is some truth to that, since communism is the supposed &quot;solution&quot; to capitalism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every two years, a revolution is possible in America.  Yes, it&#39;s difficult to engineer a huge turnover of the House of Representatives, but we have the power to do so.  If you think Bernie Sanders or Ron Paul wouldn&#39;t be beholden to corporate interests, what would 350 of them do in the House?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even in reality we vote for our house members every two years.  I realize it&#39;s a tall order, but it&#39;s doable.  It will take a lot of hard work, but it&#39;s more realistic than the post directly below mine right now:</p>

<p>&quot;A reset button.  A revolution.  An armed arrest of all the top asshats ruining the country.  Dismantling the bloated departments not needed.  In essense (sic), a Ron Paul presidency.&quot;</p>

<p>Talk about lacking in reality.  The reflection on &#39;hope&#39; and &#39;change&#39; from 08 is that the president can be rendered powerless really easily in the American system.  A &#39;radical&#39; president would not change anything, but dismantling the existing House WOULD.  </p>

<p>But it will take a lot of really hard work and organization and it&#39;s a lot easier to sit on the internet and complain into our echo chamber. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hear hear. I think one problem is that we have these conversations in threads like these, and then they are lost. We just continue about our normal business with only a little bit of it actually sinking in. I think that&#39;s a real weakness in using Reddit instead of an actual forum- less posterity, less engagement, less community.<br/>
I worry that none of us could ever do something like start our own political party. Posting in places like this could so easily come back to bite us if we ever stood out enough to be a target, politically.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you can look at American history and see that a segment of the population has always been fighting for a change in what they see wrong.  It&#39;s usually college aged people.  Then they age, have children, and they become less idealistic and more interested in preserving the lifestyle of their family.  Look at the hippy movement, then the years of the anarchy people at the DNC, the occupy movement, the people who wear the white masks (what are they called? Anonymous?)  If real change needs to happen, a ton of people have to decide they don&#39;t care about their standard of living.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any &quot;solution&quot; you can think of, like a revolution, can be turned on its head and serve the exact opposite of its intended purpose. Why ? Because of how people act in their day-to-day lives. Aren&#39;t they functioning first and foremost for their own interests ? Why would politicians be any different ? Manipulation, negativity and fear are deeply ingrained in the human psyche. Politicians come from the people, and people are what they are. Either we fix ourselves unequivocally, or we collectively head deeper into hell. Pointing fingers is a cop-out to the problems of humanity. </p>

<p>Then the movements have to be at the ground level. Think co-ops, trade/barter, 3d printing, solar and electric cars, break away from the federal reserve and start a separate gold backed currency, create a strong import/export economy with China and others.</p>
