       So I've been fucking guys this whole time? Ffs dude, couldn't you have told me earlier. Would've been way more convenient figuring out I am gay before all that pussy. Thanks though, better to find out late than never!

       Yeah, sorry.  A bit late on the announcement.  But hey!  At least we can all be gay together now without worrying about the judgement (or possible existence) of women, which is all that stopped us before, right?

       You are worried about judgement of women? Way to incorporate your insecurities into your theory. You think you didn't crawl out of your mom's vagina? How old are you anyway? You're still a virgin?

       Lol, just trying to expand on an absurd theory, which is itself just a parody of the "real women" debate.  Way to turn a joke into an insult.  You are really quite sensitive, aren't you?

       Nah, I just can't stand stoner theories. You believe we are hallucinating so you can therefore negate any criticism to your theory by simply saying hallucination.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell me how I can check if I am indeed hallucinating and that these women in my life are just fever dreams. If you can't tell me how to check if your theory is true than it's nothing but another stoner theory that has no place here.

       Despite that, though, I see your point about the theory's validity.  It was never intended to be an actual theory about the reality of non-existent women, just a joking concept about the term "real women," designed as an antithesis to the "all women are real" argument by arguing that "no women are real," in the most literal sense.  We all have sensory experiences with women, so the concept had to have some kind of explanation for those experiences.  I figured the easiest way to do that would be to say that men imagine their existence.  Sure, that's not exactly an original idea.  But it serves its purpose, and I saw no point in trying to come up with an even more convoluted explanation.  I knew it was bunk when I came up with it and can't make any scientific claims for its accuracy in fact.  Maybe it would be better fitted to writing prompts.  Just figured someone here might get a laugh out of it.

       Like, I just happened to see someone ranting about "real women," and I thought "what does that even mean?  'Real women?'  Like there are women that don't exist?"  Normally, social justice warriors respond to this question with "all women are real!"  But that's a bit cliche and uninteresting, so I thought "what if NO woman was real, like they literally don't exist and men have just imagined their existence."  All the stuff about "beauty" is just a continuity device to explain where our mental images of women come from, and to make the concept seem more expansive.

       Sure, it's just when those people deride the idea of "real women" it is their way of trying to dismiss expectations of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think most of female "beauty" is an arbitrary concept. It all seems to be accentuating female traits that are inherently sexually desirable.

       Women who wear makeup regularly do so mostly for themselves, and very little for our enjoyment.  Even when they go out with no intention of attracting men, where they may not even SEE any men, they will often still wear makeup because it is an expression of how they see themselves.  Their face is less of a sexual organ, in their mind, and more of a canvas on which they can express themselves.  Men can do that too.  But other men ridicule any man who tries it because we live with the false assumption that makeup is used only for getting men's dicks hard and nothing else.
      </p>
      <p>
       It isn't women who deny men the ability to embrace their physical and sexual identity, it's other men.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR Makeup is for yourself, not for others.

       They are doing it for the perception of people in general, both men and women. You think women aren't competitive against each other? I never said it was for "getting men's dicks hard." I said, they use it for their benefit.
      </p>

       Are you talking about men not liking other men wearing makeup? Because, as I said, it is for accentuating
       <strong>

       sexual traits. It doesn't work for men, that's why there are Mustangs and Armani suits.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's other men calming that we objectify women, and that men that look at women are perverts? You sure about that?

       I'm talking about men believing that makeup is used only for accentuating female traits, as you just claimed.  If that were true, then why do male actors still wear makeup?  Why does special effects makeup exist?  Because it isn't true.  It's a way of looking different, of "making up" for imperfections in one's skin and bone structure, or even just to make you look downright weird or intimidating.  Some women put on makeup for the explicit purpose of not looking like women, or specifically to turn men away.  To say that makeup exists only to accentuate female features is to only observe a fraction of its usage.  Yes, most women use it that way, to accentuate their femininity.  The way that their moms probably taught them to do it.  But that is far from the only way it is used.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, I'm not talking about who says we objectify women or are a bunch of gross perverts.  The fact is, we DO objectify women and treat them as if their only function is to please us.  It is not men or women claiming that, but rational human beings whose genders are irrelevant to another logical human being.  But that isn't what I was talking about.  What I meant is that men could just as easily make themselves more attractive to women, or to express themselves visually using makeup instead of obscene muscle cars or $6,000 suits.  The latter are expressions of wealth and power, which are impressive but rather Neanderthal in their purpose.  The only thing that keeps men from doing things like wearing makeup (which, in this situation, is just an analog for any concept that men view as innately "female") is the fact that other men would ridicule them for it.  You might compare it to the concepts of intimacy.  Men are expected to share intimacy only with their significant other, and no one else.  Women, however, are allowed to share intimacy (hugging, cuddling, gracious compliments, even kissing) with any friend they see fit because women are seen only as the givers of affection, and men are expected only to receive (or in extreme situations, take).  And that causes men to be constantly starved for intimacy when they are without a significant other, it makes us desperate and rabid for affection because the only source of affection we allow ourselves is that of women.  Women who usually reject us because we come on so desperately and with such limited understanding of human emotion.  We bring that limited understanding on ourselves when we ridicule each other as "gay," or "girly," or "a pussy."  All of those are insults meant to degrade another man by comparing him to a woman.  Most insults men use against each other are based on comparing him to a woman.  And that speaks volumes about what we think of women.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you know, now that I think of it, I will go back and say that I agree with your initial statement:  Stop expecting things of women!  (Even if that wasn't the point of the original post.)

       We weren't talking about touch-up or effects makeup, that is completely different thing, as you know. Sure there are other ways to use make up, but that has nothing to do with our conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some men only see women as a source of pleasure, some women only see men as a source of labor. No "we" don't all do that; that's a generalization that some women use, even though those same women hate when men generalize about them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm talking about when women view men finding them attractive as creepy or sick, but of course that's only when they don't find those men attractive. It's a human instinct for women to feel uneasy about the attention of men they have no interest in, but they rationalize it as meaning there is something wrong with them other than they are simply unattractive. How dare an ugly man have sexual feelings right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, human instincts are primitive and often dumb, but we have to learn to work within them, instead of pretending they don't exist or are just socially instilled ideas like some people claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right, men don't show affection freely, in the case of women because of, being seen by them as creepy or harassing, and with men because of being seen as feminine or gay, which is often viewed negatively by both men and women. If you want to talk about men disliking feminine men, many girls and women hate them as well. Remember the trans boy who wanted to use the girls' bathroom?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to say stop expecting things of women, then what follows is to stop expecting things of men. The double standard you always see is If a man can't get a woman, he's a loser and needs to get it together, but if a woman can't find a guy to marry her then it's the men's fault and they need to man up and commit. Everything is a trade, and when someone expects to get want they want without giving someone else what they want, then it all breaks down.

       Not interested.  My face doesn't need makeup.  Also, that sounds rather like an insult.  And using the idea that a man might want to wear makeup as an insult is at the heart of men's misunderstanding of women.

       Make up is stupid anyways. It really doesn't make a woman more attractive. Physical fitness plays way more into attractiveness than red lips or large eyes. You can put all the lipstick you want on a pig and it's still a pig
