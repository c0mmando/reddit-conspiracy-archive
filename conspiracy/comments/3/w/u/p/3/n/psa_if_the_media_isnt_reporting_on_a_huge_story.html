       Not at all. Those stories take zero time to churn out, and senior reporters sure as shit aren't writing them. You don't move up in the industry writing about the Kardashians. You do it with good reporting and better stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never said "The news doesn't report things because of liability", I said that stories will not get published unless they can be confirmed as fact, eliminating any liability. That story was full of holes and irresponsible to publish.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the insurance story, I had the entire family on record. But those stories are tricky because you can only report one side. The insurance company would not respond, so the story that ended up being published was just about the family's predicament.

       How would trying to get CCTV and dashcam footage hurt their reputation? It would be a great segment or story. The fact that no one seems to have tried is what hurts their reputation IMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       The witness accounts are more shaky, but no one expects the news org to be responsible for them. All you have to do is interview a bunch of people and let what they say speak for itself.

       The number one complaint people have about the media... well, actually it's stuff like their breaking into the Farouk apartment. But the number
       <em>
        two
       </em>
       complaint they have is that the media tries to crowbar everything into a preset narrative.

       Really?  You are trying to tell us that you do not self-censor at all?  There are no carrot and stick mechanisms when it relates to the content of the stories you are pursuing?
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously think about this.  You are steeped in the news journalism environment, so it seems normal, but take a step back.  You are trying to tell us that if you pursued stories in areas such as below, unless you adhered to a very specific narrative, your career would continue on the same?
      </p>
      <p>
       -vaccine dangers
       <br/>
       -Jewish domination of banking, business and just about everything else
       <br/>
       -recent false flags perpetrated against the people of North America.  You said you worked at the Toronto Star.  Do you think you would be allowed to print a real news piece about what happened on Parliament Hill?
      </p>
      <p>
       As a member of the mainstream media you self-censor in order to survive.  So when you post bullshit like this, are you just lying to this subreddit, or do you really believe it and you lie to yourself?

          Nothing can now be believed which is seen in a newspaper.
         </strong>
         Truth itself becomes suspicious by being put into that polluted vehicle. The real extent of this state of misinformation is known only to those who are in situations to confront facts within their knolege with the lies of the day. I really look with commiseration over the great body of my fellow citizens, who, reading newspapers, live &amp; die in the belief, that they have known something of what has been passing in the world in their time; whereas the accounts they have read in newspapers are just as true a history of any other period of the world as of the present, except that the real names of the day are affixed to their fables. General facts may indeed be collected from them, such as that Europe is now at war, that Bonaparte has been a successful warrior, that he has subjected a great portion of Europe to his will; but no details can be relied on. I will add, that the man who never looks into a newspaper is better informed than he who reads them; inasmuch as he who knows nothing is nearer to truth than he whose mind is filled with falsehoods &amp; errors. He who reads nothing will still learn the great facts, and the details are all false." - Thomas Jefferson, in a letter to John Norvell, 14 June 1807

         ... There is not one of you who dares to write your honest opinions, and if you did, you know beforehand that it would never appear in print. I am paid weekly for keeping my honest opinion out of the paper I am connected with. Others of you are paid similar salaries for similar things, and any of you who would be so foolish as to write honest opinions would be out on the streets looking for another job. If I allowed my honest opinions to appear in one issue of my paper, before twenty-four hours my occupation would be gone. The business of the journalists is to destroy the truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the feet of mammon, and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread. You know it and I know it, and what folly is this toasting an independent press? We are the tools and vassals of rich men behind the scenes. We are the jumping jacks, they pull the strings and we dance. Our talents, our possibilities and our lives are all the property of other men. We are intellectual prostitutes." - John Swinton, journalist and writer for the New York times, in 1890 at his private retirement party after being asked to toast the 'independent press'

       It's understandable that a journalist would want to defend his career and think of himself as a "good person." Organized crime figures often talk about their "code of honor" and how they are "soldiers" as well.

       I see the problem as the "Journalist" has willingly become a Special Deputized Agent, Operative In Charge, Junior CIA. Since most agencies have a resident spook or co-opted editor/owner who matches his content up with "the list" everything is laundered. The only thing the poster says that's true is they are worried about liability : somebody's gonna yell at them, and since the oligarchs killed the unions, he might get fired or black balled.

       Journalists don't tend to make a lot of money, so they are easy to bribe. There's a famous quote by a CIA director saying that it's cheaper to hire a journalist than a DC call girl. They both do essentially the same job.
      </p>
      <p>
       Much of what journalists do is re-write press releases from companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The myth of the "righteous journalist" comes from Woodward and Bernstein, the writers that broke the Watergate scandal. Of course, their reputation is completely unearned; far from courageously exposing government corruption, they were simply tools by parts of the establishment to take down Nixon, their source was an FBI agent that hated Nixon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, Nixon was a crook but compared to politicians today he was a Boy Scout.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of journalism is just shilling for the powerful, they are establishment propagandists.

       I would say 10% of submitted posts in r/conspiracy are based on....honest intentions, which leaves a full 90% as propaganda. This post obviously is meant to wast peoples time. It falls in the 90%...
       <strong>
        absolutely

       . Interestingly, of the 10% of posts stemming from honest intentions, at least 80% of them are from wholehearted dumb people (people, who, through their day-to-day domestication have stunted all capacity for original thought and have had their critical thinking faculties neutered). This leaves a measly 2% of posts in r/conspiracy that are worth your time. The best way to operate is to spend as little time as possible in this subreddit. Get in, quickly scan the headlines, maybe click on a few linked articles, but just get out and research the topics elsewhere. 100%, this is what you have to do to protect your time and actually have your understanding of "things" progress in the right direction. r/conspiracy is a fucking
       <strong>
        minefield
       </strong>
       ! It's actually worse than MSM outlets in many ways. Good luck.

       Right. The US media virtually ignored the TPP for months, instead reporting on Bruce Jenner's "heroics" and Kim Kardashians ass.
