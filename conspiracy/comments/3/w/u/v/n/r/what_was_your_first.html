    <div class="md"><p>Actually, maybe someone can help. Years ago there was a video on youtube, of some US president a few decades ago giving a speech, which was cut short by a whisper in his ear from some head of a bank who was standing behind him. Sorry for the vagueness but does anyone know who it was? It was a really old video and was the first real proof I saw that politics/life/power weren&#39;t exactly as we&#39;re taught.</p>

<p>Around the same time, I was writing a paper on global financial aid, and was researching the IMF. All was well until I got into reading about their loan conditionalities. This organization was supposed to be helping the globe&#39;s poorest countries, but what I was reading wasn&#39;t adding up. That was a shock to me and that&#39;s about when I started to look at everything critically.</p>

<p>Zeitgeist 1 was an eye-opener for me as well, around the same time.</p>

<p>Yep.  Definitely.</p>

<p>They&#39;re <em>all</em> of these things though.  Existence in this cosmos spans all of these different types scenarios and then some.</p>

<p>TPTB on this planet have <em>zero</em> desire to let the plebs (us) know anything about any of this, however.  The moment we know about the reality of ET existence on and around this planet is the moment we find out about the free energy systems they use for power and propulsion - and the moment we find out about <em>those</em> technologies and begin making use of them ourselves is the very moment we will no longer have any use for the oil, gas, and fossil fuel burning paradigm that exists on this planet.  That is a multi <em>trillion</em> dollar industry that has the entire planet and civilization in a grip of slavery and has killed millions of people in oil-motivated wars of aggression.</p>

<p>All of that would be gone w/the discovery and implementation of the free energy technologies that ETs most <em>definitely</em> have.</p>

<p>ETs existing on and around this planet actually affirms and <em>proves</em> the existence of modern, working, free energy devices.  For how else do you think they got here? using crafts running on internal combustion engines and gasoline?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok wow, I was trying to be nice but alright here we are. If we&#39;re thinking critically, instead of presenting the mountains of evidence, paperwork, and witness testimony he&#39;s collected, Greer based his entire sirius documentary on how badass he is and how people pay him hundreds of dollars to go meditate in the desert and to photograph military flares and woodland moths. The testimony he&#39;s collected is great, but anything else out of his mouth is generally so exaggerated and unfalsifiable that it&#39;s basically just storytelling. Most reasonable people I&#39;ve talked to presume him to be a CIA disinformation agent, telling stories about psy powers and 2-mile wide saucers to discredit the witnesses he actually does rarely present.
As for free energy &quot;existing. period. full stop.&quot;? If this is so, why hasn&#39;t anyone collected the $100,000 award Greer offers? And here&#39;s the page where it says they&#39;ve collected $250k- <a href="http://www.siriusdisclosure.com/donate/">http://www.siriusdisclosure.com/donate/</a>
Just because ufo&#39;s don&#39;t work by gasoline, doesn&#39;t mean they break the laws of thermodynamics. The quantum foam and the casimir effect are incredibly weak forces by our energy standards. It&#39;s far more likely that any UFO craft uses miniature nuclear reactors, plasma storage, or some kind of fuel we don&#39;t have the technology for. The &quot;box sized free energy generator&quot; types of device Greer is fantasizing about are long running scams perpetrated by charlatans just as bad as him. Just because we don&#39;t understand the technology doesn&#39;t mean it comes from nowhere. It&#39;s a nice dream but the laws of physics do not work that way.</p>

<p>You’re trying <em>way</em> too hard, son.  <em>Way</em>.  Independent of anything that happened in the documentary or that Greer’s done, you’ve done exactly nothing to actually address the actual content of The Disclosure Project of the Citizens Hearing On Disclosure.  This is a classic (if not desperate) obfuscation fallacy on your part.  And I’m not sure you realize you’re even committing it.</p>

<p>And?  What does that have to do with anything?  I mean THROW AWAY anything <em>he himself</em> has said.  It’s called <em>critical thinking</em>, bro; separating the wheat from the chaff.  Throw away what doesn’t work, keep what does.  You would be well advised to do that with <em>everything</em> in life as it stands.  And if you do that with Steven Greer, what do you get?  You get what I already mentioned above, which is more than enough to make a very strong argument - even in a court of law - for the actual existence of ETs on and around this planet.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Because nobody wants to fucking die, son.  $100,000 ain’t gonna follow you to the grave when you end up like <a href="http://jimstonefreelance.com/lielielie.jpg">Michael Hastings</a>.</p>

<p>Again, you’re trying too hard, and your trying so hard is keeping you from realizing that you don’t really have much of an argument here.  All you&#39;re doing is committing a very convoluted Argument Against The Person fallacy.</p>

<p>These “laws” are “laws” that have been devised by human limitation and ignorance.  To think that we’ve figured out the &quot;law&quot; of almost <em>anything</em> in a universe this vast - to think that there aren’t beings and intelligences that have enough understanding to make our measly understanding obsolete - is truly hubristic.</p>

<p>But Greer is a master at protecting anonymity? Right? Right?
Also, the laws of thermodynamics are one of mankind&#39;s greatest achievements in describing the physical universe. The sum of the entropies of two interacting systems will always increase. I&#39;d explain what this means and the difference between &quot;free energy&quot; and devices using small input for total energy gain, but I have a feeling you&#39;ll &quot;critical think&quot; your way out of learning a damn thing.</p>

<p>Once again, I already said: </p>

<p>witness testimony good.
Greer stories bad.</p>

<p>And what you&#39;re trying to say is Ad Hominem. Either that or you did a quick google of logical fallacies and pasted &quot;Attack Against The Person&quot; because it sounded good.
Basically, you&#39;re trying really hard to convince yourself that I&#39;m trying really hard.</p>

<p>Then why the hell did you even bring up Greer in the first place?  It’s like you brought up a completely unnecessary factor into this conversation…and for what?  Just so you can hear yourself argue unnecessarily?  Wat?  Wow, man…</p>

<p>Look…I didn’t even bother reading anything else you posted in this response after the above comment you made.  Just…not worth it.  The points I made still very much stand.

<p>This issue is bigger than Greer, bigger then me, bigger than you, bigger than any one person.  If you want to keep trying to bring the entire thing down by childishly attacking Greer himself…then okay.</p>

However, you have to ask yourself what the likelihood is that every sighting and every contact experience that has ever taken place and that has been recounted by so many different types of individuals from all different walks of life throughout all of history…are all the doing of “the government”.  Sightings and contact experience have existed long before this or almost any other government has even existed - so how could <em>this</em> government have been responsible for all the sightings and contact experiences recorded from ancient times?  Heck, they’re not even responsible for all the ones that have occurred in <em>today’s</em> day and age - to say nothing about what happened 100+ years ago and longer.</p>

<p>Additionally, what you&#39;re postulating is stretching the importance and power of the government <em>way</em> further than it should be.  Regarding “fake” craft sightings or &quot;fake&quot; abduction scenarios? It wouldn’t be the government anyway that would be the entity involved with whatever globally powerful and covert machination necessary to do that in the first place.</p>

<p>SOME sightings are definitely covert MIC ops.  Yes.  However, most definitely not all.  By a <em>long</em> shot.</p>

<p>Everything I said above still <em>very</em> much stands.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.  Because - as I&#39;ve literally <em>already</em> stated - I&#39;ve A) already have personal experiences (so I don&#39;t need you or anybody to &quot;believe&quot; me or anything I said one way or the other.  I already have a good idea that things are very much <em>not</em> as we&#39;re indoctrinated and brought up to believe they are), and B) independent of any personal experience that I&#39;ve ever had, there are people like Captain Randy Cramer, Andrew Basiago, Brett Stillings, Laura Eisenhower (great granddaughter of Dwight D. Eisenhower), Dr. John Mack, etc, etc who have been involved in projects and who&#39;s information is a LOT more sound and filled with documentation than anything you could come up with and provide.</p>

<p>You come here and are either a shill that is paid to attempt to discredit information or are simply <em>that</em> ignorant and stupid that you unthinkingly discard information based upon what you <em>don&#39;t</em> know without even bothering to first do some work and due diligence prior to opening your mouth.  I would actually <em>hope</em> you&#39;re simply a shill paid to unthinkingly, uncritically poop on information, because if you&#39;re not, then that means that your&#39;e literally just saying &quot;Nope.  Not real.  Can&#39;t happen.&quot; based on...<em>nothing</em> really.  Based solely on your own personal level of not knowing; on your own personal level of ignorance coming from what you&#39;ve been told in your life is and isn&#39;t the case by the MSM.</p>

<p>Come on, man.  You HAVE to raise your level of critical thinking in life.  You will get absolutely <em>nowhere</em> otherwise.</p>

<p><em>Think</em>, man.  It ain&#39;t illegal yet.</p>

<p>I would say more than skeptical, what one should do is be <em>critical</em>.  Don&#39;t be skeptical.  Be <em>critical</em>.  To be skeptical is to automatically bend toward a &quot;Na.  Didn&#39;t happen/couldn&#39;t have happened.&quot; perspective - which automatically makes one biased in one direction or the other.  You absolutely do <em>not</em> want to be biased one way or the other for or against a thing.  You want to simply approach the subject matter with a critical thinking mind and intelligently assess the situation as objectively as you can regardless of where the evidence leads.</p>

<p>Additionally, I wouldn&#39;t say that we would acknowledge the existence of something &quot;we fundamentally DON&#39;T understand&quot;.  I feel <em>many</em> of us VERY MUCH understand exactly what&#39;s happening.  &quot;ET&quot; doesn&#39;t <em>necessarily</em> mean &quot;so anomalous that we can&#39;t possibly comprehend it&quot;.  A lot of ET phenomena is <em>very</em> understandable.  Most certainly not <em>all</em> of it, of course, but let&#39;s not sell ourselves <em>too</em> short here.  Some of it we <em>do</em> understand.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Less than .1% of all sightings and encounters need to be true for it to be a very world shaking concept.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely correct - and a <em>lot</em> more than 1% of all reports are true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Zeitgeist is what started it for me. I never really subscribed to their whole &quot;technocracy/resource based economy&quot; ideal for society, but all three of the Zeitgeist documentaries are very wonderfully made and definiteley got me asking some of the right questions.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t to long after that I discovered Stefan Molyneux, and watched &quot;The Story of your Enslavement&quot;. Which to this day I still consider one of the most life changing experiences I have ever had. I started devouring all of his videos and was introduced to the concepts of Anarchy, Voluntaryism, and the Non Aggression Principle. </p>

<p>Being an Anarchist feels so natural and correct to me now, it is the lense I view the world through, its principles help me discern the true nature of reality, and while I&#39;m still open to new and potentially better ideas, I don&#39;t really watch to many videos anymore. I mostly just read and try to be as active and healthy as possible</p>

The video you linked is an allegory using farm animals to describe the evil of corrupt government and banking. Totally original and not required reading for 14 year olds or anything.
I&#39;ve seen him berating callers, berating his audience for not giving him money for posting his free internet videos, berating more callers, reversing questions, avoiding questions, generally being a nasty person. Please be careful with how you let this man influence you.</p>

Also when I saw the movie Arlington Road for the first time they talked about how Timothy McVegh was the lone wolf in Oklahoma City bombings.

I was still in high school during 9/11 and the whole thing seemed a lot like the first episode of the x-files spin off the lone gunmen. I&#39;ve never trusted the government or the media.</p>
