<h2></h2>

<p>Common sense would stop someone from answering the question &quot;Do you have a message for China&quot; with &quot;Listen you motherfuckers, we&#39;re going to tax you 25 percent!&quot;  Thats an actual quote.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>Common sense would stop someone from admitting in public that they have some shitty business ethics. &quot;I dealt with Gaddafi. I rented him a piece of land. He paid me more for one night than the land was worth for two years, and then I didn&#39;t let him use the land. That&#39;s what we should be doing. I don&#39;t want to use the word &quot;screwed,&quot; but I screwed him. That&#39;s what we should be doing.&quot; Again, another quote.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>Common sense would stop someone from suing a comedian for $5 million dollars over a monkey joke.   That happened.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>Common sense would stop someone who is running for president from taking to Twitter for insults, name calling, commenting on a former first lady&#39;s sex life, and - for some unfathomable reason - doling out dating advice to the sparkly dude from Twilight and .  I couldnt make this shit up if I tried.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>Common sense would stop someone from blaming the military co-ed policy for the 20K+ reports of sexual assaults instead of THE MEN WHO DID THE RAPING. </p>

<h2></h2>

<p>Common sense would stop someone from screaming &quot;You&#39;re disgusting!&quot; at a female lawyer during a deposition just because <strong>she simply requested a short break at some point to pump breast milk.</strong></p>

<h2></h2>

<p>Common sense stops someone from telling people he finds his daughter sexually attractive. </p>

<h2></h2>

<p>I could go on all day but it should already be apparent that he kissed common sense goodbye a long time ago and the faster you snap out of these delusions of yours, the better off we&#39;ll all be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t you think he&#39;s a better option than Shillary though? I mean he might not be to your taste, but he&#39;s self funding, and he will protect the border at the very least. You know he&#39;s on to something when literally the entire force of the mainstream media and politicans are trying to ruin him. He&#39;s not playing by the rules, and I&#39;m enjoying it quite a bit. Yes I find him crass and in an ideal world he would not be my man, but in America, with the amount of money you need to be able to run, the chances of getting another person who is able to self fund and bypass the gatekeepers are very very low. He&#39;s also second amendment and personally carries, and with Obama ramping up all the gun grabbing rhetoric, he would by far be the best choice when it comes to this issue as well. Sometimes it&#39;s surprising to me how blue pilled <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is on certain issues, still very PC. </p>

<p>Not allowing them to enter the u.s isn&#39;t even in the same category as your hyperbolic bullshit comment.</p>

<p>No one has a right to emigrate to the u.s. it is a privilege, and as such it is subject to any stipulations or conditions that we see fit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. It&#39;s almost like people have forgotten that money buys elections. Jeb has not yet begun to fight.</p>

<p>Let Trump sail along because why waste money on someone who is surging on a caffeine fueled reality TV wave? Jeb will lie low for a while and then, maybe early in the new year, start hammering Trump mercilessly with TV ads, social media, ground game, faux polls, etc etc etc.</p>

<p>Trump has a lot of money but I seriously doubt he&#39;s going to go toe-to-toe with Jeb&#39;s 200 million. Jeb is cutting it close but he&#39;s got a lot of game yet to be released and I think holding it back is a strategic decision.</p>

<p>However, if Trump does win this thing I am going to have to adjust my reality goggles because that means shit has fundamentally changed somehow.</p>

<p>When he decided to run, she took more validity in some of the shit I tell her about the left/right paradigm.  But now, she&#39;s like, look like nothing is happening with Bush.  I was like, election is 11 months away...just watch.  </p>

<p>And that&#39;s just the republican spin.</p>

<p>The major hurdle for Sanders v Clinton in the primary is media representation.  This from Sander&#39;s website :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ABC’s “World News Tonight” has devoted 81 minutes to Donald Trump&#39;s campaign so far this year compared to a mere 20 seconds on Bernie Sanders through the end of November, according to a new report. NBC’s “Nightly News” afforded 2.9 minutes of coverage to Bernie since January. The “CBS Evening News” provided viewers 6.4 minutes of coverage.</p>

If it&#39;s really just an ego thing, the best thing for him to do would be to drop out while he&#39;s on top for a reason unrelated to politics. Maybe he says he has a family member with a medical condition that he needs to spend time with. </p>

<p>Then he endorses whoever he thinks has a good chance of winning the primary (Cruz could actually win it with Trump&#39;s endorsement), and gets to brag that he&#39;s a kingmaker. If that person loses the general, he can say it&#39;s not on him. He get&#39;s to leave the campaign a winner in his own eyes, and in the eyes of much of the public.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump running independent will be the nail in the coffin. Ross Perot, another populist, had issues with republicans during the 90s. I haven&#39;t done much digging, but he&#39;s thought to be one of the biggest reasons that Bill Clinton won the presidency versus Bush in &#39;92. He then did it again in &#39;96.</p>

<p>It seemed to be a winning formula for Bill, so why not try the same for Hillary? Even if Perot wasn&#39;t tied to the Clinton&#39;s, the formula for victory was there: Have a strong populist fracture a party and then run independent or 3rd party.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember Ross Perot very well. I voted for him and/or he stole Bush&#39;s vote from me.  Which, as you said, did account for Clinton winning.  That is one of the many reason&#39;s I think Trump is fake.  This election cycle seems <em>way</em> to similar to that on many levels.  Regardless, if either of them win, it will be a miserable 4 years to say the least.  Ironically, I prefer Trump over Hilary <em>if</em> I had to chose.  We do not need another Clinton, or Bush for that matter, in the White House at all.  The Clinton&#39;s are corrupt, and Hilary is probably the worst one because she hides it so well (for the most part).  Paul would be my overall first choice but it looks like he may drop out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A couple of thoughts. One is that Trump is running for his own benefit... because that&#39;s his style.</p>

<p>So how does he benefit? There&#39;s a million ways he can win even if he doesn&#39;t win. One, he gets massive publicity from being a high profile presidential candidate. Another is that he might be taking a dive in exchange for some reward he&#39;ll receive somewhere down the line. He&#39;s also a total attention whore. So being in the spotlight 24/7 having crowds of fans cheering for him... he must be having the time of his life right now.</p>

<p>Or maybe he&#39;s the American version of an oligarch. Using his fame and fortune to attain the highest office in the land. Once there, he&#39;ll makes sure he cashes in big time.</p>

<p>The scariest possibility is that Trump is for real. Maybe he&#39;s got some secret backers. You know, the kind that profit from war. They need a real psychopath in the White House... a psychopath that has the ability to convince enough people that a huge war is the right way to go.</p>

<p>This has happened before in other countries and there&#39;s no reason it couldn&#39;t happen again. So if Trump does end up &quot;taking a dive&quot;, that&#39;s just fine by me.</p>

<p>WTF is this?</p>

<p>The kind of people who profit from war have been doing it long before Trump was even a factor. They bought out the two sides responsible for the last 15 years of war, ages ago. They don&#39;t need Trump for a damn thing. If he&#39;s for real (probably is if he&#39;s spending his own money), he&#39;s probably a thorn in their side more than another marionette on display. Unless he can be bought, which, almost all men can, so...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember that Trump has one thing a lot of recent leaders haven&#39;t had. He&#39;s got this personal charisma. There have been a lot of leaders like him before who have had the same thing. They gain power and then use this charisma to create a cult of personality.</p>

<p>When this happens, nobody questions their policies. If &quot;the charismatic leader&quot; says we need to do whatever, let&#39;s do whatever he says. Hitler is a prime example of a leader with this quality.</p>

<p>Remember a couple of years ago when Obama tried to sell the idea of US involvement in Syria... and nobody went for it? They had to wait a year until they could use ISIS as an excuse.</p>

<p>If Trump would have been President at that time, people might have gone for it.</p>

<p>edit: Also, I&#39;m talking about something way bigger than what we&#39;ve seen in the last 15 years. Something like a war with the Chinese or maybe even the Russians.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, he doesn&#39;t seem that way, and yet....he was tying the Saudis to 9/11, etc., on that notorious MSNBC interview, and nobody in the corporate media has touched that, instead they beat the Hitler-for-Muslims-meme all day long. </p>

<p>Trump strikes me as dangerous to A LOT of people, and his ascent and the obvious secret powers aligned against him definitely supports the theory that there are multiple secret societies and conspiracies running simultaneously, and many of them are in conflict. Sometimes all or multiple interests converge, like with 9/11 or JFK or maybe even surveillance, but right now it&#39;s a fucking free-for-all.</p>
