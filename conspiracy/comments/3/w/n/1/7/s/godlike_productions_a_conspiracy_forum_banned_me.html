    <div class="md"><p>You haven&#39;t been &quot;banned&quot; per se. From time to time GLP restricts regular-but-non-paying users  from accessing the site (based on your registration details and/or IP address, if you haven&#39;t signed up) in the hope that some of them will pay for a subscription. Even though it&#39;s irritating, you can&#39;t blame the owners from trying to increase their revenue - they&#39;re not running a public service.</p>

<p>I browse GLP regularly because occasionally something interesting is posted. They must have had a management meeting to ramp up revenues last week because I can no longer access the site from my IP address. This isn&#39;t the first time this has happened, and within a week or two I&#39;ll be able to access the site again. In the meantime, I will just use a proxy IP address if I want to browse the site.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They had no good reason at all to ban me and to deny my appeal as well. So if the mods of the r/conspiracy banned you for no reason right now do you think it&#39;s reasonable because it&#39;s &quot;their subreddit their rules&quot; and then ask for your money to get unbanned?

If this was a good idea how come Microsoft isn&#39;t shuting down your older copy of windows and forcing you to buy windows 10 to make your computer work?

    <div class="md"><p>Haha. People still use that shithouse. GLP is a Tavistock test tube. Type the word Tavistock while there and see how quickly you get banned. Jason Lucas (AKA Trinity or Ghetto Monk) owns a company called Zero Point ltd which designed a nice little object called the &quot;Lop virus&quot;. Just by going to his site you are installing all kinds of goodies on your computer. Have fun with the zioshills while there as well lol. </p>
