       You haven't been "banned" per se. From time to time GLP restricts regular-but-non-paying users  from accessing the site (based on your registration details and/or IP address, if you haven't signed up) in the hope that some of them will pay for a subscription. Even though it's irritating, you can't blame the owners from trying to increase their revenue - they're not running a public service.
      </p>
      <p>
       I browse GLP regularly because occasionally something interesting is posted. They must have had a management meeting to ramp up revenues last week because I can no longer access the site from my IP address. This isn't the first time this has happened, and within a week or two I'll be able to access the site again. In the meantime, I will just use a proxy IP address if I want to browse the site.

       They had no good reason at all to ban me and to deny my appeal as well. So if the mods of the r/conspiracy banned you for no reason right now do you think it's reasonable because it's "their subreddit their rules" and then ask for your money to get unbanned? Because I know for damn sure you wouldn't be happy if they banned you just so they can rip you off

       Website have the right to do what they want but there's a limit and one of them isn't to start banning everyone's IP and avoiding the question why they got banned but then starts to go on about their paid membership. If this was a good idea how come Microsoft isn't shuting down your older copy of windows and forcing you to buy windows 10 to make your computer work? It's a shitty idea and most people don't agree with it. If you own a website that has those type of rules then no wonder

       have you tried AOTS or Prison Planet?  Just as nasty, just as full of 'tards and xtards as GLP

       how about /pol/?  Too racist for you?

       I never said it was a good idea. But it's their idea. And having a shitty idea and executing it is their right. They can ban anyone they want for any reason they want. And so can you on any website you make.

       Yeah and most people don't like the idea. Now I know why people complain about it from AboveTopSecret. If I ever made a website I would at least be rational about it and don't start begging for money like most functioning forums and subreddits unlike that shitty forum

       Haha. People still use that shithouse. GLP is a Tavistock test tube. Type the word Tavistock while there and see how quickly you get banned. Jason Lucas (AKA Trinity or Ghetto Monk) owns a company called Zero Point ltd which designed a nice little object called the "Lop virus". Just by going to his site you are installing all kinds of goodies on your computer. Have fun with the zioshills while there as well lol.

       They do that all the time.  I go there to read the headlines, which are mostly copy/pasted from other conspiracy sites.  Some of them are interesting, most are just entertaining.  My ip has been banned there many times.  Now I import the headlines into a news aggregator called "Inoreader", and if there's a story that seems interesting, I'll google it to get it from the source.

       I'm not interested in the comments anyway.  The discussion there is always really lame.

       lol no it's just one of the worst ways to run your site especially them threatening to shut down my ISP pfft. I guess your one of the fools that paid for the membership because you look a little offended when I called GLP forum shit.

       You're acting like a child throwing a hissy fit because you didn't like the rules of a private website. How did you come to the conclusion that I have ever been to godlike productions? Because if i don't agree with you, i must be a member? Grow up

Go there and start a new thread called "Tavistock and the LOP virus". It'll be hugely popular.
