        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Lately the massive &quot;counter-conspiracy&quot; crowd has materialized and, if you glance at most of their histories, they appear to be fairly typical cookie-cutter types, most containing such similarities it smacks of the same people. They try to distract from our points. They try to incite anger or emotion out of us to change the direction of the discussion. They do everything they can to make us forget we&#39;re right.</p>

<p>They all try to laugh, try to point and ridicule and try to downvote us out of questioning what the fuck is happening in the world. This tells me they are scared and they are doing everything they can to make us stop what we are doing. I say this is evidence to keep doing what we are doing. To keep asking unpopular questions. To keep pointing out obvious flaws in the media. To question the events we are told are true. That isn&#39;t insane. That&#39;s intellect and intelligence is the thing that scares them more than anything.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get emotional, don&#39;t feed into their trolling. Just keep doing what you&#39;re doing because it&#39;s working so well people who claim we are crazy or stupid are dedicating their spare time to discrediting us and arguing with us.</p>

<p>Just a thought.</p>

<p>Edit: I come to this sub everyday and read opinions and theories that I both agree and disagree with. I am on the radical liberal side of things, but I do respect the libertarian viewpoint that is more commonplace here. Keeping that in mind, just because you disagree with me doesn&#39;t mean that I am a shill or part of some &quot;counter-conspiracy&quot; and quite frankly, those labels tend to close what would have otherwise been an open-minded, respectful dialogue.</p>

<p>In more plausible conspiracies like 9/11 and jfk, the thing that makes us better / more truthful than the anticonspiracy people is that we actually have evidence.

<p>I always try to keep an open mind while trying to keep myself grounded firmly in the reality of my own experience. </p>

<p>When I listen to his stories I quickly find myself clinging firmly to the reality I am familiar with. It almost seems that I might loose my sanity if I entertain any of his stories with anything other than total disbelief.</p>

<p>His highly detailed descriptions of situations and events seem to potentially have the power to poison a sane mind.</p>

<p>He obviously has a significant number of people who believe what he says. I guess It&#39;s kinda like a cult.</p>

<p>His charisma is right up there with L Ron Hubbard and Jim Jones. It&#39;s a tragedy that people like this are able to bamboozle people into believing their BS. </p>

Who is that other guy? Greer? Bald with glasses, holds retreats where he takes people for walks and talks about how aliens are following them, and if someone on the tour acts with disbelief he tells them the aliens are offended and wont visit because of that individual. He was leading the disclosure project. I mean, if there is actual evidence of alien visitation, and the politicians, and military vets that came forward to request the governments of the world disclose this information are legitimate in their beliefs, then following someone like Greer (whatever his name is) does nothing but discredit the entire effort.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.  With a healthy dose of racism and anti-semetism thrown in.  I&#39;ve been here a couple years and seen this slide a lot this year.  I&#39;ve been accused of being a shill many times for pointing out faulty logic and racism which is discrediting the community.  Often with people saying they &quot;don&#39;t care how anyone sees the community&quot;.  And also declaring I don&#39;t belong to the community because I don&#39;t think doctors and first responders would cover up fake dead bodies.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty childish behavior.  If anyone is bringing down the sub it&#39;s these people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is correct. Me, I&#39;m one of those. Just because someone can see that there is a &quot;monolithic and ruthless conspiracy&quot;, global in nature, and has existed for a much longer time than I&#39;d like to guess, doesn&#39;t mean I think ANYTHING about Jewish people at all, or their involvement in these things, etc.. That is very narrow and probably plays right into the hands of the perpetrators of these things...a racial scapegoat is sure to leave the true culprits feeling relieved. </p>

<p>It frustrates me when people assume that I can&#39;t believe A. without also believing B.</p>

<p>It feels like a weird form of discrimination that has no name, a judgement from which I cannot really ask for relief.. So I just keep my thoughts to myself now. (Other than here from time to time.)</p>

<p>Then you have certain posters who ONLY talk about &quot;the jew&quot;.  One of them finally got busted in an FBI sting, but there are a handful of others that are clearly managing characters.</p>

<p>But I&#39;ll tell you what- claiming that there is a global conspiracy by the church or a global conspiracy by islam or a jewish conspiracy or a masonic conspiracy is no different.  Of course groups conspire.  Of course there is an ideology.  Where they overlap these groups have worked together.  Some groups are used by other groups to push their own agendas.</p>

<p><strong>The Double Identity of an &quot;Anti-Semitic&quot; Commenter</strong></p>

<p><strong>Smearing a Progressive Website to Support Israel</strong></p>

<p><strong>Like many other news websites, Common Dreams has been plagued by inflammatory anti-Semitic comments following its stories. But on Common Dreams these posts have been so frequent and intense they have driven away donors from a nonprofit dependent on reader generosity.</strong></p>

<p><strong>A Common Dreams investigation has discovered that more than a thousand of these damaging comments over the past two years were written with a deceptive purpose by a Jewish Harvard graduate in his thirties who was irritated by the website&#39;s discussion of issues involving Israel.</strong></p>

<p><strong>His intricate campaign, which he has admitted to Common Dreams, included posting comments by a screen name, &quot;JewishProgressive,&quot; whose purpose was to draw attention to and denounce the anti-Semitic comments that he had written under many other screen names.</strong></p>

<p>Yes. I posted it really so people can see just how devious and deceitful these people can be. They&#39;re politico-religious extremists who literally will stop at nothing to get their own way.

    <div class="md"><p>I think the conspiracy theorists need to spend less time speculating and more time bringing their theories back to earth.</p>

<p>Are the interests of Jews disproportionately represented in the elites&#39; agenda? I&#39;d certainly humor the possibility: after all, progressives tell us that the agenda of all the white races are disproportionately represented by the elites. Trivially then, the Jews must be disproportionately represented as well, and by appropriating the same logic, we could even humor the idea that their interests are even represented disproportionately to other white people.</p>

<p>But perhaps we should also consider that the people who claim the Jews control everything to the complete exclusion of all other cultures are sent here to paint us as anti-semites. Or perhaps they are just delusional Nazis.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just asking questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A shill isn&#39;t someone who disagrees with you, it&#39;s someone who is trying to hijack the entire narrative and turn it into something that it isn&#39;t. The purpose is just to discredit; to make anyone listening look at us and say &#39;these guys are just a bunch of anti-semitic, holocaust denying nutjobs who believe in shapeshifting reptilian aliens taking over the planet through political espionage&#39;.
I know some people here may believe David Iche, and some may deny the holocaust, and some may be rampant antisemites, but the majority of us are not (I haven&#39;t seen anything about reptilian shapeshifters or holocaust denial on the front page of this sub in a long time, and I think most of us like it that way)
However, we here at r/conspiracy sometimes forget that conspiracy theorists come from all ends of the political spectrum, which obviously means we won&#39;t agree on everything. Arguing is fine, this is a place to argue, a place to claim things and offer proof and citation. However if you think anyone who disagrees with you or who views conspiracy from the opposite side of politics that you do is a Shill, you won&#39;t get very many people to listen to you and the real shills will win.</p>

<p>You need to be cognizant of the language you use.  You are trying to paint with as broad of a brush as the people who you are attempting to ridicule.  </p>

<p>To try and say  &quot;every terrorist attack is a false flag perpetrated by the Jews.&quot; would imply that any explanation involving Israel should just be discounted because it is just another &quot;&#39;crazy conspiracy theorist&#39; saying it&#39;s &#39;da jews&#39; again!&quot;</p>

<p>In fact, Israel has been involved in covert operations of the morally despicable kind for a very long time.  To write off any idea because it involves Israel is just as stupid and shallow as ascribing every incident to Israel.</p>

<p>It&#39;s funny that people will readily become part of a conspiracy to hide a friend&#39;s infidelity in a relationship -- or a conspiracy to keep employees in the dark about another company buying their company.</p>

<p>So <em>they know</em> conspiracies are the norm rather than the exception -- because they themselves have known of, and participated in many with relatively low stakes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>100 percent agree. If this sub had the same skepticism for conspiracy-favored content as they do for the mainstream media, this place would be a bit more respectable. Can&#39;t believe I still see posts about secret energy sources (with absolutely zero scientific basis) or that someone wearing a Freemason hat is part of a shadow group. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is quick to accept science when it works for their narrative (like the free fall speed of the towers)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mocked the idea of organizations being secret and influential. Our military and intelligence departments are the most powerful organizations in the world, and they operate in complete secrecy. So, what is being suggested with the advice of being more skeptical? Without any evidence the organization is controlled, I&#39;m suppose to be skeptical that they would do anything bad? Why? Because it&#39;s not fair to have suspicion?</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for skepticism, but it&#39;s stupid to completely dismiss theories because there&#39;s no evidence to prove or dismiss an idea. That&#39;s why most discussions are about possibilities, -- not certainties.</p>

<p>The fact that people are taking it as an attack on the sub, which its not, and  thinking its a personal attack should tell you who&#39;s the real ideologue. As I said in the beginning: all this criticism isn&#39;t unique to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, its happens everywhere.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, of course...The techniques of government to assert equivalence in conspiracy discussions have always worked thus. In fact, government operatives make &#39;cointelpro&#39; truther documentaries to play into that. After the Civil War, those who thought Booth wasn&#39;t the guy murdered in Garrett&#39;s barn became strangely equivalent with the nutjob denying that Booth killed Lincoln and hopped onto the stage; the evil government, always flush with other people&#39;s money, paid the reward. The government uses <em>The Dark Side of Camelot</em> to defend its coup but the same journalist has a real ordeal to catch a break with publishers &#39;truthing&#39; about Osama Bin Laden. My point, in case you missed it, is that Americans (in what I call the Lyndonian mainstream) are mean-spirited and unforgiving hardasses EXCEPT for government/media spokespeople, who they view with a friends &amp; family outlook that is quite extremely unwarranted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. No doubt about shills anywhere in general, but we shouldn&#39;t silence views or opinions because it ultimately disagrees  with the rhetoric presented. We have to listen to everyone&#39;s view, provided it be sound enough.</p>

<p>There are many questionable links to websites and forums on this sub that outside it would be filtered or blocked so I think there is a possibility to abuse that. </p>

<p>All in all, I think recent current events have brought many people from across the world here and we should enjoy it, never before in history has such a public forum of information and truth been freely available and  so mainstream, you have to consider that just because someone didn&#39;t vote or comment doesn&#39;t mean they didn&#39;t look and see the evidence presented and gone on to make up their own mind, which in the long run should be our goal. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think people would hold our words and opinions to any value if we just silence those who might say different, that isn&#39;t how you create and present a sound argument.</p>

<p>Bush and members of the UAE did 9/11. Rothschild, Murdoch and Cheney and a minority of extremist Jews or members of a terrorist group known as <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genie_Energy">Genie Energy</a> are paying for Syria while they &quot;drill for oil&quot; in Golan Heights, look where it is on a map. The worlds superpowers are being paid to sideshow. Isis is because of everything there since the who knows how far back, Cheney also paid mercenaries to destabilise the region a couple years ago, then they moved on to create isis, they garnered support because the people are tired, religion is strong ask the before mentioned. I don&#39;t think aliens have visited us on purpose. Yet.</p>

<p>Actually, the entire cosmos is flat. </p>

<p><strong>The simplest version of the inflationary theory, an extension of the Big Bang theory, predicts that the density of the universe is very close to the critical density, and that the geometry of the universe is flat, like a sheet of paper.</strong></p>

<p><strong>WMAP has confirmed this result with very high accuracy and precision. We now know (as of 2013) that the universe is flat with only a 0.4% margin of error.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_shape.html">http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_shape.html</a></p>

<p>You see, the universe rests at its own critical density level. That is, the expansion of space-time is matched equally by the effect of all the accumulated gravity within it.</p>

<p>But I digress. What I meant to say is nobody here is a flat-Earther (at least that I have ever spoken to), so your use of complete bullshit as a form of attack tells me you are almost certainly on the right wing, yes?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is such an intelligent response. But you are comically missing the point by saying &quot;fake conspiracies&quot;. People are trying to disprove theories (fake conspiracies) by having discussions about them here.</p>

<p>The issue is the bias that comes from people refusing to even entertain the possibility of certain topics (Sandy Hook for one). Their internal censor cuts on and they willingly or unwillingly participate in the ridiculing of theories instead of the actual disproving of them with the people that actively want the topic to die without actually having been disproved.</p>

<p>Ridiculed to the point of seeming absurd anything can seem &quot;false&quot; but when given a critical eye and actively attacked in an intelligent way to disprove it; gives it that strength you mention when it can stand up to those kinds of attacks.</p>

<p>In essence, ridicule is an underhanded means of making a conspiracy topic seem &quot;fake&quot; when it is actually right on the money.</p>

<p>The truth always rises, and a lot of people are not into metaphysics or the like, but the one thing I have known for a long time is that when you are dealing with fringe topics there are <em>no</em> coincidences.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t &quot;want&quot; to prove one side or the other. I care whether my beliefs are true or false, and I want to have as many true beliefs as possible, and almost more importantly, as few false beliefs as possible. </p>

<p>There are ways to find proof and there are different forms of proofs too. It would spiral downwards into craziness, as it already has in the mainstream media, whereby news are cherry picked and serve as advertisements. It spiraled down to craziness with the Iraq war. So the people that circulated information and details displaying that the position by NATO was false, contrived and cruel were onto something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been an active user of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> almost daily for six years and to see the direction it&#39;s taken lately is a huge bummer.  It&#39;s like we built a beautiful city but failed to guard our borders or hire any police, and hooligans from outside have come in and trashed the place.  And there is nothing we can do but just stand by and watch.  Their attacks are organized and our defense is not.  We are not even allowed to point out undeniable shillery.</p>

<p>This was especially obvious to me last night when scrolling through the comments on this top-of-the-page post:  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3w835o/book_exposing_sandy_hook_hoax_sold_too_well/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3w835o/book_exposing_sandy_hook_hoax_sold_too_well/</a></p>

<p>Despite 1183 upvotes, the comments are a coordinated attack on the book, the idea that Sandy Hook was faked, this sub, and conspiracy theorists in general.  I didn&#39;t recognize most of the users posting.  Many follow a predictable pattern such as used in volleyball:  one player sets up another.  One user asks a seemingly innocent question that is a set up for the next user to attack, attack, attack.  </p>

<p>We know that the US Air Force has software that allows one person to control 20 different social media accounts without detection.  With just three people working together (total of 60 accounts) they can subvert and destroy any meaningful discussion going on here.</p>

<p>This comment may also be down voted to hell.  If so this may be the end of me commenting here.  The hooligans were allowed in to destroy what we built, and they have.</p>

<p>What we need now is a way to sort comments by &quot;most downvoted.&quot;  That&#39;s where all the best comments are now.</p>

<p>To some extent I agree this is true, but brigading has evolved since 2007. I remember having to argue with 30-40 accounts at once, but there was no voting and/or report system for them to abuse and so you were still able to win the debate, or at the least get your point across to the world.</p>

<p>I went &#39;balls deep&#39; into reddit and swore off all other social networking other than Live Journal. I spend way too much time on it. There are good things and there was this one thing. That one thing that made me go, &quot;Huh! Old timers must be right because this is shit.&quot;</p>

<p>I got banned from a subreddit because once in the past I posted on another sub, and the moderator banned me unless I promised to &#39;swear off that hate site.&#39; I think it was SRS or something and the mod from offmychest.</p>

<p>I basically told her that it was cool, and I&#39;ll just unsub from her little fiefdom.&quot; But it was the guilt by the loosest of associations that started eating at me.</p>

<p>Fuck it all; I&#39;ve been on social networks since 1994. This sub is one of the more &#39;fun&#39; to view. This sub makes me look smarter and more informed when posting comments on blogs. I really should find some other outlet for my time than Reddit.</p>

<p>And with management trying to &#39;clean up&#39; something that is messy by design, the impetus to leave is pressing.</p>

<p>Yes, but those things are NOT what conspiracy theorists are doing.  It is not an honest pursuit of truth or honest questioning.  It is motivated, religious, and deceptive.  It is starting with the conclusion you want (usually, govt is evil or Jews are evil or corps are evil) and then bending everything to try to fit that.  Often the conclusion is stated minutes after the event; no wait for facts or investigation.  Deny facts, invent facts, ask slanted &quot;questions&quot; that can&#39;t be answered.  In the case of 9/11, keep holding to your conclusion for 14+ years without coming up with a single simple solid clear piece of evidence to support your conclusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I dont think so. These conclusions are directly related to what is happening. If you dont see whats happening in government and with corporations like Monsanto trying to destroy our food and the planet you are blinding yourself to it. The effects of corruption are having effect on every signal life form on this planet. And you want to sit here and tell us that its not happening? Im sorry if you dont see it but its happening. There are countless examples of what is happening in government from many different sources.  Its not fun to becoming aware of things that are happening around us that dont line up with our previous belief systems. Its not pretty, im sorry to tell you. The more you go into looking for the truth, the more you find that its worse than anyone can imagine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are so right on it is not even funny. It is the people who do not discuss issues rationally and just generate such obvious anger over the topic it is not even funny.</p>

<p>They will not converse rationally, they will ignore your points, and even ignore entire paragraphs of what you have pointed out to them.</p>

<p>They will even ignore the evidence behind what you have said to just keep attacking you with &quot;facts&quot; even if you have proven said facts to be BS.</p>

<p>Trying to take a neutral standpoint with them is hopeless because they have no concept of being neutral because they have an agenda they are either paid to push or are too ignorant of how things work; even when confronted with evidence.</p>

<p>The other day I tried to get someone to understand that I was not championing a cause, I was trying to break it, it is how I learn. I challenge everything.</p>

<p>The problem I told them I had was that the &quot;official&quot; sources of knowledge on the topic had proven themselves full of crap to me. As such, I was having problems disproving the issue, breaking it, and finding it more and more likely to be true.</p>

<p>I said I needed sources not from these groups and the individual ignored my request, told me to just &quot;Google it&quot; and generally was just being unpleasant and acting like I was wrong for trying to learn something new.</p>

<p>It is when you are speaking of a hot topic, something they want to hide, they attack you. </p>

<p>Lets keep on talking.</p>

<p>This is most likely true. I do not know of any evidence but the mods might and the admins would.</p>

<p>Not necessarily. It could be as simple as people trolling. People such as the subscribers of <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> and <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a> </p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is wrong because we do not know <em>why</em> people are trying to discredit/brigade the subreddit. Therefore can not know that it&#39;s because we are &quot;doing something right.&quot;</p>

<p>Hell, I could even propose an alternate theory and that&#39;s that your post is set up to discredit the subreddit by using a leap in logic to conclude that this subreddit must be successful. And by doing so you may give even more fuel to <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> by giving them ammo to make fun of us for us thinking we&#39;re actually making a difference.</p>

<p>Though I agree with <em>almost</em> everything you said -- I doubt most of them are working in their <em>spare time</em>.  Some subjects attract opposition from people who appear to have more spare time than any one person could possibly have.</p>

<p>Next time, before attempting to engage with someone in argument, try first to understand what it is that you are trying to argue for or against. It is not always the case that your first instinct is correct (certainly it was not in this case). A classic mistake is to assume a person is making an argument you are familiar with and to respond on the basis of that assumption. This is a fatal flaw and shows a true deficiency in cognition.</p>

If you understand how the mind works you will understand that people will do whatever it takes to protect whats called ego boundaries. Our sense of identity is tied directly to our belief system and when that gets challenged the people who know the truth are the ones that suffer.</p>

<p>Nobody wants to be reminded of uncomfortable truths, except the people who have decided to take responsibly for what they have created.

    <div class="md"><p>What kind of nonsense is this absolutism? Sometimes things are right, sometimes things are bullshit. Questioning something and requiring proof (you know, the POINT OF THIS FUCKING SUB) makes people shills? </p>

<p>Not only that, but Occam&#39;s Razor. Those people probably have normal comment histories because they&#39;re normal people who don&#39;t necessarily buy into lazy theories that try to attribute complex global phenomena to a shadowy cabal pulling the strings. There&#39;s a valid Marxian approach which asks the question of &quot;Who is exploiting who?&quot; on the one hand, and the approach of just wildly making shit up without any proof on the other hand. Maybe this &quot;counter-conspiracy crowd&quot; is just tired of the second type of posts on this sub which devalue good investigative research. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A personal observation is that once you start calling out the trolls and shills and stop wasting time debating them, you are targeted less by those same people. Since calling people shills on here is against the rules, I don&#39;t do it, but this is something I noticed on YouTube. I used to have someone calling me names, picking my post apart, or as you said, distracting me and others from the real questions every time. Now, I only seem to get like-minded people with honest discussions. Anyone else notice this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My main problem with this subreddit is people keep posting things like they just discovered the ultimate conspiracy, like their theory is totally correct. We all know things are fucked up we all know there&#39;s evidence out there. But aside from posting and reposting random shit, I don&#39;t know that anyone&#39;s actually doing anything with this information, which includes me.</p>

<p>My second problem is although I&#39;m sure alot of these theories have some level of credibility, we&#39;ll never know what the real truth is for any of it. And people get upset when you try to play devil&#39;s advocate, to get them to question what&#39;s real and what actually matters. </p>

And if you know anything about other subreddits, you know they are catering to and frequented by stupid people.
r/science used to be great, and is now (rough estimate) 80% bullshit. People using correlational data to try to sell a stupid idea, sensational and misleading headlines, and &#39;social sciences&#39; telling you your marriage is bad because they took a bunch of polls.
So naturally (and unfortunately) if we are getting attention from other subs, it is from stupid people who don&#39;t understand what they read; they just know it doesn&#39;t fit their narrative and they are sure going to tell you</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or its easy pickings for both random internet arguing (which is fun, especially when objective facts about reality back up my side of an argument)</p>

<p>as well as good food for thought , case in point currently on the front page is that the gun from the french attacks was linked back to the same arms dealer involved in iran contra - that is some juicy shit right their.</p>

<p>Also I have some personal &quot;favorites&#39; which I&#39;ve never quite wrapped my head around and gotten a decent answer too and I like to keep trying when they pop up on here. </p>

<p>Example? &quot;crisis actors&quot; , ok so, are we saying it was or was not a false flag? because if &quot;they&quot; &lt;- emphasize the quotation marks , have the means to falsify such an event why even bother? if you can fake it why not just do it and not leave all the loose ends of these actors who now know your dirty secrets? </p>

<p>A conspiracy is supposed to be secretive, you dont hire aspiring actors and trust them not to squeal, or involve entire town and county and state law enforcement officials, the media I could buy but entire communities in on it? fucking absurd, and really - following my line of reasoning, fucking retarded.</p>

<p>Ok so maybe the event isnt faked but they hire actors anyway? wtf for? why would you need to hire someone instead of (gain) just having people do it? , like i&#39;d be more willing to believe that mk-ultra was still around and had evolved into...I think its called project monarch right? that makes more sense, the government has sleeper agents all manchurian candidate like, that to me, makes more sense than the government faking entiring shootings / bombings and somehow none of the thousands of people involved go to the press in an age where a cellphone with audio and video costs less than eating at dennys.</p>

I am a fairly normal (for someone killing time on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> anyway) middle-aged US citizen.

Once you have defined everyone who might disagree with you as a &#39;paid shill&#39; or a bot or a Ukranian nihilist, a nonentity you don&#39;t have to listen to, it seems like you&#39;ve wandered off into some kind of sealed mental universe where no contrary information can get in.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but to what purpose? </p>

<p>I always try to keep an open mind while trying to keep myself grounded firmly in the reality of my own experience. </p>

<p>When I listen to his stories I quickly find myself clinging firmly to the reality I am familiar with. It almost seems that I might loose my sanity if I entertain any of his stories with anything other than total disbelief.</p>

<p>His highly detailed descriptions of situations and events seem to potentially have the power to poison a sane mind.</p>

<p>He obviously has a significant number of people who believe what he says. I guess It&#39;s kinda like a cult.</p>

<p>His charisma is right up there with L Ron Hubbard and Jim Jones. It&#39;s a tragedy that people like this are able to bamboozle people into believing their BS. </p>
