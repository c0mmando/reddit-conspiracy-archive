        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><blockquote>
<p>People will argue about those towers for years and never understand that it&#39;s a total distraction trying to sit down and piece together what happened at ground zero. It&#39;s a total waste of time in my opinion - a distraction. It&#39;s all speculation and nobody knows what really happened - maybe it did go down exactly as it was reported, who knows. </p>

<p>So much important information has fallen to the wayside because people endlessly want to debate steal beams melting, nuclear bombs, lasers and holographic airplanes. Silliness. </p>

<p>Nobody talks about the Bush administration co-signed thinkpiece by the &quot;Project for a New American Century: Rebuilding America&#39;s Defences&quot;, published exactly one year before the attacks, advocating a complete overhaul of the American military, to modernize and stay ahead of the competition (like Russia and China). Explaining that this would be a difficult thing to propose without some catalyzing event LIKE A NEW PEARL HARBOUR (on pg.51 if I remember correctly). </p>

<p>The fact that for the first time in the history of American military aviation command the shoot down policy changed hands from the joint chief of staff to the vice president (Dick Cheney) before the attacks occurred, meaning he now had control over the planes being shot down - which brings light to the testimony made by Congressman Norman Mineta when he said that Dick Cheney was with him in the emergency bunker in DC watching the plane coming into DC airspace with a radar operator giving them constant updates of the planes distance saying &quot;When the plane was 50 miles out the man asked [Cheney] &quot;Do the orders still stand?&quot; and Cheney whipped his head around and barked &quot;OF COURSE THE ORDERS STILL STAND HAVE YOU HEARD DIFFERENTLY!?&quot; go look it up on youtube for yourself. </p>

<p>That a prominent member of the House Intelligence Committee (basically the group in DC that knows all and see all, even more than the president) Porter Goss (Ex-Head of the CIA) was having breakfast on the morning of 911 in DC with General Mahmoud Ahmed, head of the Pakistani intelligence service (ISI)... the same man who arranged 100,000 dollars be wired to Attah before the attacks occurred. And it&#39;s impossible to claim ignorance from Goss&#39; perspective because our intelligence, foreign intelligence and signals intelligence all repeatedly indicated that these attacks were incoming soon, how they might take place and who might be involved and the Bush administration ignored them - they even had mornings briefings entitled &quot;Bin Laden determined to strike the United States&quot; go look it up, Condoleeza Rice herself admitted it. </p>

<p>There were massive, unusual troop mobilizations taking place on the borders of Afghanistan before the attacks. The Iraq wars were already planned before the attacks. The day of the attacks there just so happened to be several massive coalition drills taking place - one in northern Canada that drew away most of the air defences of the western seaboard, leaving our skies much more vulnerable than they otherwise would be - very convenient for the terrorists of course and most peculiar Operation Vigilant Guardian which even involved simulated hijacked aircraft! Which is why you hear air traffic controllers on 911 recordings saying &quot;Is this real or simulated?&quot; because they were fucking confused by all the convenient drills going on. </p>

<p>Even though all this was going on the Pentagon still had contingiency plans for exactly the kind of attack that took place, but for whatever reason never implemented them, they&#39;d had them since at least the 70s. Which is why so many people were confused when Bush and Rice said &quot;We could never imagine someone using a plane as a missile&quot; yes, we did... for decades and planned for it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s certainly not the first attack of it&#39;s kind, it was a particularly spectacular attack and it alligned with the massive surge of people using the internet. The vietnam war was initiated by a false flag attack at the Gulf of Tonkin - 150,000 american lives and untold number of vietnamese up in a puff of smoke over a complete lie. Just search youtube for &quot;Israel Lobby: We need a false flag to start war with Iran&quot; these people are deadly serious (Also try to steer clear of those who will try to blame everything on Israel/ Zionists and t3h Jo0000z - these people are tiresome and have zero perspective)</p>

<p>Just look at the 1993 WTC bombing. As it turns out the FBI were aware of the entire attack taking place and the bomb maker himself was an informant! An ex-Egyptian army guy (his name was Ehmad Salem)... he was concerned that the FBI insisted he give the terrorists real explosives and so he started recording his phone calls - imploring them to replace these explosives with fake ones because he was worried he would be implicated and that people might be hurt. It was a good thing he had those phone calls because they saved his ass after the bombings in 93 and luckily the terrorist morons couldn&#39;t follow simple instructions and place the truck against the main support beams or we may have seen a much, much earlier 911 agenda taking place. </p>

<p>There is so much motive it&#39;s coming out of our ears as well. Almost everything we&#39;ve done over there is on paper for anyone to read, written by prominant administration members for decades. If you want to understand our middle eastern foreign policy just read Zbigniew Brzezinski&#39;s &quot;The Grand Chessboard&quot; - he was a foreign advisor to the Carter administration and Obama&#39;s foreign policy mentor. </p>

<p>From the military industry perspective - during the cold war we had an enemy that justified 50 years of military build up... an ungodly amount of wealthy distribution. When that enemy vanished we had no reason to justify that kind of defence budget anymore. Poof, trillions of dollars worth of contracts drying up. We needed a new enemy and fast. After all we created Al-Qaeda. They didn&#39;t have the shelf life we wanted either, so we created ISIS. People will try to tell you that ISIS is the unintended result of our activities in Iraq. That is PATENTLY bullshit. Not only do we KNOW that we funded and armed them just like we did Al-Qaeda, but we have reports straight from the horses mouths (the CIA) indicating that they would be pleased to see a religious caliphate emerge in Syria and Iraq (even referring directly to IS as they were known at the time) as a way of putting pressure on the Assad regime. One of the 5 countries we planned to invade directly after 911 according to General Wesley Clark (Remember the map I showed everyone at university when I was dressed up like a tit?). </p>

<p>Hell just look at the drug trade. The intelligence communities like the CIA and MI6 traffic drugs and make a ludicrous sum of liquid cash flow from it. And its unauditable, unlike official tax paid funding. This is why drugs are and will remain illegal for a very long time - there&#39;s too much money in it. This was the purpose of the drug war, which started around Vietnam, around the time the CIA started dealing coke and herion (ever see Air America? If you want to know more read &quot;Powder Burns&quot; by Cele Costillo, ex DEA/ Special forces vet who caught the CIA flying coke out of South America, into Mena Arkansas (Who&#39;s governor at the time was, BOINK Bill Clinton who as a reward for turning a blind eye was made president, even though his wife was implicated in murder). Shit, before we occupied Afghanistan 30% of European heroin was sourced from Afghanistan, after we went in post-911 it&#39;s over 90%. Which made it so helarious when Tony Blair said &quot;We are bombing the poppy fields&quot; yeah... OK Tony.</p>

<p>Do I think we did 911? Yeh. Do I know how? Nope and I don&#39;t care :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The main thing wrong with your post is that you assume the government (specifically the CIA) cares about safety in any capacity. This is the same agency that slipped extremely high doses of LSD into random people&#39;s coffee all through the 50s and 60s. Also, making ISIS a loose cannon is a good thing for them, I think. ISIS obviously has their own agenda, so any of the bad shit that they do that they aren&#39;t told to do, is just a bonus that can&#39;t be traced anywhere other than to ISIS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I second that.</p>

<p>Plus it&#39;s very easy to cut through just smoke. They need a meatblocker if they want to keep up the facade long enough.</p>

<p>Plus it&#39;s always been the sociopath best weapon to be able to play poker with things without a problem. They are particularly keen to do that with other people money and lives these days since they can get away so well with it.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t blame the guys, they did what society let them get away with.
Still if i was in a position of ( righteous ) power i&#39;d have little qualms chopping their heads.
Moral relativism ( and permessivism ) was a creation of the first modern sociopaths and is now collapsing on society. 
Mankind must accept and deal with evil, but nowadays we just tolerate it. We as a whole are unable to do that with internal conflicts because we excuse the powerful.
Now some cruelty was always necessary, but there is no more higher purpose in that today, only hedonistic egoism.</p>

<p>It&#39;s war and one side will eventually die off. I calmly wait for sheeple to pack up on their actual side of the fence. Then a group of psychopaths will fight for leadership, maybe win, and if we fail to keep them in check, restart the sociopathic machine.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to understand why eternal vigilance and one responsability to violence ( as defence ) were so important in older, more chaos-exposed society. The outer danger made the inner organization stronger.
Now outer and inner are confused and twisted so everything goes dysfunctional.</p>

<p>It would be a lot more difficult, for a start. It would also cost a lot more money and need a different sort of expertise than military.</p>

<p>Can you imagine the effort it would take to con every news agency in the world with a fake attack? Not to mention the risk of a backfire. Better to set up a real one and then sit back while the media circus flocks around it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a distraction, it&#39;s just disorganized <em>information</em>, some of which is nonsense, but some of it is vetted <em>evidence</em>, so much of it in fact that 9/11&#39;s official conspiracy is a total joke.  We have triangulated at least 20 &#39;problems&#39; which science has proved to undermine.  We&#39;ve corrected NIST 3 times.  The media still will not recognize the nanothermite or molybdenum spheres in the dust.  That they say the red chips are from paint and not unexploded thermitic material is proof they are controlling opposition with lies upon lies.</p>

<p>But yes, the problem overall is that 9/11 truth people have <em>more than ample evidence to bring a accusation of a widespread, complex coverup by the government and media</em>, but they cannot seem to connect all the dots into an organized pattern of criminality leading to a narrative that is investigable and actionable.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like when cops are trying to figure something out, they corkboard it with pushpins and then draw lines connecting with yarn.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_analysis">This is link analysis</a>, and the 911 truth movement needs to start linking these facts up together until they have a case against one single individual and then class action them, just as a means to put the foot in the door on prosecuting other people in a civil case.</p>

<p>It didn&#39;t. It genuinely didn&#39;t. The way those towers collapsed isn&#39;t compatible with the laws of mechanics unless there was some form of unseen damage to the structure below the centre of gravity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read through the email, but I stopped really caring after the first paragraph. If you don&#39;t actually know how the towers collapsed, and you think discussing it is a &quot;distraction&quot; then you clearly aren&#39;t basing your view on facts. The question of how the towers came down is the key question and if whatever theory you present doesn&#39;t explain our even address how they came down, it isn&#39;t a good theory. You can focus on the supposed motives of other people all day long, but you need to actually provide evidence that it was an inside job in order for people to be convinced.</p>
