    <div class="md"><p>Feels like getting caught is an attempt to stir an uprising, then attempt to squash it with force.</p>

<p>The first real development of a militia will be weak, probably made up of conspiracy guys and truthers and a few gun nuts that just want shoot some politicians. This militia will probably be infiltrated and rooted out as quickly as possible through police and army depending on how successful they are at taking targets and convincing people.</p>

<p>After this first group falls, due to sheer numbers, the way they are treated will either spark the flame that puts all of America behind them, or all of America in fear. Chances are this group will also be divided by less radicals and more people that just want to restore power to the people (think American Revolution). The ones in fear will most likely turn informants for some extra money and a promise of protection, but in the end their lives, the militias&#39; lives, the 2nd wave militias&#39; lives, the police and militarys&#39; lives won&#39;t really matter. By then they will be safely in their bunkers, or in Saudi Arabia having sex with children, or up in a space station with their finger on that all impending red button.</p>

<p>Either it will go their way or it won&#39;t, and they sure as hell have a plan for both.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This actually sounds pretty spot on.
They are starting to question the &quot;official&quot; narrative on 
the main stream media. Really making it obvious to the thick headed. This will only incite the more radical individuals at first though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really a weird time to be interested in conspiracy. It&#39;s like the culmination of all the efforts conspiritors have put forth by having those conversations with those that know very little, the knowledge is power aspect of it, is coming to fruition. But it&#39;s in our nature to be cautious because history has shown us that not doing so is a death sentence.</p>

<p>When things like the SB incident happen with such glaring problems in the narrative it&#39;s like all of our red flag indicators go off. They couldn&#39;t have messed up that bad on this, they have been successfully pulling this stuff off for years. But in a way information has become their biggest enemy, and harnessing the Internet for their benefit has become like catching a greased pig. Maybe this is a fully botched scenario, maybe it isn&#39;t. We can&#39;t really know until history reveals itself in the present. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is there really any way to answer his question without sounding paranoid?</p>

<p>We could say it just is to reduce more rights, which will push the people until literally everyone is in prison or making prison wages. It&#39;s just about how far they can push at this point, becoming brazen about it is just human nature, and that is really all you are seeing at an elitest level.</p>

<p>You really have to ask yourself what outcomes are possible. It&#39;s not like people give up power easily, what makes you think TPTB are any different?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends, how far fetched of a wacky theory do you want?</p>

<p>My wackiest slightly plausible theory? In todays information age going to war is harder than ever. They have to stage events to create justifications for invasion, which they have done with 9/11 etc so they were able to invade Iraq and you know the rest.</p>

<p>Then they created ISIS to spread fear against Muslims on a global scale. Make people fight Muslims by using Muslim actions to justify it, and this to radicalize Muslims against everyone else.</p>

<p>If you get caught, make the next president come in and &quot;mop up&quot; and look like some kind of hero for fixing it.</p>

<p>Create World War 3 against the Islamic nations, roll in with your gazillion dollar army and &quot;save&quot; the world, unite the globe, enter space age.</p>
