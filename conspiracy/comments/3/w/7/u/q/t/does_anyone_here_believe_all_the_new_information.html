    <div class="md"><p>Ok... so why do you start with the idea that this has to be a false flag?  Seems like you are working backwards from a conclusion there.  Why don&#39;t you entertain the idea that it might just be a case of Islamic terrorism because I assure you there are Muslim terrorists (go overseas for a little while and check out the unreported/under-reported shit going on) and they would love to kill you if you aren&#39;t Muslim.  </p>

<p>I assure you there are FBI terrorist lead plots, from providing the bombs for the 1993 WTC attack, to finding weak minded, poor folks and making them into a plausible terrorist.</p>

<p>But you willfully ignore the prime suspect. Any reason for this?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t &quot;start with the idea that it has to be a false flag&quot;. I start with an open mind, aware that the FBI is responsible for most of the attacks, and others are responsible for a lesser number. I then see where the evidence leads. </p>

<p>By the way, I spent 18 years overseas. I know many Muslims, but have never met one that was a terrorist. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t try to convert those who are willfully blinded by authority. It&#39;s just not worth it. Any possible means of plausible deniability, they latch onto. And knowing this, it has been shown that the intelligence agencies intentionally produce plausible deniability, which you will no doubt hold in higher esteem than anything that is presented to you  regardless of any known investigative measures or weighting of evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The same motives that the US has for promoting terrorism at home, exists for them and other countries abroad. </p>

<p>To me, it&#39;s a question of sales. Am I being sold something? Is what I&#39;m being sold commensurate with the event that was reported? What is the likelihood that the event was as reported?</p>

<p>Who has the most history with such events? If a coup happens, I generally suspect the CIA until there is legitimate evidence that it wasn&#39;t them. This is due to the vast number of coups and assassinations lead by them. If there is a revolution, I suspect the CIA as this has become their new mode of operation.</p>

<p>What I believe essentially doesn&#39;t matter, what matters is what impetus I provide for such events. </p>

<p>DO I support attacking Iraq because of 9/11? No. Do I support providing the MIC with trillions of dollars because of it? No. Do I support torture, black-site prisons, end of due process, the TSA, multiple wars, funding the corporations owned in part by Cheney, Bush, Rumsfeld, etc because of it? No. </p>

<p>Do I support ignoring the funding of the attacks, the massive amounts of heroin that has been brought into the country post 9/11 with no investigation as to how this is supporting terrorism? No. Do I support drone strikes, sodomizing Gaddafi with a bayonet using proxy Al Qaeda agents and then having the weapons transported to Mali so that they can stir up shit so that Canada and France can secure the countries resources? No. Do I support France leaving the Ivory Coast in chaos while extracting their resources long after France was booted from the country? No. </p>

<p>Do I support violence of any kind? No. </p>

<p>I see a pattern in these attacks. A cheap marketing trick that enables billions and trillions to be sought over an event that might cost 0.0001% of the return. I see that the FBI were disappointed with the limited response by the public after the 1993 attacks and wished it were bigger. I see a pattern of people intercepting these plots being ignored, dismissed, fired, imprisoned and ignored in the media. </p>

<p>Do you see these patterns?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with pretty much everything you said there but how does that get you to thinking that this attack wasn&#39;t Muslim terror?  I can agree that US occupation of Middle Eastern countries helps to draft more terrorists and I know we funded, trained and armed terrorists for decades but that still doesn&#39;t make me think &quot;San Bernardino is either a hoax or false flag.&quot;  It just makes me think that maybe decades ago we helped train the people who taught these guys.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US created &quot;Muslim terror&quot; as it is today directly or indirectly.</p>

<p>The US overthrew the democratically elected leader of Iran who was trying to nationalize the oil there. They installed Israel in the midst of the Middle East and then allowed Israel to disenfranchise the former populace. They helped Saddam get into power. Helped Saddam build chemical weapons factories, egged Saddam into wars, embargoed Iraq making up to 2m people starve. Attacked the infrastructure of Iraq, reattacked Iraq for WMDs coming from the same chemical factories which Donald Rumsfeld had helped broker in the 80s. </p>

<p>If you had been a child in the region for the last 60 years, then you might have a lot of reason to hate the US. Very valid reasons. Dead parents, relatives, children. Hunger, dictators, threats.</p>

<p>What you wouldn&#39;t have are means and opportunity of enacting revenge. </p>

<p>So then the US supplied them with the means and opportunity after having supplied them with the motive.</p>

<p>Was it direct or indirect? Does it matter? Know them by their fruit, and the fruit is not good.</p>

<p>I would argue that it was direct. Those at the bottom of the ISIS and Al Qaeda pools are probably those who legitimately hate and want revenge on the US. Those at the top are being supplied, trained, funded, and allowed to grow by the US. </p>

<p>Without an enemy, there is no reason for war or supplying the MIC with 800b a year in perpetuity. But that&#39;s become the expectation. 800b a year and budgets projected forward by the recipients of the money. </p>

<p>If you were getting 40b a year and knowing that that stops when the threat of terrorism calms, would it be worth spending 0.5% to enable an enemy?</p>

<p>How much terrorism can you buy with $200m? These San Bernadino folks got $28,500 apparently, so apparently 0.5% can buy quite a bit.</p>

<p>Edit: And directly to the point of this thread, the FBI gets approximately $250m per terrorist that they create and are known to create. Mighty fine returns for giving a mentally ill guy with radical leanings some money that will be given back to another FBI to get weapons from him and then bust the guy and get the weapons back. Cost of operation: 0. Money back to FBI, weapons back to FBI, $250m collected. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so you believe this shooting was an actual Muslim terror event... The terrorism might have been because our government literally funded, trained and created an Islamic terror group in the Middle East but you understand that this was just an offshoot of that.  This wasn&#39;t a hoax. </p>

<p>You are on the same page as I am I think.  I just don&#39;t think this was some FBI setup or staged event.  This was the consequence of our presence in the Middle East and the teachings of the Qur&#39;an and Hadith.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, I don&#39;t know if it was a hoax or not.</p>

<p>I expect a certain amount of evidence in this day and age.</p>

<p>I would expect corroborating witnesses, signs of radicalization and extreme desire for revenge. I would expect a suicide video, notes, a statement as to why. I would expect videos of the shooting, etc. </p>

<p>I neither believe one way or the other. I don&#39;t have access to the evidence, I can&#39;t question witnesses, review backgrounds, letters or videos of intent, can&#39;t access the family, the car records, the escape plan, the source of funding.</p>

<p>And I can see that it is being used to censor. </p>

<p>All in all, the concept of &quot;don&#39;t let a crisis go to waste&quot; muddies the waters. Disinfo muddies the waters. Planted evidence muddies the waters. </p>

<p>I would like to see a return to freedom, to see the agencies of our government stop fucking over nations. To stop taxing us to the extreme and beyond (taxing us into the future by printing money that they can&#39;t tax and tagging it onto a future bill that we will need to pay).</p>

<p>I would like to see the prison population in the US decreased. The homeless population decreased. The money required when someone gets sick to decrease, the number of sick decreased, the level of education increased. The amount of pollution decreased.</p>

<p>But none of those things are happening. And they aren&#39;t happening because of social engineering. It makes more sense in our economic environment to have criminals, to have sick people, to have terrorists, to have a lot of bad shit. </p>

<p>And if it isn&#39;t there, to make it there.</p>

<p>And until we can disincentivize the benefit from crisis and problems, then I suspect all problems will be used as a means of marketing. That all politicians then merely become salesmen for the greatest possible GDP.</p>

<p>What motivates you to not only supply the impetus to enable private corporations to obtain the technology and expertise to first provide motivation for destruction and then trounce that destruction as they may deem fit?</p>

<p>What motivates you to provide funding to companies that cannot be tied to the US and will leave as soon as the massive funding that they are enabled, by you, to extract from the taxpayer and the reckless printing of money ends?</p>

<p>What do you think Boeing is going to do when the Petrodollar goes south? When the US dollar goes bad? When the service industry of this nation is utterly disgraced by the economic collapses that are enabled by the populace makes Boeing unable to secure funding locally?</p>

<p>Perhaps they are already preparing for it? Making treaties that enable them to dictate the terms of the government while profiting abroad and not at home any longer?</p>

<p>Because that&#39;s what the FBI does.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The latest whistleblower is David Steele, a 20-year Marine Corps intelligence officer, and the second-highest-ranking civilian in the U.S. Marine Corps Intelligence. He is a former CIA clandestine services case officer, and this is what he had to say:</p>

<p>“Most terrorists are false flag terrorists, or are created by our own security services. In the United States, every single terrorist incident we have had has been a false flag, or has been an informant pushed on by the FBI. In fact, we now have citizens taking out restraining orders against FBI informants that are trying to incite terrorism. We’ve become a lunatic asylum.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you see the people who actually did it?  They look white.  You can&#39;t distinguish between tan and Arab.  If you just want to believe that they didn&#39;t do it then there is no evidence that will satisfy you.  Everything that comes out now will be &quot;that&#39;s what they want you to think.&quot;  This is the trap that every shooting event falls into.  Everyone makes up their mind on day one and then when more information comes out it&#39;s tainted by the government so it&#39;s a lie.</p>

<p>Show me a picture of the couple holding a weapon. Link me to an interview with a witness / survivor identifying the accused. There was CCTV at the Regional Center, dashcams on the cop cars and CCTV at the gun range, which would put to rest many theories.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because that is the number of FBI agents that are working on this.  You can google that.  So you think that maybe a handful of agents are tainting the evidence or influencing everyone else?  That&#39;s more likely than the idea that a couple of radical Islamists killed some people?  What about in Beirut and Nigeria?  Were they also false flags that were barely reported or were radical Islamists killing people for real in those places?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I googled &quot;FBI agents working on San Bernardino case&quot; and found nothing. Nor did I say &quot;handful of agents.&quot; I am not privy to the personnel records, and neither are you. I am simply pointing out that your hypothesis that &quot;hundred of agents&quot; are involved could be flawed if indeed this is a false flag. These operations are quite compartmentalized but presented to give the appearance that lots of people are involved. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t know, I am focused on SB, which is a major high profile event. My starting point is if coverage is scant and there is no narrative, that&#39;s likely real. When coverage is huge, and there is a big narrative/ story line plus anomalies that is suspect. At SB we are now getting two different eyewitnesses saying there were 3 white male shooters in gear on the scene. Their observations can be viewed here: <a href="http://winteractionables.com/?p=28530">http://winteractionables.com/?p=28530</a></p>

<p>Also the media can put out any number they want on the number of agents, but do you automatically just accept that? I don&#39;t. </p>

<p>No, the real conspiracy here is the sudden, <em>MASSIVE</em> surge in anti-official-story posts here. <em>Specifically,</em> posts that claim that the terrorists were <em>white</em>. This, after the first three days where we found out they were Muslim imports and damn near the <em>entire fucking board</em> was united in conceding that yeah, they suspected it was Muslims the whole time <em>Now</em>, we have multiple posts daily trying to convince us these three clowns were white and we&#39;re being lied to. Nunuh. Nope. We ain&#39;t falling for that bullshit again. It&#39;s an attempt to get people to <em>go back to sleep</em> and forget the facts.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, most middle-eastern muslims share the same race. That is the race everyone means when they use the word &quot;muslim&quot; to refer to &quot;middle-Easterners of Muslim faith.&quot; They&#39;re not caucasian/white.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can also say someone is white and they might be tan and have the exact shade of skin as a Muslim from Pakistan... </p>

<p>No, actually, you <em>can</em> tell a middle-Easterner from a caucasian easily. Look at the hair, eyes, facial structure, and skin tone. You can look at them and tell the difference, just like you can with a Jew as opposed to a Caucasian. Tanned caucasian is not the same as middle-Eastern brown. </p>

<p>But hey, if you&#39;d like to keep pretending to be &quot;racially colorblind,&quot; be my guest.</p>
