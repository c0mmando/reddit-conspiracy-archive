       Jet fuel can't melt steel beams, so why was there molten metal at the WTC collapse sites?
      </p>
      <p>
       NIST claims that WTC 1&amp;2 collapsed due to jet fueled fires (just normal offices fires for WTC7) which were not hot enough to produce molten steel or iron, but also claim that if there had been molten steel or iron in the debris afterwards, it would have been irrelevant to the cause of the collapses. The evidence of molten steel or iron cannot be called “irrelevant,” given the fact that the building fires, as NIST pointed out, cannot explain it.

         Early in 2002, Barnett and two WPI colleagues published an analysis of a section of steel from one of the Twin Towers, along with sections from WTC 7, as an appendix to FEMA’s 2002 World Trade Center Building Performance Study

         Their discoveries were also reported in a WPI article entitled “The ‘Deep Mystery’ of Melted Steel,” which said:
        </a>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Steel – which has a melting point of 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit – may weaken and bend, but does not melt during an ordinary office fire. Yet metallurgical studies on WTC steel brought back to WPI reveal that a novel phenomenon – called a eutectic reaction – occurred at the surface, causing intergranular melting capable of turning a solid steel girder into Swiss cheese.

        <a href="http://www.wpi.edu/News/Transformations/2002Spring/steel.html">
         Stating that the New York Times called these findings “perhaps the deepest mystery uncovered in the investigation,” the article added:

      </ul>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A one-inch column has been reduced to half-inch thickness. Its edges – which are curled like a paper scroll – have been thinned to almost razor sharpness. Gaping holes – some larger than a silver dollar – let light shine through a formerly solid steel flange. This Swiss cheese appearance shocked all of the fire-wise professors, who expected to see distortion and bending – but not holes.

          In May 2004, the RJ Lee Group issued a report, entitled “WTC Dust Signature,” at the request of the Deutsche Bank, in order to prove (to its insurance company) that the building was “pervasively contaminated with WTC Dust

        Underground fires burned at temperatures up to 2,000 degrees. As the
huge cranes pulled steel beams from the pile, safety experts worried about the
effects of the extreme heat on the crane rigging and the hazards of contact with the
hot steel. And they were concerned that applying water to cool the steel could cause
a steam explosion that would propel nearby objects with deadly force. Special
expertise was needed.
        <strong>
         OSHA called in Mohammad Ayub and Scott Jin, structural
engineers from its national office, to assess the situation. They recommended a
special handling procedure, including the use of specialized rigging and instruments.

       The fact that the rubble contained steel or iron that had been melted shows that the buildings were destroyed by something other than fire and airplane impact.

       No, it's correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       The chips identified in the dust as being "thermitic" were a combination of Iron Oxide, Kaolinite clay and epoxy. To any good materials scientist, Iron Oxide, Kaolinite clay and epoxy are primer paint.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was one brand of primer paint used on the floor trusses that matched the makeup of several of the "thermitic" chips in chemical composition, XEDS spectra, color, and a DSC peak that is consistent with burning epoxy in oxygen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best evidence from the Bentham team that the red/grey chips were thermitic came from a DSC test ran on one of the chips that showed a sharp energetic peak at around 430 degrees. They charted that DSC test in their paper (under figure 29 IIRC) and compared it with a test from another lab, LLNL, which tested actual thermite. Since the Bentham test compared favorably with the LLNL test, the Bentham team thought it proved their chip was thermitic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only one problem, they did the DSC test incorrectly.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2 authors of the paper the Bentham team used as a comparable came out and said their DSC test was ran in an inert atmosphere of ultra pure nitrogen where the Bentham team ran their DSC test in oxygen. So in essence, all they proved is that their chip made up of over 70% organic material will ignite and burn in air, just like you would expect it to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stephen Jones was made aware of this mistake in 2012 and agreed that a follow up inert atmosphere DSC test was needed...too bad it was never done. Mark Basile took $5000 in donations 2 years ago to sent a sample to an independent lab and have them run a DSC test in an inert atmosphere. That also was never done.

      <p>
       In other words, not every red grey chip was LaClede, nor would you expect it to be. There were
       <em>
        at least
       </em>
       3 different steel primer paints in the trade towers, and the one (or more) used on the core supports is still unidentified.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that we know the DSC test in the Bentham paper was done in a completely different atmosphere than the comparable test from LLNL, we can safely say there is absolutely nothing about the red grey chips that resembles thermite in any way. Not the DSC spike, not the chemical makeup, not the XEDS spectra, not the ignition temperature, not the ratio of organic content. Nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, have you been  keeping up with your buddy Mark Basiles donor funded study? Seems he's pissed off a lot of his initial supporters with his complete lack of results after nearly
       <em>
        2 full years
       </em>
       . His donor page actually briefly turned into a picture of his face next to a picture of Donald Trump with the caption "you're fired" for a few days. Rick Shaddock from ANETA emailed Oystien directly and had a few interesting tidbits to share:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>

        Ziggi did not donate to the project.

       There was more than one type of steel primer in the towers, and there was more than one makeup of red grey chips. So it stands to reason that LaClede doesn't represent every chip found in the dust, but it almost certainly represents
       <strong>
        some

       of them.

        I'm having a great time watching you fail at proving your theory. Your theory that the original purveyor admits to be flawed.

       Nah, you're just being pedantic because I've taken your precious paper apart a brick at a time and you have no response for it. You could say I've
       <em>
        progressively collapsed
       </em>
       it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The theory is that the red grey chips were primer paint, no matter which of the brands they came from (some of which are still unidentified). A good deal of them are a spot on match for LaClede, which supports that argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only that, but there is not a shred of evidence that the chips are
       <em>
        anything but
       </em>
       primer paint. The only evidence the Bentham team had that they were thermitic was the DSC test, which was done incorrectly and
       <strong>
        never followed up on
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       You get that part, right? Jones and company knew that their test was done in the wrong atmosphere, yet they didn't follow up with the LLNL lab and they didn't rerun their tests in an inert atmosphere. They basically left their own paper for dead. Mark Basile's attempt at a donor funded transparent study has become a laughable flaming train wreck, attacked by the very truthers that sponsored it.

The only evidence that your sample was thermitic came from an improperly done test that the authors

       Yeah, like running a DSC test in a proper atmosphere...or actually checking with a lab who's test results you are trying to replicate...or managing to send a sample to an independent lab within a 3 year time frame.

       And he's completely right. Some of the red grey chips are not specifically LaClede. They are still a mixture of iron oxide, Kaolinite clay and epoxy resin, which absent any evidence to the contrary, makes them primer paint.

        Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) contain some information about product materials.

However, none of the 177 different coatings are a match for the red layer coating found in this study.

        The existence of elemental aluminium in the red chips is proven by the formation of the microspheres in the DSC, largely iron. What else can start to rip the oxygen out of iron oxide at below 400 deg C, then have a runaway temperature increase at least to the melting point of iron? Those who dispute this on the grounds that oxygen was present, and that the energy came from the combustion of organic material, must provide an explanation for why such special conditions are required in a blast furnace to produce iron. The idea that you could heat a little kaolin and coke and iron oxide to a mere 400 deg C and see it suddenly run away and produce molten iron is clearly a fantasy.

       I provided evidence that

       There is no evidence that the chips were thermitic. They don't share a single property of any thermite ever seen. Not chemical makeup, not ratio of organic material, not ignition temperature. Nothing.

       "Dr. Harrit has never claimed that thermitic reactions were the sole method of melting steel.
      </p>
      <p>
       He does not believe that an ordinary wood fire in a steel barrel is going to heat primer paint to the point that iron oxide will melt into iron-rich microspheres.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dave's test is a mess just like is infamous steel wool hand waving.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take an old steel barrel (likely heavily contaminated with welding-created iron-rich microspheres), dump in a pile of wood fuel, burn off the primer paint from steel, extract steel from debris sludge at the bottom of the barrel, scrap off residue and examine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two iron-rich microspheres are found and are immediately attributed to the burned primer paint.
      </p>
      <p>
       The possibility of contamination being the source of Dave's discovery of a couple of microspheres is never acknowledged or considered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why only two?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why not a myriad of various microspheres, spheroids etc?
      </p>
      <p>
       How strange that in all the heat experiments previously reported on primer paints, iron-rich microspheres were not discovered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who knew it was so easy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Harrit replied to me that Dave's test was rubbish and that when Dave publishes his work, Dr. Harrit will gladly respond"

       You guys all seem to have trouble getting published on this matter.

       Wow, what a long, off topic response. You went from at least part of your comments being on topic, to none of it. Do you think if you just keep making them longer, the audience won't notice? And why are you still begging me to go off topic? I literally just told you that if the audience wants that information, I will link them. You were already given the information. You simply want to talk about it again because you were proven wrong about the primer paint. That is literally the topic. And again, you can attempt a topic shift if you like. I will not participate. I will continually point out that your theory about the primer paint has not been proven or even supported. In fact, the primer paint you claim has been disavowed by your own sources.

          In the simulations, none of the columns with intact insulation reached temperatures over 300 °C.  Only a few isolated truss members with intact insulation were heated to temperatures over 400 °C in the WTC 1 simulations and to temperatures over 500 °C in the WTC 2 simulations.  In WTC 1, if the fires had been allowed to continue past the time of building collapse, complete burnout would likely have occurred within a short time since the fires had already traversed around the entire floor, and most of the combustibles would already have been consumed.  In WTC 2, if the fire simulation were extended for 2 hours past the time of building collapse with all windows broken, the temperatures in the truss steel on the west side of the building (where the insulation was undamaged) would likely have increased for about 
40 min before falling off rapidly as the combustibles were consumed.  Temperatures of 700 °C to 760 °C were reached 
over approximately 15 percent of the west floor area for less than 10 min.  Approximately 60 percent of the floor steel had temperatures between 600 °C and 700 °C for about 15 min.  Approximately 70 percent of the floor steel had temperatures that exceeded 500 °C for about 45 min.  At these temperatures, the floors would be expected 
to sag and then recover a portion of the sag as the steel began to cool.  The temperatures of the insulated exterior and core columns would not have increased to the point where they would have experienced significant loss of strength or stiffness.

        For a large over-ventilated jet-fuel pool fire, the heat release rate per unit area is reported to be approximately 2 MW/m²
        <sup>
         [13].
        </sup>
        As one limiting scenario, we consider that the plane dumped its whole fuel load over only one floor (smashing all material on that floor, including both combustible and non-combustible matter). Then the fuel would cover this floor to an average depth of nearly 0.8 cm, and the fuel load per unit area would be approximately 6.2 kg/m². In this case, we consider the fuel to be instantaneously ignited and begin burning with a heat release rate of approximately 2 MW/m², yielding a total heat release rate in this scenario of several GW. At this burning rate, the jet fuel would be consumed in only a few minutes, assuming an adequate air supply, and even in less time if the fuel were spread over a greater area. These estimates are consistent with those given in the FEMA/ASCE study
        <sup>
         [7]
        </sup>

       Sorry, sorry. But yeah, no, if you look at the numbers even when you take into account all the other shit burning around it, it still wouldn't have been hot enough to melt steel. You'd have needed thermite for that.

       He makes 80k a year - he took a paycut to help the 9/11 truth movement. He has produced, by far, the BEST materials on 9/11.

       Why do you think I'm full of shit? The lab's method on the "nanothermite" was proven faulty and they never acknowledged their mistake or got the sample tested at another lab. In the science world, we call this "fraud".

       Maybe you should spend a little time investigating the background of the lab and employees who did the tests. It's all shrouded in shady, shady procedure.

       It doesn't fool us scientists, which is why we haven't taken the study seriously and aren't holding our breath for a second study.

       Therefore those issues were

        on topic
