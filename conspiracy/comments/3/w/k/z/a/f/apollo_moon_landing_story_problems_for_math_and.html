       This is kind of a kindergarten approach to physics, especially the fixation on Lagrange points and the weird idea that you'd need to fire engines the entire way there. It's like this is based on a worldview that nixes the laws of motion, the rocket equation, and basic math. (Not to mention the nature of orbiting and probably the shape of the planet.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll toss this one in, though:
      </p>
      <p>
       The Saturn V launch and the lunar lander can't really be compared in scale. Not even close.
      </p>
      <p>
       The former had to launch the lander and orbiter through the atmosphere with the fuel required for the Moon visit - and then it had to carry all the fuel required to lift its own upper stages too. At launch it weight something like 6.5 million lbs and it had to reach a speed of 17,500 mph while countering drag and high gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
       The lander, meanwhile, required only enough to launch a small lander from an airless surface that's got a fraction of the gravity, and accelerate it to about 3,700 mph. There are orders of magnitudes difference here, it's not a matter of dividing by 6.

       If you go faster than Earth's escape velocity, you're off to the races. Although technically you are never completely out of the pull of gravity of anything, the numbers are so negligible that it makes no difference. About 25,000 miles per hour is enough to leave Earth forever - doable, considering you're already at a significant fraction of that just orbiting. LEO is halfway to anywhere...

       The Moon's gravity is pretty tiny actually, hence why things aren't meaningfully lighter when the Moon is in the sky. Tidal forces are a bit more complicated than that, being more a cumulative effect due to the tendency for water to flow downhill rather than just literally getting pulled upwards by the Moon. I mean, that logic wouldn't explain why there's also a bulge on the opposite side of the Earth...
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, the Earth's gravity still affects a rocket to the Moon plenty. It orbits the Earth, right? That orbit is the effect of gravity - without gravity, objects would just keep going straight. All those bendy paths you see are due to the effects of good old gravity. :)

       can you elaborate on this concept of "escape velocity"? it seems one could argue that a bird achieves "escape velocity" because it can fly. why would escape velocity be different for a bird than for a bullet or a rocket? what is so magical about 25,000MPH?

       Birds don't escape the Earth, sorry to say. I wish our avian friends the best of luck, though! ;)
      </p>
      <p>
       Escape velocity is the minimum speed required in order to break free of the gravitational attraction of a body, generally a big one like a Planet or Moon where the mass starts adding up. For Earth, that velocity is about 25000 mph; if you go slower, you're not getting out. Note that orbiting objects like the ISS, space shuttles, satellites, Moon landers, the Moon itself etc. aren't escaping the Earth's gravitational influence - they're all well within it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile probes to Mars or the outer planets, or straight out of the solar system, are moving at a rather faster clip and necessarily had to surpass escape velocity to do so.

       The Apollo rockets didn't need to reach that speed, because they weren't escaping the Earth's gravity.  (They were heading to the Moon, which is orbiting Earth, so this is kind of obvious.)

       can you tell us exactly where a rocket has to be when it is traveling at 25,000 to achieve "escape" velocity?
      </p>
      <p>
       would that be 25,000MPH at the surface of the earth, or 25,000MPH as rocket leaves earth orbit and heads toward lagrange point?

       You don't have to travel at escape velocity to escape provided you keep providing thrust. Escape velocity is the vertical velocity needed on the surface to escape without the use of any fuel or other means of propulsion. As rockets use fuel, escape velocity is not needed.

       Remember in the looney tunes when wile E coyote runs off a cliff so fast he kinda hangs in the air? Imagine a similar situation where you are moving so fast that earths curvature actually comes into play and your forward momentum takes off of the earth tangent to earths curve. Another way to say it is that you impart an object with enough kinetic energy to overcome the potential energy of earths gravity.

       you have a vivid imagination, and thats about it. you have never been to the moon, and you will never go to the moon. furthermore, you will never meet anyone who has been to the moon or will go the moon.

      <p>
       to illustrate the absurdity of your wild imagination, imagine if you were driving a car at 25MPH, and then you cut the engine. would you expect the car to coast uphill for the next 200 miles? of course not. you'd be lucky to coast a block. if my analogy seems absurd, its because it is. just like your moon travel myth.

and that vaccines are safe, effective, and necessary?

       its really not that hard to figure out, but you were brainwashed at such a young age that this absurd bullshit got programmed into your mind before you developed any critical thinking skills. kinda like how some people believed in santa claus.
      </p>
      <p>
       now that you are an adult, you can go back and revisit these absurd ideas and apply critical thinking skills.
      </p>
      <p>
       for example, if we ask why nobody from Russia, China, England, or France has ever walked on the moon, one simple answer may be that Russia, China, England,and France do not have the technology to go to the moon.
      </p>
      <p>

       You have been provided direct refutations. You're just unwilling to accept the explanations provided and continually demand additional evidence. That doesn't mean the landings didn't happen - it just means no evidence is good enough for you short of you stepping on the moon yourself.

       My proposition is exactly like your proposition - you are claiming that no matter how much energy a rocket uses, it should not be able to escape earth's gravity. My example is exactly that on a smaller scale - since there is gravitational force between the two of us, I should not be able to escape your gravitational force ever

       “It is commonly believed that man will fly directly from the earth to the moon, but to do this, we would require a vehicle of such gigantic proportions that it would prove an economic impossibility. It would have to develop sufficient speed to penetrate the atmosphere and overcome the earth’s gravity and, having traveled all the way to the moon, it must still have enough fuel to land safely and make the return trip to earth. Furthermore, in order to give the expedition a margin of safety, we would not use one ship alone, but a minimum of three … each rocket ship would be taller than New York’s Empire State Building [almost ¼ mile high] and weigh about ten times the tonnage of the Queen Mary, or some 800,000 tons.”

       That's a quote which deals with the scenario of a single stage monster rocket which takes off from Earth, flies directly to the Moon, and lands there before doing the same thing in reverse. Such a scenario would, indeed, be rather absurd. You'll note that he's disagreeing with a 'common belief' at the time - I'd rather doubt you would go so far as to suggest Wernher von Braun of all people thought that space travel was impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       The actual moon landings weren't even a little bit like that scenario, of course. (Beyond using some big rockets.)

       how exactly did NASA test the lunar lander's launch capability? do we have any documentation of any such tests? I'm having a hard time believing this modern art sculpture is capable of flight.

       You realize that it's Apollo
       <em>
        11
       </em>
       for a reason, right? Not to mention the Mercury and Gemini programs that preceded the Apollo program. All the various parts involved were tested on Earth, in LEO, at the Moon, and ultimate applied to the first Moon landing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides that, of course, you can calculate the exact requirements for the launch and landing with math, including the precise amount of fuel needed for all the various stages. This is why Armstrong knew, to the second, how long he had to land the Eagle, before the mission would be aborted. It was pretty close on that first one.

       I don't even get what your argument is here - surely if the tests weren't done, there would be no tapes at all, not even copies. What is meaningful about not having the originals? It's not like they were literally on board the capsule, you know. (Also, it doesn't apply to any of the later landings, so it doesn't even apply to all of them.)

       It happened more around that time - odds are if they'd kept the tapes boxed up it'd have decayed and become useless since then, like what happened with other television. It's weird to think how primitive some kinds of technology were compared to others.

       In the above pictures of flags, let your eye follow from the flagpole to along the bottom edge of the flag. note how the edge bends slightly upward, then down, 
then gets rough/jagged near the the end.
      </p>
      <p>
       let your eye follow turn the corner and follow the vertical edge upward. note the triangle shaped "tit" sticking out. note that the edge smooths out at the 
4th red stripe from the top, then kicks outward a little at the very top.
      </p>
      <p>
       let your eye find the star closest to the center of the flag. note that star, along with 2 directly above it, are in a shadow. note that the shadow in both flags is 
identical, and covers the exact same stars in both pics. notice how the shadow continues onto the white strip below, with the same jagged contour.

       so, we now know that NASA is not showing all of the photos in this series. i wonder why that would be? something to hide? surely even a "bad" photo taken on the moon is worth something to someone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry if i find your explanation implausible. I don't think the shadows on the blue field on the flag would look the same taken from different sides of the flag at different times. never mind the fact that this flag is somehow "waving" in spite of no wind on the moon. yes, i see the horizontal part of the flagpole that supports the top of the flag. I'm talking about the rest of the flag, which should be hanging more or less straight down.

       They imparted movement into it when they set it up, unlike on earth things stay in motion for a lot longer.

       Oh for gods sake. We haven't been back and don't go back because of one simple reason. There's fuck all to do on the moon. It's entirely composed of elements found here on earth, due to it actually being a part of the earth. It's a dead rock in space, with far less gravity and no way for life to form. Frankly, I'm surprised we went as many times as we did. It costs more than the GDP of many, many nations to get to the moon, and currently there is absolutely no gain from going there, as the US learned anything worth learning on it's trips.

       Talking about fallacies...

       Yea, I know that quote. Only ever saw it on idiotic conspiracy websites. Funny thing is that those same people quoting it don't realize that it's almost a proof for the space program. Since von Braun's mixture of liquid oxygen and alcohol propellant, propellant's improved significantly achieving much better efficiency and higher density ratio...

       If you use a slingshot, you only give energy at the very start, you don't need to provide thrust the entire way to the target. If you fire a rocket, you only need enough thrust to get it on its way, it's not like it'll suddenly stop if you cut the engine. Newton, man.

       You're quibbling about scale now, which isn't really relevant. Slingshots obviously can't reach anywhere near orbital velocities, but that was not the point I was making.
      </p>
      <p>
       The time &amp; distance it takes to impart energy to the object (via slingshot or rocket engine) is far shorter than the actual distance travelled by the object. Ergo, you can travel a long distance without firing your engines the entire way!
      </p>
      <p>
       Indeed, if you launch something fast enough, gravity's unable to slow it down enough to keep it in orbit - escape velocity. It's never coming back. :)

       its not really a question of "how much" earth gravity affects the rocket.
      </p>
      <p>
       if a rocket is traveling at 25,000MPH opposite the direction of earth's gravity, and the rocket engines are cut, will rocket continue to travel at 25,000MPH or will rocket immediately begin to slow down?
      </p>
      <p>
       bear in mind the rocket will continue to increase its gravitational potential energy all the way to a lagrange point, which is well over half way to the moon.

       If you launched it straight up (and weren't going for an orbit) then at 25,000 mph or so, it would keep going up, asymptotically losing speed until it almost stops (barring other gravitational fields.) If it's lower than the escape velocity it falls back, if it's faster then it'll just keep moving away. I don't think it's actually feasible to do this perfectly - gravitational effects would turn a straight shot into an eccentric orbit and unless one part of it dips into the atmosphere, that orbit could remain for a long, long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       In reality, of course, you don't generally launch straight shots - you use orbital mechanics to get from place to place more efficiently. You could use 25000 mph to orbit at the very edge of the Earth-Moon system, about three times as far away as the Moon is.

       3) Considering Law of Conservation of Energy, where would you expect rocket obtain energy required to increase the gravitational potential energy of the rocket?
      </p>
      <p>
       A) fuel
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Would you expect to need to continuously use fuel in exchange for continuously increased gravitational potential energy of rocket all the way to Lagrange Point?
      </p>
      <p>
       A) yes
      </p>
      <p>
       5) If the rocket orbited the Earth before heading up toward the moon, would you expect the distance traveled, and therefore fuel required, to increase?
      </p>
      <p>
       A) yes
      </p>
      <p>
       16) If rocket is traveling at 25,000 MPH, how far will rocket travel in 3 hours?
      </p>
      <p>
       A) 75,000 miles
      </p>
      <p>
       see the problem here? even after 3 hours of traveling at 25,000MPH, the rocket still wouldn't be half way to the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       if the rocket didn't maintain speed, they would not even travel that far
      </p>
      <p>
       of the rocket did maintain speed, they would quickly run out of fuel.

       The 25000MPH figure is from the surface of earth. If I were on an idealized uniform mass version of earth with no atmosphere, and I were accelerated to 25000MPH away from the center, I would achieve escape velocity. As I travelled "up," the force of the earth's gravity on my body would provide a negative acceleration, slowing me down. I would continue to slow down indefinitely, but I would slow down less and less as the earth's gravity had less and less effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually, the force of the earth's gravity would be negligible. If my initial velocity were slightly less than escape velocity, I would eventually stop moving, and then start accelerating back toward earth. If it were slightly more, I would continue moving at roughly the magnitude of the velocity greater than escape velocity. If I were exactly at escape velocity, my velocity would continue to decrease as I approached infinite distance from the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I already start at a point above sea level, such as the Saturn V after it's left the atmosphere, the escape velocity is much smaller. You can basically plug your distance from the center of the earth into
       <a href="/u/Roarian">
        /u/Roarian

       's equation to find your new escape velocity from that point.

       If you're talking about orbital mechanics and rockets propelling probes outside of earth's gravitational well, then yes, it's been repeated multiple times, as I've told you in other comments. If you're talking about specifically landing a man on the moon again, then yeah sure, that's never been done since Apollo. This isn't strict science, though it is based on science, it's engineering.

       <p>
        For an object of mass the energy required to escape the Earth's gravitational field is GMm / r, a function of the object's mass (where r is the radius of the Earth, G is the gravitational constant, and M is the mass of the Earth, M=5.9736×1024 kg).

      <p>
       The atmosphere of the Earth contributes significantly to the energy required to leave Earth. The moon has no such atmosphere. The return vehicle is also very much less massive than the Saturn V rocket.

       let me draw your attention to the corner of the blue field closest to the center of the flag. notice how the shadow covers up the same number of stars?
      </p>
      <p>
       also note the sharp pointy thing on edge of the flag farthest away from the flag pole.

       well you see, its highly unlikely that the exact same shadow would appear on two different flags on two different days.
      </p>
      <p>
       what is more likely is that there is one image, and that image was flipped and used more than once.

       Once in space, the answer is indeed gravity. That obstacle, however, is much less challenging than the initial one of drag.

       yes, accounting for drag makes the apollo moon landing even more absurd. i deliberately left it out so as to focus strictly on gravity, which will be always be working against the rocket regardless of drag.

       You don't have to directly fight gravity to get to the moon. Rockets don't travel on a straight path to the moon. They launch to orbit, which is a circular path around the earth. Getting to orbit is the hard part, as drag from the atmosphere is pretty severe. It takes significantly less thrust to alter the shape of your orbit. Once the shape of your orbit is changed so that you enter the sphere of influence of the moon's gravity, you can fire engines and slow down to begin orbiting the moon.

       1) Considering the gravity of Earth, in which relative direction would you say the Moon is to Earth? Up, Down, or Neither (Flat) ?

       A) Up

       now, you might claim that the path taken by a rocket was not 90 degrees straight up, which would make the path more like an inclined plane. however, taking the path of an inclined plane means they would have to travel farther than a straight line distance of 200,000 miles, which has already been shown to be an absurd claim.

       A) yes

       in other words, you can't apply basic math and science, because your brain doesn't like the answers, which are incongruent with what it perceives as reality, and this creates cognitive dissonance.

       It's got rockets and rocket fuel and it's in a freaking vacuum. Hell yes, it's gonna run the pants off anything that travels in an atmosphere with no issues whatsoever. That's the neat thing about space - you don't need aerodynamics because there's no air. You don't need jet engines because you've got hypergolic fueled rocket engines to give it a big ol' kick in the rear!

       4) Would you expect to need to continuously use fuel in exchange for continuously increased gravitational potential energy of rocket all the way to Lagrange Point?
      </p>
      <p>
       A) yes
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       No.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you fired the engines all the way up there you'd be going too fast and overshoot the moon. Plus you'd run out of fuel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read the Apollo 11 flight plan and you'll see they made multiple burns lasting between a few seconds to up to 11 minutes. All added up it it's about half an hour of total burn time.

       Get a trolley, strap on a rocket.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fire the rocket for a few seconds to get the trolley moving, once the trolley starts climbing the hill, fire the rocket again for a few seconds to give it the boost needed to climb the hill.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's basically it. No need for constant acceleration the whole way if you just boost the shit out of it.

       Generally if you're in orbit, it's not really an 'uphill' climb anymore - you're on a level road. Short of something pushing against your forward momentum (like an atmosphere) you can merrily stay there for a long time. Hence satellites who only need minor tweaking to stay around for decades.

       In actual space, you don't have to keep your engine running to keep going, the 'always on' idea is only the case in Tintin-like depictions. The concept of basically running your engine until you hit the midpoint is an old-fashioned concept at best, the better part of a century out of date.

       Anyway, it should be pretty obvious that gaining an understanding the basic physics of how to reach objects in space and the cost of actually building a vehicle capable of carrying out such a journey are vastly different in scope.

       Kinda like how reading up on supersonic flight, lift and drag is very easy, but building an aircraft which can take advantage of it is not!

       Going to the moon became mundane by Apollo 17, the public wasn't as nearly as excited as Apollo 11. Plus at that point the US had "won" the space race. There is no need to go back to the moon unless we're going to start mining it for resources. How hard is this to understand?

       We say it's "easy" because NASA proved it's possible to go multiple times without catastrophic failure / loss of life. That is considered "easy" as far as space travel goes, especially with dated technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're not excuses, they're facts. The Soviet Union abandoned going to the moon because a) it was/still is absurdly expensive and b) it was
       <em>
        already done
       </em>
       by the US at that point.

       And BTW, China and Russia both have plans to put men on the moon. I can't wait to see the reactions from conspiracy nuts when China/Russia posts 4k HD live streaming on youtube.

       4 is no - you don't need to continuously use fuel.

       5 is no - orbiting doesn't cost you fuel, since you are not changing your velocity. (Leaving aside orbital perturbation, but that would hardly be relevant on anything but a long timescale.)

       A, you don't need to continuously use fuel - you just need to use it for a brief while, and you will easily travel the rest of the way without further propulsion. That's how actual rockets work, anyway. You'll slow down, sure, but unless you messed up your calculations you'll arrive precisely where you meant to.
      </p>
      <p>
       B) Your question was if the rocket
       <em>
        orbited

       the Earth before heading towards the moon, would you expect fuel to increase? The answer to that is no. Did you forget what you yourself said?

       , a decade before Apollo in fact. A manned mission with a return trip is more or less the same, only because you need to also send humans (and food, oxygen, etc.) and enough fuel for the return trip, you just need
       <em>

       more fuel to send that payload to the moon.

       If you're asking why no one has sent a manned mission since Apollo, I'd ask why? What scientific benefit is there to do it again? If you're not actually trying to start a colony on the moon, it doesn't make a lot of sense to spend the extra money, as well as risk the lives of humans, to do something robots can do just as easily with less payload.

       A) Up
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       A) gravity
      </p>

      <p>
       A) no
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       A) no
      </p>
      <p>
       22) Considering the Moon itself cannot "escape gravity" of Earth, would it be plausible for a rocket to "escape gravity" anywhere between Earth and Moon?

       A) no
      </p>
      <p>

       if its so easy, why hasn't anyone been able to replicate it? please don't say NASA replicated it, because i will simply ask "if Dr Wakefield replicated his own science 7 times, would be any more valid?"

       The difference between a manned and unmanned probe is mostly scale, since you don't have to lug around life support for the latter. This whole line of reasoning was about reaching escaping the Earth's gravity, so robotic missions certainly count!

       The Earth's gravity exists in all directions though, so by necessity it's simultaneously 'up' from one side of the Earth and 'down' from the other, and everything in between, even if we took down to be the center of the Earth. Not sure what relevance this has...?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are in an orbit, say 1000 kilometers above the Earth, then you will remain there - it's stable. Unless some outside force acts on you (aka not the Earth's gravity) then you will remain in that 1000 kilometer orbit for a very, very long time - forever, if earth's gravity was perfectly even. The reason why satellites have some fuel on board (though not much) is to counteract some of the smaller perturbations that happen because of other sources of gravity like the Moon or unevenness of the Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same thing holds for 2000 km, and 5000, and 384000. If you go fast enough you can visit all of these without worrying that you're mysteriously and suddenly going to be yanked back by gravity - that force is what even allows this to begin with. The further away you go, the less effect the Earth's gravity will have - until eventually you escape altogether.

       That's like saying which is a bigger number, 1 or 0?

      <p>
       Doesn't mean 1 is a big number.
      </p>
      <p>
       In space there's no drag, so you can reach some pretty incredible speeds. So imagine a rocket boosts up to an arbitrary number of 1,000 'units' of speed, or velocity if you want to use proper words, but this is an ELI5.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gravity from Earth will cause the escaping rockets speed to tick down to 999, 998, 997 etc. Counting down slower and slower the further the rocket gets away.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if the rocket only needs to be going 500 units of speed to eventually reach the moon at the end of this 3 day trip, why would the rocket have needed to be accelerating the whole way?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just boost to a high enough speed to compensate for the slowdown from Earths gravity.

      <p>
       because the rocket will be increasing its gravitational potential energy all the way from earth to a lagrange point, and this continuously increasing potential energy must come from continuously consuming fuel. even if you reached 25,000 MPH you still won't coast uphill for another 100,000 miles.

       But the whole way the gravitational influence of the Earth becomes less and less.
      </p>
      <p>
       So from launch to getting to the moon, it'd be a hill that quickly becomes a near-perfectly flat road the moment you escape the atmosphere. Remove drag and you can coast for quite a long way.

       what does "atmosphere" have to do with gravity and the inverse square law?
      </p>
      <p>
       20) Considering Inverse Square Law, is there any place between Earth and Moon where rocket is not affected by gravity of both the Earth and Moon?
      </p>
      <p>
       A) no
      </p>
      <p>
       21) Considering Inverse Square Law and bullet experiment, is is possible to "escape gravity" anywhere between the Earth and Moon, regardless of speed of rocket?
      </p>
      <p>
       A) no
      </p>
      <p>
       22) Considering the Moon itself cannot "escape gravity" of Earth, would it be plausible for a rocket to "escape gravity" anywhere between Earth and Moon?
      </p>
      <p>
       A) no
      </p>
      <p>
       23) If the Moon is Up relative to Earth, is there always a gravitational "slope" of greater than zero as rocket approaches Lagrange Point?

      <p>
       A) yes

       are you familiar with boolean algebra? basically if only ONE condition in a string is false, the entire string is false, for example:
      </p>

       1+1+1+1+1+1+0=0

       You are pitting this bunch of nonsense and conjecture against hard science, against thousands (if not hundreds of thousands) of peer-reviewed, evidence-based scientific explanations that got us to the moon and got us all other various benefits of space travel?

       You should at least try to understand the concept of scientific method before trying to play a scientist

       isn't replication part of the scientific method? who else besides NASA has claimed to put men on the moon?

      <p>
       and about that "peer review". its not as rock solid as you seem to believe.

       OP, you have a physics fail. You don't understand how a rocket trades kinetic energy for potential energy as it travels through a gravity field.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at it this way: at the L1 point, gravity is balanced between the moon and Earth. If a rocket starts at this point and falls to Earth, it will accelerate to achieve a certain velocity by the time it reaches Earth.  Conversely, if the rocket starts with this velocity from Earth, it will coast all the way to L1. Any velocity greater, and the rocket will coast past L1 and accelerate as it gets closer to the moon. This is the point you don't get.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit for clarification.

       presumably its easier to try and silence someone than it is to debate, because the debate certainly wasn't going their way, and it never will. so i invited a few people onto this thread to continue the discussion of the evidence for and against the Apollo manned missions to the Moon.

       "OP obviously doesn't understand orbital mechanics"
      </p>
      <p>
       "why didn't those ever-vigilant Russians alert me to this fraud?"
      </p>
      <p>
       "what about the moon rocks?"
      </p>
      <p>
       "what about the reflector on the moon?"
      </p>
      <p>
       "where do you think the rocket was going?"
      </p>
      <p>
       "nobody can replicate because reasons"

       In the above pictures of flags, let your eye follow from the flagpole to along the bottom edge of the flag. note how the edge bends slightly upward, then down, 
then gets rough/jagged near the the end.
      </p>
      <p>
       let your eye follow turn the corner and follow the vertical edge upward. note the triangle shaped "tit" sticking out. note that the edge smooths out at the 
4th red stripe from the top, then kicks outward a little at the very top.
      </p>
      <p>
       let your eye find the star closest to the center of the flag. note that star, along with 2 directly above it, are in a shadow. note that the shadow in both flags is 
identical, and covers the exact same stars in both pics. notice how the shadow continues onto the white strip below, with the same jagged contour.

       can you name one example of the so called "science" experiments that were conducted ON THE MOON being replicated ON THE MOON by a non NASA person or organization?
      </p>
      <p>
       when your science can't be replicated, we call it "pseudo science"
      </p>
      <p>
       12 years of free education and 99% of the people out there can't explain what the scientific method is or how it should be applied to NASA experiments

       Very close to "yes":

       They placed a reflective surface on the moon when they landed. Now using lasers they're able to measure the rate at which the moon is moving away from the earth. NASA isn't the only organization able to verify this claim.

       if you really understood science, would you still believe that men walked on the moon, 
and that vaccines are safe, effective, and necessary?
      </p>
      <p>
       lets face it. you will never go to the moon, and you will never meet anyone who will go to the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       its really not that hard to figure out, but you were brainwashed at such a young age that this absurd bullshit got programmed into your mind before you developed any critical thinking skills. kinda like how some people believed in santa claus.
      </p>
      <p>
       now that you are an adult, you can go back and revisit these absurd ideas and apply critical thinking skills.
      </p>
      <p>
       for example, if we ask why nobody from Russia, China, England, or France has ever walked on the moon, one simple answer may be that Russia, China, England,and France do not have the technology to go to the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       and thats the exact same reason that nobody from USA has ever walked on the moon.

       Get a trolley, strap on a rocket.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fire the rocket for a few seconds to get the trolley moving, once the trolley starts climbing the hill, fire the rocket again for a few seconds to give it the boost needed to climb the hill.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's basically it. No need for constant acceleration the whole way if you just boost the shit out of it.

       Also things in space tend to go along their merry way quite easily.

       But the whole way the gravitational influence of the Earth becomes less and less.
      </p>
      <p>
       So from launch to getting to the moon, it'd be a hill that quickly becomes a near-perfectly flat road the moment you escape the atmosphere. Remove drag and you can coast for quite a long way.

       can you show us on this lunar lander where this alleged fuel cell is supposed to fit? also, where is the large amount of fuel needed to launch this lander and intercept an orbiter?

       You're initial comment above was regarding "escaping the gravity of the earth". You seem to be focused on such a profound misunderstanding of the term I had to point it out that it is possible, and has been done many times. You're just trying to distort the argument yet again.
