       Is it the look, the notion that we run everything? You guys are really pathetic and don't like a group of people because your friends are telling you not to. What did Joseph Gordon levitt, jake gylenhaal, Natalie portman, Rachel weisz, mila kunis, lizzy kaplan, Jay baruchel, Jason shwartzman,etc. Do to you besides potentially having you guys masturbate to them? I love how Jennifer Lawrenceville is only somewhat popular again because of her obvious ties with anti semitism. It's sad really, you never actually win.

       Maybe it's not "everybody hates jews".
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe people are actually repulsed by the actions of certain "jewish" leaders...and then certain "jewish" people claim that repulsion as an attack on all jewry.

       We know that JIDF types like to pose as "nazis" and "radical Muslims" and spread the same "anti-semitism" they like to complain about so much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember Joshua Goldberg, the "white supremacist" and "neo-nazi" that was actually a Zionist Jew being given publicity by Rita Katz of SITE Intelligence?
      </p>
      <p>
       He's not the only one:

      <p>
       "The Double Identity of an "Anti-Semitic" Commenter: Smearing a Progressive Website to Support Israel"

        http://commondreams.org/hambaconeggs
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, most famous "neo-Nazis" in America have actually been Jews dressing up in costumes - and they were all given publicity by the $PLC and ADL.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, just read the comments on this thread.

       It's pretty obvious.

       This is bullshit because I feel like most Jews have become ashamed of their ethnoreligoius background especially if they aren't orthodox or religoous , such as myself. I agree, right now Jews should ban together and live happily the way we want but from what I see they are still trying to be seen as equals by the people who were once our friends but turning against us. Also, I feel like Jewish men are against Jewish women which causes a rift in the system

       I think people dislike Zionists, that is those who support the expansion of the state of Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only half of Jews are Zionists.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's not really about Jews, it's about the powerful abusing their power, and many of them just happen to be Zionist.

       You're being brainwashed. Jews have been targeted socially since before we were born and this is a very blatant thing if you really start observing literally any messages in mainstream tv. Look at the "Eugenes Bike" episode in hey Arnold if you don't believe me. It's really sad how heartless people are.

       I don't want to try and argue with people who are either blind or refused to admit reality. Zionism is directly related to Judaism and jews, so the answer is yes. No one is going to openly admit on TV that they want to eradicate a race of people, that is illegal, however, the implications are very blatant and all lead to the same conclusion. The signs are there if you choose to look. All movies in 2016 have have a central message revolving around aliens and fallen angels, returning home and Jews not being cool enough or good enough to maintain respectful and mutual relationships. Emphasis on the word YOU is growing aka jew and if you watch the new Toby McGuire movie trailer where he is a chess player, they emphasize that he is Jewish and want him gone. The messages are clear and since most people unanimously agree that the zionists and Jews are to blame for the world's short comings, it leads me to belive that most people will have no problem hunting Jews down when the time comes.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Your sarcasm aside, it's not "the Jews" being the "reason for any given world problem". It's the fact that in America 2015, we can critique all aspects of the power structure
       <em>
        except
       </em>
       for the ones that are labeled "Jewish". It's the fault of a dysfunctional culture that's unable to be honest about all the members of the culture.  Few people bat an eye when we hear about extremist Christians and Muslims and their agendas in the news. Rarely are Americans informed of the agendas of extremist Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example: The
       <a href="http://rightweb.irc-online.org/profile/Jewish_Institute_for_National_Security_Affairs">
        Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs
       </a>
       is an extremist group that passes as a "think tank". It's a militaristic, corrupt, incestuous group that seems to do no good in this world yet it still has a place in DC. If it was called the Catholic Institute for National Security Affairs and was always stumping for the Vatican, I'd like to think someone would at least raise the issue of separation of religion and state. But in cases like this, namecalling and snark replaces honest appraisal of the unhealthy mixing of religious beliefs and government policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or we could just continue to engage in dysfunctional behavior and keep doing what we're doing.

       Sarcasm? You're not funny, guess you have to be Jewish to have a decent sense of humor tho, right? Ur a shitHEAD in my shitpost in this shitworld. If you are going to make derogatory statements and then back it up with "it's sarcasm" than I seriously think you should go back to middle school brah. Seriously, stick to your guns. It's sad to see the sociopaths emerging at shockingly high volumes. But when does sociopath turn into psycho?

       Because they are taught that they are superior to non-jews / many don't get the "all men are created equal" thing. Honest, intelligent and ethical people do not have to be identified as a member of any group ( be it ethnic, religious, academic, etc..) to feel legitimate. It's the old US ( god's chosen people ) against THEM ( gentiles ) gang mentality that wears on people causing resentment. Geez, do a little open minded research to answer your own question. Plus orthodox rabbis performing felatio on baby boys, as well as the disgusting things written in the torah doesn't help their case.

       OK don't bring rabbi pedophilia into this considering that priests have been known to molesting little, ehem, LITTLE protestant boys. So because you guys are lied to and told you are superior by a collective of other in securely ego driven maniacs you automatically believe it's true? Sure, some Jews are kinda wacky but there are plenty ugly as fuck wasps as well. Just like there are sexy Jews and sexy people from all walks of life. I'm sorry but I am not going to feel inferior just because of my ethnicity and culture. If you're ugly you are ugly but you can't blame ur race for that,since there are soo many ugly whites and defintely ugly people of other Christian worshipping races. I get it, you have been lied to to give yourself a sense of pride and dominance in this shifty world but please don't think that there aren't flaws in your people that isn't being exposed by the illumimati. I literally have no envy for non Jews other than the fact that everyone hates jews. In terms of success and appearwnce, I think it all varies and the illumimati is pushing a sad agenda. When I see Natalie Portman being treated like borderline trash for being a jew, that's when I laugh and say "OK I don't give a fuck anymore about this bigotry", I'm just glad that I have the mental freedom to accept what is going on in the world. I don't need to be seen as superior by a bunch of people who only know how to come together if it means having a common enemy. I grew up believing in unity, and thinking that this was gods way but nope.. apparently everyone's destined to act like a hypocritical ads hole snd it somehow makes me feel better aboutnmyself.

       You actually seem to be the hateful and racist one here.  There's actually way too many numerous reason to list why the people who dislike jews feel that way.  I think what it boils down to is that jews tend to be very clanish and racist towards outsiders and non jews.  Up until the last fifty years or so, jews were very insular and did not try to assimilate into the countries that they lived in.  This makes people wary and distrustful of them.  They spoke their own language, dressed in their own odd clothes, and engaged in unique and odd customs.  They in turn were very distrusting towards non jews did everything they could to keep them out of their society.  They also have a history of pushing their politics and customs on their adopted countries.  The germans had big issues with the jews after wwi because they felt they were responsible for backstabbing them to end the war when it was looking like it would end in a stalemate.  Which is actually not that far off from the truth.  Most jews were communists bin Germany and central Europe and this was another reason why people disliked and didn't trust them.  The wealth they had was another thing that made people hate them and they disliked that the social programs and charities that these wealthy jews had were only geared towards jews and not gentiles.
       <br/>
       So there are a lot of reasons why historically jews were not trusted and were disliked.  A lot of it is on the jews too because of their refusal to integrate and assimilate as well as their own racism.  Jews call themselves the chosen people and they look down on the goyim.  They engaged in communist revolutionary acts which angered a lot of people.  This just added to historical hatred and culminated in the holocaust and other anti Jewish acts. 
Today there is still hatred because of the horrible things Israel has done and continues to do as well as the fact that jews are very powerful in banking and media.  People also hate that they can't speak out against them without being instantly called a racist and anti semite.  Jews seem to have the thinnest skin in the world and attack people at the drop of a hat, meanwhile being some of the most racist and bigoted people out there.
       <br/>
       I for one don't hate or dislike any race or group of people, other than the damn Danes, they can all burn in hell, and I prefer to judge people on an individual level and person by person.  I do dislike what Israel has done and continues to do but that doesn't mean I dislike jews as I believe they are two very different and separate things.  I think that if the jews want to be accepted more ans disliked and hated less, they need to be more open to criticism, be less clannish, and be less outspoken on their mistreatment of the past.

       Haha, okay Mr. Rogers. Sorry, I call it as I see it. I'm not a proud jew but I would rather be a conscious jew than a hypocrite anyday. Love how Jews are seen as deceptive yet we know that the whites deceived every race known to man prior to slaughtering them and taking their land/ taking them from their land.

       As you can see, a self-described "Jew" is engaging in racist bigotry against European people - the same self-described "Jew" that complains about "anti-semitism."

       Right. Your argument is shit. Jews never enslaved Europeans and tried to eradicate them, though. I am not against Europeans on an individual level at all. If a white person is nice to me even after knowing I'm a Jew than I will have no animosity towards them but unfortunatrly, like you, most PEOPLE of all races start treating me like shut after finding out I'm Jewish which automatically leads me into hating all of you lmao

       But no one is against white people, no one is targeting white people or implying their persecution. White people run the media, contrary to the belief that Jews do. That is why there is so much nazi like propiganda, most talk show hosts are white Anglo saxons and they are pretty clear about their intensions. Yes, this thread is about Jews but everything is being perpetuates by white people so you have to do the math LOL. You can't just be so focused on one aspect of the topic that you refuse to dig deeper into the situation. People are blaming Jews for things that have been openly done by Christian whites time and time again. Literally the only reason any other race practices Christianity is due to imperialism and years of conditioning. Isn't it obvious that the white people and illuminati have had a clear cut plan for world domination? Jews already had a set religion and movement t and that's why whites wanted then gone.

       Some jews are white. European Ashkenazi Jews are heavily mixed with white and have Jewish ancestry, while mizrahi and sephardi jewish populations tend to be less diluted and are generally brown skinned peoples. Both are jews but since jewish is sucha  diverse ethnoreligious group there exists white jews, black jews, middle eastern brown jews, even east asian jews.

       Has anyone noticed that the argument defending Muslims from criticism is the same argument used to defend Jews from criticism?
      </p>
      <p>
       Muslims say, "You can't persecute all Muslims for the actions of a few." Yet we all know that all the terrorism in the West over the past few decades (with a handful of minor exceptions) has been radical Islamic terrorism. Islam preaches terrorism. Those who accept the teachings of Mohammed accept the teachings that non-Muslims must be converted by force. That's what Mohammed did -- he forced people to join his nutty new religion by threatening to cut off their heads. So we all know that we must target Muslims, because Islam is the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of Jews, we all know that Jews as a tribe have been incredibly destructive of human life over the past century or so. Jews were wholly responsible for the Russian revolution, and for all the millions who died as a result. Jews were responsible for World War 2. They connived to get the world enbroiled in war because of the way the Nazis were treating Jews in Germany. No, I'm not talking about "The Holocaust", I'm taking about Hitler taking crooked and corrupt Jews out of positions of power in Germany so that they could be filled by true Germans. As a result of Hitler's actions, the German economy revived so quickly it was looked upon as a miracle. A direct result of removing Jew leeches from power in Germany. The Jews hated Hitler and the Nazis for doing this, and forced the world into war to overthrow the Third Reich.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, we can blame all Jews, collectively, as a pernicious alien influence in Western culture, for many (perhaps the majority) of problems we have today. I've only scratched the surface of Jew crimes against humanity.

       You are truly a pathetic human being who has been brainwashed by the media and your pathetic kkk friends. Seriously, why the fuck would you even care about what Jews did in the past (which is a lie, btw) are you in a bad position now? You're just a fat loser on reddit spewing bigotry so why the fuck do you have a personal recollection or vendetta on what has happened in history. You don't like Jews because other people don't like Jews. Plain and simple like you and your mom. Look you piece of white shit, you're a sheeple. That's it. You'd probably be an asset to a hot chick if you knew she was jewieh. That's how sad you are. Why the fuck do you care who started any war? Why aren't you against the western white imperialists who have enslaved many races for years just to keep them as uncle Toms now? Why just blame the Jews for one war? Are you russian? You just don't like Jews cause you're a cowardly ignorant mess like everyone else. There are are few people that I understand should dislike Jews and that is Muslims and germans. Everyone else on this band wagon is pathetic.

       You should learn some history before you go plowing into these threads. Here's a little from that well-known anti-semitic source, ynet.com:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3342999,00.html">
         Stalin's Jews
        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        And us, the Jews? An Israeli student finishes high school without ever hearing the name "Genrikh Yagoda," the greatest Jewish murderer of the 20th Century, the GPU's deputy commander and the founder and commander of the NKVD. Yagoda diligently implemented Stalin's collectivization orders and is responsible for the deaths of at least 10 million people. His Jewish deputies established and managed the Gulag system. After Stalin no longer viewed him favorably, Yagoda was demoted and executed, and was replaced as chief hangman in 1936 by Yezhov, the "bloodthirsty dwarf."

       Excuse me. I am  muslim and arab, and I have many jewish friends and so did my parents(they had sephardi jewish friends as we are from north africa). I dont hate jews and i consider them to be people of the book(meaning believers). Also, i only know one or two muslim who dislikes jews, and he is an idiot and the other muslims who know him say he is an idiot too. We are nice people, i hope our communities can come together and end this hate.

       Sarcasm? You're not funny, guess you have to be Jewish to have a decent sense of humor tho, right? Ur a shitHEAD in my shitpost in this shitworld. If you are going to make derogatory statements and then back it up with "it's sarcasm" than I seriously think you should go back to middle school brah. Seriously, stick to your guns. It's sad to see the sociopaths emerging at shockingly high volumes. But when does sociopath turn into psycho?

      <p>
       Your sarcasm aside, it's not "the Jews" being the "reason for any given world problem". It's the fact that in America 2015, we can critique all aspects of the power structure
       <em>
        except
       </em>
       for the ones that are labeled "Jewish". It's the fault of a dysfunctional culture that's unable to be honest about all the members of the culture.  Few people bat an eye when we hear about extremist Christians and Muslims and their agendas in the news. Rarely are Americans informed of the agendas of extremist Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example: The
       <a href="http://rightweb.irc-online.org/profile/Jewish_Institute_for_National_Security_Affairs">
        Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs
       </a>
       is an extremist group that passes as a "think tank". It's a militaristic, corrupt, incestuous group that seems to do no good in this world yet it still has a place in DC. If it was called the Catholic Institute for National Security Affairs and was always stumping for the Vatican, I'd like to think someone would at least raise the issue of separation of religion and state. But in cases like this, namecalling and snark replaces honest appraisal of the unhealthy mixing of religious beliefs and government policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or we could just continue to engage in dysfunctional behavior and keep doing what we're doing.

       I'm not religious, so don't expect me to defend protestant, catholic, or christian pedophilia . I was just offering some thoughts in response to your question. Congrats on your mental freedom, but I think Natalie Portman can take care of herself. Cheers.

       You actually seem to be the hateful and racist one here.  There's actually way too many numerous reason to list why the people who dislike jews feel that way.  I think what it boils down to is that jews tend to be very clanish and racist towards outsiders and non jews.  Up until the last fifty years or so, jews were very insular and did not try to assimilate into the countries that they lived in.  This makes people wary and distrustful of them.  They spoke their own language, dressed in their own odd clothes, and engaged in unique and odd customs.  They in turn were very distrusting towards non jews did everything they could to keep them out of their society.  They also have a history of pushing their politics and customs on their adopted countries.  The germans had big issues with the jews after wwi because they felt they were responsible for backstabbing them to end the war when it was looking like it would end in a stalemate.  Which is actually not that far off from the truth.  Most jews were communists bin Germany and central Europe and this was another reason why people disliked and didn't trust them.  The wealth they had was another thing that made people hate them and they disliked that the social programs and charities that these wealthy jews had were only geared towards jews and not gentiles.
       <br/>
       So there are a lot of reasons why historically jews were not trusted and were disliked.  A lot of it is on the jews too because of their refusal to integrate and assimilate as well as their own racism.  Jews call themselves the chosen people and they look down on the goyim.  They engaged in communist revolutionary acts which angered a lot of people.  This just added to historical hatred and culminated in the holocaust and other anti Jewish acts. 
Today there is still hatred because of the horrible things Israel has done and continues to do as well as the fact that jews are very powerful in banking and media.  People also hate that they can't speak out against them without being instantly called a racist and anti semite.  Jews seem to have the thinnest skin in the world and attack people at the drop of a hat, meanwhile being some of the most racist and bigoted people out there.
       <br/>
       I for one don't hate or dislike any race or group of people, other than the damn Danes, they can all burn in hell, and I prefer to judge people on an individual level and person by person.  I do dislike what Israel has done and continues to do but that doesn't mean I dislike jews as I believe they are two very different and separate things.  I think that if the jews want to be accepted more ans disliked and hated less, they need to be more open to criticism, be less clannish, and be less outspoken on their mistreatment of the past.
