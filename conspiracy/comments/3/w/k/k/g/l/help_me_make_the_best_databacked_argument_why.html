       Hi guys, first time posting here. Let me know if I am doing something wrong. So, I am into conspiracies. I will admit that I am initially very open-minded, and even interested in ideas that seem crack-pot-ish. I like when some of them turn out to be true, but obviously false information and arguments must die. Regardless of how you came to this sub, we are a minority. Most people's reaction to a suggestion that powerful interests may be conspiring to screw someone because of incentives to do so are frequently met with strong skepticism at best, personal attacks at the worst.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I posted this link:
       <a href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2014/06/20/complete-history-monsanto-worlds-evil-corporation/">
        http://www.wakingtimes.com/2014/06/20/complete-history-monsanto-worlds-evil-corporation/
       </a>
       on a different sub (please remember Reddit's rules for following into a different sub)
      </p>
      <p>
       and got this challenge:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This and similar articles have been recycling these false claims for years. It is a menu of the 1000x debunked claims by anti-GMO / anti-science activists.
        <strong>
         Just pick what you think is the best one and we will examine it.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I want to be prepared. I want to know my stuff before a debate. I have been not careful / wrong before, and even though "fallacy fallacy" (failure to argue well is not the same as being wrong) is technically a fallacy (lol), first impressions matter quite a bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me personally it seems pretty obvious that Monsanto would pollute food, soil and science for its own gain. I would like to have water-tight verifiable data, facts that I can use to convince others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could you help? Thanks.

       Starting with your personal feelings then trying backfill with supporting evidence is the wrong approach. Rather you should examine all the evidence with an open mind, and let that guide you to the truth. The "water-tight " evidence will become apparent.

       Would not that be nice? That is not how a human mind works.

      <p>
       Everybody is biased. I am just more open about it. I have a preference for non-mainstream ideas. Others are in reverse. I believe that it is better to be safe than sorry (it is darn difficult to demonstrate that something is "safe"). Several countries banned GMOs. Monsanto's past is apparently (if that article is to be trusted) very murky.

       Not all issues are black and white. There are different degrees of belief associated with different hypothesis. When the rules of the debate and the scientific methods are followed, the truth will eventually come out. Informed and thorough fanatics on either side could actually be helpful in trying to test / break / defend a theory.

       Please provide a source. The EU has restricted imports and exports of products of biotechnology, but I'm quite sure that only Kenya and Ecuador have outright banned GE cultivars. Other countries (eg. Iraq) have not

       Probably late to the shindig but, I'd say to: Make sure you have a very clear main argument, like a thesis, that puts all of your arguments into one nutshell. Refer to this nutshell a lot. Make your own original arguments, but use the other sources, data, info, etc. as evidence to back you up. Don't rely on the evidence to build your claims or argue for you, let the evidence be your support. Like others are saying, relying only on personal feelings is ill-advised. If anything, use the feely-feels along with all three: logos, pathos, ethos. Make claims that appeal to logic, claims that appeal to feelings, and claims that appeal to your or the evidence's credibility. Always consider the opposing viewpoints. That is probably most important. Be so well-versed in the opposition that you can easily shoot-down those viewpoints before they have enough time to simmer. Good luck :)

       So, convincing others doesn't really work. 
Show them the light and let them go.
They allow no independent studies using their copyrighted seed and all studies are funded by them. 
They might be safe or not.
Without independent peer reviewed science that can be be replicated, I have no cause to believe they are. 
Also the chemicals they need to grow has been proven to create bigger stronger weeds, so, 
I guess if you trust that gmo food producers wouldn't be as corrupt as corporations say like Enron were, well, that would be where choice comes in.
The fact that they are so strongly against labeling their fine products, instead of insisting due to their foods obvious benefits tells me they want to keep us from knowing what we are eating and how it is grown.

       Anyone citing Monsanto.com and GMOAnswers.com (Ketchum, Monsanto's PR firm) is not going to be taken seriously. My suggestion: team up with the fools at

       The recent IARC conclusion that deems glyphosate a 2A carcinogen was done by looking at independent studies only. The EFSA looked at private Monsanto studies to come to their conclusion, which IARC does not have access to. Silly. Bullshit.

       OP said Monsanto doesn't allow independent studies using their patented seeds. I'm just pointing out that Monsanto says they do. That link makes no claims about GMO's safety. All it says is "we allow other to study our seeds".

       We've only been using GMOs for about 20-25 years. That's less than a generation. Hence, little is known about the long term effects on humans.

       Can you specifically show me the parts of my post that they "disagree" with, because you're just posting fucking nonsense. Your first extract in fact confirms that what I just said is correct. We have been using GM for less than a generation and therefore we haven't been physically able to research its effects over the course of even one lifetime.

        I retired 10 years ago after a long career as a research scientist for Agriculture Canada. When I was on the payroll, I was the designated scientist of my institute to address public groups and reassure them that genetically engineered crops and foods were safe. There is, however, a growing body of scientific research – done mostly in Europe, Russia, and other countries – showing that diets containing engineered corn or soya cause serious health problems in laboratory mice and rats.

       Let's ignore the fact that I've posted dozens of quotes from massive scientific agencies. Okay.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suggest you look into what Dr. Vrain has to say. He cites Seralini - who, if you're unfamiliar with the infamous story, is a fraud and has had his research retracted. Seralini forces journalists to sign contracts preventing them from speaking to other scientists; Seralini fraudulently manipulates data; he ignores regulatory standards; and he's funded by organic firms (via CRIIGEN/ENSSER). Seralini writes books on anti-GMO rhetoric, he is the definition of anti-science woo. Vrain cites other anti-science quacks like Rowett and Seneff (who believes vaccines cause autism); he rejects the mainstream papers and instead supports papers that have been dismissed by the academic community as deeply flawed.

       <strong>
        Literally every single study Dr. Vrain cites is bunk.

       This statement is a total contradiction of itself. If non-GMO crops "have not been studied as thoroughly" then you cannot reasonably say they carry the same risk. Why are you contradicting yourself so openly?

       What you are ignoring is that the Russian and European scientists do not agree with your "scientific statements". And, since I began by merely pointing out that not enough research has yet been done into GMOs to conclude they are safe (i.e. a fairly neutral and accurate position), by process of elimination you are therefore not neutral in the matter.

      <p>
       <em>
        International Seed Federation
