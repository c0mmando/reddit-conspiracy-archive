    <div class="md"><p>Will there be another major terror attack in Europe or the US?</p>

<p>That depends - did the attacks of 11/13 sufficiently condition the public to accept the extreme actions that the Wise Ones intend to take to &quot;keep us safe&quot;? Are we now willing to surrender more rights? To outlaw encryption, and allow governments to censor &quot;inflammatory websites&quot;, &quot;dangerous opinions&quot; and &quot;crazy conspiracy theories&quot;?</p>

<p>Are we now ready to spend billions (or trillions) unleashing the military might of the US, Europe, and Russia on the Levant and Arab countries to &quot;destroy ISIS&quot; (and Assad and Hezbollah and likely Iran)?</p>

<p>If it is deemed that we are NOW ready to accept these drastic measures, there may be no need for further attacks, but if we are not, or we seem undecided, we should expect more terror to follow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was a good film, with nods to long established conspiracy theories. Although highly unrealistic and full of clich√© as all Bond films are, it was a pretty enjoyable thriller and it was interesting to see all the symbolism and references to conspiracy theories in there. </p>

<p>There was even one part which made reference to the human rights abuses that happened under MK ULTRA [1].</p>

<p>I think that the people who wrote the script were genuinely interested in conspiracy theories and wanted to put a message across.</p>

<p>What you also have to understand is that most of us don&#39;t take the view that we&#39;re living in North Korea where everything is 100% under control. In fact, the human rights situation in the US is only &quot;medium risk&quot; [2]. The press freedom index for the US is at position #49 on the league table [3], which is not bad compared to many other countries out there.</p>

<p>However, the situation is gradually deteriorating. In 2002 the US was at position #17 [4], so why has it dropped?</p>

<p>Did the neocons and US intelligence agencies have foreknowledge of 9/11 and chose to let it happen in order to get more control [5]? Could there be manipulation to make us go to war as happened with the second Gulf of Tonkin incident [6] and the plan known as Operation Northwoods [7] ? Is there something to be learned from conspiracies in the past which people said were crazy but were later proven to be true [8]?</p>

<p>Yeah! It had exactly what you are talking about. A global organization that uses &quot;terrorism&quot; to coerce everyone to do their will.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You mean like the Military-Industrial/Corporate Complex?</p>

<p>That&#39;s hardly new. They&#39;ve been using terror/war <em>(or the threat thereof)</em>  - whether covertly or overtly - to coerce people into doing their will for a very long time, creating &quot;shadow enemies&quot; from scratch to justify unjustifiable aggression, fomenting coups and revolutions to disempower uncooperative leaders, pumping out propaganda and yellow journalism to demonize their targets and manufacture <strong>outrage</strong> among the befuddled masses to build popular support for egregious actions that are often (usually?) contrary to the best interests of these same masses...</p>

<p>I see the same pattern being followed here. A relatively small group of extremely wealthy and powerful people working to consolidate and entrench their power. Human nature, you know, but advancements in technology have given rise to possibilities that were previously beyond their reach.</p>

<p>Of course technology is a two-edged sword, for while it has extended the depth and breadth of the reach of these would-be tyrants, it has also opened up avenues of communication <em>among the masses</em> that call unwanted attention to their aspirations - and that is seen as a irritating hindrance, if not a threat.</p>

<p>You may have noticed (I have) that the actions proposed by our Glorious Leaders and their gaggle of talking-head &quot;experts&quot; not only call for physically <strong>crushing</strong> the <em>(largely phantasmic)</em> &quot;enemy&quot; called ISIS, but for further &quot;protecting us&quot; by limiting our access to certain types of &quot;bad information&quot; by tightening restrictions against certain types of &quot;speech&quot; and ideas that they, in their benevolent wisdom, tell us is detrimental to a &quot;free society&quot;.</p>

<p>IMO, the dangers of restricting information and the free-flow of ideas is a FAR greater threat to society than could ever be posed by the straw-man ISIS.</p>

<p>Your mileage may vary.</p>

<p>Regardless. These are a couple instances where training mirrored events that either happened just before or just after training.</p>

<p>Law enforcement and military are constantly training and two fairly generalized examples doesn&#39;t prove that this is some sort of recurring trend. The Boston Police alone probably have numerous training days a year throughout the various sections of their department.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well i work in private security and have done a lot of the training for this stuff. if you are training you are on high alert, the fact these all went on right under their noses is very very suspicious.</p>

<p>my law enforcement background is why i question these things in the first place. very little lines up with these &quot;attacks&quot; </p>

Having a security background helps a lot when viewing this information, I&#39;m sure.
Have you seen the FLIR radar footage of the guy running through the woods at the Sandy Hook false flag?
I can&#39;t find it anywhere anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was a good film, with nods to long established conspiracy theories. Although highly unrealistic and full of clich√© as all Bond films are, it was a pretty enjoyable thriller and it was interesting to see all the symbolism and references to conspiracy theories in there. </p>

<p>There was even one part which made reference to the human rights abuses that happened under MK ULTRA [1].</p>

<p>I think that the people who wrote the script were genuinely interested in conspiracy theories and wanted to put a message across.</p>

<p>What you also have to understand is that most of us don&#39;t take the view that we&#39;re living in North Korea where everything is 100% under control. In fact, the human rights situation in the US is only &quot;medium risk&quot; [2]. The press freedom index for the US is at position #49 on the league table [3], which is not bad compared to many other countries out there.</p>

<p>However, the situation is gradually deteriorating. In 2002 the US was at position #17 [4], so why has it dropped?</p>

<p>Did the neocons and US intelligence agencies have foreknowledge of 9/11 and chose to let it happen in order to get more control [5]? Could there be manipulation to make us go to war as happened with the second Gulf of Tonkin incident [6] and the plan known as Operation Northwoods [7] ? Is there something to be learned from conspiracies in the past which people said were crazy but were later proven to be true [8]?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Yeah! It had exactly what you are talking about. A global organization that uses &quot;terrorism&quot; to coerce everyone to do their will.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You mean like the Military-Industrial/Corporate Complex?</p>

<p>That&#39;s hardly new. They&#39;ve been using terror/war <em>(or the threat thereof)</em>  - whether covertly or overtly - to coerce people into doing their will for a very long time, creating &quot;shadow enemies&quot; from scratch to justify unjustifiable aggression, fomenting coups and revolutions to disempower uncooperative leaders, pumping out propaganda and yellow journalism to demonize their targets and manufacture <strong>outrage</strong> among the befuddled masses to build popular support for egregious actions that are often (usually?) contrary to the best interests of these same masses...</p>

<p>I see the same pattern being followed here. A relatively small group of extremely wealthy and powerful people working to consolidate and entrench their power. Human nature, you know, but advancements in technology have given rise to possibilities that were previously beyond their reach.</p>

<p>Of course technology is a two-edged sword, for while it has extended the depth and breadth of the reach of these would-be tyrants, it has also opened up avenues of communication <em>among the masses</em> that call unwanted attention to their aspirations - and that is seen as a irritating hindrance, if not a threat.</p>

<p>You may have noticed (I have) that the actions proposed by our Glorious Leaders and their gaggle of talking-head &quot;experts&quot; not only call for physically <strong>crushing</strong> the <em>(largely phantasmic)</em> &quot;enemy&quot; called ISIS, but for further &quot;protecting us&quot; by limiting our access to certain types of &quot;bad information&quot; by tightening restrictions against certain types of &quot;speech&quot; and ideas that they, in their benevolent wisdom, tell us is detrimental to a &quot;free society&quot;.</p>

<p>IMO, the dangers of restricting information and the free-flow of ideas is a FAR greater threat to society than could ever be posed by the straw-man ISIS.</p>

<p>Your mileage may vary.</p>
