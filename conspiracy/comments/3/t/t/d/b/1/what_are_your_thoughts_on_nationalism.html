    <div class="md"><p>I disagree on the basis that nationalism relies on a high authoritarianism based public, which I think is very bad as it harms a &#39;free market of ideas, thoughts&#39; by limiting the spectrum of discourse, secularism (a &#39;free market of religions--value/belief systems&#39;), and &#39;free market on rights&#39; by having the government attempt to make them uniform.  Just to explain that last one, no government is making the amish abandon technology, no government is making vegans define what they can&#39;t eat, no one is telling the tea party or occupy wall st on opposite polar extremes cannot organize.  But under nationalism, these people will find themselves in a hostile climate in which the main population of authoritarians will act as the immune system preventing these people from being safe in these endeavors of activism and organization.  </p>

<p>This is very bad and it goes against the most fundamental American principles.</p>

<p>This is why I believe Nationalism is not even a real political system.  It&#39;s a strategy for social control that weaponizes autoritarianism.</p>

<p>Nationalism is an attempt at making society uniform, which is that &#39;the one big fear of communism&#39;, the squelching of individualism and opportunity--it does this by imposing the uniformity of values, limiting the spectrum of discourse, &#39;getting people onboard&#39; and trying to corral people like animals into one big patriotic narrative that attempts to create an abusive ingroup that shuns outsiders, outliers, and nonconformists--even going so far as to say they are mentally ill, and possibly detaining them with such a designation as a justification.  High authoritarian people will have no problem with this, as demonstrated by the Millgram experiment, which was the one were 60% of people &quot;shocked another person&quot; because someone with higher authority told them to.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I beieve there is a way to have the America, that has a <em>real</em> identity and <em>real heritage</em> that doesn&#39;t have to open its borders to transnationals or become a global octupus of culture.  No!  In fact, we can change things around right now and become the heroes of the world by </p>

<ol>
<li>Reinvestigating 9/11 and prosecuting the criminals; come clean on &#39;government spy-cology games&#39;</li>
<li>Apologizing to the world and making it right.</li>
<li>Legalizing all drugs and permanently ending the drug war</li>
<li>Closing off our borders and focusing on rebuilding america with alternative energy New Deal type jobs programs to disentangle ourselves politically and become energy sovereign</li>
<li>Make healthcare free so our people don&#39;t have to worry</li>
<li>Take care of our elderly because they deserve it</li>
<li>Take care of our children by making our education system free</li>
</ol>

<p>How to pay all that?  Stop fucking having decades of fake war!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will warn you about this thread: it&#39;s a shill-strawman.  I don&#39;t say this often because it&#39;s almost never warranted.  But I&#39;ve looked into 3 of users here and they have very low karma and many posts in conspiracy. This means they are shitposting and agent provocateurs in this sub mostly.  I believe they are astroturfing.  Sorry if that appears at face value to violate a rule, so if you are a mod, look into it and if I&#39;m wrong, then delete my comment or have me do it.</p>

<p>Also, the flavor of the commentary is pushing nationalism.  Are you kidding me?  We fought 2 wars against nationalists and won.  We think N. Korea is batshit.  </p>

<p>Further, the discourse is trying to conflate Nationalism with National Identity.  This is a logical fallacy.  Nationalism is a society that has become overwhelmingly authoritarian.  National Identity is a &#39;presenting to the world a uniform identity--a perspective, mission statement, and set of general values&#39;.  The two are <em>not</em> the same.</p>

<p>Yeah, destroying peoples genetic makeup, culture, and everything else that makes them unique in the world is totally progressive /s</p>

<p>This is why we are seeing a rise in the radical left. Look at Europe right now, they are becoming the most multi-cultural continent and it&#39;s doing wonders for them! Sweden is the most tolerant, multi-cultural and progressive country right now, I wonder why they have a rape epidemic.. </p>

<p>Nationalism is wanting to preserve and protect your own people, but in today&#39;s world this is seen as &quot;racist&quot; for the obvious reasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are exactly right.  You get gold.  Nationalism will stop questioning the problems with ISIS, the problems with 9/11, the problems with X.  It limits the spectrum of discourse, which means that outgroups and outliers get squelched.  </p>

<p>This is bad, and it goes against americanism in that our country was founded by a small group of nonconformists who won the opinion of the larger group and then rebelled against authority and won.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just think they are running a new trick. Rather then break down and traumatize the whole population of a country through war, they ship in refugees from the small countries they have  totally demoralized. That way they save the infrastructure from destruction but still bring in a large enough dysfunctional group that everyone stays in survival mode at all times. </p>

<p>You could focus on the &quot;invaders&quot; as the problem if you like, but it&#39;s not them, it&#39;s the puppet masters who are the source of the problem. America worked as a melting pot. It worked well. That&#39;s not the issue.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;amp;v=OsFEV35tWsg#t=992">Authoritarianism is evil</a></p>

<p>Polarized authoritarianism is an enemy of individuality.  Individuality is that &quot;freedom, opportunity, and entrepreneurship&quot; that people who love the free market idealize.  </p>

<p>Authoritarianism is not a prerequisite for having a national identity.  Your national identity could be a &#39;critical, free thinking, informed public who doesn&#39;t take shit from their government...that is why drugs are legal, our borders are closed, and our educational system and culture are vibrant, complex, and diverse&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It can be either.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism">Nationalism is NOT a political system</a>. It&#39;s a description of authoritarianism in a country.</p>

<p>you can have both left wing authoritarians (PC SJW FemiNazis, Stalinism) or right wing authoritarians  (Tea party, pro gun libertarians, Cliven bundy supporters, oathkeepers, Nazis, Mussolini fascism)</p>

<p>America at the moment is a polar nationalism wherein both left and right think they are being nationalistic but neither actually are, nor are they listening to each other.  It&#39;s like there&#39;s a wall inbetween them, the wall of the &#39;silent centrist&#39; who happens to be the only sane person in this equation.</p>
