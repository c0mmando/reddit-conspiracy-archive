       I disagree on the basis that nationalism relies on a high authoritarianism based public, which I think is very bad as it harms a 'free market of ideas, thoughts' by limiting the spectrum of discourse, secularism (a 'free market of religions--value/belief systems'), and 'free market on rights' by having the government attempt to make them uniform.  Just to explain that last one, no government is making the amish abandon technology, no government is making vegans define what they can't eat, no one is telling the tea party or occupy wall st on opposite polar extremes cannot organize.  But under nationalism, these people will find themselves in a hostile climate in which the main population of authoritarians will act as the immune system preventing these people from being safe in these endeavors of activism and organization.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is very bad and it goes against the most fundamental American principles.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why I believe Nationalism is not even a real political system.  It's a strategy for social control that weaponizes autoritarianism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nationalism is an attempt at making society uniform, which is that 'the one big fear of communism', the squelching of individualism and opportunity--it does this by imposing the uniformity of values, limiting the spectrum of discourse, 'getting people onboard' and trying to corral people like animals into one big patriotic narrative that attempts to create an abusive ingroup that shuns outsiders, outliers, and nonconformists--even going so far as to say they are mentally ill, and possibly detaining them with such a designation as a justification.  High authoritarian people will have no problem with this, as demonstrated by the Millgram experiment, which was the one were 60% of people "shocked another person" because someone with higher authority told them to.

       I will warn you about this thread: it's a shill-strawman.  I don't say this often because it's almost never warranted.  But I've looked into 3 of users here and they have very low karma and many posts in conspiracy. This means they are shitposting and agent provocateurs in this sub mostly.  I believe they are astroturfing.  Sorry if that appears at face value to violate a rule, so if you are a mod, look into it and if I'm wrong, then delete my comment or have me do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the flavor of the commentary is pushing nationalism.  Are you kidding me?  We fought 2 wars against nationalists and won.  We think N. Korea is batshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, the discourse is trying to conflate Nationalism with National Identity.  This is a logical fallacy.  Nationalism is a society that has become overwhelmingly authoritarian.  National Identity is a 'presenting to the world a uniform identity--a perspective, mission statement, and set of general values'.  The two are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       the same.

       This is why we are seeing a rise in the radical left. Look at Europe right now, they are becoming the most multi-cultural continent and it's doing wonders for them! Sweden is the most tolerant, multi-cultural and progressive country right now, I wonder why they have a rape epidemic..

       Nationalism is wanting to preserve and protect your own people, but in today's world this is seen as "racist" for the obvious reasons.

       You are exactly right.  You get gold.  Nationalism will stop questioning the problems with ISIS, the problems with 9/11, the problems with X.  It limits the spectrum of discourse, which means that outgroups and outliers get squelched.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is bad, and it goes against americanism in that our country was founded by a small group of nonconformists who won the opinion of the larger group and then rebelled against authority and won.

       It has always been so, but this is the "best" time to take it out and use it. With all that's been happening with the refugees (thanks to western wars like in Afghanistan etc) this is the perfect time for nationalists to feel vindicated even though they're very short sighted in their approach.

       I think putting your country first is akin to putting your own family first when it comes to choices you make. That said, the folks really running the show don't care about our Nation or our families.

       I just think they are running a new trick. Rather then break down and traumatize the whole population of a country through war, they ship in refugees from the small countries they have  totally demoralized. That way they save the infrastructure from destruction but still bring in a large enough dysfunctional group that everyone stays in survival mode at all times.

       You could focus on the "invaders" as the problem if you like, but it's not them, it's the puppet masters who are the source of the problem. America worked as a melting pot. It worked well. That's not the issue.

       Nationalism is a description of a polarized high Authoritarianism society, it's not a political system but a trend.
      </p>

        Authoritarianism is evil
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Polarized authoritarianism is an enemy of individuality.  Individuality is that "freedom, opportunity, and entrepreneurship" that people who love the free market idealize.
      </p>
      <p>
       Authoritarianism is not a prerequisite for having a national identity.  Your national identity could be a 'critical, free thinking, informed public who doesn't take shit from their government...that is why drugs are legal, our borders are closed, and our educational system and culture are vibrant, complex, and diverse'

       I'm all for the elimination of nationalism, but for a post-scarcity society that benefits all instead of a statist society that benefits a few at the expense of everyone else. A one world order can be good or bad depending on how it works out.

       I'm not looking for approval from anyone. My stand is simply because national borders don't exist and it's enforced by the use of violence. The Earth is not a possession, it is a place where all living beings should be able to thrive on.

       national borders do exist.  if you think they don't, you are living in a dreamworld.  People own property and land,and that's just how it is.  Nothing you can do about it, and all the hoping and imagining in the world won't change it.

       It can be either.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism">
        Nationalism is NOT a political system
       </a>
       . It's a description of authoritarianism in a country.
      </p>
      <p>
       you can have both left wing authoritarians (PC SJW FemiNazis, Stalinism) or right wing authoritarians  (Tea party, pro gun libertarians, Cliven bundy supporters, oathkeepers, Nazis, Mussolini fascism)
      </p>
      <p>
       America at the moment is a polar nationalism wherein both left and right think they are being nationalistic but neither actually are, nor are they listening to each other.  It's like there's a wall inbetween them, the wall of the 'silent centrist' who happens to be the only sane person in this equation.

       I think nationalism goes hand in hand with religion as things that are no longer relevant, or shouldn't be in my opinion.  The nation is just an imagined community after all, and although this sounds like a nice idea it creates an other as well as allowing a populous to be manipulated more easily.
