<p>It&#39;s also amazing how during a tornado many houses are blown apart yet the nearby grass remains intact and there&#39;s also paper and fabric strewn about!  Maybe we should build houses out of grass as well as sheets of paper and sweaters!  On the other hand, maybe tornadoes are simply false flags ... I can&#39;t decide.  Regardless, something is clearly up in these photos:</p>

<p>Look at all that paper and grass left behind!  This makes it clear to me that grass and paper are stronger than wood, foolproof logic.</p>

<p>Which, given that at least six other &quot;hijackers&quot; complained of identity theft, was also almost certainly fake.</p>

<p>I think this absolutely stinks. ISIS doesn&#39;t need to use false passports to get into France.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is thorough vetting exactly? 50% of Muslims worldwide are illiterate. When I was in Afghanistan, 90% of the people I spoke to had no idea what year it was, how old they were, what village they were born in, or how to write their names. Honestly, the vast majority of them said their name was Muhammad. I&#39;m just curious as to what you think a proper vetting would look like as far as what kind of questions asked and how deeply we should look into people. I personally think it&#39;s the political answer and its bullshit. The people being expected to do that job are being asked to do the impossible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if all that is true, then I&#39;d say unless there is hard data tying them to militants, they should be given a chance.  Just like we should&#39;ve given German Jews a chance in 1939 when they tried to come here for asylum, instead of turning them around and jeopardizing them. They didn&#39;t turn out to be Nazis, did they?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I just wanted to point out that you shouldn&#39;t trust government rhetoric about them having some vetting process that works. They said the same bullshit about the &quot;moderate opposition&quot; they built up in Syria. The tool itself is ineffective in places where people are illiterate and have nothing to lose. Even further, how many attacks have taken place by people with known terrorists affiliations? Virtually all of them. Usually under the watchful eye of intelligence agencies. Let&#39;s face it our governments are all incompetent fucks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree.  It&#39;s always been darkly amusing to me that intelligence, no matter what agency or country, happened to know about these perpetrators every time before a terrorist act.  It&#39;s almost like they are being used as tools for some greater use.  Hmmmm....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You think it&#39;s more likely that a shadowy group of people are fabricating events to make refugees look bad than it is for someone to have a fake passport?  Really?</p>

<p>Why would the people involved in this conspiracy risk so much to make these people look bad when the refugees do it for themselves.  According to <a href="http://english.dohainstitute.org/file/Get/40ebdf12-8960-4d18-8088-7c8a077e522e">this poll</a>, 31% of them oppose or strongly oppose the campaign to degrade or destroy ISIS.</p>

<p><em>“You can go to the Syrian government today and say to them, ‘I need a piece of paper that says I’m Tony Caterpillar.’ And they give it to you,” he said.</em></p>

<p><em>“These are not forged documents. These are written out by a government employee who needs money, whose family has no food.”</em></p>

<p>I think it&#39;s likely that a shadowy group of people are fabricating events to make other groups look bad.  Not just refugees. This passport tactic is counter-intelligence 101.</p>

<p>This is just language bias. Why do you think Jihadists are not &quot;a shadowy group of people&quot;, but everybody else who could possibly have done it is? This makes absolutely no sense and is a textbook abuse of reason.</p>
