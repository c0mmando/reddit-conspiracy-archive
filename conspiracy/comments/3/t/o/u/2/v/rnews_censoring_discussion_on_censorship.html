       Mods just banned me for starting a discussion on all the new censorship rules put into place, along with wiping out the existing comment thread.

      <p>
       Not only that but
       <a href="/r/videos">
        /r/videos
       </a>
       is actively censoring this video - keeping it from going viral and preventing people from potentially identifying the suspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       And
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       tries to censor discussion on that banning by removing the top comment.

       Posting my now hidden comment
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       For those that aren't aware,
       <a href="/r/videos">
        /r/videos
       </a>
       has recently banned all 'political' video which is whatever they deem political. Essentially they are giving themselves a blank check on censorship and the new rule was rammed through with the thread comments being locked down at the very beginning so nobody could complain. All videos which were upvoted with satirical titles in protest were also removed. This is the same tactic they've used to censor
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       , while
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       cites "No 'Opinion/Analysis'" for their excuse to censor.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has the exact same effect as silencing free speech and creating 'free speech zones' in their wake through places like
       <a href="/r/videosplus">
        /r/videosplus
       </a>
       . It sounds better but ultimately it's just silencing opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless
       <a href="/r/videosplus">
        /r/videosplus
       </a>
       is made a default sub,
       <a href="/r/videos">
        /r/videos
       </a>
       will still remain the default place people go - effectively showing that reddit as a 'free speech' platform is a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       All these new pro-censorship rules aren't just appearing by coincidence either. It is specifically designed to implement censorship rules as the reddit admins are bought and paid for.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Intercept (run by Glenn Greenwald whom Snowden gave his documents to - a site dedicated to whistleblowing) is regularly censored both here and on
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       , along with most stories damaging to the American government's narrative.

       According to the Wikileaks STRATFOR email dump, Alex Ohanian (reddit cofounder) was in active talks with them.

      <p>
       What is STRATFOR? An 'intelligence' contractor based in the US. And it's not just a publication as

        I want to set up this call with his associate Erik from Antique Jetpack -
please tell Susan who should be on the phone call to plan the meeting on
March 14th at our office with the Reddit cofounder.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sorry for the delay, Meredith! I just got my schedule finalized with
speaking gigs/appearances/etc.
It looks like I'll be free after 1pm on Mar 14th. Is there a time that
afternoon that would work?
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm CCing my associate, Erik, who does Antique Jetpack consulting with me.
I'm thinking you to could hop on a call to nail down just what we'd be
doing at this meeting and maximize what STRATFOR gets out of it :)

       Now, if 'Antique Jetpack' really was a marketing firm, why would their website have nothing except a mailing list subscription box? No contact info, no offerings, nothing except the motto -

       The timing was inline with the great push by Merkel this month  to destroy europe with millions of immigrants and the pointing out through incriminating videos that it was a plan specifically  desired by barbara spectre, former president of france Sarkozy and a radical rabbi.  I posted those vidoes and proofs where those people actually say that in their on words on r europe where i was instantly banned.

       A whole lot of others have had the same thing happen apparently as
       <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/removalbot">
        http://np.reddit.com/r/removalbot
       </a>
       shows.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems this is a most senstive subject for the controllers of reddit because i have never seen such banning and changes inacted so quickly as with the exposure of the plan to destroy europe using the immigrants.  So apparently that plan and keeping it from the 500,000 subscribers to r europe is very important right now  and fhey dont want the thousands of  r video subscribers seeing it either becuas eright at that moment  r video began censoring all political videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ironically compliants about the moderation at r europe are directed by r europe to r europemeta but they are quickly censored there as well asyou will notice since are included in r removalbot as well now apparently.
