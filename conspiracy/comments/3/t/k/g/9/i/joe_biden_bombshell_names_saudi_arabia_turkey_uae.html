        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Watch: <a href="http://youtu.be/UrXkm4FImvc?t=1h31m57s">http://youtu.be/UrXkm4FImvc?t=1h31m57s</a></p>

<p>In the above Q&amp;A at Harvard on the Oct 2, 2014, US VP Joe Biden explains the origins of ISIS.</p>

<p>It also corresponds with Putin&#39;s speech at the G20 when he said 40 States were funding ISIS and some of them were G20 Nations.</p>

<p>At 1.31.57 the Questioner asks...</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> In retrospect do u believe the United States should have acted earlier in Syria, and if not why is now the right moment?</p>

<p><strong>Biden:</strong> The answer is &#39;no&#39; for 2 reasons. One, the idea of identifying a moderate middle has been a chase America has been engaged in for a long time. We Americans think in every country in transition there is a Thomas Jefferson hiding beside some rock - or a James Madison beyond one sand dune.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is the ability to identify a moderate middle in Syria was - there was no moderate middle because the moderate middle are made up of shopkeepers, not soldiers - they are made up of people who in fact have ordinary elements of the middle class of that country. And what happened was - and history will record this because I&#39;m finding that former administration officials, as soon as they leave write books which I think is inappropriate, but anyway, (laughs) no I&#39;m serious - I do think it&#39;s inappropriate at least , you know, give the guy a chance to get out of office. And what my constant cry was that our biggest problem is our allies - our allies in the region were our largest problem in Syria.</p>

<p>The Turks were great friends - and I have the greatest relationship with Erdogan, which I just spent a lot of time with - the Saudis, the Emiratis, etc. What were they doing? They were so determined to take down Assad and essentially have a proxy Sunni-Shia war, what did they do? They poured hundreds of millions of dollars and tens, thousands of tons of weapons into anyone who would fight against Assad except that the people who were being supplied were Al Nusra and Al Qaeda and the extremist elements of jihadis coming from other parts of the world.</p>

<p>Now you think I&#39;m exaggerating - take a look. Where did all of this go? So now what&#39;s happening? All of a sudden everybody&#39;s awakened because this outfit called ISIL which was Al Qaeda in Iraq, which when they were essentially thrown out of Iraq, found open space in territory in eastern Syria, work with Al Nusra who we declared a terrorist group early on and we could not convince our colleagues to stop supplying them. So what happened?</p>

<p>Now all of a sudden - I don&#39;t want to be too facetious - but they had seen the Lord. Now we have - the President&#39;s been able to put together a coalition of our Sunni neighbors, because America can&#39;t once again go into a Muslim nation and be seen as the aggressor - it has to be led by Sunnis to go and attack a Sunni organization. So what do we have for the first time? &quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>The problem is the US has been helping to arm Saudi and Turkey for the purpose of arming terrorists;</p>

<p><strong>From The New York Times:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;With help from the C.I.A., Arab governments and Turkey have sharply increased their military aid to Syria&#39;s opposition fighters in recent months, expanding a secret airlift of arms and equipment for the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad, according to air traffic data, interviews with officials in several countries and the accounts of rebel commanders.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;From offices at secret locations, American intelligence officers have helped the Arab governments shop for weapons, including a large procurement from Croatia, and have vetted rebel commanders and groups to determine who should receive the weapons as they arrive, according to American officials speaking on the condition of anonymity.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So when Putin announces at the G20 meeting this week that G20 nations are arming and funding ISIS.
No Western Media outlet reported it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>do you even read what you post as proof?  that article just proved me right!  it says they are leaders of syrian rebels.  NOT AL QAEDA!!!  you seem to just look at pictures and form your own story, but im the one that needs to wake up.  right?</p>

<p>it goes on to say that these men may have kidnapped someone, but it NEVER SAYS THEY ARE WITH AL QAEDA!</p>

<p>where the hell are you getting that he met with al qaeda leaders on obamas behalf??  is it because they are brown and therefore members of al qaeda?</p>
