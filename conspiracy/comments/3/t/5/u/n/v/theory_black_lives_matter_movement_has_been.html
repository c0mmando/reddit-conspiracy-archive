<p>Ferguson was a powderkeg waiting to blow.  There&#39;s a warrant out for over half of the population.  Mostly over unpaid parking tickets.  It&#39;s a perfect case of systematic oppression.  Either Mike Brown was the spark that ignited all of that pent up rage or he was a controlled burn designed to defuse the situation.  Either way his case is mired in controversy and Eric Garner seemed to not get nearly as much coverage despite being a much better example of what&#39;s wrong with our society.</p>

<p>There hare been other cases of not very civil demonstrations.  like the library incident a couple days ago or the Bernie Sanders rally interruption.</p>

<p>Now we have Jamar Clark, another easy to smear person that has people rallying people in Minneapolis, an area that isn&#39;t seeing a large amount of black deaths at police hands.</p>

<p>It feels like the hole BLM movement is intended to make Civil Rights a laughing stock so everyone ignores the real issues at hand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Subversion of minority political movements has been standard operating procedure of the FBI for over half a century. There is absolutely no doubt they are involved in BLM. The goal is to take legitimate ideas and marginalize them through extremism and violence.</p>

<p>Here is a primer on COINTELPRO, follow the cited sources for more info:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the questions are: How would they do this without it getting attention?  What keeps all of their agents so tight lipped?  How do they steer people into following such counter-productive causes?  How would we find evidence to support that this is happening with BLM?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great questions. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s good to begin a discussion with the hierarchy of the FBI and the type of people that would be involved in infiltrating BLM.</p>

<p>For many decades, the FBI was run by a well known psychopath, J. Edgar Hoover. He was instrumental in assassinations of black panther members, writing the letter to MLK suggesting suicide, waging war against the American Indian Movement, creating working relationships with gangs and the Mob, etc.</p>

<p>It is not disputed among the general populace that Hoover was a psychopath who enjoyed hurting others, but through some mental gymnastics people generally  believe that the agency reformed when he left.</p>

<p>This unfortunately overlooks some important processes involved in the growth of institutions. Basically, hierarchies dominated by psychopaths at the top will, over time, become more and more saturated by similar peers. The process is called ponerization, and I describe it like this: In the same manner that you and I naturally exclude social deviants from our social groups over time, a group saturated with psychopaths will continuously exclude typically developed people over time, until eventually a significant majority of the organization consists of people who enjoy inflicting pain and value power, both personal and organizational, over other goals.</p>

<p>Now the intelligence community has taken this process beyond simple socialization and has actually made a science out of it, with John Gittinger&#39;s Personality Assessment Test developed under MK ULTRA. The test itself may have evolved, but the idea remains the same: find agents whose personalities fall into the psychopathic category, who are obedient to institutional authority, perhaps those who are racist or reactionary, and assign these people to sensitive assignments such as subverting legitimate political movements.</p>

<p>I have a lot more to say but have to return to work for now, I&#39;ll edit this comment tonight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He operates in the faux-philanthropic Fabian tradition of Rothschild, Rockefeller, Carnegie, and Ford:</p>

<hr/>

<p>You would think that they&#39;re sworn enemies from the way story is told in school, but the Marxist vision of a centrally planned economic, social, and political order was not at all incompatible with elite plans for world government. It just needed some case-specific alterations.</p>

<p>The international banking cartels and industrial &quot;robber-barons&quot; of 19th and early 20th centuries that had amassed great fortunes (especially during wartime) often found their plans for the reorganization and modernization of society (on their terms) frustrated by the same &quot;oppressive&quot; monarchies, aristocracies, religions, nationalisms, tribalisms, and traditions that Marxism promised to overturn. By financing Marxism, global elites could both co-opt its message and steer its ultimate direction, thereby covertly recruiting their seeming opposition as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUYCBfmIcHM">powerful new ally in their schemes</a>. Controlled opposition is, after all, the best kind.</p>

<p>Thus, in globalists&#39; home countries, the Marxist victim-oppressor dialectic was reoriented from the axis of economic class to axes of biological identity (i.e. race, gender, and sexual orientation), securing much-needed cover for financial elites and their supra-national &quot;non-governing&quot; bodies by diverting leftist academic scrutiny from overt economic inequalities to natural ones. It also had the effect of agitating and exacerbating those same divisions among the citizenry, rendering them incapable of unifying around a coherent political platform. Divide and rule.</p>

<p>The global elite understood that the way to sell slavery to a Western, capitalist democracy was to brand it as a form of liberation. This necessitated a revolution in education that would dispense with individual virtues, traditional values, and objective truth. Instead they would institute an ersatz system founded upon a moral and intellectual relativism that stressed socialization, consensus, and collectivism. The subsequent leftward slide of the masses effectively arrested the development of any ethno-nationalist movements which pose perhaps the only serious ideological challenge to globalist rule.</p>

<p>Thus, for the past century or more, our schools and universities have been socially re-engineered by a professional cabal of progressive educators, utopian crusaders, marxist agitators, leftist academics, communist zealots, and other so-called &quot;school reformers&quot; and &quot;change agents&quot; laboring under the generous patronage of such esteemed names as Ford, Carnegie, and Rockefeller (through their tax-exempt foundations, of course) to, often by their own admissions, produce a collectivist, obedient, and technocratically manageable society of credulous, helpless imbeciles incapable of independent thought and political agency.</p>

<p>To understand how all this came about, it is necessary to study the genesis and history of our educational system outside the narrative parameters of that same educational system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you aren&#39;t seeing the whole picture. The black lives matter movement has continually rallied behind the guilty party and ended up making things worse. The FBI trying to subvert them would probably give them legitimate targets to rally behind. They are unorganized, have zero leadership and ultimately the message is completely wrong. Not to mention they are looking in the wrong direction for their outrage and doing it in an inherently racist way. Just my opinion but the FBI doesn&#39;t have to subvert a movement that is misguided and already outraged.</p>

The idiots in the BLM group at Dartmouth, and on the Minnesota highway don&#39;t represent the whole black lives matter movement. They just want attention, they&#39;re not there to help or anything at all. So don&#39;t group them with the ones who actually do something and EVERYTIME, I&#39;ve seen something about BLM it&#39;s always negative in Reddit, never once have I seen anything positive with it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While whites are just as much at the mercy of cops, blacks are targeted more because they are easier to arrest, convict, and put away for longer periods of time.  Cops can pad their numbers and look good by profiling targets.  Lots of black people in the system lets DAs pad their numbers with convictions.  Corrections contractors like black people in the system because it means more business.  There is plenty interest in keeping this cycle going.</p>

<p>By spinning the BLM movement around and turning it into a joke, it will only breed more racism.  Leaders love racism because it keeps the peasants fighting each other.</p>

<p>Feminism feels like the same way.  Pick out the most batshit insane people and give them a megaphone and keep men and women fighting each other and not the real issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting.  It&#39;s always difficult to know what the most effective method of civil disobedience is in an ever-evolving society, but I think it&#39;s safe to say that preventing people from learning wasn&#39;t the course of action George Jackson envisioned years ago while doing thousands of fingertip pushups in solitary.  </p>

<p>In the specific case of the library &quot;protest&quot;, preventing the education of others would seem to be directly counter to their cause, the more you learn about the world the more you should want to revolt against the status quo, while also providing yourself with the intellectual resources required to do so:</p>

<p>&quot;Believe me, my friend, with the time and incentive that these brothers have to read, study, and think, you will find no class or category more aware, more embittered, desperate, or dedicated to the ultimate remedy - revolution. The most dedicated, the best of our kind - you&#39;ll find them in the Folsoms, San Quentins, and Soledads. They live like there was no tomorrow. And for most of them there isn&#39;t.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What people fail to realize that BLM isn&#39;t an organization to attempt to guilt trip White Americans. BLM isn&#39;t even directed towards White people, the media skewed it that way.</p>

<p>BLM is supposed to draw awareness to the situation that Black lives seem to almost be disposable to not only just society, but other black people too. Everyone knows black people kill other black people way more than the police, that&#39;s what this movement is about, bringing awareness to systemic oppression, and to unify blacks for a benevolent outcome. </p>

<p>The media is trying to polarize the argument as Angry Blacks vs White Americans or Angry Blacks vs Police officers which is not the case at all. I would be lying to say there aren&#39;t any blacks in the movement who aren&#39;t in agreement with this view but <em>as a whole the organization is more involved with getting Black lives to matter to other Black people than bashing White people.</em> </p>

<p>Then that&#39;s where the sabotage comes into play, if such a movement were to become successful there would no longer be any quarreling between people of color and white Americans. That&#39;s the only reason why you only see on the MSM when the select few who are the ones who are essentially fucking it up for all of us.</p>

<p>In reality, <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expanded_homicide_data_table_6_murder_race_and_sex_of_vicitm_by_race_and_sex_of_offender_2013.xls">black-on-white crime</a> (specifically murder, which is what BLM is mainly about) is a much bigger issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t disagree with you about the aims of BLM seeming outrageous at times. Although there was a shooting of a black man by police recently here in Minneapolis: <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/protests-erupt-black-man-shot-police-minneapolis-35221494">http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/protests-erupt-black-man-shot-police-minneapolis-35221494</a>. I live in the Twin Cities and people have always been very passionate here regarding BLM because there has been a presence of police cruelty here for some time now. So as of late it seems justified. However, after Ferguson there was pretests that shut down highways here and that was a bit much in some people&#39;s view. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Umm, Minneapolis has <a href="http://www.aclu-mn.org/news/2015/05/28/aclu-finds-severe-racial-disparities-low-level-arrests-minne">extremely racist police</a> and massive <a href="http://www.startribune.com/black-minnesotans-of-all-backgrounds-up-against-disparities/329659731/">income disparities</a> that look like institutionalized racism. </p>

<p>While Black Lives Matter has definitely been infiltrated and <a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/a-undercover-police-have-regularly-spied-black-lives-matter-activists-new-york">spied on</a>, the movement as a whole is intended to draw attention to the very real issues around entrenched societal racism. If you feel like it is a laughingstock because of how it is portrayed by mainstream media and talked about by those around you, then maybe this is an opportunity for you to participate in more meaningful communication around what you believe the &#39;real issues&#39; to be. </p>

<p>African-Americans were crowded into neighborhoods in the ghetto because so much other housing was closed to them and as a result, housing prices in ghettos were much higher than similar housing in white areas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What. The. Fuck?  Impossible to take the guy seriously.</p>

<p>The government may have created the housing, but they gave it to them for free.  They turned it into ghettos.  Speaking of ghettos, are you strictly referring to the housing situation or the connotation which includes things such as culture, eg violence, drugs, etc?  I was referring to the latter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reposting my comment doesn&#39;t magically change its meaning to fit yours pal. </p>

<p>BLM as a movement failed because the message isn&#39;t clear and its members are so vile, ignorant and hateful that people are just turned off by it. </p>

<p>BLM is currently accusing media outlets of stealing their headlines for the Paris attack.</p>

I said nothing about invalid ideas, that was all you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, thanks for the awesome reference list and huge write-up. We need more contributors like yourself in this sub. I don&#39;t care whether the references were just copy pasted, it&#39;s important to have foundations for claims when speaking about such pertinent topics because I believe many visit this sub once or twice hoping to find something that resonates with them as a rational individual but also meets the criterion of having falsifiable evidence to backup these claims, yet they often leave unfulfilled.</p>
