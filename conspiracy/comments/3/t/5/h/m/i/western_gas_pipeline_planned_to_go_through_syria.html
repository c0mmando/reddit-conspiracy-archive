       To get their pipeline The West have to take at least half of Syria, that's what they will push for now that Russia is protecting Assad.  By funding terrorism in the Eastern side, they can use it as justification to bring in ground troops, thereby taking and controlling the land, eventually setting up new state for the pipeline to safely run through.

       Assad turned down the pipeline in 2009, "to protect the interests of [his] Russian ally", not long before the so-called 'uprising' in 2011, which was really a Western plot for regime change and to eventually get their pipeline
      </p>
      <p>
       "In 2009 - the same year former French foreign minister Dumas alleges the British began planning operations in Syria - Assad refused to sign a proposed agreement with Qatar that would run a pipeline from the latter's North field, contiguous with Iran's South Pars field, through Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria and on to Turkey, with a view to supply European markets - albeit crucially bypassing Russia. An Agence France-Presse report claimed Assad's rationale was "to protect the interests of [his] Russian ally, which is Europe's top supplier of natural gas"."

       excellent post, and the crux of the whole Syrian mess. It's always about money.

       I feel that America and its investment interests are already moving away from oil, while it's still important, advances in solar and other green tech have made a real impact. More importantly, they made a real impact in the last like 10 years, going from being some eco hippy bullshit to being something we can actually reasonably imagine will end a lot of oil use. Suddenly, during this time, we have grown a lot colder to our Middle East interests. Saudi Arabia, our good oppressive buddies in the zone, are hemorrhaging money right now, the current price of oil is close to half the price they need for the country to be profitable, and at the current price of oil they have 5 years of fiscal reserves. This is not how you treat an ally you care about. Keep in mind, we were quite ready to tell them to totally fuck off when the US started it's aggressive campaign of
       <del>
        poisoning it's groundwater
       </del>
       fracking for oil, and exploring shale deposits, which was basically a middle finger to the middle east. "Charge us $200 a barrel? Fuck you, I'll make it here for $180 and you won't get a dime of it!" They responded by dropping the price of oil to an unsustainable level because to them some profit is better than none (which was a break with OPEC), while also allowing the big oil companies to invest just enough time and energy that starting and then suspending operations over all this shit was massively expensive for them, which was basically a Fuck You right back. These are the tactics of a country up against the wall.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oil is still required for a lot of stuff, asphalt is made of it fer fucks sake, I don't have much trouble believing Europe wants a supply path for it in which it has a lot of political / physical power over the producing and transmitting countries.

       Definitely an interesting hypothesis. I'd like to see a perspective of someone over there to see if this seems odd or it's just more Western fear-porn.
