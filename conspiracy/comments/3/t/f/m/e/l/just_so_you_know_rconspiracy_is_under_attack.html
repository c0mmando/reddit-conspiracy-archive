       This place hasn't ever looked this different. Paid agents/shills have hijacked the front page and the narrative in the rising threads. Just goes to show how powerful the media is in controlling the narrative and by extension, your mind.

       Also anybody notice the decrease in comments in the rest of reddit lately?

       : just got back from my steak dinner and was quite pleased to see this thread blow up. I hope the message is clear to people, and we can use the popularity this sub is gaining to wake people up to the other very important issues we have been discussing for a while now.

       It really is. Consolation is that it's all in your mind. With a little confidence, acceptance and light heartedness, you can easily overcome it. Digging your head in the sand is even more painful in the long run!

       Just like those who wilfully reject the truth when it's presented to them, they NEED the cognitive dissonance just to sleep at night.  The more intelligent ones are the ones incapable of lying to themselves.  Those or lesser intelligence never so much as question themselves once.  What an existence.

       Yep, not exactly sure why my comment was downvoted when it's probably the only correct answer to the question of where shills get their motivation from.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was an AMA on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       a couple years ago with a guy who claimed he was a paid shill and provided pictures of the software he used, his ID card, and a few other things and he said he was paid six figures, was given a ton of vacation time, worked negotiable hours, etc., etc.  It sounded like a pretty cushy job (ya know, except for that whole "betraying your fellow man for an extra buck" thing).

       That's just posting etiquette. As in "You post online, it can be read by anyone, anywhere. Don't post sensitive information, please." It's the same speech my work gets, as do any organization I teach. It's just common sense in this day and age. It doesn't mean we're all shilling on Reddit.

       It's so obvious, look at the current top thread right now, something that would never naturally have 3k net upvotes on r/conspiracy:

       "Hillary Clinton campaign demands that comedy club Laugh Factory delete a video of comedians making fun of her"

       I agree, but like another poster said it is a site-wide problem. I think the creators of this sub and many of the mods have the best intentions. It's just that Reddit itself has doubled back on its original principles.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion we should take as much traffic as we can, when we can, and create a new home. Otherwise I think it is only a matter of time before are divided and destroyed. I already see this sub as an island (at least for real political debate). There are dozens of subs which have been initiated specifically to mock it and the pressure is probably only going to increase with time.

       Anybody else notice Voat has swung pretty far right lately?  The "migrant crisis" is easily the most common topic I see, and from a pretty xenophobic perspective.  Remember when Stromfront tried to take over this sub?  Kinda feels like Voat got Stormfronted.  They've been under various DDOS, child porn, donation, and other attacks since the start.  Someone wants Voat dead.

       Yea man.  It used to be dead center.  Even civil point/counterpoint discussion when people were on opposite sides.  The past few months has been just straight up liberal bashing and fuck brown people.  I mean I understand there's a lot of Europeans who are dealing with the tensions with migrants.  But that pendulum stuck to the wall.  It's not just about migrants obviously, that's just the most common example I've noticed.

       Voat is one idea. My experiences there haven't been positive, but there are others here who like it. Ultimately though I think we're going to have the same problems on Voat as we do on Reddit, because the setup is so similar.

       I recently had a comment removed from
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       . The context was basically some user was saying all muslims hate non-muslim and when i tried to explain to him that he was dehumanizing muslims and generalizing them, he replied with a Sam Harris link of some talk he gave that was anti-islamic. So all I said was, "Could you please not be unoriginal and articulate and formulate your own responses?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Then a mod messaged me and he removed my comment and told me to be civil. I didn't use profanity or anything, I literally just told him to formulate his own response and think for himself, then my comment was removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the reply from the mod:
"telling people they are unable to come up with orginal thought is just saying you think they are stupid. Talking around the point still doesnt change the point. "

       I ran into this elsewhere and really had to step back and question what was going on. Exactly the same thing, trying to bring (ignorant) conversation into polite terms, and ... being moderated for it. Sent me on another path, anyway.

       Flytape banned my other username. He's dishonest. I caught him covering up for a "friend" who was using alts to game the subreddit and constantly harass people here... so of course I "deserved it".

       LOL.  He holds firm to the shill accusations censorship, protecting certain individuals.  It seems far more often than using the same tools on those usual suspects who come here, refuse to debate facts, and solely exist to ridicule and insult.  Shill 101 behavior to a T.
      </p>
      <p>
       He unfortunately is often far too heavy handed in this highly selective enforcement.  I rarely see any benefit in these sftions to the normal, contributing members of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .  Those we need to stick around most.  And sadly because of this inaction in handling those who harass our user base, many of those people have simply left (of they weren't banned by him already).
      </p>
      <p>
       Is your support based on the fact that he's protected you many times over here?

       Nah, I don't worry about being banned from a digital forum that holds no importance to my life or death.

       There is some shills on here that their job is to get content for TopMindsofReddit or isrconspiracyracist. Knowing those two subs are out there hounding r/conspiracy, I don't wish ill will on any mod here, it's a tough unpaid gig. With that said, I do have suspicion that at least one mod and of course some users here are associated with those two other subs. Every time I have an argument with certain members here usually about israel, it ends up on those subs instantly. Computer_Name mod over there uses a different name here.

       The post itself was about a soldier who posted about how the armory at his base was recently broken into and nobody knows who did it, stealing a bunch of rifles and handguns as well as big caliber guns. The weirder part was that Donald trump was making an appearance there soon.

       Remember a couple of weeks back when they fucked up the algorythm so that posts would stay at the fromt page for 24h? I think they tweaked it so that posts rise faster to the top and there is therefore less time for commenting. Also, but this is subjective, Reddit has increasingly dumb content in the main subs and often there is not much to say about it.

       Most of Reddit is that way now.  I've been a Redditor for over a decade.  It used to be this sleepy little discussion forum (I came over from FARK).  Now it's protected by Conde Nast and gotten very political.  I don't spend much time here any more.

       Do you have any other place where we can land? Like seriously I just started recently in this subreddit but overall reddit in General started to feel weird recently.

       I think Voat is even worse than Reddit. It is certainly no better, since it runs exactly the same voting and abuse systems which can be (and are) abused in exactly the same way.

       My own experience on Voat started off very positive. I was up to about eighty five karma after 2-3 days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I started challenging some of the main page anti-Islamic threads. Lost 79 karma in one afternoon, and the account lost posting privileges the next day. Lol. The brigading was literally worse than I've ever experienced on Reddit, and I've had some pretty messed up days here, too.

       But maybe other people have different stories to tell.

       I used to lurk on reddit for a good 2 years before I started actively participating. May be because I thought my English couldn't stand up to the scrutiny that was demanded, but also because all reasonable opinions were allowed to be voiced. Nowadays I can't but comment. Do people still lurk?

       You see, this is my very own Zionist stalker harassment bot.  They see the damage done, and think this will do it.
       <strong>
        Its ABSOLUTELY NO SURPRISE WHATSOEVER that these same idiots are the ones who are pushing the bullshit aliem agenda.
       </strong>
       Of course.   The agenda only benefits them.  Deflect the focus away from the soulless scum that are running the show from behind the scenes, and blame it on fictions from outer space.  The exact same method that fuckface Icke uses with his bullshit reptilian garbage.  Look who signs his paychecks.  It's the same people who sign the Zionist gatekeeper shill, Gnome Chumpsky.

       I hope that bullshit aliem fiction is going a little better for you.  I know, who'd have ever thunk blaming Alf for the worldwide financial crisis caused directly by one group of people (shit still hasn't recovered since the drapes fell down with LIBOR and the IMF, readily exposing every aspect of the private transnational usury scam banking class was pure fraud through and through) would outright reject this nonsense so violently???

       It happens so often I'd have to report many of the comments I read. Amazing you were even asked to prove it. It's obvious, but trolls want you to dig up proof - probably so you waste your time digging it up. It's pretty sad when people have nothing better to do than to troll this sub, claiming they're here "for entertainment" or for "humor". How boring must they be at parties?

       Trolls are typically schadenfreude seeking dickheads, those who enjoy arrogantly expressing that their perspective is superior to those around them. It makes them feel better, because often times, their own lives are unsatisfying. Misery loves company. Going down into the mud with them makes them feel happy, less alone, less pathetic.

       The counter to this is viewing by /new and browsing post histories to assess motivation of commenters.  This is of course up to each individual user.  People who don't use /new and take the weighted average of the sentiment in the comments and votes to be the "voice of the subreddit" are being misled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps a prominent note on the sidebar reminding people to use /new would be helpful.

       Unfortunately I only started using r/conspiracy about a month ago. I missed what might be termed the glory years. Now, to me, it seems very surface level and full of psyop propaganda. As a long time reader of Beforeitsnews, I eventually learned that most of the stories that circulate in the the conspiracy world are bull shit to try and start organic movements for or against things. This sub is even worse than the content that you'll find there and pales in comparison to places like godlikeproductions, abovetopsecret, earthfiles.com, and even drudgereport.

       Look at our front page. Have you noticed how little upvotes our front page has? Some group has been mass spaming down votes. It sucks that reddit remove all status for upvotes and downvotes or else we would see it much clearer with numbers.

       This sub has been hijacked by racists and the military for years, who have openly posted about doing so and inflated their influence through tactics that violate Reddit's rules, but mods and admins don't act here or in other subs.  I'd also be surprised if a lot of the very stupid (nukes don't exist, flat earth etc.) and actually antisemitic (not anti-Zionist) stuff aimed at making this sub look bad comes not just from general /conspiratards, but also from Hasbara/JIDF types.  Obviously they can't really use megaphone and similar apps like they do in
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       , because of the obvious duplicity involved in posing as an antisemite to defame others by association, but that does not rule out smaller groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       All that said, I have not noticed a major upsurge in such since maybe 3-4 year ago.  Also, during the same period I have noticed the almost complete disappearance of people coming here to politely and logically disagree with theories that are widely accepted here.  This is not surprising given the reception they have increasingly gotten (piss poor and it reflects so on this sub).  I disagree with a lot of the wilder claims made here but I rarely bother to post because I am routinely met with silent downvotes, ad hominem attacks and repetition of baseless nonsense.  It's only a little better than rationally defending Palestine on a given point in
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       and shows that a significant portion of this sub needs to read and follow the reddiquette.  Sorry to complain, but 5-6 years ago this place was filled polite discussions and disagreements that stretched for pages.  How often do you see that now?

       Polite disagreement implies something called "discourse". Discourse is the enemy of propagandists. Reasoned discussion is dangerous for those who would rather we don't think. So much more effective to stoke anger and even hatred. This trend has been in full force in American mainstream media for years, so it's only natural that the trend would finally wind up on a popular and widely used forum like Reddit.

       Yeah, a lot of it has to do with Reddit getting, on average, younger.  The great Digg migration prompted that somewhat, but a lot of long time users become less prominent with new kids, jobs etc. and are replaced by college and even High School kids whose younger siblings often get the idea to come here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The younger the audience, the more frequently and entirely their views on the political and economic world will be based on the vitriolic, jingoistic and factless rhetoric of the post 9-11 era in America.

       im still fairly new to reddit (still dont know how to quote a previous post in my post.  can anyone help me with that btw?), but i would love to see polite discussion that is pages long.  id also like to see threads where everyone posting in it is investigating the subject and sharing information.  but i guess thats all just a pipedream.

       The so called rule should not include all "memes" or images. For one, a huge amount of information can be relayed through a "meme", however, I do not consider a picture or graphic that includes valuable, relevant and or legitimate text that conveys a truth relevant to this subs interests a "meme"...especially the sort that are constantly used over at r/adviceanimals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Images with text work extremely well helping some people understand the true nature of some of the more complex issues we deal with. It's true...a picture paints a thousand words. Maybe the gatekeeper mods in some of those "other" subs don't like it when a lot of pertinent information comes through in a compact and quickly understood format.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't "cheapen" or "dilute" the sub when images with text are presented within the context of this sub. I think it would be a disservice to exclude ALL. There are pictures of John McCain with ISIS leaders with text pointing out who the individuals are...is that a dilution? Are we supposed to explain and describe it all in a wall of text that would put most people to sleep? No...Keep the relevant memes.

       It's because we are most western population in here, and most of us thought media had a scent of reality in it. It turns out it is not. Of course, other countries are just as bad.

       Our media is garbage. Either pointless stories to spew targeted propaganda funded by the highest bidder or to force a biased opinion among the masses. When news is actually relevant it becomes fun to watch.  The dramatization recedes a bit and a more nervous, unorganized cast appear, trying to remain professional looking as they stumble over their half ass research and obvious lack of Intel or knowledge on the subject.

       All "superpowers" indulge in heavy propaganda or else they aren't allowed to play in the big boys clubs. I thought we were finally over fighting based on our nationalities, religious ideology, race etc and as humans would hold ourselves to a higher level of ethics and code of conduct, only to learn years later that the ruling oppressors rather have us fight over imaginary lines in the sand.

       I don't think you should trust anyone on this subreddit. Just forget about people and stay for ideas ( to evaluate critically and crosscheck at will) and news ( crosscheck always king ).

       It's not, I cant find this thread in any list. But I can access the thread because I posted in it. I suspect an admin or a moderator 'hid' this thread from me to give me the illusion that it has been removed after I complained and reported it.

       As it turns out, "Hide" was indeed clicked. But I swear that I didn't click that button. I never click on "Hide". I rule out the possibility that I accidentally hit it.

       I just went and clicked "Hide" on that thread now deliberately. This is the first time I see that fading animation and the disappearance of the thread in front of my eyes. This did

       Will do. I mainly stay on reddit because of the familiarity of the ui, to stay in the loop of what else is being discussed, sentimental attachment since I was a redditor since 2009, and also to wake people up!

       I know many my fellow redditors would not go for this idea, due to the false sense of comfort, and looser tongues, that erroneously perceived anonymity provides. Yet, there is a way to greatly curtail manipulation on a forum like reddit. One would have to able to implement the feature to make it work of course. OK, here it is. Simply disallow anonymous voting as well as vote massaging that alters the true vote count. We could name, criticize, discuss, and call out those who we observe exhibiting a repeating pattern of dishonest voting behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additional features could be applied such as a comment section on every user's account dedicated to grievances against them that, at their own discretion, could be addressed. The validity of the claims made against them coupled with their responses to them, which would never be obfuscated by spam by design, would allow us to weed out posters of low integrity more efficiently. This would make using VPNs and fake accounts to manipulate opinion a more difficult proposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, we need to replace reddit and be very mindful about how it is managed and how the community is informed about the actions of management. That way they can know much better if corruption is taking hold.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know we like to feel anonymous posting, so we can feel free to speak our minds, but by now we should all know that if the powers that be behind the western governments' surveillance systems wanted to know who we are, they could find out. Under these proposed changes we could still be just as anonymous from our colleagues at work and our families.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's face it, a lack of transparency and accountability is what invites the darkness to play with us. We should not allow our fear based illusions stand in the way of better practices that would assist us in overcoming the root causes of our fear based illusions.

       The decrease in comments is because people are waking up to what Reddit has turned into,  a viral marketing mouthpiece for corporations and the political establishments agenda.    This is my last post ever on Reddit.    Censoring and planting stories is the last straw.    Fuck off Reddit.

       Here's the thing though.  Take away all the shills and you still have people in here trying to control the narrative.  Regular members here upvote and downvote based on their preferential version of a conspiracy, instead of based on the quality of the comment.  There's absolutely zero difference when this type of behavior is happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone contributes to the discussion in a quality manner and you disagree with them, you should upvote them, not downvote.  That discourages quality users to quit posting in here.  Vote based on quality.

       Why is everybody so set on "Paid Agents" and "Shills?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Not everyone with a different point of view has necessarily been indoctrinated into or actively part of the media and it's narrative. The thing that's most off-putting is that this mentality gives this sub the credence to the idea of an overarching plot. Which, for most people, is the hardest part to stomach when coming here. The world is a chaotic place and it makes absolutely no sense that everything exists within a unified plan.

       344,568 subscribers to this subreddit and 742 are online at the time of this post. You don't think domestic intelligence agencies would take an interest if there was a public meeting in a town hall to discuss government and media lies, and 700+ people showed up?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Here's some pretty compelling evidence:
       <a href="https://theintercept.com/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/">
        https://theintercept.com/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Among the core self-identified purposes of JTRIG are two tactics: (1) to inject all sorts of false material onto the internet in order to destroy the reputation of its targets; and (2) to use social sciences and other techniques to manipulate online discourse and activism to generate outcomes it considers desirable.
       </p>
       <p>
        To see how extremist these programs are, just consider the tactics they boast of using to achieve those ends: “false flag operations” (posting material to the internet and falsely attributing it to someone else), fake victim blog posts (pretending to be a victim of the individual whose reputation they want to destroy), and posting “negative information” on various forums.
       </p>
       <p>
        Harvard Law Professor Cass Sunstein, a close Obama adviser and the White House’s former head of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, wrote a controversial paper in 2008 proposing that the US government employ teams of covert agents and pseudo-”independent” advocates to “cognitively infiltrate” online groups and websites, as well as other activist groups.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sunstein also proposed sending covert agents into “chat rooms, online social networks, or even real-space groups” which spread what he views as false and damaging “conspiracy theories” about the government.

       That's just posting etiquette. As in "You post online, it can be read by anyone, anywhere. Don't post sensitive information, please." It's the same speech my work gets, as do any organization I teach. It's just common sense in this day and age. It doesn't mean we're all shilling on Reddit.

       LOL.  He holds firm to the shill accusations censorship, protecting certain individuals.  It seems far more often than using the same tools on those usual suspects who come here, refuse to debate facts, and solely exist to ridicule and insult.  Shill 101 behavior to a T.
      </p>
      <p>
       He unfortunately is often far too heavy handed in this highly selective enforcement.  I rarely see any benefit in these sftions to the normal, contributing members of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .  Those we need to stick around most.  And sadly because of this inaction in handling those who harass our user base, many of those people have simply left (of they weren't banned by him already).
      </p>
      <p>
       Is your support based on the fact that he's protected you many times over here?
