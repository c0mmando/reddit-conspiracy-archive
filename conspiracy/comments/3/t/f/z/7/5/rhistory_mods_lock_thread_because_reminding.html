       However, reminding people that MuslimArabsIslam are on a constant Jihad is A-OK, as is denying that the civil war was caused by slavery....

       Gotta make sure that history doesn't get re-revised (a.k.a. corrected). If you follow the money on Pearson PLC, the worlds largest provider of educational text books, you'll notice that they have deep ties with media (Zionist Owned). Also the founder, Samuel Pearson, and his heir, have close ties to the Rothschild family. In general they have a very shady past of investing in media outlets such as the Economist, until they sold their 50% stake in the economist to the rest of the majority holders including, the Rothschild family, the Schroeder family, the Cadbury family, and the Agnelli family of Italy. When you find out what other types of investments these characters have made, it starts to become very alarming that they sit on the board of directors for a company that educates the world.

       That's very interesting about Pearson. It is beyond me how this has anything to do with a locked

       thread, which was locked because the comments devolved to current-day politics, which breaks the rules of

       I guess you're right that it doesn't have much to do with why this post was banned from that specific thread. However, it is important for stories like that of the USS Liberty to once again become common historical knowledge and you would think that
       <a href="/r/history">
        /r/history
       </a>
       would be an acceptable avenue for that information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the OP in
       <a href="/r/history">
        /r/history
       </a>
       wasn't presented in an objective fashion and had an obvious political agenda?

       Nope. If that was the case, the mods would delete the thread. Since it was just the comments, they only locked it.

       It's not soapboxing if you are telling us how guilty we should all feel, and how it totally makes everything Israel does OK, and that it was the worst and only genocide ever.

       Just putting this out there (please read before you judge) while i agree with David Cole that the 6 million figure is absurd and that the majority of deaths were from Typhus, between 300,000-3 million Jews really were killed/starved/worked to death/thrown into filthy labor camps where a disease like Typhus could spread easily. The Nazis were thugs who really did not like the middle class and lower class jewry. They went really easy on the upper class jews (cause you know they needed money) but they definitely did target working class jews with a vengeance. So lets exercise some balance with Holocaust revisionism. Yes we were lied to by the Zionists, no that does not mean the Nazis were good people or not anti-semetic. Its also a lesson to learn from, those labor camp, fear mongering tactics will be used again in the near future either on Americans or on Arab immigrants. So please tread lightly around that subject, the line between informed truth seeker and nazi apologist is rather thin unfortunately. Also the Right Wing extremists in America and Britain are notoriously cooperative with the CIA, FBI and MI6

       I'll even acknowledge that the allies bombed the camps and that the Soviets were killing prisoners (they had their own little holocaust). However this idea that comes up in Holocaust revisionism that not only were no jews killed on purpose but that they wanted to be there is complete tripe. The Nazis really did despise the Jews (except the Bankers who they largely left alone) and they really did use slave labor to build their war machine (as did the allies use prison labor and the commies used gulag labor). So once again lets be balanced, i have german blood and i admire many Germans from that era who got swept up in Nazism (such as Heidegger) its just no principled to wholesale dismiss the crimes of the Nazi regime. At the very least they violated those people's rights and subjected them to inhumane housing and forced labor. At worst they starved them and allowed disease to run rampant unchecked.

       Those are all unsubstantiated neo nazi talking points. There's zero evidence the Nazis were housing the people out of kindness. We have overwhelming evidence they used slave labor and that they despised and arrested jews. Please save it i've already done this research multiple times. I'll grant you there were no gas chambers and they did not mass execute jews

       I'm mot interested in Nazi apologist. I am willing to say that Germany was absolutely hard done by the Treaty of Versailles, the Soviet Occupation and the allied bombing campaign. I'm disgusted with the holocaust laws, the Germanophobia, the demonization of Heidegger and the Gas Chambers lie. That does not change the disgusting nature of Fascism or the Nazi party who were working for American and British capitalists. The Nazis were crypto-occultist illuminati puppets and anyone who falls for National Socialism is beyond helping.

       Jesus Christ they were forced into the fucking camps. That's pure Neo-Nazi bullshit, they actually were doing forced labor and most of the deaths were from starvation and typhus. Like I said lets be BALANCED, i acknowledge that the gas chambers are fake. That does not mean that the Jews just happened to be in the camps and just happened to die en masse. Im not submitting to complete bullshit revisionism.

       How hard it is to go over there, look at the comment the mod left and realize it is about the comments section. If the post itself was current-day politics they would simply have removed it, not gone through all the trouble of allowing it and only locking the comment section.

       No idea, but given the comment the mod left I am pretty sure they were dealing with such a great deal of off-topic non-historic comments that these people that failed to followed the rules ruined it for those looking for a historical discussion.

      <p>
       Even if they had left it unlocked historical discussion probably would have been nearly impossible knowing how politics is discussed on reddit.

       All things considered I think this has been a good middle ground, since they were able to leave the post up so people looking for the subject can still see it. Wouldn't you agree?

       How can politics be separated from history? Also, I don't see any modern politics-related comments there. If an event is political, then discussion would obviously be political in nature. Either remove it completely, or not. Because comments bring up perspectives of every individuals, which a user can go and analyse for himself, and form his opinion.

       Well yeah, as the mod said they have no issue with political discussion in a historical context. They have an issue with current-day politics and specifically soapboxing. In other words using history as method to push their political view. Which has nothing to do with history anymore at that point.

       In what way? Your title clearly implies that you seem to believe that the topic at hand was said to be soapboxing. I just explained that the topic clearly is fine, which you can see in the mod comment. It is the comments and resulting discussion that turned into people soapboxing about current politics.

       Hello Mr. Eugenics! If you had the time to actually read the moderator's post in
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       , you'd have seen this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The warning is aimed at people commenting not the article itself which is indeed historical in nature. Which is why the submission is not removed but commenting is now locked. A lot of people used the context of this submission to talk (or rather, shout) about modern day politics which is something we don't allow. We removed most of those comments but since people kept ignoring this warning we decided to lock the thread instead.
       </p>

       Nay, it is more important that the speech of the minority be protected.

       They are not rulers, they are faithful minions. Their "God" is one of tricks, lies, subversion, manipulation and control and apparently he advises his minions. What a twist, he created and corrupted religion to serve his ends and in every one there is a myth that describes his own nature. His nature is the extreme of competition and self-service even at the expense of others. His minions are to be mid level managers for his slave race.

       Wherever you post on reddit now some bullshit "rule" will either have it removed or say it's the wrong thread... anything with any mention of US political people/events/situations, is pretty much removed, whereas anything saying how shit russia/china/islam is are allowed even when certainly in the same categories...

       The article they linked is a decent place to start.  Also the comments have a few good sources.  Wikipedia has a some decent citations.  If you have any academic searches like Jstore available to you, they have some articles.

       They don't even see it that way that's the problem.  Control what someone watches, reads, and learns from day 1 to 18y/o, and you'll have one compliant citizen ready to do his duty

       Jesus Christ they were forced into the fucking camps. That's pure Neo-Nazi bullshit, they actually were doing forced labor and most of the deaths were from starvation and typhus. Like I said lets be BALANCED, i acknowledge that the gas chambers are fake. That does not mean that the Jews just happened to be in the camps and just happened to die en masse. Im not submitting to complete bullshit revisionism.

       I'll even acknowledge that the allies bombed the camps and that the Soviets were killing prisoners (they had their own little holocaust). However this idea that comes up in Holocaust revisionism that not only were no jews killed on purpose but that they wanted to be there is complete tripe. The Nazis really did despise the Jews (except the Bankers who they largely left alone) and they really did use slave labor to build their war machine (as did the allies use prison labor and the commies used gulag labor). So once again lets be balanced, i have german blood and i admire many Germans from that era who got swept up in Nazism (such as Heidegger) its just no principled to wholesale dismiss the crimes of the Nazi regime. At the very least they violated those people's rights and subjected them to inhumane housing and forced labor. At worst they starved them and allowed disease to run rampant unchecked.

       Those are all unsubstantiated neo nazi talking points. There's zero evidence the Nazis were housing the people out of kindness. We have overwhelming evidence they used slave labor and that they despised and arrested jews. Please save it i've already done this research multiple times. I'll grant you there were no gas chambers and they did not mass execute jews
