    <div class="md"><p>If you observe major trends in politics, then you see both parties&#39; candidates have the same agendas.</p>

<p>In 2000, SNL, continually promoted Bush and Gore as having the same policies. John Kerry and Bush had the same policies. While campaigning from supposedly opposite spectrums, McCain and Obama turned out to have the same policies. Romneycare vs Obamacare came next.</p>

<p>In 2013, all major candidates of this century proposed attacking Syria while public support was 11%. </p>

<p>The &quot;opposing issues&quot; such as abortion, guns, etc. have remained unchanged for decades; never being solved.</p>

<p>As such, as long as the contender maintains the status quo, MSM doesn&#39;t give a shit about the skeletons in the closet. Those come out when a candidate diverges from the narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because most people don&#39;t care about &quot;scandals&quot; anymore.  </p>

<p>Hillary and her crew are doing their level best to convince the world the email &quot;thing&quot; (if you watch, Hillary&#39;s people never call it a scandal.  It&#39;s a situation, or issue) is a manufactured scandal meant to smear her.  </p>

<p>Second, people don&#39;t understand - aren&#39;t being helped to understand - why the email server of the Secretary of State needs to be secure and not used to trade recipes with Aunt Cheryl.  It also hasn&#39;t been adequately explained why the Senate investigative committee wants to read it.  That&#39;s because on that server are likely hundreds of documents linking Ms. Clinton to any number of illegitimate acts as secretary of state.  Collecting 100 million from foreign governments and businesses via her charity foundation, for instance.  </p>

<p>Because if you really looked into that you would see that her service as Secretary of State was not to benefit the US so much as it was to cement her 2016 run to Presidency.  Hillary feels she is the next president.  She is convinced of it and so are most self-identified democrats.  </p>

<p>So.  Why is she still eligible to run?  Because no news agency has the balls to really work that story.  News agencies are not about information anymore, they are about profit via information and to secure their contacts to the White House, the Clinton campaign or any other government body or candidate, they have to maintain good terms with that body or person.  That means the public doesn&#39;t receive information anymore - not relevant information anyway - we receive sound bytes and press releases, vetted by the government and packaged as news and delivered 24/7.  </p>

<p>This process is exactly what the American founders wanted to avoid.  They considered the press a method by which the people were informed in order to hold their elected representatives and leaders accountable and make an informed vote.    Now, the press is merely a mouthpiece for a particular candidate or issue.  </p>

<p>The reason it is not being brought up more is the media doesn&#39;t bring it up more.  Attribute that to what you want.  The stuff that has come out doesn&#39;t point to her having seriously endangered national security, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not there, though you&#39;d expect Wikileaks or someone would release it if it were.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It can&#39;t be verified, nor can it be falsified.  We just have to live with that.</p>

<p>I consider it to be &#39;a network of secret societies working for the same gnositc occult goal of human instrumentality towards ascention in a &#39;great work of alchemy&#39;&#39; in other words, freemasonry, which seems to be the thread that ties them all together as if it&#39;s the marketplace and the individual concerns like the UN, the council on foreign relations, the bilderberg group, the round table, etc.  are the <em>vendors</em></p>

<p>That&#39;s my belief, from what I&#39;ve put together.  Yes, it could be a shadowy org on top of that, but I have no evidence.  People point to a website of the illuminati, and it&#39;s interesting and I&#39;ve been there and read it, but it could just be a compilation / info dump type site.  </p>
