       The "public's apathetic attitude" is only an illusion that is holding popular belief solely because our mainstream media is treating it as if no one cares. But the facts are, the public does care.

       Governments are smarter after every event because as a collective, they learn the mistakes of their predecessors. The governments have learned that as long as the majority of the population remains unharmed, there is no tipping point for revolt. Minor mob mentalities can be quelled. Dangerous ideas, when small, can be quelled. People as a whole on the other hand, seldom do not learn from others' and past mistakes.

       If you observe major trends in politics, then you see both parties' candidates have the same agendas.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2000, SNL, continually promoted Bush and Gore as having the same policies. John Kerry and Bush had the same policies. While campaigning from supposedly opposite spectrums, McCain and Obama turned out to have the same policies. Romneycare vs Obamacare came next.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2013, all major candidates of this century proposed attacking Syria while public support was 11%.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "opposing issues" such as abortion, guns, etc. have remained unchanged for decades; never being solved.
      </p>
      <p>
       As such, as long as the contender maintains the status quo, MSM doesn't give a shit about the skeletons in the closet. Those come out when a candidate diverges from the narrative.

       Because most people don't care about "scandals" anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary and her crew are doing their level best to convince the world the email "thing" (if you watch, Hillary's people never call it a scandal.  It's a situation, or issue) is a manufactured scandal meant to smear her.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, people don't understand - aren't being helped to understand - why the email server of the Secretary of State needs to be secure and not used to trade recipes with Aunt Cheryl.  It also hasn't been adequately explained why the Senate investigative committee wants to read it.  That's because on that server are likely hundreds of documents linking Ms. Clinton to any number of illegitimate acts as secretary of state.  Collecting 100 million from foreign governments and businesses via her charity foundation, for instance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because if you really looked into that you would see that her service as Secretary of State was not to benefit the US so much as it was to cement her 2016 run to Presidency.  Hillary feels she is the next president.  She is convinced of it and so are most self-identified democrats.
      </p>
      <p>
       So.  Why is she still eligible to run?  Because no news agency has the balls to really work that story.  News agencies are not about information anymore, they are about profit via information and to secure their contacts to the White House, the Clinton campaign or any other government body or candidate, they have to maintain good terms with that body or person.  That means the public doesn't receive information anymore - not relevant information anyway - we receive sound bytes and press releases, vetted by the government and packaged as news and delivered 24/7.
      </p>
      <p>
       This process is exactly what the American founders wanted to avoid.  They considered the press a method by which the people were informed in order to hold their elected representatives and leaders accountable and make an informed vote.    Now, the press is merely a mouthpiece for a particular candidate or issue.

       be fair about it. im bye no means a hilary fan.  she did indeed discuss buisness on a private server.     THEY ALL DO... weather or not classified secrets were exchanged is the trick.  its totally a bout making hilary look bad.   most people as fucking sleepy as they are are not gripping the  potential. they just dont see it.   so its a non issue.   no one has the balls to stop her from running.    gossip is all they have. and until there is proof. its gossip.

       People really care about the scandals, but people like Hillary are in tight with the people who own the media outlets, with the people who control what is covered in the "news" and from what angle.

       No charges have been brought against her and even if she had been
       <em>
        convicted
       </em>
       of a felony, that would not render her ineligible.  Technically, you could run for President from jail.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason it is not being brought up more is the media doesn't bring it up more.  Attribute that to what you want.  The stuff that has come out doesn't point to her having seriously endangered national security, but that doesn't mean it's not there, though you'd expect Wikileaks or someone would release it if it were.

       9/11 cannot be brought up enough, especially at a time like this. I really don't think the American public should pay for the crimes of their evil, deceptive governments. We will support you'll if you do something now to write the wrongs. We shouldn't be people living in "terror", especially in this day and age where differences can be discussed and settled like adults.

       What most dont realize though is its not a simple mistake, it's just being played like one.  Combining personal and work emails is 21st century taboo.  It speaks to a person that has no clue about technology.  Not someone we need leading us into tommorow.

       Illuminati is a legitimate group with a well documented ideology. It is an historical fact that such a group exists. I don't know why they club it with outrageous "conspiracies".

       I consider it to be 'a network of secret societies working for the same gnositc occult goal of human instrumentality towards ascention in a 'great work of alchemy'' in other words, freemasonry, which seems to be the thread that ties them all together as if it's the marketplace and the individual concerns like the UN, the council on foreign relations, the bilderberg group, the round table, etc.  are the
       <em>
        vendors
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       That's my belief, from what I've put together.  Yes, it could be a shadowy org on top of that, but I have no evidence.  People point to a website of the illuminati, and it's interesting and I've been there and read it, but it could just be a compilation / info dump type site.
