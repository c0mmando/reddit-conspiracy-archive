       I was a non-believer in the sandy hook issue for a long time.  I honestly thought it might be the love for a "good mystery" taking hold of people in the conspiracy realm and looking for anything, just anything to glom onto.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats including the fact that i had caught a small detail early on regarding the so called school nurse Sally Cox of 25 years, making a supposed mistake when being quoted as saying that Lanza's mom was a teacher there and that he went after her first.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, after all of that there was a lull in the information as info was being arranged for us who can only sit on the sidelines waiting for the real pro's to do their work.  Only after seeing "We need to talk about Sandy Hook" was i just floored at how much i had missed.

       hahahaha... welcome to the club.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 really woke me up.  (@@cough@@Dick Cheny@@cough@@Larry Silverstein@@cough@@)
      </p>
      <p>
       Since, I have begun to realize that 90% of all "terrorist attacks" are staged -- in one way or another -- true "lone wolves" are extremely rare, in reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is to say, if the official story is "lone wolf", and you were at a casino, bet it all on "bullshit", and you will walk out of that casino with a lot of money.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the "tells" is if there is a "drill" associated wit the event.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11: Drill
      </p>
      <p>
       7/7: Drill
      </p>
      <p>
       Sandy Hook:  Drill
      </p>
      <p>
       Boston Bombing: Drill
      </p>
      <p>
       Paris Attacks: Drill
      </p>
      <p>
       And I have further determined that these drills are often legitimate!  But simply "hijacked" by terrorists looking to coordinate attacks at the very moment when officials/authorities are simply expecting a "drill" -- such was the case w/ 9/11, for example.  Everyone at the FAA was so confused because no one knew who the real tourists were and which of the planes were simply "drill planes".
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that is what happened in Paris, recently.  A drill was planned for that same day:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://thefreethoughtproject.com/paris-emergency-crews-practiced-mass-shooting-simulation-hours-prior-terror-attacks/">
        Confirmed: Paris Emergency Crews Held Mass Shooting Drills on Same Day as Terror Attacks
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/11/18/world/science-health-world/paris-er-ranks-just-run-routine-terror-emergency-drill-ready-time-attack/">
        Paris ER ranks had just run routine terror emergency drill, were ready at time of attack
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       ... and Mossad stepped in with some actual terrorism -- left fake Syrian passports -- just to drive home their anti-muslim narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one is buying it any more:  Classic "cry wolf".
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you know how to spot the "tells", it's just so obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Sometimes no one actually dies (as I believe was the case at Sandy Hook),
       </strong>
       though "they" (internationally: primarily Mossad with the assistance from the CIA &amp; MI6; domestically: the FBI w/ Homeland Security™) have been getting desperate to "prove" attacks are real.  So they have started actually killing people more and more.  It's all so fucked up.

       Could be that the elementary school nurse is the one that first got his Mom to put him on meds that fucked him up royally. There are serious cover-ups and probably payola ongoing in the Sandy Hook saga; maybe one day we'll know the truth and I would bet anything the pharmaceutical companies and school system are neck deep involved in the conspiracies involved in the coverup of motive. Sick shit, too, considering how many kids were killed and how many others have been killed since then by others affected in similar ways - that if these people just had integrity and spoke out, they could avoid so many other murders and suicides.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no, keep it quiet, keep it quiet. Gotta protect our pharma holdings. Sick people.

       I am disappointed you're still trying to push this absurd "SSRIs caused Sandy Hook" disinfo theory, even after all this time. It should be obvious to anybody who has spent time looking into Sandy Hook that the event was multi-agency drill with a "school shooting" narrative superimposed onto it. You've learned absolutely nothing from your time on

       I can sleep at night, though. My conscience is clean. I can't see how yours can possibly be at peace pushing falsehoods that allow more people to die (and more kids' lives totally fucked even if they survive adults' bullshit drug-pushing) on a daily. :(

       That's a hilariously flimsy strawman, because I have never said anything remotely positive about big pharma in 8 years on reddit. Whatever problems there are with SSRIs, you can't blame them for a shooting that never actually happened.

       I tagged you a long time ago as an [unmentionable], for your ludicrous attempts to peddle disinfo on Sandy Hook, and you're still at it, trying to shore up the official narrative that this was a "real" event.

       You should visit the US and find out how common crimes like this occur. Or, just select any city in the US and read their local paper, maybe follow their local city-based gossipy "Facebook pages." It's cheaper, and just as effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       These mass murders can't all be hoaxes. And something like this is too big and touches too many people to be hoaxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       By pushing the "X never happened" narrative, you further the goals of the criminals responsible for the murders--I urge you to do a little more research outside of YouTubes and paid propagandists.

       You argue like a GMO pusher, and that's all I need to know, so the rest of this is for onlookers:
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone reading this actually interested in the deception and not the black propaganda being pushed by pharmaceutical companies and their advocates to hide what caused the massacre and other massacres across the United States: look into the "Dark Knight" rumors and the Attorney General's statements. Also check out the info about the Xanax-taking, face-eating chimpanzee and the radio show call-in. Also, Aurora. Whenever you see "it never happened" kind of Internet rumors - see them for what they are - a deliberate obfuscation to keep anyone from further investigation into the crimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       See how what Sabremesh is pushing works?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're into conspiracy theories, you can only glom onto the "it's all fake" black propaganda or you're "a deceiver." If you're a normal person trying to investigate, you are suddenly tarred as an insane person who believes "everything is fake."
      </p>
      <p>
       When you see bullshit stories that are obviously fake - understand who's pushing it and why and know there are REAL, dangerous conspiracies behind them, and don't let people like Sabremesh or assholes like
       <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">
        /r/topmindsofreddit
       </a>
       folks keep you from searching for the truth behind all the propaganda.

       A truly idiotic statement. I have an 8 year comment history that people can check - and see you're a liar. I challenge anyone to find something I wrote that promotes (or even defends) big pharma in any way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your attempt to conflate Sandy Hook with real shooting events (in which the killers may well have been on SSRIs) is transparent and, frankly, not very clever, because anybody can see what you're trying to do.

       It's weird that you get so upset about my views that you feel compelled to attack and insult me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, I don't care if you're "disappointed" in me and I question your motives in so angrily attacking and insulting me here for simply mentioning (to another user) my own theories about Sandy Hook.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are you so pissed at me for it? Why the ad hominems and weird attack methods reminiscent of GMO flacks? Why no honest and respectful discourse?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's interesting, for sure, but it makes me sad.

       I was in the initial skepticism. The original hoax video had me at goosebumps. Them, family, friends, everyone. "How could you criticize thaty those children died! ". I felt so outcasted. Also, the Internet died down from it as it does wirth trends. Then, I watched these exact two videos in a row. ... I wad physically sick. The strange deaths since, the wolfgang halbig foia hearing. I truly believe in my lifetime someone will crack, and some contorted new version of the truth will come out.

       “If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it. The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the State.”

       I'm really undecided about what happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it is certainly not the official story they gave us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even through I think it is a joke that everything was redacted because lawdy,lawdy the children's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why was everything redacted on two adults!? Lanza and his mother.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at how the parents at Coloumbine acted, they pushed for everything to be made public in hopes of stopping other school shootings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not one lawsuit against "I can't wait to go shooting with you" Daddy Lanza!?
      </p>
      <p>
       And instead of selling the Lanza house like in any other estate it  is sold to the town for $1 and demolished.
      </p>
      <p>
       The NDA the construction crews tearing down the school had to sign.

       That whole Roig bathroom story is such bullshit a gallon of Febreze wouldn't make a dent in the stench.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't recall what forum it was but someone actually tested it out, with children at a party (they made it into a game for the kids) and it was absolutely impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't forget she was also able to pull a bookcase in front of the magic bathroom door.

       She also has a book out peddling her BS.

       The law passed about children's death certificates.

       There are photos and videos of Daniel Rohrbough dying alone on the sidewalk outside of Columbine all over the internet.

       But Connecticut needed a law to stop people seeing basic death certificates!?
