    <div class="md"><p>I was a non-believer in the sandy hook issue for a long time.  I honestly thought it might be the love for a &quot;good mystery&quot; taking hold of people in the conspiracy realm and looking for anything, just anything to glom onto.</p>

<p>Thats including the fact that i had caught a small detail early on regarding the so called school nurse Sally Cox of 25 years, making a supposed mistake when being quoted as saying that Lanza&#39;s mom was a teacher there and that he went after her first.</p>

<p>Anyway, after all of that there was a lull in the information as info was being arranged for us who can only sit on the sidelines waiting for the real pro&#39;s to do their work.  Only after seeing &quot;We need to talk about Sandy Hook&quot; was i just floored at how much i had missed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hahahaha... welcome to the club.</p>

<p>9/11 really woke me up.  (@@cough@@Dick Cheny@@cough@@Larry Silverstein@@cough@@)</p>

<p>Since, I have begun to realize that 90% of all &quot;terrorist attacks&quot; are staged -- in one way or another -- true &quot;lone wolves&quot; are extremely rare, in reality.  </p>

<p>That is to say, if the official story is &quot;lone wolf&quot;, and you were at a casino, bet it all on &quot;bullshit&quot;, and you will walk out of that casino with a lot of money.</p>

<p>One of the &quot;tells&quot; is if there is a &quot;drill&quot; associated wit the event.</p>

<p>9/11: Drill</p>

<p>7/7: Drill</p>

<p>Sandy Hook:  Drill</p>

<p>Boston Bombing: Drill</p>

<p>Paris Attacks: Drill</p>

<p>And I have further determined that these drills are often legitimate!  But simply &quot;hijacked&quot; by terrorists looking to coordinate attacks at the very moment when officials/authorities are simply expecting a &quot;drill&quot; -- such was the case w/ 9/11, for example.  Everyone at the FAA was so confused because no one knew who the real tourists were and which of the planes were simply &quot;drill planes&quot;.</p>

<p>I believe that is what happened in Paris, recently.  A drill was planned for that same day:</p>

<p><a href="http://thefreethoughtproject.com/paris-emergency-crews-practiced-mass-shooting-simulation-hours-prior-terror-attacks/">Confirmed: Paris Emergency Crews Held Mass Shooting Drills on Same Day as Terror Attacks</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/11/18/world/science-health-world/paris-er-ranks-just-run-routine-terror-emergency-drill-ready-time-attack/">Paris ER ranks had just run routine terror emergency drill, were ready at time of attack</a></p>

<p>... and Mossad stepped in with some actual terrorism -- left fake Syrian passports -- just to drive home their anti-muslim narrative.</p>

<p>No one is buying it any more:  Classic &quot;cry wolf&quot;.</p>

<p>Once you know how to spot the &quot;tells&quot;, it&#39;s just so obvious.</p>

<p><strong>Sometimes no one actually dies (as I believe was the case at Sandy Hook),</strong> though &quot;they&quot; (internationally: primarily Mossad with the assistance from the CIA &amp; MI6; domestically: the FBI w/ Homeland Security™) have been getting desperate to &quot;prove&quot; attacks are real.  So they have started actually killing people more and more.  It&#39;s all so fucked up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could be that the elementary school nurse is the one that first got his Mom to put him on meds that fucked him up royally. There are serious cover-ups and probably payola ongoing in the Sandy Hook saga; maybe one day we&#39;ll know the truth and I would bet anything the pharmaceutical companies and school system are neck deep involved in the conspiracies involved in the coverup of motive. Sick shit, too, considering how many kids were killed and how many others have been killed since then by others affected in similar ways - that if these people just had integrity and spoke out, they could avoid so many other murders and suicides. </p>

<p>But no, keep it quiet, keep it quiet. Gotta protect our pharma holdings. Sick people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should visit the US and find out how common crimes like this occur. Or, just select any city in the US and read their local paper, maybe follow their local city-based gossipy &quot;Facebook pages.&quot; It&#39;s cheaper, and just as effective.</p>

<p>These mass murders can&#39;t all be hoaxes. And something like this is too big and touches too many people to be hoaxes.</p>

<p>By pushing the &quot;X never happened&quot; narrative, you further the goals of the criminals responsible for the murders--I urge you to do a little more research outside of YouTubes and paid propagandists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You argue like a GMO pusher, and that&#39;s all I need to know, so the rest of this is for onlookers:</p>

<p>Anyone reading this actually interested in the deception and not the black propaganda being pushed by pharmaceutical companies and their advocates to hide what caused the massacre and other massacres across the United States: look into the &quot;Dark Knight&quot; rumors and the Attorney General&#39;s statements. Also check out the info about the Xanax-taking, face-eating chimpanzee and the radio show call-in. Also, Aurora. Whenever you see &quot;it never happened&quot; kind of Internet rumors - see them for what they are - a deliberate obfuscation to keep anyone from further investigation into the crimes.</p>

<p>See how what Sabremesh is pushing works? </p>

<p>If you&#39;re into conspiracy theories, you can only glom onto the &quot;it&#39;s all fake&quot; black propaganda or you&#39;re &quot;a deceiver.&quot; If you&#39;re a normal person trying to investigate, you are suddenly tarred as an insane person who believes &quot;everything is fake.&quot;</p>

<p>When you see bullshit stories that are obviously fake - understand who&#39;s pushing it and why and know there are REAL, dangerous conspiracies behind them, and don&#39;t let people like Sabremesh or assholes like <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a> folks keep you from searching for the truth behind all the propaganda.</p>

<p>A truly idiotic statement. I have an 8 year comment history that people can check - and see you&#39;re a liar. I challenge anyone to find something I wrote that promotes (or even defends) big pharma in any way.</p>

<p>Your attempt to conflate Sandy Hook with real shooting events (in which the killers may well have been on SSRIs) is transparent and, frankly, not very clever, because anybody can see what you&#39;re trying to do.</p>
