       Wait, are you really trying to claim that religion itself isn't a sheep mentality?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's been the single greatest source of brainwashing in modern history. Ever wondered why Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are so closely tied into each other? That wasn't by mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Atheism can be used in a similar way, but this analogy is just slightly misguided unless you apply it to more than just atheism.

       Not just that, but the similarity in
       <em>
        belief
       </em>
       . As I've stated before in this thread, you can present aaaaall the evidence out there to a sheep that 9/11 was a false flag, and at the end of it all he would still go "I don't believe this". Even when presented undeniable proof he would go 'nope'.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think "belief" is actually something very complicated that would take forever to really get a grasp on. I don't understand what makes someone belief or disbelief in something at all. I'm talking about the very fabrics of belief.

       Which concept is truthful?  If you compare 9/11 truth folk to religious folk then I'd say over half the world believes in a deity where only really awakened folk believe our govt is deep  enough to control the world's narrative.

       In that case not believing in anything is a religion. Which means that everything once considered and not believed in is a religion. Which means there are about a quintillion religions out there. Which means that religion is a meaningless term. But religion IS a term with meaning. So atheism is not a religion. It's a judgment.

      <p>
       This is a matter of semantics, because the deity of atheists is that there is no deity. Most atheists are fanatical about this, refusing to change unless they do some DMT or something similar that basically forces the realization that life is so much more than what meets the eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       Agnostics don't have a particular belief one way or another,
       <strong>
        atheists believe that there is nothing greater
       </strong>
       . This is an important distinction.

      <p>
       Or if they see solid evidence of a deity. Atheists do not believe that there is no purpose, or supernatural superior being/deity, it is simply that they have not been presented with any evidence for such an entity/entities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Belief doesn't come into it, at least not for me. If evidence is ever revealed that there is a god/deity or higher supernatural power, then I won't believe in it, because with evidence, one won't have to believe in it, in the same way that I don't believe in friction or gravity, I just know they exist, unambiguously, because my particles are not flying around at the speed of light, and I can literally feel friction by touching things.

       Again, this statement ought to be re-written to say that atheists have not been provided with any evidence that shows god (or a higher power) exists.

        If evidence is ever revealed that there is a god/deity or higher supernatural power, then I won't believe in it, because with evidence, one won't have to believe in it, in the same way that I don't believe in friction or gravity, I just know they exist, unambiguously, because my particles are not flying around at the speed of light, and I can literally feel friction by touching things.

       Atheists like to believe they are some kind of neutral unbiased people, and for many that may be the case. For many others, it's a form of fanatical nihilism.

       "Evidence" varies depending on who is doing the evaluating.

       On a quantum level observation changes reality, and the effect often precedes the cause (some elementary statements I know, but applicable).

       Nassim Haramein's work in particular is very relevant to my point. We are all inherently part of the same universal field.

      <h2>
       Atheism is not a religion. At least in the way in which you could only be implying.
      </h2>
      <p>
       religion:
1 the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, especially a personal God or gods.
▸ a particular system of faith and worship.
      </p>
      <h2>
       2 a pursuit or interest followed with great devotion.
      </h2>
      <p>
       Definition 2 doesn't even apply. Atheists (unfortunately) don't commune together to intellectually pursue and validate each other. There is no point.
      </p>
      <p>
       The atheist says no persuasive argument for the existence of God has ever been advanced or adduced without convincing rebuttal. No argument in favor stands (or has been found to stand: the test of argument and evidence. We cannot say that we know that there could be no such entity.

       Atheism is a "Know System" as in what is known is followed and used as a tool of understanding. The quest to learn more is our goal, and the strength to avoid assumption is our struggle.

       What you regard as 'know' (science) is what I believe can also be called a 'belief'. People trust and believe in science because it holds subjective truths for them. They keep trusting in science even if it's ever-changing and ever self-updating. So you could make the argument that people favor science over religion continously believe in a system that never stays stable. Their belief in the system stays constant. You can write all you want about the supposedly beauty of that and how people like that keep an open mind about the ever changing search for truth but the objective description of the situation stands.
Mind you that I am not disregarding science at all. Science is a tool of understanding like you said. It's only when people choose to elevate science above religion in the hunt for understanding of our reality that it becomes a problem.

       Your understanding of science is very incorrect. Science defines what can be reproduced as a known cause and consequence of events. Trials and studies are performed on many sides of the earth by many different people and the se results can be reached.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Truth is YOU lack the understanding that through scientific measurment the world has 0 proof of supernatural events. Nothing says coverup more then a collective effort to manufacture a story. Religion is the largest coverup in history.

       God may be real, it aint abraham, molech, jesus, or baal anything created by the mind of man is not supernatural it is "natural". Thus our god theory is of our own creation and that it itself is an example of

       Personally (only speaking for myself just drive the point home) It's not hard for me to believe that we have been lied to about 9/11.  But it is extremely difficult for me to believe that god put a single man and single woman on the earth with a talking snake and an apple tree then only a few thousand years later here we all are.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would be more apt to believe the critical thinkers who don't believe in a higher power would be the ones to questions and be skeptical of the official 9/11 narrative, but hey it's your post pal.

       Wait, what are you saying is the older and bigger lie?  Religion or atheism?  Because I would say religion is the oldest lie. Although no one can definitively prove there is or isn't a higher power so really this whole thing is futile anyway.

       As ever, the liars are using them both against you. Follow the money, cui-bono, who can't be criticized, which stories seem designed to prevent inquiry, and neutralize your power. Just do the same thing you did for 9-11, but on a grander scale. There is a reason that Jesus knew the devil as the father of lies.

       I don't know if following money will lead me to the conclusion you think it will.  For example if I follow the money and who stands to profit in religion (let's only use Catholicism to keep it simple) it leads straight to the Vatican. If I follow the money in Atheism... well... there aren't exactly collection plates in atheism so my money stays in my wallet. Also with an atheistic outlook such as mine I can criticize anyone I want. There are no stories, so nothing to really prevent inquiry. And so far nothing about my views have neutralized my power.

       I would say "atheism" is the bigger lie. I put that in quotes because back in the day it wasn't very much atheism that was the lie, but the myths and deities people made up that was the lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we want to phrase this correctly. The bigger lie is the lie against the idea of a One and Only God.
People made up various religions like the Romans and their planet worship. Sun worshippers, this that. But the very first religious idea was always that of a One and Only God.

       This paragraph doesn't present the argument you think it does and, in fact, demonstrates the exact principle of "sheep" that you started this topic to discuss. The first monotheistic religion was Egyptian Atenism, pre-dating the supposed existence of Moses by several hundred years. How about Noah? Virtually the entire Flood account is copy-pasted from the blatantly polytheistic Epic of Gilgamesh. But those are lies spread by the devil to lead you astray, aren't they?

       A really simple look at evolution, but one I want to present anyway...

       When you look at all the animals on the earth, you can see that there is a
       <em>
        certain
       </em>
       similarity to them. They all act in a sort of similar way. It's hard to describe. As if they have no thoughts or continuous consciousness.  How can it be that
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       those animals evolved their consciousness in a similar way, but it was just the Homo Sapiens who developed in such a completely unique direction?

       The Evolution theory is just that, a theory.

       Evolution is reality.  Evolution is the result of the dialectic.  Consciousness evolved just like everything else.  If I (230pounds of meat and water) can have consciousness then there is no reason a planet our even the universe can't have a consciousness.   God did not create the universe...the universe gave birth to god.  The god of being verses the god of becoming.  One is an absurd impossibility the other is a certainty.

       I hate generalizations.  I'm courageous enough to accept other people's opinions and not be the asshole you describe in your post.  I'm a devout Athiest (har har).  To me, part of being an Atheist is to acknowledge and respect the power of a person's brain to process information and to make their own choices.  I respect people's beliefs until they become overzealous or attack me for my own.  It's what any decent human being would do.

       The simple fact that you refer to people that do not accept conspiracy bullcrap as 'sheep' is very telling of your mental and intellectual maturity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the fact that you present both highly contented claims (the 9/11 conspiracy and the existence of God) as 'truthful concepts' without keeping the door open for a rational discussion on these subjects or presenting even a single argument supporting your claims, is not really inviting people to honour you with an actual, honest answer.

       I had to decide on a word to refer to them. I could have gone with the 'brainwashed' or 'the ignorant masses' but decided to go with 'sheep' because it was the simplest example. Being politically correct was not what I considered when I made my post.

       I understand your second paragraph. I was just trying to make a point clear and I was in a mindset of doing it fast and dirty. But what do you know, the majority of the people here understood my point underneath the meme-ish post and went on to having a rational discussion anyway. Almost the whole thread is filled with just that.

       Being intellectualy mature and recognizing the false flag nature of 9/11 are not connected. One person who is cognative dissonence effected and in denial may be smarter then the other who admits the corruption and rogue federal govt. In the sense of living a normal life, ignorance is bliss.

       If you doubt the use of paid CIA soilders aka Bin Laden, too fabricate an enemy and bring about war that was designed by Gen Wesley Clark called A Plan For A New American Century then you havnt been paying attention. OR you have Cognative dissonance and keep it buried. Sheep? Only those who have No Clue. Those are Sheep. If you know and bury it deep inside Id consider you more a turtle, hiding in your shell of fear.

       If you are willing enough to dive in it, you can find proof of god. Here I just googled "scientific proof of God" and found various articles from a scientific background.

       Besides, to reinstate it
       <em>

        still

       disbelief that 9/11 was a false flag.

       You make me laugh, Hard! OK you just suggested that the guy in your youtube vid ( suggested proof of god) makes claims you hope I will consider and give an opinion on. Here is the basic issue. Science does not need my opinion, science is not about claims, well atleast those we prove untrue. Science is about fact of discovery from a reproducable test. Which ofcoarse is NOT shown in any video about the  argument of existence for God. If there was any creditable information in this suggested video MIT and Stanford along with many others would be testing the idea to prove it as truth. Till we have solid evidence, claims are bullshit.

       This is just psychological behavior in response to opposing ideas, when someone shits on your belief it kinda pisses you off, doesn't it?

      <p>
       It's something everyone does from time to time, some more than others. You're reading into it too much, and it looks like you may be a victim of it yourself in a roundabout way.

       Since belief is an opinion, it should be presented as such. For instance, I believe our consciousness (or what is perceived to be) is recycled or transferred through some yet-unknown mechanism, similar to how everything in existence is broken down and reused. While it's based on factual observations, it's merely a belief I hold which can't be proven or dis-proven yet, and don't expect others to share the same idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the difference here is when presented with real, observable evidence with repeatable science, the sheep hides and refuses to absorb any knowledge or truth given beyond that point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a feeling that if atheists saw irrefutable proof of a sentient creator, such as the creators actual appearance and manipulation of reality with just their being, they might change their minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's much harder to prove that something or someone you can't normally see, hear, taste, touch, or smell doesn't exist in the first place.

       So you are saying that 9-11 is as true as the existence of God?
      </p>
      <p>
       Thing is we have evidence and can prove the official 9-11 story has major flaws and holes.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how about just explaining why do you personally think that believing in a God is a truthful concept?  A book? Some one told you?

       See my previous comment to another post. Except "god" is more understood as "existence itself" in my perspective. And even then I'm not even talking about the bible's old white man in a dress with a beard and feet sitting on a magical chair that sits on clouds in the 10th aeon of the highest sephirot. That's just stilly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Or if you want to say that there needs to be a consciousness for a "god" situation to be happening, then what is/has "consciousness"? Maybe you go all native and say that everything has a consciousness. So the consciousness of earth might be god class, and the sun be a god in a class above, and the galaxy a god in a class above that, and a cluster above that, universe... -fades out- You get the idea. So if you don't want to call all of these one class... i dunno... angel class, demon class, demigod class, spirit class... lol... or whatever you like. Celestial, Astral, Divine, Minstrel, Dragon, Sylvari, Charr, Gryffondor.... as long as you're talking about a specific thing.

       I'm not an atheist I just hold no religious beliefs, if fact I hold very little beliefs and prefer facts. So I think it would be a bit of a stretch to call me a sheep. I also think that atheists are infinitely smarter for stringently believing in nothing when compared to their counterparts who believe in little angels and the big man up in the sky.

       that there is
       <em>

       Heya! I'm about to get weird on you. First off, non-existence isn't a thing. But for this conversation you have to accept that your understanding of time doesn't mean much if anything past the 4th dimension and that there is a multiverse. If you'll humor that, let's continue.
      </p>
      <p>
       So let's talk about non-existence and why it can't exist. Existence is the difference between "thing" and "no-thing", with existence being the "force" that animates things. Well... imagine there are no things. If there are truly no things, not even empty space, then you'd have no no-thing either. With a thing, there's nothing to make the comparison (thing is missing) and so no nothing. So you have no thing, no nothing, but this is the multiverse. That means there are still things "out there". To truly have an instance of non-existence, those things "out there" would have to not only not exist, but never existed. This nonexistence literally can't happen because we're having this conversation. It's not a thing, and nothing is a whole different concept. To even give it a title means that there's a thought involved, and so it's not non-existence. Non-existence, as a term, is a bandaid to discuss a concept you can't actually name or technically talk about. Because what are you talking about? Etc. etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now let's go even more quantum. Just humor me further on this. Let's say that in the 10th Dimension, you have all waves of probability that could ever be for every thing, situation, moment, event, etc. etc. How does one collapse a wave function in this case? Observation. So to observe things on the 10th dimension... yooooou'd pretty much need to nee to be all seeing and have a conscious capable of comprehending what's going on. At the level of seeing everything forever, you pretty much have to decide (say) what you want to observe. And so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       So even if that is a logical understanding of the Divine, the next question is: is it taking the information of what's happening in (passive observation) or is it more or less projecting its will down through the dimensions (active observation) or just yes? Probably just yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then you can take that further and it's not a god-"proof" but more of a soul-"proof". Using "proof" as a "catch all/you know what I mean". But that's a whole other conversation involving planes of existence that only theoretically exist, maybe. :D

       No, that's fine, I have a basic grasp of multi-verse theory--then again, any proper geek does. Problem is, I believe that while yeah, there are other universes out there, we're either all cut off, or cut off in such a way that passage between them is
       <del>
        impossible
       </del>
       exceedingly difficult, for matter or energy.

      <p>
       I'll offer a counter to this, using purely physical and biological principles. What is a soul? What is intellect? Near as we can tell, it's electro-chemical impulses jumping between neurons, flipping biological bits in the brain to store data. Your brain is a living computer, in essence.
      </p>
      <p>
       But let's dumb it down further, eliminate some biology. Imagine a light bulb. Power goes to the bulb, runs through the filament in a vacuum, and produces light and heat. Shatter the bulb. What happens to the electricity running through the filament in those last few seconds? Where does it go? What happens to the electricity flowing through your processor and ram if you suddenly pull the plug? Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, but it can change state. It bleeds off as light and heat, escaping as cosmic background radiation. Entropy. And once it's gone from those various parts, it has no access to your data storage or emotional centers. So, what makes you
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       rots, while the power fueling your brain bleeds off into space, bouncing around and mixing with the rest of the heat, completely non-sentient.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like your idea better and I've had the thought before. It is pretty much the one possibility that I'm wrong and gives me any hope whatsoever. But hope, as I've come to learn time and again, is a fairy tale we tell ourselves to convince us things really aren't as bad as they are.

       but then i almost literally have to ask about where that energy is coming from in your light bulb analogy. What is that special... bioelectromagnetic... "ummph" that animates a body? You can't just shock a corpse and expect it to animate. You can make a heart run but not a whole body.

       Most 'atheists' subscribe to faith-based belief. Ask an 'atheist' for their proof in human evolution, the big bang, or even the existence of dinosaurs. They will refer you to their clergy (which their faith calls 'scientists'). This does not mean that their beliefs are wrong, simply that it is based on faith. This

       Labeling a "trust in evidence" as a "belief" is a BS move from the religious upon the atheist. Let us ignore the "cleric" smear and posit that most atheists do believe scientists, without question. The religious cleric bases their knowledge on a static, iron-age text, whereas the "science cleric" bases their knowledge on a growing, evolving picture of reality. The "faith" of the atheist in this analogy comes from a trust in the systematic exploration of the real, whereas religious faith comes from belief in an invisible friend and his apologists. Equating the two is insincere.
