        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Something was triggered when Russia went into Syria and destroyed ISIS. The Western powers appear to have lost there minds and suddenly it&#39;s no longer about ISIS in Syria. Now it&#39;s ISIS attacking and planning on attacking every country that is actually behind ISIS.</p>

<p>Considering the announcement Putin has just made about Western backing of ISIS, this major false flag global distraction away from Putins message is starting to make sense. The timing is very suspicious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would explain it like this. Fox is blatantly biased towards / a propaganda arm of the GOP, so right away half of Americans are going to hate them. MSNBC is blatantly biased towards corporatism, and more subtly towards the DNC. CNN is biased towards a false neutrality between both resulting in debates about &#39;whether terrorism is bad or not&#39;.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, all are biased towards total horseshit and an insult to intelligent journalism. </p>

<p>I fail to understand how it isn&#39;t crystal clear to everyone that these propaganda networks simply exist to push narratives and sway public opinion in the direction of their own private interests. After-all, they are owned by private corporations. Why are they taken seriously?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. This will result in Iran and Syria being toppled in short order. The question is whether or not Putin is bluffing, in on it, or will respond in some way to prevent this. </p>

<p>My gut says there is no way this can escalate and is going perfectly according to plan. The whole globe is paralyzed in fear, any action by Putin or China will turn all Western Powers and their allies/sympathizers against them. </p>

<p>With the focus on ISIS it gives all leaders a chance to further their goals. </p>

<p>At the expense of middle eastern and East/West soldiers&#39; lives. And of course at the expense of freedom, liberty and privacy for all who are not running the show.</p>

<p>Or the wheels have come off and we are mostly all dead by year&#39;s end.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

I think we are about to see Obama, Putin, et al &quot;narrowly avoid WW3&quot; at some point in the future so that the globe can rejoice in peace and harmony but not before ramping up the global &quot;war on terror&quot; to include all nations importing trained muslim soldiers as &quot;refugees&quot; into their countries for the purposes of fast-tracking the full suite of Big Brother &quot;anti-terror&quot; legislation and commencing the full enslavement of humanity.</p>

I feel that everyone should watch it during the big events...not as a source of information, but to just experience it. You can feel how they try to induce panic and fear. They talk and act upset with urgency in their voices and and frightened looks on their faces...and that&#39;s just the anchors.

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely.  I was flipping through the MSM &quot;news&quot; outlets and HOLY FUCK, the fear mongering strong with these ones.
      Nothing but &quot;ISIS is going to attack D.C. and the rest of america&quot;  and &quot;We need more boots on the ground&quot; and all the military &quot;experts&quot; saying our military is only 30% ready to go to battle because they need more money for training and that the military is being severely underfunded.
  It was hilarious. TPTB don&#39;t even have to try anymore. It&#39;s right in front of our face yet nothing will or can be done. The masses have spoken. Convenience over confrontation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a great, great video game I&#39;d play years ago called Freedom Fighters, in which you&#39;re an average Joe in America, and suddenly Russia invades and occupies. You take up arms, and join with others over time to form the foundation of the Freedom Fighters uprising against this tyranny. One of the key elements in this game is that Russian tv, and media propaganda is what keeps your Freedom Fighting abilities restricted,  as the populace is limited in their ability to fight back because of mass fear via the propaganda.</p>

<p>What you do in the game is, you take a large group with you and you basically start to take over the news/media broadcasting stations one by one, and you spread the truth. This won you more followers en masse, than fighting locally ever did, but everyone has to start at the grassroots level. My point is, the only way to beat the media, is to fight the media... and for that, we need revolution and willing fighters. The only reason people won&#39;t change is because they see the government as the only form of leadership, even if they realise that leadership is a huge liability, they feel useless to act. </p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t been exposed to the evening network news such as ABC, CBS and NBC for a while, to watch it is to witness something that I find very disturbing.  They are so obviously targeting their audiences emotions to invoke panic and fear. They are obviously showing people at events that are &quot;posing&quot; for the cameras to visually aid in invoking these fears in people...and the Narrative goes on no matter to what degree it has been proven false.</p>

<p>Here are a couple of <a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/08/10/210686255/a-sense-of-power-can-do-a-number-on-your-brain">easy</a> <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2778336/Power-REALLY-does-head-Giving-people-taste-authority-corrupt-honest-members-group.html">reads</a> to get you started.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had heard of the power/empathy connection but enjoyed the read. The solution? Disempower MOST of the entities that have taken power. The divisions of government set up by the founders were meant to &quot;balance&quot; power. In a sense to frustrate the power of the other branches. Laws, enforced are also a way to limit the power mad.  </p>

<p>In today&#39;s America too many groups have power, each exerting their own cruel hand, but like metastasized cancer it has spread to NGO&#39;s like the CFR, Neocons, Thinktanks, and worst of all, unfettered oligarch and super rich. With this tsunami of disparate groups all grabbing with bloody claws, at this point, the best we could do now is pit them against each other? I speak now of the Soros, Koch, Gates, Kagan, Murdock, all the recent Secretaries of Treasury. As they become mega rich they become mega cruel. Lop of their heads?</p>

<p>Edit: Better answer. Return to the 90% top tax bracket. Take away tax exemption from all entities. Make the President accountable, Congress Accountable, and Fully staff the Supreme Court but depoliticize it (somehow). </p>

<p>One interesting idea comes from traditional Somali law (&quot;Xeer&quot; if you want to read more about it).  They scale punishments according to power.  If an elder or judge commits a crime, the punishment is expanded (sometimes by many times) because they have more power to hurt people for their own profit and therefore require a greater disincentive.</p>

<p>This is untrue from a general standpoint, let alone mind control effects.</p>

<p>WiFi and cellphones alone emit radiation off of them, never mind intentional control. Plenty of studies have been done showing potential negative effects of cellphones in particular. </p>

<p>Even the wiki page on ELFs states that these particular frequencies can cause observable nervous system changes even though your average individual may not be exposed to the levels necessary for this to occur....on a physical level it&#39;s not far fetched whatsoever:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>October 2005, WHO convened a Task Group of scientific experts to assess any risks to health that might exist from &quot;exposure to ELF electric and magnetic fields in the frequency range &gt;0 to 100,000 Hz (100 kHz) in regards to childhood leukaemia.&quot;[18] There are established biological effects from acute exposure at high levels (well above 100 µT) that are explained by recognized biophysical mechanisms. External ELF magnetic fields induce electric fields and currents in the body which, at very high field strengths, cause nerve and muscle stimulation and changes in nerve cell excitability in the central nervous system. Health effects related to short-term, high-level exposure have been established and form the basis of two international exposure limit guidelines (ICNIRP, 1998; IEEE, 2002). At present, these bodies consider the scientific evidence related to possible health effects from long-term, low-level exposure to ELF fields insufficient to justify lowering these quantitative exposure limits. The long-term, low-level exposure is evaluated as average exposure to residential power-frequency magnetic field above 0.3 to 0.4 µT, and it is estimated that only between 1% and 4% of children live in such conditions.[18] A common source of ELF fields in the United States is 60 Hz electric and magnetic fields from high-voltage electric power transmission lines and secondary distribution lines, such as those found in residential neighborhoods.[17][18][26] The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has evaluated the scientific data and has classified ELF magnetic fields as being &quot;possibly carcinogenic&quot; to humans. IARC based this classification on the following:
Human health population studies showing weak evidence of an association with childhood leukemia; and a large database of laboratory study results showing inadequate evidence of an association with cancer in animals.[citation needed]
In summary, when all of the studies are evaluated together, the evidence suggesting that EMFs may contribute to an increased risk of cancer is very weak.[27][28] Epidemiological studies suggest a possible association between long term occupational exposure to ELF and Alzheimer&#39;s disease.[29][30] </p>

A frequency is not the pattern but it can make patterns especially with wave interference wherein certain particularly evocative frequencies effect the mind and have been demonstrated to cause, fear, anger, emotionality, low or even higher brain function. They were broadcast over Iraq, perhaps the reason they surrendered readily. You can evoke impending doom, the feeling of being watched, nausea, scatter-mindedness, dare I say be so disruptive as to make people appear to be discoordinated zombies so frightening, almost decerebrate, worthy of being shot by those unaware of what is causing it: now there&#39;s a weapon, get your enemies to kill each other!  </p>

I also saw a building just come just come down. No planes hit it or anything. I looked further into the vision and saw President Bush giving the presidency to a black President.  What are your down votes gonna do?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe. But that&#39;s not at all what&#39;s happening. You haven&#39;t shown any evidence that such never stimulation can affect neurons not that the neurons can lead to different thought. Most importantly, you haven&#39;t shown this could even be controlled. You also have shown no evidence this actually works and is really being used.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely!  The MSM is now a juggernaut. What the vast majority of the population doesn&#39;t realize is that the MSM is deceiving them. With only 6 corporate owners with very similar backgrounds and agendas, the MSM has become a full on brain wash propaganda machine.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t been exposed to the evening network news such as ABC, CBS and NBC for a while, to watch it is to witness something that I find very disturbing.  They are so obviously targeting their audiences emotions to invoke panic and fear. They are obviously showing people at events that are &quot;posing&quot; for the cameras to visually aid in invoking these fears in people...and the Narrative goes on no matter to what degree it has been proven false.</p>
