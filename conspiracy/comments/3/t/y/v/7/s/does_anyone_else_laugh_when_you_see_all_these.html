       It seems like the leftists are really trying hard to refute any argument against their pro gay agenda. Every few months I see headlines about another species of animal that practice homosexuality in nature. Gay swans is the latest example.

       Let's play a game of hypotheticals.
      </p>
      <p>
       <del>
        Scholomo
       </del>
       Bob enjoys looking at little girls. Bob wants to have sex with little girls. Bob feels he should be allowed to have sex with little girls, because he was born finding little girls sexually attractive.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, most other people have come to accept that adults engaging in sexual relations with a minor is wrong, amoral, unnatural, and have made it illegal. Most people feel that those who molest children should have horrible things done to them in return, as an example to others. In fact, some go so far as to say that even hand drawn depictions of children should be treated the same as if they were real images of children, and that those who possess them should be treated as real predators.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bob really,
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       wants to have sex with little girls, however. Bob is also
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       rich and has time on his hands. Bob also has lots of rich, famous, or otherwise powerful friends who feel as he does. He even knows a senator or two, for instance,
       <del>
        Hebbie
       </del>
       John. So, they all get together one day to figure out what they can do about making it legal to diddle kiddies.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Bob: Damnit John, I just really want to diddle kids. Can't we just... I don't know, convince people it's normal,
        <em>
         natural
        </em>
        even to want to have sex with little girls?
       </p>
       <p>
        John: I may have an idea, Bob. How about we pay the Discovery Channel or someone to run a few documentaries about how all sorts of animals have sex with young animals all the time? Then we run these things once a week on tv, newspaper, science rags, and the like--really just inundate the normal people with imagery of it. Then, we have someone really popular come out and say he also likes little girls.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bob: What about Charlie Sheen? I hear he has AIDS. We could make it sound like some sort of special appeal thing...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       'Movements' like the gay, trans, and other 'acceptance' stuff are executed over years, slowly convincing people of the lie:
       <em>
        this is normal.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        This is okay.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        If you don't agree, you are secretly just as degenerate and hiding it.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       And so forth. It's a prolonged psyops campaign, all set to destroy the American family unit and traditional gender roles, and it is working--to our country's detriment. Divorce rates through the roof, infidelity, porn, single motherhood, the idea of 'free sex' destroying women's and men's (but it's mostly aimed at women) morals and prudence and creating an entire generation of promiscuous whores only concerned with what they can get in the moment, and many others are just byproducts.

       Absurd. The acceptance movement is about sexuality among consenting adults. Pedophilia is not considered an acceptable relationship because it is almost universally recognized that children are not old enough to give consent. It is universally recognized that pedophilia is harmful to children and the psychiatric community. Gay relationships have shown no such harm.
      </p>
      <p>
       This argument is better suited in a Fox News comment section. You have stripped out the reasoning for different lifestyles being accepted and used it as an excuse to justify your distaste of gay/trans people. Your views may be based in emotional reasoning, but most people's aren't. There is a reason people are accepting of gay and trans people and why they arent accepting of pedophilia.

       I appreciate that you took the time to paint that exact picture what I couldn't exactly put into words to explain the situation at hand here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we wait for them to come in and claim it's not the same thing, totally blind that it is the same concept in the background. It's like you said, it's a long-con, executed slowly over the years aimed at that specific core concept of acceptance, and even worse, promoting and encouraging sexual deviancy. Your entire point of pedophilia acceptance is exactly what I meant when I wrote:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Well the thing is when it comes to the encouragement of sexual deviancy, you can pretty much guess where it will eventually lead to. This idea of acceptance may not stop where you think it should stop."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       People are always looking for ways to discredit those who are talking about the gay/TS agenda and always resort to name-calling like 'bigot' or 'homophobia'. That's why it's the exact same thing like pulling the 'anti-semite' card. It's not constructive, not grounded, and pretty much gives away that you have ran out of all arguments to say.
When it comes to the word "normal", I personally use that word in it's literal sense.
Homosexuality is not normal. It is not the norm. It is rare. The word normal has a neutral meaning for me. As it should be because that's exactly what the word means. Normal doesn't mean 'good' or 'bad'. It means "conforming to a standard; usual, typical, or expected."

       Yeah, pretty much. Taking advantage of our innate empathy for our fellow man to push things that go against our best interests has been a long-running gimmick. For instance, multiculturalism. It fails at all levels, and yet, we're being told refugees are
       <em>

       instead of very,

       argument. They
       <em>

       And that is where the rule of large numbers comes in. "Well, x% of people are gay, it must be normal now!" Or "Well, x% of our population of voters is made up of refugees, surely they wouldn't take advantage of that large number to screw everyone else?" It's another con--the idea that the majority should determine what happens. If you, Schlomo, and Hebbie are in a car together and Schlomo and Hebbie decide it'd be a good idea to run the car into a lake, that's a 2/3's vote--and while it's clearly not in everyone's best interests, it's "what everyone wanted."

       Pretty much, with a few rare exceptions. Atheism has mostly been taken over by feminists and converted into "atheism+," at least, the larger and more vocal segment has. There are still rare exceptions of atheists who don't care what you believe. For example:
      </p>
      <p>
       Hi, I'm an atheist, and I don't care what you believe--even if I disagree with it. I'm not the kind of asshole who tries to force his opinion down others' throats. ...Unless you ask me to explain my beliefs and reasoning, in which case, you've asked to open that can of worms yourself, and I'll typically warn someone before they do to prevent the butthurt. Except that it seems most Christians I've known are eager and enthusiastic to defend their beliefs and ignore the warning, then get butthurt when I do explain--and then telling them "I warned you" only makes it worse.

       Agree totally. I heard a testimony of a former manager of Planned parenthood. She talked about PP's strategy to increase revenue. They were very involved in public school sex ed classes to introduce sex to kids. PP's goal was for abortion to be the number one contraceptive. Expose kids to sex at a young age. Encourage them to enjoy it "safely". Then cash in on the unavoidable mistake of unwanted children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Homosexuality is the same thing. The health risks for men on men sex is crazy. Then tell everyone it is normal and healthy. Once gay marriage was legal in Mass they moved in the public high schools and started handing out pamphlets teaching kids how to experiment with gay sex. The number of kids that tried it went way up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The globalists are all about population control. Encouraging people to be gay is an easy way to accomplish it.

       No it can't because the pro gay
       <em>
        movement
       </em>
       (this includes the entirity of LGBTQXYZ) will use it as an argument that homosexuality is totally normal. Just because something happens somewhere, doesn't mean that its
       <em>
        norm
       </em>
       al. It's rare. 
I got nothing against homosexuals, with that I mean I feel in no way resentment or look down on them, I think about them the same way I think about everyone, but the incredible push for homosexuality and especially transsexuality is definitely one of the agendas of the zionists to destroy more and more the concept of the family and having children.
The stuff you read about certain parents 'deciding' for their kids what their gender should be at a young age is frightening.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might ask why I jumped from homosexuality to transsexuality. Well the thing is when it comes to the encouragement of sexual deviancy, you can pretty much guess where it will eventually lead to. This idea of acceptance may not stop where you think it should stop. They are destroying the very cores of human sexuality.

       This has to be one of the most ignorant things I've seen on Reddit today. You do understand that people have whatever orientation they are born with?  And that seeing a gay person on TV is not going to persuade people to become gay?  So the your idea of "zionists destroying the concept of the family and having children" is nonsense!
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore plenty of LBGT families exist.  Hell, they pushed for the right to marry. If that ain't trying to fit the "concept of family" I don't know what is.  If becoming a family wasn't important to them why would they have fought so hard for it?!  And who said they can't have children? You?  There are plenty of LGBT couples who have adopted, used a surrogate, or lesbian females becoming impregnated.  They can provide just as loving and supportive a home as a straight couple can.  The
       <em>
        pro gay
       </em>
       movement as you are calling it is not to convert people.  After centuries of persecution and hatred it's finally to make their voice heard and show people that the LGBT community is just like everyone else. It's to create a more understanding environment, and inform closed minded individuals such as yourself that they are people too. Just like you and me. They don't deserve to be treated any differently just because of who they love.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can say "I got nothing against homosexuals" all you want.  But that fact that you don't think they are capable of having a family or caring for children shows me that you do in fact have some deep-seated resentment and hatred for them.  And for that I feel sorry for you. I hope one day you see that we're all just humans, and all that other shit that separates us is just peripheral.  People really need to stop hating others for their differences and just accept the fact that we are all here on this earth trying to make the best of it. Life is too short for all the hatred and division.

       Oh don't worry about responding to any of the points I made. Just go ahead and write me off because you can't logically refute my argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I came to the decision like any reasonable person, based on evidence. Evidence that you have shown me with your comments. Here is some of the evidence I based my conclusion on:
      </p>
      <p>
       1)
       <em>
        "agendas of the zionists to destroy more and more the concept of the family and having children"
       </em>
       - This tells me that you believe LGBT people are incapable of being in a healthy committed relationship or raising children, therefore are somehow lesser individuals that you. Also tells me you may have some anti-semitic tendencies, but that's a discussion for another day.
      </p>
      <p>
       2)
       <em>
        "encouragement of sexual deviancy"
       </em>
       - Nothing about being LGBT is sexual deviancy. You only view it as such because it does not fit your narrow minded view of what a relationship is supposed to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do not have to take me seriously, that is your right.  But it will never change the fact that the world is moving in the right direction (at least in this aspect) and people are becoming more accepting of differences.  Soon all the dinosaurs with your old-timey, bigoted mentality will have died off and humanity will be able to worry about more important issues than who is sleeping with who.

       I highly doubt there will ever be a push of acceptance for that, but if there is at least we can stand on the same side for once.  Because there is no amount of conditioning that could make me accept the abuse of a child.  But seriously man, how can you compare gays to pedophiles?  It's apples and oranges, really fucked up rotten oranges that deserve to be castrated. I just don't see how anyone can make that leap.

       People who make the "homosexuality = pedophilia" argument do so because they are unable to recognize that the acceptance is based off a logical conclusion rather than an emotional one. Modern society accepts gay people because the involved parties are adults and there is no evidence that they cause any harm to society. Therefore it would be immoral to deny them the rights of any other person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Listen to the way
       <a href="/u/Geralt23">
        /u/Geralt23
       </a>
       and other users in this thread comment. Lots of sweeping, non supported claims that have more in common with the sermons of a bigoted preacher than someone who has reached conclusions based on evidence. Based in emotion, not evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, these people are projecting their own tactics onto those they disagree with. Because they have reached their position on emotion alone, they assume that others will too. So from their perspective, people who wanted to accept gays have no reason not to accept pedophiles, as they have no means of comprehending that views on sexuality can be based on more than emotion.

       We know homosexuals aren't the same as pedophiles. This is not about the homosexual itself. It's about promotion and encouragement to normalize a sexually deviant culture.
As I've made clear before, I don't consider homosexuals to be bad people. I might find it wrong what they do but who am I to judge what they do. We are all sinners. To be honest, personally I don't mind gay culture as much as I object the pro-transgender agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Homosexuality used to be viewed as a disgusting and abnormal act. Gay people were shunned and regarded as freaks of society. You know when I think about it, I still remember the news on tv when George Michael was 'caught' and outed as a homosexual. This was in the early 90's. Not so long ago. Even then it was regarded as something abnormal. Otherwise there wouldn't have been much fuss about it. Nowadays something like that wouldn't happen. Being gay is normal.
      </p>
      <p>
       So slowly by slowly it became more and more accepted. 
The media, the internet, movies which featured homosexual characters and the entertainment industry played a huge part in speeding up the process.
If you could have asked the average gay person back in the 70's when gay culture was on the rise what they thought of the idea of someone taking hormones and cutting off their genitals to turn into the opposite sex, I can bet you a lot of them would be against that. I don't even have to mention how the idea of transsexuality would be completely dismissed by almost everyone else in that era.
Now compare that to today, where it's becoming more and more accepted, slowly by slowly normalized. We live in an age where there are parents who decide for their 6 year old son that he is somehow actually a girl trapped in a boy's body and start hormone therapy for him a few years later, and
       <em>
        this is legal
       </em>
       . It's insanity.
You see the pattern here? A concept of something being totally unacceptable, through time becomes more and more accepted and eventually regarded as 'normal'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that gays and transgenders are so widely accepted in society,
       <em>
        other
       </em>
       groups of people are carefully gonna ask for their acceptance. Just wait and watch how it's gonna unfold. Necrophiles, pedophiles, people into beastiality etc. I'm not saying this will happen tomorrow, or next year. Give it a decade maybe. The point is that it will eventually happen. Remember this is all being done step by step. We are still too freshly in the era of being pro-LGBT. Stuff like this takes time.
But when that time comes, where you will start to see it happening in the future, I urge you to stop and remember what people like I have told you about it today. Remember what we said.
      </p>
      <p>
       And another thing to note that is of great importance... What these Transgender Rights movements never tell you are the horrible stories of the cases of suicide and life-crushing depression amongst some of these transitioned transsexuals who regret making the transition. These people realize they have made a mistake so big and so devastating, and that there is no turning back from it. The agony and helplessness they feel makes them turn to suicide. And if not that, lifelong depression so painful you and I can't fathom it. 
They won't ever make that side of this story mainstream news, it doesn't fit their agenda. They don't
       <em>
        care
       </em>
       about your or my well-being.
This whole issue is entangled in a set of a myriad of other issues relating to man's nature. Gender fluidity, sexual orientation, transsexualism.
It's all about corrupting and perverting society. Their intentions are to turn this society into a Godless, gender confused, sexually confused, mish-mash mess of a people who are emotionally and mentally drained. People who have nothing to hold onto, no moral system, no faith, no belief and no certainty. This is the long-term plan to which we today are seeing the small steps for. The encouragement and the ideas revolving around sexual deviancies and gender fluidity is nothing but one branch of the system that's trying to change humans in what they want to mold us into.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope you realize that when you read all this, you see that it's not with homosexuals or transsexuals I have problems with, but the agenda behind it that's being pushed by "the powers that be".

      <p>
       Find me an example of this happening with any sort of regularity? I've never heard of parents choosing the gender of their child. This sounds like a boogeyman that the transphobic make up to wrongly characterize something they don't like. Gender dysphoria is a real condition and people struggle with it. Allowing them to live and identify as the gender they feel they were born is the right thing to do. Just because it wasn't done in the past doesn't mean there is anything wrong with it. I think your understanding of trans issues is extremely poor.

       They might. Luckily, because we, as a society, have standards regarding what is, and isn't healthy, for individuals, we can pretty accurately determine the legitimacy of a group's request for acceptance.

       No it won't. Because you are so obviously ignorant on these issues, it may not have occurred to you that there are actual reasons why gay and transexual people are accepted by society and these aren't. Because both of these things either involve only a single individual or two consenting adults. See, your right to express yourself ends when it infringes on other's rights. Homosexuality and Transexuality does not do this. They do not effect anyone but the concerned parties.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of your moronic examples, do contain parties that can not consent. Did you know that dogs, children and dead people can't consent to be fucked? That is the fucking difference, and I don't understand how many times your bigoted ass needs to be explained this. Unlike yourself, who has clearly reached their position for emotional (and possibly religious) reasons, the acceptance of other's sexuality actual follows a line of pretty solid logic. Unless you fundamentally change the laws of consent (only an utter sociopath would consider it, as they are there to protect those who are not in a position to consent), this will never change.

        And another thing to note that is of great importance... What these Transgender Rights movements never tell you are the horrible stories of the cases of suicide and life-crushing depression amongst some of these transitioned transsexuals who regret making the transition. These people realize they have made a mistake so big and so devastating, and that there is no turning back from it. The agony and helplessness they feel makes them turn to suicide. And if not that, lifelong depression so painful you and I can't fathom it.

       And there are also thousands of people who will be forced to live their lives as a gender that they will never feel comfortable in because of bigots like you. And they will undergo the same problems you just listed.

      <p>
       People don't just up and change gender one day. The struggle with gender identity is often confusing and difficult. An irreversible sex change involves extensive counselling and doctor involvement. Just because you can conjure up some hypothetical horror stories does not mean we should prevent people from exercising their rights.

The encouragement and the ideas revolving around sexual deviancies and gender fluidity is nothing but one branch of the system that's trying to change humans in what they want to mold us into.

       It depends on how you define it, but since the term generally implies that perverted sexuality is harmful or unnatural, I would not describe it as such. If one used the term simply as a descriptor for less common expressions of sexuality, than perhaps it would be appropriate, although I think there are probably more appropriate terms.

       Because people generally try to limit children's exposure to sexual themes as they are usually too young to properly understand it. But your concern about exposure to sexuality because of the pride parade is ridiculously hypocritical. Go for a drive, turn on a tv. Listen to song on the radio. Sex is in everything. Yet you only seem to think that some gay folks marching down a street with their shirts off dancing suggestively is harmful. We recognize that this world is a sexually charged one and that parents have a responsibility to limit childrens exposure and help them understand it. I suspect you only care about gay sexuality on display because you are disgusted by homosexuality, and not for actual reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't want your kid to see people at gay pride, don't take them to the parade. No one is forcing them or you to go.

       That is because it is? Why do you care who people choose to love?

        I got nothing against homosexuals, with that I mean I feel in no way resentment or look down on them, just think about them the same way I think about everyone, but the incredible push for homosexuality and especially transsexuality is definitely one of the agendas of the zionists to destroy more and more the concept of the family and having children.

       "I've got nothing against homosexuals, I just think that the fact that they want to be treated like normal human beings is a Jewish plot to destroy the world."

       If you think that acceptance of homosexuality is in anyway damaging to the world, you definitely have a problem with homosexuals.

       When Homosexuality occurs between consenting adults, who the fuck are you to say acceptance should stop before that?

       Bullshit. What are these cores, who defines them? Sexuality is broad and complicated, what gives you the right to look down on those who express it or experience it differently than you?

       This has to be one of the most ignorant things I've seen on Reddit today. You do understand that people have whatever orientation they are born with?  And that seeing a gay person on TV is not going to persuade people to become gay?  So the your idea of "zionists destroying the concept of the family and having children" is nonsense!
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore plenty of LBGT families exist.  Hell, they pushed for the right to marry. If that ain't trying to fit the "concept of family" I don't know what is.  If becoming a family wasn't important to them why would they have fought so hard for it?!  And who said they can't have children? You?  There are plenty of LGBT couples who have adopted, used a surrogate, or lesbian females becoming impregnated.  They can provide just as loving and supportive a home as a straight couple can.  The
       <em>
        pro gay
       </em>
       movement as you are calling it is not to convert people.  After centuries of persecution and hatred it's finally to make their voice heard and show people that the LGBT community is just like everyone else. It's to create a more understanding environment, and inform closed minded individuals such as yourself that they are people too. Just like you and me. They don't deserve to be treated any differently just because of who they love.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can say "I got nothing against homosexuals" all you want.  But that fact that you don't think they are capable of having a family or caring for children shows me that you do in fact have some deep-seated resentment and hatred for them.  And for that I feel sorry for you. I hope one day you see that we're all just humans, and all that other shit that separates us is just peripheral.  People really need to stop hating others for their differences and just accept the fact that we are all here on this earth trying to make the best of it. Life is too short for all the hatred and division.
