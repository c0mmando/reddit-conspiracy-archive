    <div class="md"><p><strong><em>Censorship on the r/Conspiracy Forum</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>r/Conspiracy is a dying forum, slowing degenerating into cesspool of schizophrenic ramblings, racism and selective ignorance. It seems like the moderators are deliberately dismantling the r/conspiracy community. They arbitrarily ban, remove or rig votes on posts addressing certain &quot;sensitive&quot; issues, all related to the intelligence community and the corporate elite. The intelligentsia is slowly getting picked off, one by one, leaving behind an echo chamber for fools and idiots.</p></li>
<li><p>In our past glory days, you would see a constant stream of well written and well researched posts, shedding a light on a wide range of controversial issues. I personally believe that Reddit played an important role in adding people like Mr. Snowden in delivering his message to the world. Recently even the corporate owned mass media had to acknowledge the pedophile scandals in the UK, something that would have never happened without the awareness created on the conspiracy forum. The information and data driven research you once could find on the front page of r/conspiracy in relation to the 9-11 attacks was amazing. The articles, journalistic research, YouTube videos and academic publications about the Wall Streets crime spree leading up to the 2008 financial crash was unparalleled.</p></li>
<li><p>In 2011 Reddit was sold to Advanced Publications and became an integrated part of the corporate owned mass media. At first the change was almost unnoticeable, but it has now become abundantly clear, in which direction Reddit moves. The voting system got completely changed/rigged. Troublesome employees and moderators got kicked from the moderator team. Reddit is now enforcing a much stricter and systematical code of censorship against all anti-establishment publications.</p></li>
<li><p>In the present, November 2015, The r/AMA forum has been turned into an advertisement platform for celebrities and famous rich people. The r/economics forum is now policed by corporate shills and pundits, trolling and down voting any alternative or anti-establishment comments. On r/news and r/worldnews you are rarely allowed to post articles about economic inequality or the crimes committed by mega corporations.</p></li>
<li><p>Every day you read news stories from somewhere about new initiatives to censor free speech. They are created in line with government policies, totalitarian regimes, the corporate owned mass media and intelligence communities. The voice of democracy and free speech is slowly fading and being replaced with spectacles, dangerous illusions and dumbed down entertainment. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>The Conspiracy forum has become a liability, too much information and fact based data has leaked into the public realm via Reddit, revealing too many of the elites true intentions.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>None sadly. We are too spineless a society to stand up for anything. Me included. Even if I spoke up about this or staged a protest, nobody would join. Even my own family will tell me to stop, scoff at me or just threaten me to stop. Maybe we have not reached the tipping point, but honestly I don&#39;t think the tipping point is anywhere in sight. I know this is a negative and pessimistic view of the situation, but maybe sometimes, that is also necessary.</p>

<p>Addendum: The real issue I think is that nobody sees the gravity of the situation as much as we do. They think we are blowing things out of proportion and being paranoid. It may be because we have the foresight that the general public lacks. And moreover, they seem to have accepted this as the norm, but we are still holding on to uphold the ideals we hold dear. The evil in the world combined with apathy, completely overshadows the good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Boy, you are so misguided. There are people across the world living much  more luxurious lives than you are. And the only reason the same &quot;luxury&quot; hasn&#39;t reached the masses is because of the system the western government holds firmly in place that is tilted in their favour, and in addition they employ immoral and unethical means you can think of. A lot of people in the west don&#39;t have it as good as it is purported to seem either. Most of them spend most of their lives at a desk, working a job they absolutely hate, adding inches to their waists, and almost all of them are in debt. Not such a rosy picture mate. And what&#39;s with the east vs west attitude, when the real war is against the 99% at the bottom vs the 1% ruling, evil elite. </p>

<p>Ask one of these people if they sometimes find it &quot;hard to make ends meet&quot; and they&#39;ll tell you some story about how they &quot;suffered&quot; in a minimum wage job for six months. </p>

<p>Where I live the cost of living is the same as the US state of Nebraska, but the minimum wage is 1/3 of the US&#39;s, and yet somehow everyone manages to get by just fine. I don&#39;t even know what to think of poverty in the US anymore, there is just money floating around everywhere, the entire country is completely saturated with it in a way that doesn&#39;t happen in the rest of the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see you post this a lot. I never see any of the mods debunk this arguement which leads me to believe it&#39;s true. I&#39;m new, and while some people might allocate that to being a shill, the fact is im just late to the game. It&#39;s sad that this is the direction society is headed.</p>

<p>On the other end of the spectrum, i see you post this sort of thing often, and it never gets censored, or blocked, or down voted into oblivion.</p>

<p>So i don&#39;t know what to believe... and i think that statement speaks more about r/conspiracy. There is so much disinformation, mixed with wildly different opinions. Not knowing who is a shill, and who has a genuine opinion against a narrative presented here. For the most part it forces me to create my own opinions, but i don&#39;t know if the opinion I&#39;m forming is falling inline with a stricter narrative; and that scares the shit out of me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is true on many levels.</p>

<p>Of course the elite have to censor &quot;delicate&quot; information, they have to fucking brainwash everyone so they do their dirty work, because their too weak to fucking do anything so they have to sit in their expensive homes snorting coke, doing satanic rituals and fucking reptilians or some shit. And the Conspiracy page as you stated, released much &quot;delicate&quot; information.</p>

<p>Explains why major Conspiracies don&#39;t appear, because their made to be false, or faked by corrupt Historians, Scientists and the government.</p>

<p><strong>The Dunning–Kruger effect</strong> is a cognitive bias wherein relatively unskilled individuals suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their ability to be much higher than is accurate. Dunning and Kruger attributed this bias to <strong>a metacognitive inability of the unskilled to recognize their own ineptitude and evaluate their own ability accurately</strong>. Their research also suggests that conversely, highly skilled individuals may underestimate their relative competence, erroneously assuming that tasks which are easy for them also are easy for others. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I never heard of Aether. I&#39;ll check it out. Thanks for letting me. I used to frequent Gawker, and then make comments on Disqus, but I guess I come back to Reddit is because of the way the system is designed (i.e. it has topics I like such as Conspiracy, science, paranormal, etc.), as well as I can keep track of good posts that has useful information. :)</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t like how some posts get down voted into oblivion by an obvious &quot;shadow&quot; campaign to silence the public, or to sway opinion. :(</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding Eglin AFB, do note the 7th Special Forces Group:</p>

<p>███████████████████████████</p>

<p>The 7th Special Force Group is one of five active Special Forces Groups providing specialized support to the combatant commanders.
Special Forces units perform seven doctrinal missions: Unconventional Warfare, Foreign Internal Defense, Special Reconnaissance, Direct Action, Combating Terrorism, Counter-proliferation, and Information Operations. These missions make Special Forces unique in the U.S. military, because they are employed throughout the three stages of the operational continuum: peacetime, conflict and war.</p>

<p>███████████████████████████</p>

<p>Smooth..</p>

<p>. The subject was the mysterious death of Aaron Schwartz, the reddit co-dounder. The full doc was available on youtube, unfortunately I didn&#39;t watch it but from the summary, his parents are pretty sure the cia was behind his death. It took me a bit but I found one doc. about him, not sure it&#39;s the same one (the other had a different title) but here it is if anyone&#39;s interested <a href="http://youtu.be/ZxdUgVaoQ9o">http://youtu.be/ZxdUgVaoQ9o</a></p>
