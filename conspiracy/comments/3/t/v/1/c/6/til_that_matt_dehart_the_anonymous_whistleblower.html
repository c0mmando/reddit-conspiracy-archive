<p>It seems they were threatening him with 70 years in prison for these charges despite admitting at one point that they had classified files on him and were monitoring him for national security matters. </p>

<p>The judge said there might be merit to his claims that the child pornography charges were being used as a pretext for searching his computers, not that he was being set up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fact that all materials taken from the raids on his properties were sent directly to FBI headquarters for analysis, not the police precinct in which the crimes were supposed to have taken place.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s two years after DeHart tried to flee the country via the Russian embassy (where, he admits, he talked about drone technology) and then the Venezuelan embassy, right? And two years after he fled to Canada?</p>

<p>Is there any evidence that the FBI was interested in him on national security issues <em>before</em> he did that?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That part of his story was never credible. Other than DeHart&#39;s word, there&#39;s no evidence that such a file existed. DeHart never told anybody about it before his arrest and claims to have deleted it. DeHart was &quot;silenced&quot; by himself, if it actually existed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are all fair points, the fact that it can be interpreted by the two of us in totally different ways shows that we don&#39;t have all the facts available and, as with most conspiracies, the conclusions we have drawn from the case are based on our own subjective interpretation and what we believe to have happened. </p>

<p>It seems to be that a government trying to smear and silence would use the charges of cp to do so, being such a heinous crime with such serious repercussions it would shut even the most vocal opponent up. And, to put it as simply as I can, I believe this man&#39;s story. Beyond that belief, everything else can be debated or questioned and I freely concede that I may be wrong, but to me it seems like he is a man being suppressed by a government that as has been shown time and time again, will use any and all tactics available to them to silence whistleblowers and those who wish to expose the crimes of said government and more specifically the clandestine operations conducted both abroad, but more pertinently in this case, at home against its own citizens. And I believe the story of this man over the story of a very obviously corrupt and dishonest government. </p>
