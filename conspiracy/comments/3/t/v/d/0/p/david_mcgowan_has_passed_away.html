        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>David&#39;s brother Craig posted the following earlier today:</p>

<p>&quot;David passed today 11/22/2015 at 12:47 PM PST. So passes the Greatest Researcher and unassailable fountain of TRUTH of our time, possibly of any time. Your Legacy will outlive all time.&quot;</p>

<p>As some of you may know Dave had been ill for a while with a particularly virulent form of cancer that started in the lungs and had spread to his bones. Despite being a life-long smoker Dave was vehement that this cancer was not natural in origin (i.e. he was targeted due to the subjects he wrote about).</p>

<p>I can&#39;t really speak to that, but I&#39;m extremely sad that an author that brought such great intellect and much-needed humor to the subject of conspiracy theory unlike anyone else I&#39;ve come across, has gone. I&#39;m sad that he was just starting to gain some recognition when this illness struck (had a meeting with someone at <del>Phillip Morris</del> William Morris just earlier in the year), and I&#39;m sad that in the back of my mind I kinda do believe he was murdered, just like Hicks, Cooper, Webb...</p>

<p>If anyone is interested in exploring his work, you can still check out his website (for the time-being) here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.davesweb.cnchost.com/">http://www.davesweb.cnchost.com/</a></p>

<p>Yes the design on his page is horrible, you have to look past that to the merit of the material. Also, like any person he does make mistakes and misinterpretations. This isn&#39;t academic work, he&#39;s just writing his thoughts, which are thoughts we&#39;ve all had once or twice.</p>

<p>RIP Dave :(</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dave McGowan is the MOST IMPORTANT conspiracy researcher of the past 25 years, if not longer. Worth noting he got the cancer almost  immediately after producing a 4 hour investigation into the Boston Bombings. </p>

<p>&quot;Weird Scenes inside the Canyon,&quot; his final book, is almost impossible to put down. </p>

<p>Interesting to see what happens w/ his material and website. The only strange thing about him and his work is that the site was so damn ugly and un-user friendly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure if the Boston piece was the actual reason, he was touching on lots of topics that some would rather keep quiet. To my understanding he even had a heated email exchange with none-other than Lt. Col. Michael Aquino (who&#39;s reputation should be known to everyone here) regarding a piece on institutionalized pedophilia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, he made thousands of enemies, I&#39;m sure. But the Aquino exchange was 15 years ago, before a lot of his work really branched out into 9/11, the Moon Landings, the Lincoln Assassination, then Boston and many others. </p>

<p>The other thing is, you know how these assholes work -- it&#39;s a joke to them, so they like mixing fun with foul. Right before Dave was diagnosed with cancer, there was a whole exchange between him and some crazy conspiracy guy about body doubles being subbed for celebrities, and when Dave mocked him, they claimed he was actually Kevin Bacon. There were a lot of laughs on his FB page about that. It all seemed very good natured and &quot;in-the-know&quot; funny. Then a week later he was diagnosed with cancer. </p>

<p>Maybe coincidence. And maybe coincidence that a lifelong smoker got cancer right at that point, and not a conspiracy to murder him. But I think they killed him, yeah. And I think the Boston thing was the catalyst. But I could totally be wrong.</p>

<p>if we are as brilliant as Dave was, that is.</p>

<p>I&#39;m truly heartbroken over this.  There will never be anybody like Dave McGowan.</p>

<p>Also, his meeting was at William Morris, the Beverly Hills talent agency, not Philip Morris, the tobacco giant.</p>
