    <div class="md"><p>It was about 2003 that I stumbled on the <a href="http://davesweb.cnchost.com">Center for an Informed America</a> website. Initially it struck me even then as somewhat retro in its look, but its look didn&#39;t matter. It was loaded with insights on current and past events that you just couldn&#39;t get anywhere else. He was never part of a &quot;movement&quot; and worked independently.  Over weeks, months, and years I would go through his work, reading his newer material and re-reading his older stuff. What amazed me over time was how well his stuff held up. Not only that, but his stuff actually seemed to become <em>more</em> relevant over time, unlike much of the conspiracy writing to be found on the Internet.</p>

<p>His voice will be missed. Whether writing about Columbine, 9/11, Laurel Canyon, The Moon Landings, the Lincoln Assassination, Boston Bombing, and other assorted events, his insight and sense of humour was second to none. In my early days down this rabbit hole, his was a voice of sanity in a sea of disinformation and misinformation. I could trust Dave McGowan. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a sad day. His work lives on though and is a reminder that even in dark corners of the Internet, people can make a difference. He never knew me, but he had an enormous influence on my thinking. He also reminds us what it takes to live in a world where independent thinking is discouraged: an indefatigable spirit, courage to go against hive mentality,  and a sense of humour. That last part keeps us sane. </p>

<p>Rest in Peace, Dave McGowan. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s destined to become a classic. I resisted reading it for years, and resisted the thought of a Moon landing hoax for the longest time. A couple of months into 2015 I started reading it for the first time and not only was it informative and illuminating, it was hilarious. I laughed a lot while reading it. It dawned on me after that that the only reason I had ever believed the Moon Landings occurred was faith. I just had <em>faith</em> that it had to have happened. It was my last &quot;sacred cow&quot;. </p>

<p>Now it&#39;s not like I&#39;m going to yell this from the rooftops. I keep my thoughts on this mostly to myself and a couple of close friends. But if you&#39;re brave, and don&#39;t mind a sacred cow being destroyed, &quot;Wagging the Moondoggie&quot; is a great read.</p>

<p>Just this opener:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can see all of you scratching your heads out there and I know exactly what it is that you are thinking: “Why the hell are we taking this detour to the Moon? What happened to Laurel Canyon? Have you completely lost your mind?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then a little further:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am very well aware, by the way, that there are many, many people out there – even many of the people who have seen through other tall tales told by our government – who think that Moon hoax theorists are complete kooks. And a whole lot of coordinated effort has gone into casting them as such. That makes wading into the Moon hoax debate a potentially dangerous affair.</p>

<p>Remember when Luther (played by Don Knotts) gets taken to court and sued for slander in The Ghost and Mr. Chicken? And don’t try to pretend like you’ve never seen it, because we both know that you have. So anyway, he goes to court and a character witness is called and the guy delivers credible testimony favoring Luther and it is clear that the courtroom is impressed and everything is looking good for our nebbish hero, Luther. Remember what happens next though? On cross-examination, the witness reveals that he is the president of a UFO club that holds their meetings on Mars!</p>

<p>The courtroom, of course, erupts with laughter and all of that formerly credible testimony immediately flies right out the window.</p>

<p>I have already received e-mails warning that I will suffer a similar fate (from people who heard me discussing the topic on Meria Heller’s radio show). Not to worry though – I have somewhat of an advantage over others who have attempted to travel this path: I don’t really care. My mission is to ferret out the truth, wherever it may lie; if at various points along the way, some folks are offended and others question my sanity, that’s not really something that I lose a lot of sleep over. </p>

<p>Ugh, many of these claims are found to be greatly exaggerrated if not absolutely false with even an ounce of secondary research.  It blows my mind that people are so willing to blindly follow certain things on Dave&#39;s site without confirming them through their own research.</p>

<p>A simple one is the Dutch &quot;moon rock conspiracy&quot;.  The problems with this specific claim are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>NASA didn&#39;t hand out Lunar rocks to other Countries until after all the Apollo missions were done, in 1972.  This &quot;moon rock&quot; was given to Drees in 1969, three years before NASA officially gave out any moon rocks.</p></li>
<li><p>The samples NASA gave out were very small. From .05g to 1.1g and encased in a clear acrylic, but this sample was was 98g and not encased in anything. </p></li>
<li><p>Spokeswoman Xandra van Gelder said the museum checked with NASA after receiving the rock in 1992 from the estate of the late Prime Minister Willem Drees. NASA told the museum, without seeing it, that it was &quot;possible&quot; it was a moon rock, not that it <strong>was</strong> a moon rock.</p></li>
<li><p>In addition <em>&quot;Drees&#39;s grandson, also named Willem, told the AP his grandfather had been out of office for more than a decade and was nearly deaf and blind in 1969, though his mind was still sharp ... &#39;My guess is that he did not hear well what was said,&quot; said the grandson. &quot;He may have formed his own idea about what it was.&#39; &quot;</em></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, his claims that lunar meteorites in Antarctica <em>&quot;are virtually indistinguishable from NASA’s collection of Moon rocks&quot;</em> is completely false.  But again, it seems as though scientific analysis isn&#39;t his strong point, nor does it need to be for people with pre-existing biases to swallow his claims wholesale.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since you said &quot;many of these claims are found to be greatly exaggerrated (sic) if not absolutely false&quot;, but haven&#39;t bothered to go beyond the &quot;Dutch Moon Rock&quot; claim, I&#39;ll just stick with that. He simply described the Dutch Moon rock story as a &quot;new source of inspiration&quot; when grappling with writer&#39;s block. It&#39;s a minor claim at best, not even central to the many claims made in the series. As he says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>which also reminded me that I had a lot of other bits and pieces of information concerning the Apollo project that I had collected over the nine years that have passed since I first wrote about the alleged Moon landings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You go to great trouble to support the claim that they&#39;re fake, which no one disagrees with, so I&#39;m not sure why you bothered to debunk a claim which you apparently agree with. It was the fact that they were discovered to be fake and that this was news at the time which was the source of McGowan&#39;s inspiration. But that the United States presented the rock to Drees as being real is also not in dispute. </p>

<p>According to this <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8226075.stm">BBC story</a>, which McGowan cited, the Moon rock was given to &quot;former Prime Minister Willem Drees during a goodwill tour by the three Apollo-11 astronauts shortly after their moon mission in 1969&quot; and that the rock &quot;had originally been been vetted through a phone call to Nasa&quot;. It also stated that &quot;US officials said they had no explanation for the Dutch discovery.&quot; But Nasa doesn&#39;t say, &quot;We never told Drees that it was a moon rock.&quot; No one seems to dispute that the U.S. gave Drees a rock that they said was from the Moon. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The rock was given to Willem Drees, a former Dutch leader, during a global tour by Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins and Edwin &quot;Buzz&quot; Aldrin following their moon mission 50 years ago.</p>

<p>J. William Middendorf, the former American ambassador to the Netherlands, made the presentation to Mr Drees and the rock was then donated to the Rijksmuseum after his death in 1988.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/space/6105902/Moon-rock-given-to-Holland-by-Neil-Armstrong-and-Buzz-Aldrin-is-fake.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/space/6105902/Moon-rock-given-to-Holland-by-Neil-Armstrong-and-Buzz-Aldrin-is-fake.html</a></p>

<p>And McGowan includes this photo:</p>

<p><a href="http://davesweb.cnchost.com/Moonrock.jpg">http://davesweb.cnchost.com/Moonrock.jpg</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since the discovery of the fake Moon rock in the Dutch museum, ‘debunkers’ have claimed that the fact that no other Moon rocks have been declared fake proves that the Dutch case is an isolated one. “After that announcement,” goes the argument, “wouldn’t every other country in possession of a Moon rock have rushed to have them authenticated? And since no other country has made a similar announcement, doesn’t that prove that the Moon rocks are real?”</p>

<p>At first glance, that would appear to be a valid argument. The problem, however, is that the vast majority of those countries can’t test their ‘Moon rocks’ because, shockingly enough, no one knows where they are! As the Associated Press reported on September 13, 2009, “Nearly 270 rocks scooped up by U.S. astronauts were given to foreign countries by the Nixon administration … Of 135 rocks from the Apollo 17 mission given away to nations or their leaders, only about 25 have been located by CollectSpace.com, a Web site for space history buffs that has long attempted to compile a list … The outlook for tracking the estimated 134 Apollo 11 rocks is even bleaker. The locations of fewer than a dozen are known.”</p>

<p>It appears then that having a ‘control rock’ wouldn’t really be of much help after all, since nearly 90% of the alleged Moon rocks that we would want to test don’t seem to be around any more. </p>

<p>But again, it seems as though scientific analysis isn&#39;t his strong point</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps not, though your analysis was hardly scientific. His strong point is rational analysis based on the available facts at the time. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>nor does it need to be for people with pre-existing biases to swallow his claims wholesale.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You really can&#39;t help yourself, can you? There was no need for that, but when an argument is weak it&#39;s to be expected. FYI, I had a strong bias to <em>believe</em> the Moon landings took place before I read it. It&#39;s a belief I held for at least 45 years, and I too mocked those who claimed a hoax. I wanted to <em>believe</em>  the landings took place. And, btw, the Dutch moon rock hoax wasn&#39;t even close to being a claim that would have turned me over to the hoax side.</p>

<p>Interesting you should take the weakest claim made. The Dutch moon rock is fake. McGowan agrees. It seems your whole argument about this one minor claim is that just because one rock is fake, doesn&#39;t mean they all are. Which he also agrees with. But as he says, there aren&#39;t many of those around to test against. </p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Oh, this priceless. You have no fucking idea whether I or anyone else &quot;blindly follow certain things on Dave&#39;s site without confirming them through their own research.&quot; No idea, yet you claim to know based on your own need to confirm your own bias that you are smarter than everyone here and do your own research, while the rest of us just read Dave&#39;s site and take that as gospel. So sad to see people who can only feel good about themselves when making wrong assumptions about people. </p>

<p>Incorrect, you didn&#39;t even read my post.  His claim about the Antarctic lunar meteors being &quot;virtually indistinguishable&quot; from lunar rocks is also patently false.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Probably because nobody ever claimed <strong>it</strong> (not sure why you&#39;re saying &quot;they&quot; there is only one rock in question) was real except for Drees.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But that the United States presented the rock to Drees as being real is also not in dispute. </p>

<p>Where did you get this information from?  Again, you didn&#39;t seem to read the post, specifically:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;Drees&#39;s grandson, also named Willem, told the AP his grandfather had been out of office for more than a decade and was nearly deaf and blind in 1969, though his mind was still sharp ... &#39;My guess is that he did not hear well what was said,&quot; said the grandson. &quot;He may have formed his own idea about what it was.&#39; &quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition, lunar rocks weren&#39;t provided to <em>anybody</em> prior to 1972.  For somebody to claim that they were given a rock three years in advance, that was nearly <em>one-hundred times</em> bigger than any other rock given to anybody else is absolutely absurd.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://davesweb.cnchost.com/Moonrock.jpg">http://davesweb.cnchost.com/Moonrock.jpg</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Amazing how the plaque doesn&#39;t state that it&#39;s a lunar rock.  You&#39;d think that would be a pertinent piece of information to include for such a valuable piece of history.</p>

<p>Considering that the only piece of lunar rock that wasn&#39;t a meteorite has been sold for around $440,000 and was 0.2g, it would be surprising that this piece, worth approximately <strong>$198 million</strong> would be so readily given away without even a plaque stating that it was a moon rock.</p>

<p>The rest of your points are readily addressed <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/2009-09-14-moon-rock_N.htm">here</a> although if you spend as little time going through it as you did my post, I doubt you&#39;ll learn anything new.</p>

<p>It was simply the easiest to address, but it would seem as though even so you are unable to follow the basic outline of events that I laid out for you in bulleted form.  I don&#39;t know why you think you&#39;d be able to follow the problems with the other claims if you are unable to even follow up to this point ... unreal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since you don&#39;t seem capable of reasoned and polite discourse, I&#39;m not going to trouble myself with you much more.</p>

<p>I <em>did</em> read your post, but realized that your central point appears to be that Drees didn&#39;t really get a moon rock from Nasa. I think we can agree with that.  You also seem to think that Nasa never claimed they give him a moon rock, they just gave him petrified wood,  and that the other moon rocks are authentic. OK. But you do know the rock was insured <a href="http://phys.org/news/2009-09-moon-fake.html">was insured for approximately half a million dollars</a>?</p>

<p>I did forget to address your point about his point about the moon rocks being &quot;virtually indistinguishable&quot; from Antarctic lunar meteorites. This is what he wrote. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is known for sure is that even some of the ‘debunking’ websites have, albeit reluctantly, acknowledged that meteorite samples gathered from Antarctica are virtually indistinguishable from NASA’s collection of Moon rocks. Of course, as we very recently learned, that is not true of all of NASA’s Moon rocks. Some of them apparently bear no resemblance at all to lunar meteorites. Instead, they look an awful lot like petrified wood from the Arizona desert.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Either way, as I said, though maybe you didn&#39;t catch it, it&#39;s a minor point. </p>

<p>I&#39;d suggest you learn to talk to strangers you disagree with in a more civil tone. It&#39;s more conducive to constructive discussion. I imagine you&#39;ll give me a downvote and another invective-filled comment in response though. When you grow up, you&#39;ll learn that actually politely disagreeing with people goes a long way to making a point. However, if you just want to get people angry your tactic will work with most, but it won&#39;t work with me. </p>

<p>Of course, as we very recently learned, that is not true of all of NASA’s Moon rocks. Some of them apparently bear no resemblance at all to lunar meteorites. Instead, they look an awful lot like petrified wood from the Arizona desert.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is conjecture based on the initial supposition that the rock given to Deese was claimed to be a moon rock, which has never been confirmed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;d suggest you learn to talk to strangers you disagree with in a more civil tone. It&#39;s more conducive to constructive discussion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I really don&#39;t care to listen to tone arguments from people who deny facts.  It does on the other hand, present an easy out for you to continue believing in the absurdity of the &quot;Apollo hoax&quot; without doing any subsequent research or learning.</p>

<p>Do you think I really want to bother &quot;discussing&quot; anything further with someone who has the emotional maturity of a 14 year old? I have no real emotional attachment to the &quot;hoax&quot; theory at all. But I no longer have an attachment to the idea that the Moon landing happened either. It really doesn&#39;t matter to me. The series is a good read and after I read it, I&#39;m more persuaded that it was a hoax, but I&#39;m not here to convince you of what you already know happened as a fact. And apparently, you&#39;re not even interested in convincing me that I&#39;m wrong because if you were, you&#39;d use a more subtle tactic than invective filled replies.   If you had come at this from the perspective of trying to persuade me, politely, that McGowan is wrong and here&#39;s why,  I would be glad to engage with you. But seriously, just listen to yourself.  Do you speak to people like that in real life? </p>

<p>I&#39;m fortunate enough to live in a place with a very high level of post-secondary education and progressive thought so I don&#39;t really encounter people who are &quot;more persuaded&quot; that the moon landings were a hoax.  They know how to analyse scientific evidence and documentation and don&#39;t simply believe the ramblings of a single person on the internet which apparently discounts the hundreds to thousands of independently reviewed samples, documents, experiments, diagrams, blueprints, mission plans, recordings and photographs which demonstrate otherwise.</p>

<p>So no, I don&#39;t really talk to people like this in real life, because there is hardly ever a reason to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Terrible news.  He has been by far my most relied upon source since maybe 6 months after I started educating myself a few months after 9/11.  I corresponded with him by email a couple times over a decade ago (wow, his writing has been a part of my life so long) and he was very much as you would expect from his Newsletters.  He said he didn&#39;t usually respond to emails but that he liked my then email address crackbabyjesus.</p>

<p>I truly hope someone backs up and or maintains his site.  I&#39;m going to go copy the Lincoln series (and selected other bits) now as I have barely started it.  I&#39;m also going to order his first 2 books, which I don&#39;t have, before they get too hard to find.</p>

<p>Also, a lot of stuff didn&#39;t get onto/stay on his site (some probably for legal reasons).  You can still find the following (mostly) if you look hard enough:</p>

<p>The 5 part pedophocracy series;</p>

<p>There&#39;s Something about Henry (regarding Henry Lee Lucas, also covered in Programmed to kill);</p>

<p>His wranglings with Mike Ruppert, who he convincingly accused of being a disinfo agent and of faking the trashing of his own office by the FBI;</p>

<p>His accusations against Michael Aquino of being the main figure in the Presidio mass molestation case (covered in the Pedophocracy series);</p>

<p>and certainly other things I have forgotten or never found over 14 years.</p>

<p>Not sure if his many Meria Heller interviews are archived, but maybe.</p>

<p>Truly a sad day.  He was easily the best at what he did in the post 9/11 era.  At least he outlived Ruppert ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was diagnosed with a particularly aggressive form of small-cell lung cancer in June, maybe late May. On  June 14 he posted this, which I&#39;ll just reproduce here for convenience.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just nine weeks ago, on April 14, I presented a lengthy video deconstruction of the 2013 Boston Marathon incident through the Caravan to Midnight radio show/podcast. About a week later (on April 20, of all days), the nearly four-hour video presentation was uploaded to YouTube. Not long after that, someone using the username Phoenix Archangel posted an interesting comment: &quot;John [Wells, the host of the show] always signs off with some of the best advice ever. Speaking of advice: this David McGowan fella really ought to quit smoking. With all the elitist feathers he&#39;s ruffling, he&#39;s likely to come down with a spontaneous case of hitherto undiagnosed stage 4 inoperable Pancreatic cancer.&quot;</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t watched the video yet, by the way, you really need to do so. And have all your friends and family members watch it as well. It’s a little on the long side and could use some serious editing, but it does succeed in completely laying waste to the official story of what happened in Boston on April 15, 2013. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzgON_5sg4Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzgON_5sg4Q</a>)</p>

<p>As for Mr./Ms Archangel, he/she wasn’t too far off, though I’ve been told that it’s actually incurable small-cell lung cancer that has already spread to my liver and bones. And no, that’s unfortunately not a joke. It’s my new reality as of just a few short weeks ago, when my entire world was turned upside-down and I suddenly found myself being admitted to the oncology ward at Glendale Adventist Medical Center. Four days later, I was beginning my first round of chemotherapy infusions. The second round begins tomorrow, on Monday, June 15.</p>

<p>I’m still having a very hard time processing all of this. Despite not having the healthiest diet and not making the most healthy lifestyle choices, I have been remarkably healthy throughout my adult life. Until a few weeks ago, I’d never been hospitalized as an adult. Never had any surgical procedures performed. Never had a major illness or significant injury. Never broke a bone in my body. Haven’t ever been reliant on any prescription drugs of any kind. Haven’t even had a primary care physician for many, many years.</p>

<p>But now, literally overnight, that reality has been replaced with a painful and, if I’m being perfectly honest, terrifying new reality. Based on what my doctors have told me and what I have read, the prognosis is not good. My oncologist seems to be of the opinion that I only have a couple years left on this planet, if that. The odds of surviving for even five more years are very, very low.</p>

<p>But I’ve never been one for taking advice or believing what I have been told. And I can be exceedingly stubborn. So if the medical community tells me that there is virtually no chance that I can survive this, I will do everything in my power to prove them wrong. But it is going to be a long, tough fight against a formidable foe. And any support that readers can offer, whether financial or moral, will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>In closing, thanks to all of you for your support and encouragement over the years. I hope to be able to continue to expose the crimes of the elite for many years to come. Stay tuned ….</p>

<p>Did you know that the CIA has the ability to give people cancer? From his website:</p>

<p>&quot;Speaking of advice: this David McGowan fella really ought to quit smoking. With all the elitist feathers he&#39;s ruffling, he&#39;s likely to come down with a spontaneous case of hitherto undiagnosed stage 4 inoperable Pancreatic cancer.&quot;</p>

<p>Intelligence agencies like the CIA can kill someone and make it look like cancer or a heart attack or a drug overdose or suicide. Guys like this are prime targets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oddly enough, he never really did. There&#39;s his short piece called <a href="http://www.whale.to/b/mcgowan.html">Ruminations on Littleton, Mind Control, and JFK</a>, but that doesn&#39;t really cover the assassination so much as it does MKULTRA . Maybe he felt it was already well covered. He seemed more interested in the more unexplored or poorly covered conspiracies. </p>

<p>But that as important a writer on conspiracies should have died on the anniversary of the assassination of JFK is kind of spooky. Or a remarkable coincidence. Whether he wrote about it or not, it must have been one of the first &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; he was exposed to, given his age. He wasn&#39;t much more than 50.</p>
