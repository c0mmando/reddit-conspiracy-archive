<p>The problem with this statement is that it suggests that we (the US) is supporting terrorism with the &quot;end goal&quot; being: &quot;ending terrorism&quot;.  (i.e., &quot;The ends justify the means -- so long as we end terrorism.&quot;)</p>

<p>In fact, the end goal is &quot;the greater israel&quot; - primarily -- with the industrial military complex (oil companies included in this lot) happily supportive/profiting from the aggression.</p>

<p>i.e., ISIS™ is absolutely NOT a false terrorism organization.  It&#39;s real.  And it primarily operates as a proxy army for Israel w/ critical financial and tactical aid from the US &amp; EUR.</p>

<p>The comment is insinuating that the &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; that clearly show that the US has created, funded, and armed ISIS are unfounded because &quot;they have been bombing them for more than a month.&quot;</p>

<p>The truth is, Russia has done more in 3 weeks to destroy ISIS than the US has done in 2 years.  Which, I believe, is the reason these Paris attacks were done to create public support for troops on the ground in Syria.  The false pretense will be used to attack the Assad regime in Syria and ultimately strengthen ISIS.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ISIS = Israeli Secret Intelligence Services (imo). If you notice, before ISIS started to dominate every MSM outlet Israel was in the news a decent bit with tensions building between Israel and Syria over the Golan Heights oil drilling by Genie Oil of Israel (Dick Cheney, Jacob Rothschild, and Rupert Murdoch comprise the &quot;Strategic Advisory Board&quot; of Genie Oil).</p>

<p>The Golan Heights ordeal, to me, is extremely telling of what is actually happening and why our (Zionist owned) media focus has switched from demonizing Iran to demonizing Syria at the drop of a hat. Also, if I remember correctly, it seems ISIS&#39;s focus changed toward Syria (according to the news) around the same time as well, although I think ISIS was always at least loosely mentioned in reference to Syria.</p>

<p>Also, to the best of my knowledge, ISIS has never attacked Israel...I&#39;ve heard they allegedly fired one projectile in the general direction of Israel but it hit in the Gaza strip. </p>
