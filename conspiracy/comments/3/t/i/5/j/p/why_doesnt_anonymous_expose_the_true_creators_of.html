I don&#39;t know a whole lot about Anonymous other than that they started here in Clearwater, Florida as an organization to protest the Church of Scientology. The Guy Fawkes masks were worn because Scientology security guards take pictures of everyone attending protests, and then spend countless hours identifying every protester in the photo so they can be harassed and intimidated at a later date. I used to see these dudes in Guy Fawkes masks on Fort Harrison all the time. I&#39;m not sure how they got from that to taking on world governments and such.

    <div class="md"><p>The majority of the members from the original public group Anonymous have been arrested and put in jail. This all happened a couple years ago. The group Anonymous today is not the same that existed then. Today, Anonymous is nothing more than a DoD psyop to trick those who agree with Anonymous in believing the war on ISIS is real. In other words, to legitimize ISIS. The sole focus of Anonymous when they first started was the freedom of information and informing the public about the wrongdoings of their Governments. Those people are no longer allowed near a computer, and more than likely still inside a very small cell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never claimed anon are <em>all</em> shitty insiders, I claimed that some of them were. </p>

<p>My evidence is admittedly circumstantial, but the deduction goes like this. The USG has a need to engage in cyberwarfare against both state and independent actors. The USG cannot overtly be seen to engage in cyberwarfare against state actors. Anonymous is a disparate group of hackers, with no tests for membership, who conduct attacks against both state and independent actors. The USG <em>can</em> operate under the guise of anon so as to not be found out by other state actors.</p>

<p>This is the line of reasoning that leads me to believe that at least <em>some</em> anon actors likely are on the payroll of the USG, which is all I&#39;ve ever claimed here. It makes sense from their perspective to do so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try to find the video from a few years ago when the FBI and various government agencies were losing their shit that they couldn&#39;t catch the leaders of Anonymous, so...they get this guy who is completely and clearly a shill. He goes on an interview claiming that he is the leader of Anonymous. He&#39;s smoking a cigarette, acting like aloof and all anti-establishment...or rather how a machine would perceive someone who is anti-establishment would act. It was the most artificial embarrassing honey pot shit you could come up with and no one went for it at all. Anonymous actually made fun of it and it may have been a meme at some point. The video seems to have been eradicated from history, but if you can find it, preserve it because it is a far more valuable insight into the way the machine thinks than most people realize. </p>

<p>One of the bigger implications is that Anonymous as it originally was, no longer exists. Anonymous represented something that is incredibly bad for systems of control: uncertainty. It was a variable that carefully engineered social systems could not predict. When your control rests on the ability to orchestrate staged events, control the flow of information and reaction to those events, and then also sell the grieving process/solution to those events, the last thing you need is someone randomly showing up and potentially pulling down the curtain. </p>

<p>Incapable of actually defeating Anonymous after trying almost everything, the most obvious solution was to simply create a new Anonymous that would eventually blend in and merge with the old Anonymous. This ultimately would end up putting control of the larger operations and media attention of the group into the hands of the establishment. Now at last, the uncertain and unpredictable variable could be controlled and any Anonymous operations not coming from the artificial main unit would reveal themselves and be dealt with until all that remained was the Anonymous the establishment created. The old Anonymous is gone and the new Anonymous is a part of the system of control. A manufactured devil that is under control to replace a devil that wasn&#39;t. </p>

<p>Edit: I actually went looking for the video or any traces of the interview and legitimately can&#39;t find it anywhere.</p>

How do you think they <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=q6d-4OYHLOc">recorded and leaked a phone call between FBI and Scotland Yard?</a> What it does do is cuts off a news source for the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3168428/British-jihadi-posed-Ed-Balls-dreamed-Asian-Prime-Minister-killed-anti-ISIS-air-strike.html">cheapskate media who don&#39;t seem to have war correspondents anymore.</a></p>

<p>look at the numbers. ISIS have between <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant">50,000 and 250,000 members</a> of which, <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/isis-terror/isis-numbers-foreign-fighter-total-keeps-growing-n314731">3,400 are from 50 Western States</a></p>

<p>Doing this will not cut the head off ISIS, nor will it strike at their heart. Meanwhile ISIS continue&#39;s to make $3,000,000+/day selling oil to anyone that wants a bargain. And who is banking that $3,000,000 a day? Where is it being spent? Time was when anonymous would ask these sorts of questions. Alas, no more. </p>

We let our masterminds in Israel plan the deceptions. We don&#39;t do anything directly, so there is nothing to expose that doesn&#39;t take a huge explanation of connect the dots.

    <div class="md"><p>Anonymous is just too loose an organisation. By its very nature it is easy to get spies in there, or even to impersonate their brand, since mostly everyone there is anonymous, even to each other. I could literally put on a Guy Fawkes mask right now, disguise my voice, and make a Youtube video in which I claim to represent them.</p>

<p>The very idea that people can rise up to facilitate change themselves is hindered by the fact that, while they might agree on much, everybody ultimately has a different view on the exact changes which are necessary. And when people are looking to divide you, they do not divide you through your similarities but through your differences. </p>

<p>We have been taught to not question authority. We have been taught to look at money and material things as a reason why you do the things you do, because you need to earn a living. I don&#39;t see freedom in that. Especially when that same authority is suppressing the very thing that got it there.. SCIENCE. The only new tech we see is tech that can make a lot of money.
