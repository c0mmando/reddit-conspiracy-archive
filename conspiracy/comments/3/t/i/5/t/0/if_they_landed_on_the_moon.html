    <div class="md"><p>Do you realize it&#39;s actually the Jews who benefit from making us think we landed on Luna (That is her true name). Jews worship the moon. Try to look at the moon with your telescope you will not see any spaceships on it&#39;s surface. There is no way we went beyond the Van Allen radiation belts. If you went through there you would come back with 4 eyes and 7 dicks. Jews and Phoenicians worship the same deities that ISIS worships today. They all worship the god of 1000 names. They worship the same being who the Nazis worshiped. All peoples trying to overcome others worship this entity through one name or another. Ninety-nine percent of them don&#39;t even realize who they are worshiping. The world is full of cannibalistic fucking psychopaths, they drink blood, they worship a stone, they fucking pray to a wall, it&#39;s all the same shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty tough to believe anyone has ever landed on the moon if you actually look at it critically.  Just the logistics of the gear supposedly taken, weights, fuel requirements, accuracy of equipment required.  There is just no way.  This is a good start:  <a href="http://davesweb.cnchost.com/Apollo1.html">http://davesweb.cnchost.com/Apollo1.html</a></p>

<p>Bill Cooper had some thoughts:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mrhO6TCuF4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mrhO6TCuF4</a></p>

<p>I think the reason so many people believe it is the size of the lie prevents them from looking.  It would be too large a blow to their world view, so they just do whatever mental gymnastics are required to continue safely believing.</p>

<p>But it is nonsense.  The rest of space travel too.  We don&#39;t have any probes checking out pluto and mars.    </p>

<p>You really believe that to be an analogous argument?  The moon (as described to us by officials) is a completely different environment.  There is only the sun as a light source and there is a lack of surfaces to bounce off of and atmosphere to refract through.  </p>

<p>There are pages and pages of arguments there.  Cherry picking one or two to refute does not dismiss the rest.  But I know you well enough, Rockran.</p>

More often than not, these myriad arguments are full of half-truths, lies, and straw-man arguments — the only condition is that there be many of them, not that they be particularly compelling on their own.</a></p>

<p>&quot;Too many words, I don&#39;t want to read.&quot;  Read it, there are compelling arguments in there.  I know you won&#39;t though.
