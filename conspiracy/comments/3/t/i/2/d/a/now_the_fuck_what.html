<p>That&#39;s still a pretty positivistic and naive way of approaching the situation. </p>

<p>The way I&#39;ve come to see society or even the driving forces within an individual, I tend to be way less optimistic, not to say despondent, disappointed with and frightful of humans. Their stupidity, hypocrisy, and, more often than not, cowardice is boundless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first step to solving a problem is admitting we have a problem. If these things were proven to be true, and a majority of the public believed them as being true, then we could work together to come up with a solution. I don&#39;t have any answers, and I&#39;m sure not one person has <em>all</em> the answers, so we would need to work collectively towards a common goal. Currently the general public is divided on so many, mostly irrelevant, issues that it would be impossible to have everyone work together to drastically improve or renovate society. A <em>mass awakening</em> would need to occur to get the public body moving in the same direction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Be, and do it well. The only thing you can do about &quot;it&quot; is in your locality, those whom <em>can</em> do, say.. <em>more</em> or whatever in that <em>area</em> should already know since its part of their emergent preceived locality, usually directly. </p>

<p>That is to say, nothing unless you <em>can.</em> An this is the most important part, do what you <em>can</em>. Don&#39;t worry about the town over unless you <em>can</em>, the ones who already <em>can</em> do that, should, though it involves more than any <em>one</em>. </p>

<p>If someone who <em>can</em> help out another place (than the locality they are in) does not have the support of their <em>local</em> presence area then most &#39;help&#39; they provide to another will have <em>space</em> for &#39;a problem&#39; in their &#39;local presence area&#39; to <em>go</em> over there. Of course this is all too oversimplified to draw hard conclusions and solutions from but it conveys the importance of <em>us</em> realizing (with our real eyes) <em>we</em> must solve the problems <em>we</em> face by working together with <em>us</em>. Remember &quot;us&quot; is formed with (multiple) yo<strong>u</strong>(<strong>s</strong>) and &quot;we&quot; is formed from double you(s) engaged with efficiency. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buh99FnKacM">E²</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, collect and organize the proof, the names, and the data so it is very clear, succinct, direct, unbiased, easily-distributable and easily-understandable with minimal artistic b.s./dressings/sugar-coating/music/etc.</p>

<p>Then, distribute the information as quickly as possible to as many people as possible.</p>

<p>Then, vocally insist on trials. If trials never come, vocally insist on replacing the judges/prosecutors with people willing to bring trials. Whatever you do, as you are fighting the guilty you should never accept money or resources from the guilty. If you do, you become guilty.</p>

<p>As far as being happy, that&#39;s a personal thing and probably very varied. Some people can be happy knowing their elected representatives fostered the emergence of radical jihadism as long as America &quot;wins&quot; in the end, and some people cannot be happy with that knowledge. You may have to sacrifice your happiness if you wish to be morally upright. Or, you may even find that you&#39;re much happier knowing you didn&#39;t stand by and watch while your government representatives played military geo-political chess with real peoples&#39; lives in order to secure resources in a distant region. It kinda depends on your personality and goals.</p>
