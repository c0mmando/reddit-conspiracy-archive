       I saw it in reddit front page and per usual they took it down. Anything holding valuable information is being taken out of all u.s. Media. I mean this has been happening for years, I think the thing now is that soo mich is going unreported that its getting really hard to ignore. That and more people are beginning to wake up

       ....what does this have to do with anything, what point are you proving, why? Dont you think theres a big difference between the coverage things get when they are on the front page than on another subreddit? That's the point im trying to make. Not sure what youre trying to do here.

       Putin is definitely playing the chessboard well. He had to have this in his back pocket and I wonder if he'd have even put this out if it weren't for Paris on Friday.

       No play on MSM? There's 2 possibilities.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         They won't touch the story because they know it's not true... except that can't be it because how do they know it isn't true unless someone has done some investigative journalism to determine this?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They won't touch the story because someone higher up knows it
         <em>
          is
         </em>
         true. You can't do proper investigation because that would reveal the truth. You don't want to do a BS investigation because someone always notices the telltale signs of a phony investigation. So you just don't cover the story in the first place.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>

       I think there's a good youtube clip where Putin explains how ISIS actually came to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       tldr; all those Islamist 'Freedom Fighters' in Syria were essentially mercenaries being paid by the West to take down Assad. After a year or two, a bunch of them decided to go into business for themselves... taking over some oilfields, running shakedowns on the locals etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was Putin's version of events. Might not be 100% accurate or unbiased, but it sounds like a plausible enough explanation overall.

       That's the way it always works, eh? We setup the thugs (Saddam, Noriega, etc) wait for them to go into biz for themselves and then use them as an excuse to invade/intervene.

        Putin did say it at a press conference.
       </a>
       The fact that no major American media outfit is reporting on what Putin said is what's both enlightening and baffling.
      </p>
      <p>
       It does show that American corporate media is in lockstep wrt to the  propaganda that it allows its public to hear or not hear.

       Have you read the new story about the Sinai plane bombing? Russians are saying 'foreign explosives' detected. Also, they're offering a $50 million reward for capture/info leading to those responsible.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's something about the way these announcements have been worded that suggests the Russians don't quite believe the official story of what happened.

       I suspect $50 million will shake a few treetops. I don't think the Russians are buying the Western explanations either but they'll act like they are.
