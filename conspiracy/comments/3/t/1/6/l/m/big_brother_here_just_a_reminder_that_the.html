    <div class="md"><p>I have no human capital, but I <em>deserve</em> a living wage. And I demand productive workers and entrepreneurs give me a piece of their pie. Thank God you&#39;re here big brother to force them to give me part of their pie...  For if you didn&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t be able to afford MTV to keep up with the Kardashians, or have time to breed like a rabbit. Hell if you weren&#39;t here, I might even have to improve myself,  or read a book! I can&#39;t even begin to imagine how I would provide for my 7 kids. My days wouldn&#39;t be full of fun and entertainment,  wouldn&#39;t that be a miserable existence. Thank God big brother is here to help. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Easy, here&#39;s where he gets it wrong:</p>

<p>1) For profit education, just like for profit healthcare, and for profit prisons, is not the correct financial model for higher education (or really any education). Private education can exist on a free market basis, but having it be the standard is objectively wrong because of conflicts of interest.
2) Even assuming for profit is the correct model to use, the American for-profit educational system is one of the worst systems to date. Special rules and priorities abound to cover the numerous flaws that exist within the system, rules such as inescapable debt, even after delcaring bankruptcy. Stupidly high lump sum type payments tied into interest rates instead of a more equitable percent of future income repayment plans. The previous two points converge to form stupid repayment loopholes such as amassing high educational debt and then getting a job unrelated to your degree in a foreign country to refinance your debt as a % based income repayment. After a few years when you&#39;ve gamed the system and come out 100k+ ahead, just move back to America after maintaining your citizenship by renewing your visa every time the expiration comes up. The very idea that you need to go into debt to get an education, then use that education to get out of debt? </p>

<p>Just like the customary units, only America had such a backwards and inefficient education system. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re just anti-government. Cool. Most people are anti government until they widen their perception and understand the social benefits that are enjoyed by all citizens. To be a citizen is to pay for a service provided by the government. Nothing is free, but to claim that for profit education as a system en masse is a good idea is just stupid. It&#39;s not even arguable at this point, every other first world country has proven the American educational system to be inferior. You&#39;re behind the times or willfully ignorant, go read a newspaper if you don&#39;t believe me.</p>
