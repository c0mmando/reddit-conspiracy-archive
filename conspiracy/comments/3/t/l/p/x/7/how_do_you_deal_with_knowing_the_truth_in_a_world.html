       I feel very alone in this world with my thoughts and this sub has been a nice forum for me to feel less isolated and given me some hope that others 'get it' so to speak. So thank you.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I am facing an issue now that I'd like some feedback on if possible and it's that I feel completely overwhelmed with all this information. How do others deal with it? I want to fight a good fight but I honestly feel like the more I read the more discouraged I get because it gets darker and darker. And then I get very angry followed by sad and then extremely discouraged because I feel like we can't win against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The masses just lap this shit up and I can't take it; it's so frustrating to me that they buy these stories with so many obvious loop holes but no ones wants to think for themselves anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       The information is out there, I can offer article and case point after case point but it does nothing. The people at the top are laughing there asses off and how easy this whole thing has been to pull off.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL:DR How does everyone go about life after knowing all this stuff?

       You are not going about your life, you're going about your new life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be kind, show love, help, build, embrace, engage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about the water experiment:
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether it has been dismissed or not, consider it:
      </p>
      <p>
       a snowflake was frozen with a word placed on it. With "hate" the water crystallized into a chaotic, non-productive pattern. With "love", it became ordered and beautiful.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you project resonates with those around you creating an equal and symbiotic effect on them, which then reverberates through their connections.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make that reverberation as productive and positive as you can, because there are those reverberating the dark and chaotic who need to be challenged and will be outshone.

       It's difficult. But I am finding more people more open minded, though the recent terror attack has sent people mostly scurrying back to their most predictable behaviors: MORE WAR!  Or DON'T BE RACIST REFUGEE HATERS. That pretty much runs the gamut.

      <p>
       You can go back to Cassandra-- she knew what was going down, but nobody believed her because nobody wanted to believe her.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just keep saying what I know and believe, hope some of it gets traction when things really go wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       But remember this: From what you've seen, from what you've learned, you know that this rock we all live on is some kind of test. The object is to pass the test and get off the rock to whatever comes next. Nobody said the test was easy; in fact, they mostly say the opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
       So remember: In this life, we are controlled by time. Once we leave this life, everything changes.

       I ask myself that question everyday. I thought I was alone too :( I am still fairly young and I am having a really hard time deciding what to do with my life. I want to make a difference.. I want to help as much as I can.. Everyone tells me to forget about all this and just live my life, get a job, start a family.. But how can one just ignore all this darkness and corruption? We're all human in the end.. We all need the same things :( I find we're so advanced and intelligent as a species but there's still so much to learn.. Why can't we focus on making our lives as best as possible collectively instead of always thinking about money and power? I probably know the answers to all my questions.. But I still wish life were different. I feel like if I decide to ignore all this information and just 'live life', I'll be letting go the humane part of me.

       I just shrug it off. No one will see anything until we're post ww3. Or even nuclear holocaust. People are sheep animals. Let the sheep be sheep and prosper as much as your country will allow you to. As long as you aren't cripplingly lazy you'll have a semi decent life.

       I found exactly the same. Some close friends even feel more distant now, that we have less in common, since conspiracies have pretty much become my hobby and passion.
      </p>
      <p>
       What to do about it? I personally am prepared to a degree and am waiting for a some kind of event to align myself with and join into the next level of resistance. Got a feeling something big is on the horizon.

       I live in a third world country where people are barely able to get by, so Sandy Hook, 9/11, the Saudi and Zionist puppeteers, feminism---they're just first world curiosities for most.

       People here do acknowledge we're living in a corporate democracy, though most have just given up and settle for a life of three meals a day and beer and soap operas at night. They do seem happy and contented about that though, so I guess, they still win?

       The best knowledge is being able to recognize one's earlier ignorance. And then keeping the same skeptical eye toward current and future beliefs, as well.

       Nebulac, I sometimes feel hesitant to post certain things
       <em>
        here on this sub
       </em>
       because I feel that even this community will disregard it. When I run into something where I see absolute truth in, I am scared to share it because I can't handle the possible backlash or downvoting into oblivion. Why? Because deep down I wish that it would get picked up on and become acknowledged as accepted truth.
Sadly I don't think this reddit format of up- and downvotes is progressive at all, but this is a whole different subject

       "Before Enlightenment, chop wood carry water, after Enlightenment, chop wood carry water."

       For the time being at least, constantly talking about the things discussed in this sub, and taking drastic measures to try to not live in a world like this, doesn't seem to end well (ei. Edward Snowden). I think at this point in time, in the United States at least, spreading awareness when appropriate, and taking measures (bitcoin, staying out of debt, staying out of the army) to get rid of your involvement in continuing the things we talk about here is the best way to be able to live in this world without being outcast by everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course I do have a bias towards this, as I'm currently in a place where I don't want to be a super radical being chased by the government. Look elsewhere for advice on that

       Yeah, I am not American so some of that doesn't really apply.  The point of this discussion from my point wasn't leading to radical anything.  Just wanted some feedback from others who probably have been researching or debunking stuff for more years than I've been alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said though,  I believe we have a responsibility to not turn our back on the truth or just burry our heads in the sand and pretend nothing is happening. My issue was how do you still help or spread the cause without getting totally sucked in and bogged down yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I liked what a few others have said today about continuing to share with who will listen and being a postive influence vs  negative. I just am passionate and care about justice and people and I get overwhelmed in a world that thrives on injustice and corruption.
