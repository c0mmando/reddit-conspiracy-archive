       Well the French President was at the Stade de France during last Friday's attacks. That's pretty close. Now getting close enough to him was probably not even something they considered feasible, but regardless it was a message direct right at him.
      </p>
      <p>
       See the problem with attacking politicians is all the high level ones have a security detail.  The terrorist fucks want easy targets, not targets that will return fire.  They go for effecting the most carnage and terror (hence the moniker
       <em>
        terrorist
       </em>
       ).  It makes more of a statement if they slaughter 100 civilians, then it would if they kill a few bodyguards while trying to get to a politician.

       Bernie is safe because he is not talking about ending the Fed, and supports Israel-first middle eastern policy.

       Rand is safe because he is looking very unlikely to win. If his pops had gotten closer last election cycle, though...

       Realistically? They're harder targets. If I recall correctly, most of them have either private security/bodyguards or secret service if they rank high enough. That, and they're
       <em>
        here
       </em>
       , in the US, and not over there closer to the action. Not to mention, there aren't nearly as many sympathetic 'refugees' for the terrorists to hide amongst here, yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Theoretically? Even if they were pulling the strings, these people hate us all equally and wouldn't hesitate to put a bullet through the head of the people funding them, for Allah.

       Our politicians live among us too. The vast majority have little or no dedicated security staff. Of those that do have dedicated security, it is typically a driver/bodyguard with additional officers at events. Of course if they can afford more...

       Few problems with this: Suicide bomber's not gonna care about the security detail. He'll take them out, too. Second, something is off with your comment about refugees, like you're pushing something. Not that I'm singing "let 'em in". But that last part... hate us all equally? That's straight up propaganda. Why do they hate us? Our freedoms? :D

       This is true. Well, to a point. The bomber is going to
       <em>
        try
       </em>
       to take them all out. The security detail has a good chance of rolling a spot high enough to hit the bomber's disguise+hide in plain sight, then open up on them if they get close.

       If I'm

       No. Our religion and our race. More specifically, the fact that
       <em>
        we aren't a Muslim nation,
       </em>
       and we aren't what they are. It's
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       that simple. Oh, people are going to argue "but we've been shooting up their lands for years" like it's some sort of excuse, but the truth they don't want to admit is that people from that part of the world have
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       been hostile towards anything different, and
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       attempt to spread as they are now. It's war by migration and deception.
      </p>
      <p>
       And make no mistake,
       <em>
        we are at war
       </em>
       with an entire people and ideology, and the sooner people realize this the better. Islam is not compatible with other religions, it can not coexist in peace, and multiculturalism will be our death if we let it.

       Meh, I never implied what your motivation was. You could just be a fundamentalist pushing some pastor's "protect jesus from the infidels" schtick. -shrug-

      <p>
       As for "our race", what you described is every imperialist regime ever. The Europeans did it. The Orientals did it (Asia is really big and more than just "orientals"). I'm sure the Africans did it before their history was wiped. Ancient civilizations... you get the point. Hell... the Jews do it (whyyyyy do you think antisemitism exists? it's the same thing) but no gets all pissy about that. Look at palestine! Is it okay because they're "not like us"?

       No, I'm not a fundamentalist. That does not mean we don't need protecting. We're the 'infidels,' in their minds, and until we convert or are wiped out this will continue.

       Yes. This makes it somehow right? Point being,

      <p>
       Funny you should mention that. Why
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       we need a special term to describe someone who hates Jews, when anyone who hates blacks, Asians, Mexicans, or any other race falls under the blanket term "racist", someone who hates women or men in particular is a "sexist," and there is no one term to describe people who hate various religions? Why do Jews get their own word? Antisemitism: to hate the Jew. Why? For his race? His religion? Both?
      </p>
      <p>
       'Antisemitism' exists to prevent us from naming the Jew, plain and simple. It's to shut down any conversation involving potential Jewish misdealings--or at least, that's how
       <em>
        it's being used,
       </em>
       and that's what matters. Kind of like how feminism is using "misogyny" or "misogynist" to browbeat men.

       If it's only that we aren't them then why aren't they going after the Chinese? Chinese are even LESS them. How could they possibly not have another motive besides "kill the men, rape the women, convert/enslave the rest, take the stuff." That's... so basic it's insulting, frankly. Or would be if I gave a shit. Moving on! :D

       believe it. Western society is just at a higher priority to fuck with because our media runs contrary to everything they believe in and we've been waging wars (for Israel) against them for a while now. Which is what it boils down to in the end--that we're infidels and that we've been manipulated into raising a hand against them.

       I agree with you but remember a couple months ago when the meme was that ISIS was recruiting SO MANY Americans! So the argument that they are not here is kind of bunk according to the media. The fact remains that they are harder targets though.

       Maybe. It's also likely the media is full of shit. Odds are there are a few, yeah. Odds are also good that the FBI and other three-letter agencies have inflated their numbers by cooking up their own domestic 'terrorists' again.
