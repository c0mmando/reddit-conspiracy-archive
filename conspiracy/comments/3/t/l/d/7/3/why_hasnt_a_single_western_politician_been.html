<p>See the problem with attacking politicians is all the high level ones have a security detail.  The terrorist fucks want easy targets, not targets that will return fire.  They go for effecting the most carnage and terror (hence the moniker <em>terrorist</em>).  It makes more of a statement if they slaughter 100 civilians, then it would if they kill a few bodyguards while trying to get to a politician. </p>

<p>Suicide bomber&#39;s not gonna care about the security detail. He&#39;ll take them out, too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is true. Well, to a point. The bomber is going to <em>try</em> to take them all out. The security detail has a good chance of rolling a spot high enough to hit the bomber&#39;s disguise+hide in plain sight, then open up on them if they get close.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Second, something is off with your comment about refugees, like you&#39;re pushing something.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I&#39;m <em>pushing</em> anything, it&#39;s closing the borders. I do not appreciate the backhanded implication that I&#39;m a shill, sir or madame.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do they hate us? Our freedoms?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. Our religion and our race. More specifically, the fact that <em>we aren&#39;t a Muslim nation,</em> and we aren&#39;t what they are. It&#39;s <em>really</em> that simple. Oh, people are going to argue &quot;but we&#39;ve been shooting up their lands for years&quot; like it&#39;s some sort of excuse, but the truth they don&#39;t want to admit is that people from that part of the world have <em>always</em> been hostile towards anything different, and <em>always</em> attempt to spread as they are now. It&#39;s war by migration and deception.</p>

<p>And make no mistake, <em>we are at war</em> with an entire people and ideology, and the sooner people realize this the better. Islam is not compatible with other religions, it can not coexist in peace, and multiculturalism will be our death if we let it.</p>

<p>No, I&#39;m not a fundamentalist. That does not mean we don&#39;t need protecting. We&#39;re the &#39;infidels,&#39; in their minds, and until we convert or are wiped out this will continue.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As for &quot;our race&quot;, what you described is every imperialist regime ever.</p>

<p>Yes. This makes it somehow right? Point being, <em>we aren&#39;t them</em> and that is why they hate us.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>whyyyyy do you think antisemitism exists?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Funny you should mention that. Why <em>do</em> we need a special term to describe someone who hates Jews, when anyone who hates blacks, Asians, Mexicans, or any other race falls under the blanket term &quot;racist&quot;, someone who hates women or men in particular is a &quot;sexist,&quot; and there is no one term to describe people who hate various religions? Why do Jews get their own word? Antisemitism: to hate the Jew. Why? For his race? His religion? Both?</p>

<p>&#39;Antisemitism&#39; exists to prevent us from naming the Jew, plain and simple. It&#39;s to shut down any conversation involving potential Jewish misdealings--or at least, that&#39;s how <em>it&#39;s being used,</em> and that&#39;s what matters. Kind of like how feminism is using &quot;misogyny&quot; or &quot;misogynist&quot; to browbeat men. </p>

<p>&quot;Well, I think Hebbie Sheckelstein may be involved in some shady business...&quot;</p>

<p>The Chinese are on the list, <del>habeeb</del> believe it. Western society is just at a higher priority to fuck with because our media runs contrary to everything they believe in and we&#39;ve been waging wars (for Israel) against them for a while now. Which is what it boils down to in the end--that we&#39;re infidels and that we&#39;ve been manipulated into raising a hand against them.</p>
