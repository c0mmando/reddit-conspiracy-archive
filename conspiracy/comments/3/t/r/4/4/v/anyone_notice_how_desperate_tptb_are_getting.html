    <div class="md"><p>They can be as sloppy as they want so long as the masses are as medicated and content as they are. We, as a group, will never be free. Freedom comes from within, it comes from your heart; choosing not to be afraid (despite being in the face of monsters), choosing to believe in goodness (when there is no sign of it), and living the enlightened life (no matter how lonely it gets) is what it takes. TPTB are &quot;getting desperate&quot; to enact their plan. The people do not want to rule themselves. They never have. The people would not know what to do. We need them to keep the balance. As sad as it is, this is a dark world. Terrible things happen every day. Is that cause to be depressed, to not see how beautiful reality really is? No. The sky is beautiful. You are beautiful. We are all living, breathing, being together. It truly is amazing how complex the whole thing really is.  Guess what I&#39;m trying to say is, who cares what happens? Just enjoy the show. They&#39;re will always be &quot;more&quot;; when it&#39;s &quot;over&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The sloppiness is intentional.  The East vs West conflict is just theatre used to manipulate the masses.  The corruption of the West is revealed and the BRICS is there as the savior solution.  But the same central banking interests own them too.  All the war rhetoric is propaganda whether they intend to initiate a real conflict or not.  We need to keep an eye on what we are being manipulated into.  The only real enemies are our own security services and those of our allies.  Don&#39;t be manipulated into hating a strawman.  </p>

<p>We are not, you know how in the story book there are background entities? Like trees or rocks and stuff? That&#39;s the us, the 3rd group. The other two are the Good and Evil or rather God and Devil. These two groups are people that have worked their way through society to amass control and power for their respective groups. You and I are nothing more than cannon fodder, even if we agree with one of the groups ideas, when it goes down, they won&#39;t be making sure their bombs and bullets don&#39;t hit us. We will simply be collateral damage. That&#39;s the reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah - seems like everything is happening everywhere (or will be). don&#39;t need to watch the news anymore, i know there will be bombings, shootings, police abuse, celeb bs &amp; <em>music concerts</em> to make people think someone really gives a damn. </p>

<p>oh, let&#39;s not forget the need to buy lots of stuff we don&#39;t need, i&#39;m thinking most people are living beyond their means anyway, but hey what&#39;s another grand. the world feels like hell &amp; we&#39;re suppose to <em>not notice</em>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s blatant arrogance; they&#39;re smarter than us, better than us, more important than us and just plain DESERVE better than us.
The only flaw in the feudal plan is those pesky 90 million legal gun owners in a country with more firearms than people.   Aaaand guess who the next target of TPTB&#39;s attentions will be? 
We defeated the greatest military on Earth and won our freedom in the 1700s from a similarly arrogant monarchy.  You&#39;d think TPTB would have studied that in their better-than-our schools.
I see their changes as desperation and therefore encouraging.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re right. The huge advancement in tech has made it so easy to take on-scene video, share info, etc. That&#39;s probably why they&#39;re ramping up terror threats, to justify more patriot act shit. </p>
