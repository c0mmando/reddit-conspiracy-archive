       Long-time lurker here, but this was too ironic not to share. In issue 9 of ISIS's official magazine Dabiq, the unnamed author tries to equate conspiracy theorizing with "shirk," i.e., idolatry, which is the gravest sin in Islam. For example, thinking that the "kuffar," i.e., non-Muslims and their state powers, are powerful and coordinated enough to, for example, orchestrate the 9/11 terror attacks is to think that they are as powerful as God.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a link to the pdf of the magazine:
       <a href="https://azelin.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/the-islamic-state-e2809cdc481biq-magazine-9e280b3.pdf">
        https://azelin.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/the-islamic-state-e2809cdc481biq-magazine-9e280b3.pdf
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And here is a quoted passage:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Grand conspiracies consist of so many factors only controllable by Allah (ta’ālā). An example of such a grand conspiracy theory is that of September 11th being carried out by the Americans themselves. How many members of the crusader government would have to be under permanent watch to prevent news of the operation getting out before its execution? How many involved mouths would have to be silenced all over the world to keep such a conspiracy from not being exposed after the fact? How many other matters would have to be guaranteed to preserve the conspiracy? Such an exaggerated outlook to the event only comes at the price of tawhīd [monotheism, i.e., the opposite of idolatry]. Does America have control over so many factors? The attack was against America itself, and according to the conspiracy theorists, it was executed by the Americans! How many American officials would have felt themselves to be committing “treason” by knowing of the “conspiracy” and remaining silent? The reality can only be the obvious one – the definite truth – and that is that the mujāhidīn under the leadership of Shaykh Usāmah (rahimahullāh) [i.e., Osama bin Laden] carried out the blessed attack and thereby humiliated America in a manner it never experienced before."
      </p>
      <p>
       The lady doth protest too much, methinks...
      </p>
      <p>
       Does this mean that r/conspiracy is an official enemy of ISIS? If so, let's make sure to keep the conspiracy theories about ISIS rolling!
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, if more people around the world see ISIS as just a proxy for US-Israel, that further discredits them in the eyes of disaffected Muslims and diminishes their chances to gain recruits. Proliferating conspiracy theories about ISIS are probably one of the strongest PR tactics against the group, which is probably why they dedicated an entire article in their official magazine trying to undermine it.

       This narrative is creeping in other Sunni sects as well who have soft spot for British created Wahabi Islam.
      </p>
      <p>
       They argue that conspiracy theorist are labelled as soothsayer and fortune teller hence forbidden while in reality seeking and speaking truth is the most important part of Islam. Now in modern day Muslim groups it is more about peer approval and groupthink rather than speaking truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       E.g. Paper money was explicitly forbidden but since Saudia uses it nearly all Islamic groups consider it legal. When you mention this you will be ridiculed with examples of lizard people Illuminati jokes.

       What would be more scary? There being a global conspiracy, where everything is controlled and there is a hidden agenda? Or there isn't one, and the world is simply going off the rails into a Third World War right now, with increased surveillance.
      </p>

       If you think about it, it doesn't matter, that's where we are headed if either was the case.
