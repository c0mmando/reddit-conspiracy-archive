       I certainly agree. Most genuine users lurk for a while before posting anyway, so waiting a month wouldn't be much of an inconvenience.
      </p>

       Perhaps the mods could starting making a note of the age of the accounts that they ban - are many of them brand new accounts?

       Yeah the problem is that the truly dedicated trolls (and dare I say shills) will continue doing what they do regardless.  We've had people message the modmail after they've been banned telling us they'd be back or that they have 50 accounts just waiting in the wings and, while I'm sure some of them are just trolling, I expect that some of them aren't.

       I have been posting here since the beginning of Reddit, and am a popular contributor here. Unfortunately, I frequently get shadowbanned, usually due to comments in
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       that logically question the narrative. Why should I have to wait a month to post here upon making a new account? I have more credibility than most of the people here.

       From what little I've seen of you, you're a boorish egotist who frequently attacks the mod-team for not capitulating to your demands that they make you a mod.

       People only get shadowbanned when they try to cheat at reddit by double-voting or otherwise breaking the simple and straightforward terms of service.

       Actually, people get shadowbanned for making good point against a consensus, raising awareness to a different point of view, and being influential.  The fact that you either don't know this or refuse to acknowledge this puts you in the minority here, kid.

       You don't agree with me, so you are going to act like I have some obligation to prove something to you that you know damn well no one has any ability to?  You can be shadowbanned for anything, I just happen to get shadowbanned after posting to a certain subreddit about certain issues.

       If you've been shadowbanned for your behavior in worldnews before and you keep coming back and starting shit with people, causing the mods a headache, then you will rightfully be shadowbanned again for ban evasion. It's not that complicated.

       I'm sure I will. but that does not invalidate my insights on day one. censorship is censorship, - free speech is not just for the established, seasoned voices.
      </p>
      <p>
       why would you want to make a new poster wait a month to "learn what is acceptable" - before they speak from the heart, this proposal you are making is is a system that dulls new truth. questioning the establishment is always about asking new questions. the impulse to share what is on one's mind should not be dampened until that person knows what "acceptable" questions are. there should be no training period where a mindset can be normalized to those who are already asking questions - to express ones original thoughts and questions.

       I'm sure your insights on day one were positively scintillating, but plenty of trolls create accounts just to attack this sub, and they don't care if their one-day account is banned. It is easier and less messy to stop these people from posting, rather than banning them after they have jizzed all over the sub. Generally a prophylactic is preferable to a vaginal douche.

       maybe I don't understand exactly what you are doing/why.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not in favor of real trolls or racist.
      </p>
      <p>
       but my experience has been a lot of people calling me a troll/shill because I sometimes post about flat earth, and I think it's super lame that people think they can decide what is ok to talk about and what is not. I don't try to shut down anybody talking about aliens - and i think its all  bs. but I don't feel angry about it, or want to shut them down.  I believe  - we don't all have to think the same things.
      </p>
      <p>
       so I think people take advantage of the idea of identifying shills and just label people they don't agree with that. and I'm sick of it. that's specifically why this convo makes me so annoyed.
      </p>
      <p>
       but also -- I really do think we should greet newcomers openly - because with each new sketchy event in news there's an influx of cospiracy curious -- and i would want them to feel welcome not like they had immediate restrictions. I really think there is so much strength in the possibility that numbers can grow rt now -- Paris attacks for example gt new round of people thinking -- is the news not so honest - andI think we should encourage that like hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       i guess I'm no afraid of shills - i feel their own weak arguments will be their undoing, and keeping gates open for new conversation should be our priority,

       Because free speech is supposed to be used to speak the truth, to allow legitimate discussion about the powers that be. Shills are paid to use their free speech to spread lies and derail honest conversation. If we can keep their effectiveness in check by making them late to the discussion, while still keeping the conversation honest and informative, then we should. In fact, this doesn't limit free speech at all, eventually you can have your say.

       the point is we NEED new voices, it's better - the more who join up we become the norm not the subjugated, and we can overcome the powers that be. in fighting should not be the death of us, remember the real enemies are the ones orchestrating the unjust wars, etc. growing numbers who see this big problem, new or old,  is to our advantage and should be encouraged.

       The mod team feels that the current two day delay that's been in use for quite a while is sufficient. I don't remember it ever being a month.
      </p>

       Let's see how this thread goes though and if the consensus is to lengthen the delay time then the mods may revisit it.

       What you're doing right now clearly isn't working for our community.  Why is this not being discussed as the most important challenge facing us?  Why aren't members and moderators alike working together to fix some very easily addressed problems?  If there were a vote for mods for exactly this, based solely on performance - past and present, for permitting and sometimes promoting long standing members, who were highly beneficial contributors of our communitu to reach their breaking points and either leave all together, or see themselves wrongfully banned. And I hate to say it, but it would purely be a vote of
       <strong>
        no confidence
       </strong>
       .  I can't recall knowing if I've even witnessed you or any other mod (FT excluded) so much as acknowledge the problems that are now growing in size and frequency.   And if not addressed, will likely ruin the board.  There's an old saying: what you permit, you promote.  And what we see is you promoting these attack shills. Lack hunters with only one purpose. They refuse debate. They refuse reason.  And this is what's being promoted here?  [ed. Clarity]
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you saying because of the administrative overhead of manually approving certain submitters that don't meet very fair criteria, you would rather we continue with the same inaction seen today?  The key issues that plague us could almost entirely be handled by a few common sense changes.  Instead of continuing down this same path, month after month, allowing the same contrarian disruptors to not only continue unabated, but to further grow in size.
      </p>
      <p>
       This comment on our current state of affairs is NOT an insult or attack.  This is an attempt to spark further discussion and ultimately action on this matter.

       Is it possible to compromise with an elongated AutoModerator pull period and the ability for mods to "white list" people on an individual basis on merit? Too subjective?

       Can AutoModerator notify accounts more than X days old that their comments are filtered and direct them to seek the mods for assistance?

       We do have the ability to 'whitelist' people but with about 300 new subscribers every day and no way to know which are new accounts it would be very time consuming.

       This will not stop anything. It will actually discourage new users, while the shills will just buy aged accounts as well as create new ones and use them in a month.

       I believe you have me confused with someone else. And yes, I'm breaking character.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a semi regular here. As I said, I'm playing devil's advocate. I'm not sure why you think me referring to your old screen name or to "conspiratard" users who have a history of using alts (unhinged ursines, for example) is any sort of telling, other than the fact that I've been around a bit longer than my screen name would suggest. Which is something I've kinda hung a lantern on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom line: I don't like censorship. I don't see how increasing censorship for the sake of convenience is reasonable, especially when such an increase won't result in anything constructive. If people are gonna troll or shill or disrupt or go on rants praising AE911 before devolving into calling everyone shills and crying about being stalked and getting banned (again) with a new screen name on a monthly basis, they're going to do it regardless of how many usernames they go through and how often those usernames get banned and how long the waiting period is.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not going to fix anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       All its going to do is make it so people who genuinely want to be part of the discussion and should be part of the discussion can't be. How many times have you seen a new user being called a shill because they're actually ignorant of the truth (and looking for it)? How many times have you seen someone dismiss another person's comment or question or even outright insult them because their account is only 3 months old?
      </p>
      <p>
       This place is intimidating enough for new users, shut them out more than they are already ostracized now and this place will run stagnant.

       Not that often. Then again, I don't go out of my way to look for that kind of stuff like some do. Getting this sub banned/quarantined is the White Whale for a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of redditors for myriad reasons, and as a result they comb through this sub for anything and everything that they can possibly highlight to deride and whine about. Many of them even abuse reddit's anonymous username system and make new accounts to deceptively manufacture things to whine about.

       It's just a month. You're trying to make a tempest in a teapot out of this. Reddit isn't fringe or obscure any more, it's one of the most visited sites in the English language WWW. Most people already have an account.
      </p>
      <p>
       The net benefit to the quality of the sub achieved by deterring the ban-evading jerks will greatly outweigh the loss of a handful of legit users who want to participate with their new account. And regardless, those who think they've got something important to say can simply send a modmail and ask that their comment/post be un-removed.

       The vast majority of new users I see posting here are malicious and contrarian. It's almost certain that they are butthurt ban-evaders who faithfully believe the SRD/#modtalk-fueled smear campaign that this subreddit is openly racist/bigoted.

       That's a moot point. Reddit is anonymous by design. I've been here for 7 years with two accounts (I would still use my original if it wasn't shadowbanned because a fallacious report was believed) and I'm still completely anonymous. Just don't post your PI and you won't have to keep reinventing yourself here.

       Agreed in principle, but disinformation and hostility toward open mindedness from the ban-evading new accounts works directly against that principle. It's made this subreddit a hostile and annoying environment for most of the regular users. Driving them away by allowing throw-away trolls blurting out "teh jooos dun it!" and ban-evaders attacking every idea that they subjectively disagree with is only making this subreddit that much less respectable and enjoyable.

       It's not a moot point.  If I talk about my state, my hobbies, &amp; my family status you could look at them together and figure out where I'm at. If you looked at my entire post &amp; comment history you could get an idea that I'm an anti-establishment kinda guy that believes our government has no place in this day &amp; age. Now, if that info is being used to start throwing people into the FEMA camps we've all heard of before, they could find me by my IP. So, as a pretty easy to take step to avoid this,  I change profiles every so often. Then, they can't put that information together. I actually don't remember when they did what you're asking for before, but I don't &amp; won't agree with censorship in my

       New accounts could still vote and browse. The people who truly wanted to participate here with comments and posts would only have to wait a short while. Even a two-week period would lead to a readily noticeable improvement in the level of discourse here IMO.

       shills could just as easily plan ahead as anybody, in fact they are the only ones best prepared to anticipate when they may want to plan ahead, what you would also be doing is keeping influx of new geniuine voices at bay. take paris for example - -lots of people came on here for first time moved to find alternate conversations. why dampen that influx and make them feel subjugated? no good reason at all. the doors should be wide open for new voices. you WANT your numbers of free thinkers to grow don't you? why would you make it hard to start talking.

       No it wouldn't. If you only came here to post at r/conspiracy, then you would have read and then after a month you'd be posting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I 100% agree that there should be a limit. Maybe a month is a bit long but I could see 2 weeks. That way troll accounts are not able to enter the conversation at all and we ensure only interested people are involved.

       lame. why would I want to wait? I'd just go elsewhere where there were not constraints. reddit is supposed to be about free dialogue.  you aren't better than me because you've been hanging out on reddit longer. we all have an equal right to post our thoughts when those thoughts come to mind.

       The main reason I do not post very frequently on this sub is because of the amount of trolls.
      </p>
      <p>
       Usually after a post you get a load of downvotes. Meanwhile you can see articles like "trump has highest SNL ratings ever" get upvoted to the front page. Loads of non conspiracy posts, political shills and general trolls have made this board lesser in quality.

       I know it´s unproductive up to plain sickening to read through a lot of stuff here. I don´t, well, didn´t, post here, but read a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       But do you really want to risk missing/letting down someone who comes here to post something really new, something that might be important and urgent,  something that might even bring people to not just talk but act, just because their account isn´t old enough? Someone who´s in a pinch about something and had no involvement or idea of such things before might search the interenet for a forum and come here to try to reach a public, uncensored, in the hope of not exposing themselves to whatever people who might not just not listen to them. A month can be
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       long. Sure most people could wait a month to contribute without the world stopping to turn, but what if they have something to post that
       <em>
        can´t
       </em>
       wait a month?
      </p>
      <p>
       As others say, the kind of people who do detrimental things hardly will have scruples about hoarding accounts, or already have hoarded them, or will make and hoard them, either.
Banning trolls as they troll, is one thing, keeping people from participating here based on nothing more than the date they created their account, another.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who come here because they have something important to say might rightfully go elsewhere if they can´t say it. Let´s hope there is an elsewhere for them then and that not everywhere won´t let anyone post who hasn´t a minimum 1 month old account.

       Easy for professional shills to get around. They just have to churn out accounts on a daily basis and have a 1 month buffer for them to mature. It's almost no trouble at all for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the growth in popularity of the sub-Reddit it's highly inconvenient. New users to the forum who may have been unjustly banned from other conspiracy forums for having the 'wrong ISP' will come here and find they can't participate here either. They might have little interest in the rest of Reddit, and forget about joining in here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only kind of shills it might deter are non-professional, non government users from political forums who wish to make this sub a recruitment ground. I suppose such a rule would make a dent in their influence.

       I've been following this sub for years now but just set up an account about a month ago because I figured what the hell.. this could be a great place to discuss topics that the msm won't touch. We are like minded, we know to take everything with a grain of salt, and at the end of the day it's our choice to believe what we want and dismiss what we deem false. Ours and no one elses. You dont have to call someone a shill or troll because you dont agree, discuss why the earth is round instead of calling flatearthers retards. People come here because they are tired of the hate and attacks from msm sites.
Maybe it's the government agents (jtrig?) Doing there best to destabilize online communities trying to make a difference.

       Except most of these clowns have likely created accounts months ago, a batch at a time, and those accounts have likely been slowly posting comments or making favorable posts to easy boards to farm karma, so when they do eventually go full-retard shitposter, it'll be more difficult to tell them from 'real' accounts, because by all rights they technically are.

       Except that the whole 'social justice' movement, trying to convince people it's wrong to have opinions that go against certain races, religions, creeds, and so forth, is a form of programming. Really, it's only one tentacle on the beast trying to convince us multiculturalism works when it clearly does not.

       But if resistance to peer pressure makes you uncomfortable, feel free to conform. I'm not going to tell you how to live your life--only point out what is going on and that there are alternatives. It's hard to think less of those too afraid to stand up for what they believe, when the cost of doing so can be your job, reputation, livelihood, and potentially your life.

       I do it because every once in a while I mention something small (where I'm from, what I do for a living, etc.) and so I'm worried that someone could connect my information together. But maybe I'm just paranoid, I don't know.

       I really don't agree because we were all new to posting here once. I understand a lot of new accounts are flamebaiters and trolls, but if you enforce that rule it's like giving in to them. You're letting them stop genuine new participants contributing. Most people aren't going to wait a month for the right to post. They'll find a different sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe a compromise? For example, limiting contributions for new users rather than outright banning them.

       Reddit is a big place. Like you said, "they'll find a different sub", there's plenty of other places for them to pass the time. Meanwhile
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       will be here when they mature their account for a measly month.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one is suggesting banning new users, just limiting their contributions entirely until the account of a certain age. The whole point is to stop the throwaway sockpuppets that authoritarian know-it-alls use to come in here and do things like bully people and troll in an attempt to use black-propaganda to do their small part to paint this sub as socially unacceptable.

       Yes, in subs opened to undermine and ridicule r/conspiracy. They'll go to r/shittyconspiracy or r/topmindsofreddit, they'll hear a bunch of negative shit and they'll probably believe it because we won't let them post anything and they're already pissed at us.

       This is a terrible idea for people like me that've been shadow banned site wide. I posted a scientific article to
       <a href="/r/science">
        /r/science
       </a>
       and messaged a mod about removing my submission, he (a psychology grad) claimed it 'wasn't scientific'. My article was about agri-science, so I asked how he was qualified to judge the scientific merit of my submission, I pressed the issue and was promptly shadow banned.

       Not worth the time to take and upload a screenshot. All it says is my post was removed for 'not being scientific'. Then I asked how a psychology grad was qualified to judge whether an article about agri-science was scientific or not, and then I was SB'd.

       Why attribute to overcomplicated AI what can more easily be attributed to undertarded people?

       I'm sure I will. but that does not invalidate my insights on day one. censorship is censorship, - free speech is not just for the established, seasoned voices.
      </p>
      <p>
       why would you want to make a new poster wait a month to "learn what is acceptable" - before they speak from the heart, this proposal you are making is is a system that dulls new truth. questioning the establishment is always about asking new questions. the impulse to share what is on one's mind should not be dampened until that person knows what "acceptable" questions are. there should be no training period where a mindset can be normalized to those who are already asking questions - to express ones original thoughts and questions.
