        Do you think these PACs are giving to both parties because they're just so moderate or do you think it's because they are buying representation? I tend to think it's the latter.

       They are both horribly corrupt and do not represent any of the ideals they are expected to, but they are vile in different ways.

      <p>
       Both are selling off the country to the highest bidders, neither have a shred of actual patriotism, neither represent anything I care about in any meaningful way.

       Democrats accomplish little, but modern Republicans actively cause damage, that's the difference to me.  Republican policies are so crazy they fight over what kind of crazy to be.

       At the end of the day, they're doing this to influence people to vote for a certain candidate. If we ignore all the BS and choose a candidate that does not do their bidding we can effectively have all this circulating money these PACs invest into candidates become obsolete.

       They could be funding both sides to increase the likelihood of their preferred candidate winning. For example, in the current election I know some people donating to Sander's so he has a better chance at winning the nomination because they think (know) he's much easier for the Republicans to beat than Hillary

       Not really, this actually seems like a well-thought out plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they believe Sander's is going to lose against Hillary, and he's the weakest nomination (in their eyes), then giving him money to become the opposing parties' nomination is pretty smart. They think by doing this Hillary will have an easier time winning, versus another candidate that Hillary would either struggle with, or has more support.

       Most of the money given to American politicians -- the big money, I'm talking about -- is controlled by Jews. Unless you are willing to say the word "Jews" in this context, you can't talk about the corruption of American politics with any depth or discernment.

       TAX them until they can't afford to pay bribes and manipulate candidates ever again. The amounts they're paying are literally saying, "Here we can afford this." Better yet triple tax in the amount of the contributions.
