<p><strong>Do you think these PACs are giving to both parties because they&#39;re just so moderate or do you think it&#39;s because they are buying representation? I tend to think it&#39;s the latter.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are both horribly corrupt and do not represent any of the ideals they are expected to, but they are vile in different ways.</p>

<p>Both are selling off the country to the highest bidders, neither have a shred of actual patriotism, neither represent anything I care about in any meaningful way.</p>

<p>Democrats accomplish little, but modern Republicans actively cause damage, that&#39;s the difference to me.  Republican policies are so crazy they fight over what kind of crazy to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really, this actually seems like a well-thought out plan. </p>

<p>If they believe Sander&#39;s is going to lose against Hillary, and he&#39;s the weakest nomination (in their eyes), then giving him money to become the opposing parties&#39; nomination is pretty smart. They think by doing this Hillary will have an easier time winning, versus another candidate that Hillary would either struggle with, or has more support.</p>
