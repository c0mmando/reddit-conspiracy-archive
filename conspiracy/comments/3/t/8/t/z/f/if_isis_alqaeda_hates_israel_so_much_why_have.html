    <div class="md"><p>they have focused on killing the governments that were, and are hostile to israel.</p>

<p>ISIS targeted the Golan, yet israel is not fighting them there, they are in fact defending them, firing at syrian aircraft that have tried to bomb them there. </p>

<p>once ISIS is eventually put down who do you think will try to claim the golan (which remains disputed territory as long as Assad is still in power.</p>

<p>obviously any government propped up by the US is going to sneak in acknowledging it as Israeli territory (which they also very &quot;recently discovered&quot; a bunch of oil under...) </p>

<p>they have also pushed forces in to the occupied palestinian territories and worked against the PA, they have been behind a lot of the recent mortar strikes intentionally trying to provoke israeli retaliation on the areas the fire from.</p>

<p>and above all seems odd that such an extremely radical branch of Islam would leave Israel completely alone and yet attack France and Russia?  other groups who Israel also just happens to have a little bit of beef with. </p>

<p>meanwhile Israel is bitching about Iran, a country who actually has boots on the ground fighting ISIS. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isis is not trying to unite Shia and Sunnis. They are trying to re-establish the caliphate. They believe all Muslims that don&#39;t adhere to their particular brand of Islam are apostates and deserve to die. This is especially true of Shias. I think the reason they don&#39;t attack Israel is it doesn&#39;t fall into their end game. They are trying to create the end times and the battle that sparks it occurs in Syria. This Atlantic article explains Isis far more eloquently than I ever could.</p>

<p>Diplomatic ties have not been established since the creation of both countries in the mid-20th century, and the countries have fought three major wars, which are the 1948 Arab Israeli War in 1948, the Six-Day War in 1967, and the Yom Kippur War in 1973, later also being involved in the Lebanese Civil War and the 1982 Lebanon War.

<p>Basically this. Arabian gulf nations propaganda against Iran needs to keep going forward and uninterrupted. ISIS attacking Israel doesn&#39;t go with the narrative.</p>

<p>But attacking France makes more sense. Members of the security council in the UN, America, UK and now France, all had their fair share of ISIS/alqaeda attacks.</p>

<p>Exactly. They could probably double their membership in a week, with Sunni&#39;s and Shia&#39;s, and many Neo-Nazi groups if they turned their focus on Israel, but again, that is not their goal or strategy. It is only a strategy to keep Westerner&#39;s in fear so they give up more liberty and freedom to the ruling elite.</p>

<p>Because history has shown that even if <em>every single Muslim country</em> in the area declared war on Israel (with the highest Islamic authorities calling for a worldwide jihad) they still lose. </p>

<p>Repeatedly. Thats why since its only been cowardly rocket attacks, suicide bombings and using the civilian population as cover/accomplices.</p>

<p>Israeli history brief as it is can be crudely summed up:</p>

<p>They were attacked by their neighbours</p>

<p>They fought back and began winning</p>

<p>They seized enemy lands in wartime</p>

<p>Afterward the enemy whinges about how land gets conquered in war. Especially given they had wanted to conquer all of Israel and genocide the populace. </p>

<p>Repeat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>isis isnt against israel.</p>

<p>isis is saudi funded(only one of many countries to fund them), and saudi loves israel. they want to make muslims mad around the world. so they are killing muslims in the middle east, to promote air strikes. other muslims then get angry over the air strikes and THINK that attacking the west/europe is retaliation. this in turn makes muslims look bad because these are muslims actions usually, which then makes the public&#39;s opinion on muslims change. which then in turn helps israel win the public agreement to destroying the muslims in the middle east, to create the one big country of zion.</p>

<p>for example, one day after the france attacks, an innocent women in toronto got beat up and called a terrorist just for walking down the street to pick up her kids from school.</p>

<p>also in toronto one day after, a mosque was lit on fire.</p>

<p>This how the MSM teaches people to think. That ISIS is some school yard bully who is just picking fights he can win and he is &quot;afraid&quot; of what Israel can do...bullshit.</p>

<p>First of all, Israel isn&#39;t supposed to have &quot;the bomb.&quot; So we can assume if they intend to use the ones they have it, it&#39;ll probably be against someone who would actually confront them, ie. Iran.</p>

<p>Secondly, ISIS is a terrorist threat if you haven&#39;t noticed?</p>

<p>Meaning they don&#39;t have to march an army to up to the wall to inflict pain.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t RISK. They don&#39;t have to announce their plans.</p>

<p>Basically this. Arabian gulf nations propaganda against Iran needs to keep going forward and uninterrupted. ISIS attacking Israel doesn&#39;t go with the narrative.</p>
