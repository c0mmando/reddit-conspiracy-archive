    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m all for navel gazing. The problem is they feel that policy should be build on their shaky science and instead of using sound reasoning or proven results they use peer pressure and labeling to bully everyone into acquiescence. And it works (the pressure part, the policy part has created a race to the bottom)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was surprisingly good!  Harald Eia is a well known Norwegian comedian (which is why people appear to not want to speak to him, as they expect something else than seriousness) so i wasnt expecting this to be honest. 
But im glad i got past my initial expectations.<br/>
And it speaks volumes about how ideological the Norwegian &quot;scientists&quot; truly are. They dont realy give a shit about why humans are the way they are,  they just want to create a society that fits their fake world view and then dismiss anything that doesnt fit that.<br/>
This definitely belongs here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> as this attitude of &quot;experts&quot; if you will is quite prevalent in Norwegian society all the way to the top.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not exactly. It&#39;s just that he couched his theories in the purview of the Oedipal Complex, or, more appropriately, Oedipal Project; to be the cause of oneself. </p>

<p>His contemporaries, especially Otto Rank, and later pioneering psychologists saw Freud&#39;s folly. They later ascribed most of the phenomenon that Freud put forth as having their cause in the &quot;death anxiety&quot;.</p>

<p>Nah, nothing Freud ever suggested had a shred of evidence behind it. They were never &quot;proven,&quot; and, in fact, they weren&#39;t even disprovable. Freud wasn&#39;t a scientist.</p>

<p>He just made up a bunch of crazy shit about fucking his mother while he was high on cocaine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah. One of my all time faves. Anyone notice Sascha ben Cohen&#39;s cousin at Oxford in there too? Smart guy, can&#39;t remember which Part he was in. Use this series for any dummies that are lured into the big &quot;gender&quot; fraud. We need think about what their (the &quot;gender&quot; people) agenda is. Remember all scams start with ostensibly feel-good terms like &quot;equality&quot; &quot;rights&quot; and &quot;kindness&quot; and so on, but their motives are nothing of it. But people are so dumb, so gullible, that they take everything at face value. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a theory abput this, that sort of makes me sympatize with women It&#39;s the games children play. Games male kids play are more logical and involving yhan girls games. They also give males years of training in devekoping motor skills and coordination that girls don&#39;t get. The end result is that technical stuff are easier for boys to get their heads around, and also have built up motor skills to cope with demands of crafting and engeneering. </p>

<p>Girls are better at dressing for much the same reason.</p>

<p>edit: they kind of go into that in the documentary, I just reached that part.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>in simple terms, boys play material games, girls play verbal games.</p>

<p>this all goes back to the hunter-gather part of human society, males did the building and hunting and guarding, girls made home and kept the social bonds in good working order.</p>

<p>one side aspect of safe home making verses dangerous hunting, HG societies tend to be matriarchal not patriarchal, not matter what the king or chief is, the females live the longest and pass on the power and stability.</p>
