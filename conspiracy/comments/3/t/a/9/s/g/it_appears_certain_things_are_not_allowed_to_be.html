<p>Homeopathic medicine] (<a href="https://youtu.be/MDCFYiLuuiQ">https://youtu.be/MDCFYiLuuiQ</a>) isn&#39;t magic. It&#39;s science that is pretty unknown unless you get to advanced sciences. it&#39;s based on energy frequencies and It works in a different matter than conventional western medicine, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s fake. Here&#39;s one more <a href="https://youtu.be/qQPS-UHKzMs">video</a> shorter than the first, but less detailed.
There has been a huge push (now even more brought on by the tpp deal) to close alternative medicine to the general public because it doesn&#39;t benefit the profit made by pharmaceutical companies. Not because &quot;its magical bs&quot;.</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t they just let people choose on their own if they want it or not? Because it&#39;s not profitable for one group that has turned healthcare into a monopoly, that&#39;s why. Maybe the fda needs to take alook at the real <a href="https://youtu.be/kOW8LNU2hFE">drug pushers</a>.</p>

<p>Couldn&#39;t help it, here&#39;s a conference with <a href="https://youtu.be/3ZppRRjAxus">Dr. Raja Sankaran</a> that&#39;s a further explanation (longer than an hour, but very informative).</p>

<p>EDIT: all right all right as usual, reddit discussions go downhill and people just spout out crazy things now(like some of who are accusing me of promoting mysticism and being part of the illuminati, goodness gracious). dealing with misinformed people is very draining. Well, I feel as if I&#39;ve provided at least a basic introduction of information for anyone who is willing or wanting to research. Thanks to some for your input and no thanks for those who are just serving to confuse. Remember, if you don&#39;t trust the studies, then perform your own experiments and observations so you can decide what works in your favor without having people with other agendas pushing you to do things.
Proof is in the pudding, why would anyone pay as much attention to this if it was made up  bull shit. Guys think about things, really. Why would people put this much effort into shutting this down if it was all fake made up information. Well, It&#39;s been interesting, that&#39;s for sure :-) thanks for your time!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>look.  how can i tie homeopathy to big pharma?  its easy!  profit motive!  pure and simple.  big pharma sells meds people dont need that do things they dont want done.  homeopathy sells pseudo medicine with some mysticism that people dont need that dont do a damn thing!  its just as bad as riki therapy or whatever the hell its called where people work with crystals and shit.  </p>

<p>and i dont have to explain why acupuncture and meditation is ok but homeopathy is not because of results.  homeopathy has no reproducible results, and its always blamed on some extraneous bullshit.  but meditation, acupuncture, chiropractic medicine, massage therapy, breathing excersizes, all this has some reproducible positive results.  but not homeopathy.  </p>

<p>im a nurse for a living.  im actually working right now.  ive been doing this for a few years now.  i know big pharma is bad.  these guys are dick dastardly level of villains.   but homeopathy is for weak minded fools who just want to waste money.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a concept that the more you dilute something, the stronger it becomes. The solution remembers the medicine within it and getd stronger... this is bullshit. And dangerous. Its a good way for me to sell you something that costs very little.</p>

<p>PLEASE READ THIS PART IN FULL..</p>

<p>The pharmecutical companies dont want something like pot out there because people claim that it can replace a litany of drugs that affect nausea, appetite, pain etc. Despite the claim by the US gov&#39;t that there is no medicinal value in marijuana there still exists documents that explicitely state the benefits of pot on record. This contradiction exists because the plant DOES WORK. </p>

<p>In the case of homepathic &quot;medicine&quot; you have the opposite. A litany of experiments that show no efficacy beyond that of a plecebo pill.. the people who proclaim its efficacy are usually out to sell you something.</p>

<p>I was once a nurse before an injury. I&#39;ve studied pharmacology and have to fully understand the drugs i give my patients. That includes being up on trends like when they discovered that Ativan was being prescribed at higher dosages than reccomended. The reason they know things like that is because constant testing is being done as to efficasy of current, new meds. Homeopathic medicine never results to anything solid. Its not that the science cant keep up. Its a way for someone to sell you water (free) and tell you its medicine (not free). You&#39;re being duped and worse, you defend it. I now practice massage therapy. Do you think a day goes by without someone in the field of relaxation deciding to pitch some bullshit that doesnt work my way? </p>

<p>Find one peer reviewed and REPLICATED experiment where someone benefits and ill subscribe to homeopathy. Until then i cant condone anything that takes from people without giving back. Selling false hope and wasting the time of the sick is horrible. These snake oil salemen make a living sounding like they have the answers where modern medicine cannot provide... dont hurt other people by spreading their misinformation. If dilution of something makes it stronger then drink ocean water. It has every medicine in it and every poison in it ever. Should make you immune from poison while curing you of everything right?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an example:</p>

<p>Homeopathy dilutes a chemical by a factor of 100 and then repeats the dilution up to 300 times.</p>

<p>If you repeat it just 100 times you end up with a dilution of 10<sup>-200</sup></p>

<p>Just to demonstrate the ridiculousness of that number, the number of atoms in the universe is estimated at 10<sup>80</sup></p>

<p>If you diluted the universe to the same degree, you&#39;d have a 1 in 10<sup>120</sup> chance of it containing just a single atom.</p>

<p>Or to put that into perspective, if every atom in the universe was a person, you&#39;d have to give them all 10<sup>120</sup> homeopathy doses each to make sure just one of them drank the dose with the &#39;active ingredient&#39;</p>

<p>And that&#39;s exactly the sort of nonsense they use to attract the gullible people they scam.</p>

<p>The only effect homeopathy has is the placebo effect. That&#39;s not to say the placebo effect isn&#39;t real, because it is. The placebo effect has been studied extensively and even in studies where people are told they are being given the placebo, the effect still manifests.</p>

<p>But just because the placebo effect is real, that does not mean homeopathy is not a scam. It <em>is</em> a scam.</p>

<p>Homeopathic medicine [is] science</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That word doesn&#39;t mean what you think it means.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>that is pretty unknown unless you get to advanced sciences.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;advanced sciences&quot; seems to be a phrase you&#39;re using to exempt your magical memory water from actual scientific rigor.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>reddit discussions go downhill and people just spout out crazy things now</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want to try to defend homeopathy, you will have to begin by explaining why randomized controlled trials demonstrate that homeopathic &quot;medicine&quot; has no more impact on patients than placebo. That&#39;s the science. All of the arm-waving at possible mechanisms involving energy, vibration, memory or quantum mechanics have no standing unless you&#39;re trying to explain an observed phenomena, and these trials demonstrate that there is no phenomena to explain.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>dealing with misinformed people is very draining</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t dislike you for being misinformed. It&#39;s better to be misinformed than willfully ignorant. You, I hope, are capable of learning. The willfully ignorant are not going to change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Homeopathy: 1796.  Modern quantum physics: 1925.  Saying it is based on &quot;energy frequencies&quot; is functionally meaningless and was less meaningful in 1796 (there wasn&#39;t the wave theory of light then).</p>

<p>Medical practices contemporary with the development of homeopathy: leeching, blistering, bloodletting, electric shock, full frontal lobotomies, metal cock rings to prevent masturbation, purging to balance the &quot;humors&quot; including eating poison to induce vomiting and using opium.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s also worth noting that. as James Randi points out, at the highest levels of dilution (X1,500) i.e. the &quot;strongest&quot;, the ratio of the actual medicine to water is roughly the same as the ratio of a grain of rice to 2,000,000,000 times the mass of a sphere of water with a radius equal to the distance from the Sun to Pluto, i.e. your chances of getting even 1 molecule of medicine is basically zero.  The common level of dilution is (X50) which is 1:100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZK6mLY2Hfg">Randi talk</a></p>

<p>Study after controlled study fails to show any consistent effect.  On the plus side, there are no side effects because there are effectively no active ingredients.  It&#39;s a mishmash of wishful thinking, placebo effect and lies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why don&#39;t they just let people choose on their own if they want it or not?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nobody&#39;s banning homeopathic medicine.  They are just want to sop false claims about it being effective, which has been repeatedly and decisively proven.  If I fill empty pill containers with chalk dust and sell them for $100 dollars a pill by claiming they cure cancer, or anthrax, should that be legal?  That&#39;s exactly what regulations try to stop the makers of homeopathic &quot;medicine&quot; from doing.</p>

<p>Socialism fails because of a concept called &quot;The Tragedy of the Commons&quot; - when people no longer can profit, then it wont get done. IE, People do things for one of two reasons, avoid pain or get some sort of gain. What you&#39;re talking about is some theory about people being unselfish and helping others and set aside their own gains to give to others, its unrealistic, childish and a YMCA trophy perspective.</p>

There are plenty of studies on this subject, it is a fact that people do not pursue profit alone we all have reason why we do things that go beyond just profits. whether you believe it or not is irreverent. You are not going to change public opinion by using empty observations. If you have not  seen it yet you should have a look at &quot;Century of the self&quot; it lays all this out for you. people are driven by unconscious desires that have more to do with relationships with the people around them then they do with profit.

<p>Which is funny, because the whole universe is comprised of oscillating energies.</p>

<p>Edit: I think the mumbo jumbo bullshit is part of what makes placebos work.One doesn&#39;t hand a placebo to a patient and say, &quot;here&#39;s a sugar pill that really does nothing but if you believe hard enough it will make you better. No, they hand them a sugar pill and call it medicine.</p>

<p>Although I did read about placebos sometimes still working even when know to be placebos.</p>

<p>So maybe the mumbo jumbo bullshit is necessary. I know homoeopathic remedies have worked for me on occasions too numerous to count. From poison ivy to bruises to headaches, nervousness, and bugbites- there&#39;s a lil homoeopathic vial of sugar pills for every little malady and I don&#39;t ever have to risk an allergic reaction to an active ingredient. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not bullshit to me. Perhaps I&#39;m just gullible. Suggestible is the word I think hypnotists use. Energy healing is also something that requires a degree of mumbo jumbo but works literal wonders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you get AIDS, will you use actual doctor-prescribed medicine or will you take a homoeopathic vial instead?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps I&#39;m just gullible. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think so. I think you just don&#39;t understand modern physics enough to realise that homoeopathy is literally just the placebo effect.</p>

<p>If you can tell me how the placebo effect works without using any mumbo jumbo then I&#39;ll admit that I don&#39;t know enough about AIDS to make an informed decision at this time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We know a lot about the placebo effect. We know for example that it does not actually cure any diseases - it merely changes your subjective experience. For example you may feel like you have less pain but the underlying cause of the pain is not resolved. In other words it&#39;s all in your head. You want to feel better and so you feel better. But if you have a terminal illness then a placebo will not cure it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes im looking for it now and they def. Took it down. Cant say it&#39;s that surprising. The shocking thing now is that they have a bunch of anti homeopathy videos up when you search.
