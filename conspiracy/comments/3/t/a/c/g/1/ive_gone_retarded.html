        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Seriously,</p>

<p>After a decade old crisis, when all we had to listen about was austerity, cutting costs, people demand too much money, cut social services, cut health care, cut every benefit you can think of, so we can <em>save the banks</em> ... god forbid a bank turns in a negative quarterly report, the world will end we will all be eating bugs if we let that happen.</p>

<p>Ok, give the banks all our monies, our elderly gave us their best already so, fuck em, right? Also fuck our children, we won&#39;t put you through school, we&#39;ll rather get you in debt 100k by the time you&#39;re 25 years old, this is much more productive for a society, innit? Oh and you want your own house? Well fuck you with that wish too. You need to get not only you but your partner in debt for the next 40 years too. And you better not miss a single payment in this 40 years, or else you will be <em>broke</em> and <em>homeless</em></p>

<p>ALL HAIL THE BANKS!</p>

<p>Couple of years later, we have Sherlock fucking Holmes as president, solving a terrorist act in mere hours ... we found the passport, they admitted, let&#39;s go! Lets&#39; spend 100 billion fucking dollars on a war, because fuck our elderly and fuck our children.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a few kilometers of 2m high fence, will solve all our problems won&#39;t it?</p>

<p>This is so stupid it&#39;s unbelievable ... TELL US THE FUCKING TRUTH.</p>

<p>Either they&#39;re all lying or simply incompetent ... in either way, THEY NEED TO GO, there is no more excuse .... which one is it? ARE YOU DUMB OR LYING BASTARD? Every parliament in the world should demand the truth from presidents, prime ministers and every <em>important</em> person in the country - if you can&#39;t provide it, YOU ARE FIRED - if you can&#39;t be fired - YOU WILL HANG.</p>

<p>this is the only way, we need to demand the truth!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m detecting a little frustration in your tone, and I&#39;m not blaming you for it. The problem is, all the Western politicians, with a few exceptions, are controlled by the same general elite social group, which tells them what they can say and what they can&#39;t say; what they can do and what they can&#39;t do. The media is the politicians&#39; guide. They look to the media, which is controlled by this elite group, to tell them where the social boundaries are, what&#39;s trending up, what is popular, and what is absolutely forbidden to discuss.</p>

<p>So who is setting this agenda that the politicians meekly follow? Not the media. They are only the organ of that agenda. No, it is the people who control the media, and who buy the politicians into office. Mostly, it is very wealthy Jews.</p>

<p>Now you&#39;ve been trained never to think a bad thought about the Jews by media propaganda all your life, but if you are able, you should consider this. Someone is pulling the strings of the politicians. Someone decides who gets elected and who gets sidelined. Someone controls the media and tells the press what to say, and more importantly <em>what not to say</em>. </p>

<p>So who is that someone? It&#39;s a small group, a wealthy group, a powerful group. If you look at the media, you will see that it is controlled by Jews. The media sets the aganda for all of society. It doesn&#39;t report on society, it directs society, by selecting which events it wants to promote, and which events it will ignore or mock.</p>

<p>If you decide it isn&#39;t the Jews, then who is it? It&#39;s a cohesive group with a cohesive agenda, a wealthy group, a powerful group, a group that controls the media and the politicians. If it isn&#39;t the Jews, is it aliens from another planet? Is it the mysterious &quot;globalists&quot; (whoever the fuck they are) of Alex Jones? Is it the Jesuits? Is it the Illuminati? Is it the Freemasons? Or is it the tribe that had gained a death grip on the banks and financial systems of the West, the tribe that owns and controls the media, the tribe that buys the politicians and controls the political process, the tribe that writes the laws and controls the justice system, the tribe that runs the Ivy League universities?</p>

<p>What I don&#39;t understand though, is these politicians of ours ... if all of this is true, why oh why, doesn&#39;t someone, at least one person in the world, go on and say, yes, they threatened my family, my kids and everybody i love, if i didn&#39;t&#39; do this and say that ...</p>

<p>why, nobody ever did that?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s not true, obviously it is, because not everybody can be that incompetent, why doesn&#39;t nobody tell us truth?</p>

<p>Please understand the most important part of my reply to you; Judaism has been hijacked by Zionist-Neocons. They are supported and mostly led by Atheists who despise all Abrahamic religions. If you want to hear how/why this hijacking took place, watch this (once you do watch this, you will most likely never associate Judaism with ZioCons again.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find Stanley Milgram Obedience to Power experiments revealing enough.</p>

<p>We can all ask ourselves which end of that scale we sit. Where a vulnerable person is copping a thrashing from bullies. Do we intervene or do we walk on by like nothing is happening? Milgram experiments showed 1 in 100 are sociopaths just can&#39;t wait to hit the kill switch. Milgram experiments also showed 1 in 100 said FU to the entire follower R us experiment and walked away.</p>

<p>Do we profit from the harm nuclear waste or indeed the massive MIC Investor State is to future generations, well nurtured via super funds or do we bother to shift said super funds into more ethical options? Not an easy task at all, even for those well used to such responsibilities. Same goes for resource wars or any of the other ponzi profit programs legally operating through out our only home world.</p>

<p>Politicians are just as mere mortal as any other. When the law makers are bent what do we do but abandon those institutions that abandon us all? Outcomes not obvious enough to those pretending to be in charge apparently.</p>

<p>Of &#39;too big to jail&#39;, not in Iceland we learn. It&#39;s not a secret yet elsewhere the economic eugenics patriots still doing OK don&#39;t seem to get it.</p>

<p>Where to from here is up to us all where able when ever able as I see it. Accepting there is no quick way to that end is the hardest part to resolve inside I find.</p>

<p>boss, I spotted a node that needs to be told that voting is a mere market study, and doesn&#39;t actually elect people or ideologies to power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I, too, am also at this point. I&#39;m ready to give up, but not give in. no more voting, no more participating in the charade. I&#39;m pretty much at the point where I&#39;m ready to give up the possessions I own to gain much more. It&#39;s time to fight back. Take action. Where do we begin?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amen. The idea is sound but we have to come out with a sustainable plan once all the evil doers are out. A new system that won&#39;t allow bankers or elite to reach such a dominating status is needed. A new way to govern and combat what has happened before it happens. If we just get rid of the bad apples but keep everything the same, new bad apples will take their place. </p>

<p>I feel capitalism is out. It has reached its prime and we are left with the situation we are at now. Communism sounds good in theory, but tends to fall victim to capitalism and desperately craves it to survive.</p>

<p>We need a quasi-democracy-anarchy hybrid way of handling the future. Robots should take care of people and the menial work, food should be abundant along with shelter and energy, and work itself should become an outdated thing of the past because of technology. Racism has run its course, and so has this political correctness phenomenon, yet we still have to figure out how to handle these issues better. Consumables need to become reusables and products need to be built to last a lifetime, not a week or two.</p>

<p>We have the ability to do it, we have the willpower to change it, we just have to keep fighting until it becomes reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who said anything about political correctness? Couldn&#39;t OP have used more descriptive words like disillusioned, dejected, hopeless, confused etc? To share his/her vague state of &#39;retard&#39;ation just made it seem he was venting and ranting on his personal blog or social media wall,that it is up to the reader to know what specific message he is trying to convey.</p>

<p>You seem to mistake me for some sort of PC police, which fortunately, I am not. Niggr.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is nothing wrong with someone being pissed off at the worlds situation right now. Venting is a good way to get that  &quot;manufactured fear garbage&quot; out of your mind. This is a great place to do it since the users understand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hollywood &#39;comedy&#39;. Yuck. 
Another Jewish looking &#39;comedian&#39; out of a million others trying to be funny but just presents rehashed degeneracy/idiocy. Yuck. Did not watch. It&#39;s clear to me now why I didn&#39;t get the reference. It wouldn&#39;t have hurt if the title showed a little more effort in introspection/vocab and did without the generic Internet term. 
I don&#39;t want to be a snobbish elitist but preferably, I don&#39;t engage with seriousness memes except for some good laughs. Admittedly, red flags such as &#39;That&#39;s/You&#39;re retarded...&#39; &#39;Are you 12&#39; &#39;OMG AntiSemite!&#39; are unfortunately, some of my TRIGGER words. Lol ;) </p>
