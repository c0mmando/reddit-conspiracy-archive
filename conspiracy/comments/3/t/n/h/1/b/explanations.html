       What's going on in the world? There is so much going on, and I'm weary from being down so many rabbit holes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is America the hand pulling the strings on ISIS? Are we just using terrorism to take down governments that aren't part of some central banking system? Are we dealing with the fallout of Reagan era policies? are we dealing with something so corrupt and perverse that it is in every aspect of society?
      </p>
      <p>
       Explain like I'm five if you wish. I'm just tired and wan't to know what's bubbling in peoples brains. I mean, ultimately it could be greed, stupidity, bureaucracy, and incompetence the whole way up and not conspiracies and shadow deals and secret societies.

       ISIS is a CIA/Mossad/Saudi creation meant to destabilize the middle east, and rationalize western intervention in Syria/Iraq, as well as justify more police state style measures in the US and Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
       The end goal is total Israeli hegemony in the middle east, an Iran under control of central banks, and more control measures implemented on the general population in the west.
      </p>
      <p>
       ISIS is the new bogeyman meant to get western populations to give up freedoms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mossad who operates ISIS actually wanted an attack to go off on the anniversary of 9/11, but their jewish operative who was organizing the bombing was caught by the FBI right before it was to have occurred:

       The recent attacks in paris were real, but the perpetrators were not ISIS, but french/western agents who killed real people and blamed it on ISIS, more information here (this website is fantastic for general information by the way):

       Watched a video last night that showed through leaked CIA documents that we actively supported ISIS, at least in it's infancy, with the goal of overthrowing the current Assad regime. It wouldn't shock me if we weren't still supporting them.

       We are living in a manufactured reality. After ww2 the Nazi scientists moved to America (operation paperclip) where under CIA they architected the biggest propaganda machine known to man. In fact all new advancements in technology, TV, radio, internet were used to this end. We did not really go to moon, they knew they just had to show us grainy video and then most of us will believe. Then after convincing us the world is round and we are just mere coincidences, we would indulge in immoral ways without guilt. Look around you, we treat each other just like a bag of meat and are willing to trample your neighbour for some temporary monetary gain.

       9/11 was another of the events they orchestrated so they can kick of PNAC (Project for new American century) where they want to expand out of the north american continent and establish their empire. What we see now is them clearing out parts of middle East that they can directly control. They want to destroy multiculturalism and alternative ways of life to establish a one/new world order. Do you want to be part of that agenda? If yes, then you become one of their shills that manipulate online forums and people via media, you are also rewarded handsomely with money. If no, you speak out on forums and to people in real life, but you don't have any reward and risk being ostracised in society, because humanity is quite like a herd of sheep, they like to follow the masses as it brings them a sense of security. The Nazi (or social) scientists know this very well, they also know which string to pull and when. For example fear is a powerful tool in their book. What we see via the war on terror is them instilling fear on the people to install a full fledged surveillance and police state. That will dawn in the new world order. We the masses can still stop them if we were aware of what I just told you, but most people are just like zombies - their minds are fast asleep.

       Imagine if they found aliens on the moon (likely in all honesty) why would they destabilize their power base (religion) by admitting to the presence of aliens. It's counterproductive.

       Of course religion is their power base because the majority of people in the world are still monotheistic, and are easily manipulated by politicians appealing to these people. Look no further than the republicans.

       Seems like you don't know what religion is about. You assume that the existence of spirits defy God because apparently you hold those beings above or equal to God. Whereas God has created both djinns and humans.

       or inter-dimensional beings."

       I didn't just mention the existence of djinns, but also the possiblity that aliens exist. In the Quran it says:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          <em>
           (Quran 65.12) Allah is the one who created seven heavens and from Earth like them (of corresponding type); [Allah's] command descends among them (heavens and earths) so that you may know that Allah is capable of anything and that Allah knows everything.
          </em>
         </p>
        </blockquote>
       </li>
       <li>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          <em>
           (Quran 42.29) And from His signs He created the heavens and the Earth; and the land animals that He scattered in BOTH of them (heavens and Earth); And He is capable of gathering them (in one place) if He wishes.
          </em>
         </p>
        </blockquote>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Read and also watch the video linked below for a further explanation on these verses:

      <p>
       You can google "Islam aliens" yourself if you want to read further into this.
And besides all that, we are all thinking about a future possibility. This is all assumptions about
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       aliens exist. And now that you have seen that Islam
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       indeed not rule out the possibility of other life-forms living in other planets, hopefully you realize and accept that you have not done enough research into the religious view on aliens. Islam does not make the entire story of existence an earth-centric one.

       I can't believe this. Even when presented with facts that go against your self-conjured statements, you refuse to change your view on it. You are not being open-minded. It is not shameful to admit you were wrong, on the contrary it reflects a strong personality. And judging from what you just wrote to me, you didn't watch the video either.
Hey man I am not here to convince you of my religion. I merely point out that the things you suggest about it are factually wrong. The things I posted explain that.

       Not that it matters though, still monotheism. You want to talk about being open minded? Take a look at the core of your belief system...it's monotheism.

       Well that's a good start at least :)

       I believe Islam may not only just leaves the "possibility open" for aliens, but might even cleary state for a fact that they exist. As we see from this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        (Quran 42.29) And from His signs He created the heavens and the Earth; and the land animals that
        <strong>
         He scattered in BOTH of them
        </strong>
        (heavens and Earth); And He is
        <strong>
         capable of gathering them (in one place)
        </strong>
        if He wishes.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Now I am in no way a scholar and I could be wrong, but this can be interpreted as that if Allah wishes, he will 'gather' the land animals together. 
It's interesting to note that they are being refered to as 'land animals'. This may mean that aliens don't have to be the intelligent or human-like creatures we see and read about in science-fiction.
Even a single living cell, a form of insect, or a larger animal that is living on some other planet would be considered alien.

       That's a stretch. The definition of alien would be a contradiction if that were the case.

       <li>
        You don't understand what intelligence is, there is no such thing as a simple creature, every living system is tied to every other living system and intelligence arises from that. As someone who finds monotheism to be a solid belief system, you don't understand what intelligent systems look like in the first place. If you did, you would not be monotheistic.

       Because space exploration is a lie. No superpower has crossed the perimeters of our atmosphere. India's much touted mars mission hardly produced a handful images, all grainy, all faked. If space exploration was real and of any scientific value, we would have much more than grainy videos and images you can easily create in photoshop and/or a studio here on earth, and
       <a href="/r/space">
        /r/space

       No, we study theories. These theories are still just theories accepted as truth until someone proved them wrong. So you have to have a inquisitive and open mind, or else even if a theory may not be wholly correct, we would never know. Such is the scientific method. So please don't take people who consider theories as facts, to know anything what they are talking about.

       I have studied this inside and out. I don't have time to elaborate. Look up jeranism on YouTube, he does a good job walking you through a new, open minded inquiry into flat earth. Even I thought it was crazy at first and thought it was all Disinfo, because of how absurd it is. But truth is stranger than fiction, do look into it for yourself. If you have questions, pm me.
