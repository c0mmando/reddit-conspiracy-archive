<p>Yes, derailing. The thread asks why we&#39;re experiencing swarm attacks recently. If you don&#39;t have an answer to that question then keep your mouth shut.

<p>I currently have access to at least sixty different IPs, and can locate myself digitally anywhere between the US and China. You are a group, you clearly have access to either bots or to a VPN (hence the minus 23 score on a post which was originally upvoted), and you are all categorical liars.</p>

<p>The very fact that you would even still be here, trying to convince people that you are not a troll, is evidence of who you are and what your intent is. Anybody who was not a troll would simply leave the thread. Yet, you are still here, persistently lying and causing trouble.</p>

<p>I really wish this site had an ignore function. You deserve to be outright banned from Reddit because your only purpose on the site is to ridicule, harass and attack users of r/conspiracy.</p>
