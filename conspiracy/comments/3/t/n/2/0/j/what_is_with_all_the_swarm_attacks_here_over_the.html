       Downvotes don't always mean a government infiltration. It probably never fucking means that, honestly. It means your opinion sucks, or lacks sources, and the people here are letting you know.

       I'd rather you explain why you're derailing my thread with false accusations, ordering that we should not agree with each other and making up bullshit claims about "government infiltration".

       The government doesn't need to "infiltrate" anything. Accounts on Reddit are free, so stop trying to make it sound like we're all here claiming there are spies crawling under laser beams.

       Derailing? There are 12 comments. 6 of them being ours. In case you missed it (and you didn't, you posted in it), there was already a "Omg were being attacked!" thread a day or two ago. My point was that we don't need a back-patting session every three days to tell us we're doing well here.

       Yes, derailing. The thread asks why we're experiencing swarm attacks recently. If you don't have an answer to that question then keep your mouth shut. Don't come in here just to attack people with your bullshit accusations about "government infiltration" and "circle jerks."

       This may hurt your feelings, but I don't participate there. And this is my only account. You just aren't as smart as you think you are. Sorry... You just proved my point about some of the of the users here. You're too fragile. Any dissent and its topminds, Mossad, or the gubment out to get us!

       It's the "same old shit" because you've been following me for the last 48 hours trying to restart an argument which you lost. Stop trolling me and I'll stop pointing out who you are.

       Lol. Right. It's just a big coincidence you:-
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Linked that thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Began the conversation by claiming I think everyone is a government shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think you're being clever by setting up an argument in which you can claim I am being paranoid, but the fact is that you are a troll from r/topmindsofreddit, and your purpose here is malicious.

       I linked that thread because I read it and watched you constantly post drivel that showed you aren't a very good critical thinker. Shit, not even a critical thinker. Just someone can think in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can admins check my Ip and see if I have an account that posts there too? I'll gladly ask them to in order to prove you're paranoid.

       I currently have access to at least sixty different IPs, and can locate myself digitally anywhere between the US and China. You are a group, you clearly have access to either bots or to a VPN (hence the minus 23 score on a post which was originally upvoted), and you are all categorical liars.
      </p>
      <p>
       The very fact that you would even still be here, trying to convince people that you are not a troll, is evidence of who you are and what your intent is. Anybody who was not a troll would simply leave the thread. Yet, you are still here, persistently lying and causing trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really wish this site had an ignore function. You deserve to be outright banned from Reddit because your only purpose on the site is to ridicule, harass and attack users of r/conspiracy.

       You claim I'm a shill/troll and I would leave if I wasn't. Why wouldn't I defend myself? Why are you crying for censorship? What are your motives? You don't realize that YOU are now the problem here. You are too stupid for me to continue this conversation.

       Luckily there is a "block" function with RES. You are tagged and blocked :)

       Lol. It seems I've struck a nerve. I guess I'm onto something.

       Check this out. It helped me realize I can ignore anything you say. Not too much critical thinking going on upstairs, huh? Also, crying "derailing!" seems to be your MO....
