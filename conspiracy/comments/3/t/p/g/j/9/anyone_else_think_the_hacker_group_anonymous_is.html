       I never really thought too much about it until suddenly they declare war on "ISIS".  A group as intelligent as Anonymous should realize that ISIS is nothing more than an arm of the G20 governments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I suspect that Anonymous is also an arm of these powerful governments.

       It's not a group, it's the same as saying anonymous= a group of people. Now, it's definitly being used by intelligence community for several things, honeypot operations, sting operations and propaganda purposes.

       Yet the majority of anon ops are NOT CIA/NSA ops.  anon is a loosely affiliated group, NOT some ultra organized group that is easily to infiltrate and control from a centralized location...

       I posted something similar to the opinion I'm about to in another thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like anonymous is there so people don't take things into their own hands. If the public thinks there is some superhero vigilante hacker group protecting them from tyrants and terrorists they'll feel okay about not doing anything about these perceived injustices themselves. People eat that stuff up and don't question it at all but to me it just seems to good to be true.

       This line of thinking is exactly my problem. If the hackers really are working in the best interests of the people and the people just sit and watch then change is hopeless. The good hackers either get turned, locked up or go into hiding. The responsibility of revolution is on all of us not just a few. People need to stop following and lead. I have this exact same gripe with people who say "x presidential candidate is gonna fix things". Figureheads don't make change happen regular people do.

       Based on some of the comments I've read on the internet and people I've talked to that support anon it would seem a great deal of them regard the "group" as some all powerful entity that protects them from the nsa and the like. I'm not really sure if you were actually looking for clarification but to me this seems like an awfully convenient idol for people that are mostly apathetic towards enacting their own change.

       Based on some of the comments i've read on the internet and people i've talked to, it would seem that people consider them to be well meaning script-kiddies who talk big but never achieve anything of value (knocking out twitter accounts that those linked to spy agencies said they wished were still around)

       I had high hopes in the very beginning, but as soon as the feds turned Sabu it was over for that group. This just cements my belief that it's now being run by interests other than those it advertises.

       Everything the msm media covers is their own fabricated lies. They control both sides of the debate, so you are just a mere spectator. They can't risk losing control of the narrative, so they need to know they are in control of both or multiple sides of the debate. Controlled opposition. This is propaganda 101.

       They didn't. They just attempted to expose the recruiters on facebook and were shut down. Then to distract you they had their CIA fake anons declare war on ISIS. I haven't seen one of them mention anything about going after ISIS. Its gov propaganda.

       I think anonymous started out legit and still is. That said, it wouldn't be hard to co-opt the movement by the very nature of it being anonymous. Anonymous can be BOTH a group of teens and the CIA. Or any other group who wants to borrow the brand for their own agenda.

       this argument is absurd

       trying to call anon a group is like trying to encapsulate a small amount of air inside the fuku reactor and then call it "AIR of earth"

       they are and aren't a group
they are and aren't a person
they are and aren't govt
they are whoever wants to call themselves it,that's it

       do you want to get tougher laws against these people,then go out there, call yourself them,and voila

       do you want to help their cause but not ever reveal who you are, then go out there and call yourself that,and spill whatever beans you have

       do you see,it's just as anything else is, should be ban forks because i can use them to hurt people?

       they act suspiciously because inside the groups there are legit people acting for a cause,and because trying to infiltrate them,is also the govt,or whomever

       yes,"they" are being suspicious right now, but who is "they"?

       What if they are anonymous in name only but they really are one group with a leadership hierarchy and all that, but their propaganda is that anyone can be them. Any group can do that. Sure, random people might fight under their banner and commit acts in their name but the real big stuff might be one group.

       To be honest, I was suspicious of that whole movie that the mask is from - V for Vendetta.  It seemed to me to condone violence and destruction as a justified way to enact change, which I feel would be a tarnishing of the progressive movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       The movie was to define and create a controlled opposition, (which conveniently hides behind a mask).  It was to define a progressive movement, and to destroy its core values in that impersonation.

       Jesus Christ. It is

       as if you read my mind. I just saw the thread above yours and started wondering why anonymous has suddenly joined the "war on terror" -- a war which they know more than anyone is bogus. Why are they now hitting foreign Muslims instead of domestic banks and credit agencies? It's a total paradigm shift.

       Because those doing it and going after ISIS like they aren't a US proxy, aren't anons. Plain and simple. They are government nerds pretending to be anon. I wish they would hurry up and let Barret outta jail. He would humiliate these script reading agent reporters.

       Yes, that might very well be true. The decentralised structure of Anonymous makes it easy for people to just turn up and claim to represent them.

       Before this, I think they were in the right path then something happened cause it looked like they dissapeared. And adding that to your point, maybe Goverment/s realize the guys behind Annonymous and are using it on their favor.

       anonymous has been compromised/useful idiots for awhile. they were co-opted since after Chanology. remember that they had a hand in helping along the Arab Spring on the communication side. now they have mainstream awareness, a self recruiting tool that doesn't need training and can operate under the name "hacktivism".

       I
       <em>
        knew
       </em>
       this current "anonymous" is not the same anonymous of 2012, or the one that targeted a cyberbully and a corrupt police more recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       This "anonymous" is a fraud.  I knew moment they got involved with ISIS and international affairs.  It doesn't fit the hacker ethos, specifically the "anonymous" described by Barrett Brown.  But that was 5 yrs ago when he left anonymous.  Still, they are antiestablishment, and ISIS is an establishment concern.  If anything, anonymous would be doing something to help refugees, not fight some mercenaries.  They are smarter than that.  If we fall for it, we're dumb.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the nsa tao has taken over the name 'anonymous' and now they are being used in the cyberwar to do stuff most americans think is ishy.  Anon is a perfect cover for them.  Also, if
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       get targetted by anonymous, it's another fear vector and a mask for the state to wear to terrorize you.  They already know that people generally hate them, so they don the mask of their enemies.  It's a neat trick, but folks on

The anonymous that is making grandiose public theatrical spectacles is most likely the ones who are being used by the cia/nsa.

       NEVER underestimate what a bunch of really pissed of hackers could do. If the anger was concentrated to a specific issue they would find each other and they would collaborate.

       I have no doubt that Anon is real. They would likely fuck someone up for faking something to look like them.

       A lot of what they do they, for good reason would want it to remain under the radar. Glory to a hacker is strictly among their peers. They could give a shit what the average person or the media thinks.

       You are correct about bitcoin. Scares the shit out of me really. Actually not so much bitcoin as much as blockchain. Banks and government are starting to get a hardon for that. Eliminate cash, put everything on blockchain. No more money laundering, no more financial privacy, instant access to your finances. Think of the implications for tax collecting.
