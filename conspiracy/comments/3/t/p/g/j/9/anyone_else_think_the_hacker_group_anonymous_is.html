<p>I feel like anonymous is there so people don&#39;t take things into their own hands. If the public thinks there is some superhero vigilante hacker group protecting them from tyrants and terrorists they&#39;ll feel okay about not doing anything about these perceived injustices themselves. People eat that stuff up and don&#39;t question it at all but to me it just seems to good to be true.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This line of thinking is exactly my problem. If the hackers really are working in the best interests of the people and the people just sit and watch then change is hopeless. The good hackers either get turned, locked up or go into hiding. The responsibility of revolution is on all of us not just a few. People need to stop following and lead. I have this exact same gripe with people who say &quot;x presidential candidate is gonna fix things&quot;. Figureheads don&#39;t make change happen regular people do.</p>

<p>trying to call anon a group is like trying to encapsulate a small amount of air inside the fuku reactor and then call it &quot;AIR of earth&quot;</p>

<p>they are and aren&#39;t a group
they are and aren&#39;t a person
they are and aren&#39;t govt
they are whoever wants to call themselves it,that&#39;s it</p>

<p>do you want to get tougher laws against these people,then go out there, call yourself them,and voila</p>

<p>do you want to help their cause but not ever reveal who you are, then go out there and call yourself that,and spill whatever beans you have</p>

<p>do you see,it&#39;s just as anything else is, should be ban forks because i can use them to hurt people?</p>

<p>they act suspiciously because inside the groups there are legit people acting for a cause,and because trying to infiltrate them,is also the govt,or whomever</p>

<p>yes,&quot;they&quot; are being suspicious right now, but who is &quot;they&quot;?</p>

<p>1 person donning the mask,an agency,a small offgroup like we&#39;ve seen before?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest, I was suspicious of that whole movie that the mask is from - V for Vendetta.  It seemed to me to condone violence and destruction as a justified way to enact change, which I feel would be a tarnishing of the progressive movement.  </p>

<p>The movie was to define and create a controlled opposition, (which conveniently hides behind a mask).  It was to define a progressive movement, and to destroy its core values in that impersonation. </p>

<p>Yes, that might very well be true. The decentralised structure of Anonymous makes it easy for people to just turn up and claim to represent them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I <em>knew</em> this current &quot;anonymous&quot; is not the same anonymous of 2012, or the one that targeted a cyberbully and a corrupt police more recently.  </p>

<p>This &quot;anonymous&quot; is a fraud.  I knew moment they got involved with ISIS and international affairs.  It doesn&#39;t fit the hacker ethos, specifically the &quot;anonymous&quot; described by Barrett Brown.  But that was 5 yrs ago when he left anonymous.  Still, they are antiestablishment, and ISIS is an establishment concern.  If anything, anonymous would be doing something to help refugees, not fight some mercenaries.  They are smarter than that.  If we fall for it, we&#39;re dumb.</p>

<p>I think the nsa tao has taken over the name &#39;anonymous&#39; and now they are being used in the cyberwar to do stuff most americans think is ishy.  Anon is a perfect cover for them.  Also, if <em>you</em> get targetted by anonymous, it&#39;s another fear vector and a mask for the state to wear to terrorize you.  They already know that people generally hate them, so they don the mask of their enemies.  It&#39;s a neat trick, but folks on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> dont&#39; fall for that brand of tomfoolery.</p>

<p>I just can&#39;t wait to see when anonymous hacks anonymous.</p>
