You may have noticed that most coupons don&#39;t actually save you money; they merely give you a discount for an item with a marked up price. In essence, you usually pay the standard retail price for an item with a coupon.</p>

<p>Obamacare is just that. Health insurance used to be very affordable, but in recent years prices have steadily risen. The allure of Obamacare is that you are paying a more affordable price, when in reality you are just paying the standard premium of yesteryear.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a scam designed to guarantee that insurance companies get your money. Just like auto insurance, which is a legal requirement in most (all?) states, health insurance has also gained an unfair industrial advantage. How many other industries are guaranteed business BY LAW?</p>

<p>We wanted free and universal health care, instead we got a marketplace to &quot;compare competitive options,&quot; so we can have some choice about how we would like to be fucked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All obama care did was allow people with broke bodies who couldnt ever get coverage before be able to actually get covered. Which is a good thing. Its pretty cheap for them since pre-existing conditions can no longer be factored into the premium. </p>

<p>Also it created an entire market of people getting regular coverage without having to pay anything because they can&#39;t afford anything. These people would have been on some other 2nd rate program before.</p>

<p>Those are the 2 demographics that obama care is good for. (other than the insurance companies they win big because everyone MUST purchase their product now, enforced by law)</p>

<p>For everyone else, insurance premiums just about doubled, because the insurance companies would have been hemorrhaging money otherwise. The govt wins out also because they get the fines from people who still don&#39;t want to pay up.</p>

<p>Quite the cluster fuck we got going here in the USA</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They patched that hole with the same fix applied to force the hospitals to provide care at ERs instead of dying outside of them like back in the day or within them.</p>

<p>Which still can happen at certain less than reputable places. Which generally sees them being closed or their management fired for the stupidity of leaving someone to die in their lobby without so much as properly triaging them.</p>

<p>The state has to pay for your care, so said system will not break anytime soon; this is because people have been doing exactly what you just suggested for decades where I live and the hospital just bills the state.</p>

<p>So it is not going to break that way, everyone helps everyone out via taxes, which is something I promote as far as their usage since we have no Universal Healthcare.</p>

<p>Everyone gets sick at some point, and to ignore that fact is insane when it comes to ensuring that everyone can get treatment without going bankrupt.</p>

<p>You sound like someone who doesn&#39;t actually buy much; like someone who watches from a distance while other people spend money. Still in junior high or high school? Still living at home, letting mom and dad pay all the bills? Because here&#39;s a hint: If a couple gives you a dollar off, you should use it. You&#39;ll save $1. Really. It&#39;s true.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Health insurance used to be very affordable, but in recent years prices have steadily risen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ah hahahaha! You&#39;re a young one, aren&#39;t you? No one above the age of 16 or with anything even remotely resembling experience in the real world has ever said &quot;health insurance used to be very affordable.&quot; You come straight out of the Fox New information-free bubble, where all the &quot;facts&quot; are made up.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s reality: Health care costs and insurance premiums have been astronomical for decades, and they increased dramatically <em>every single year</em> long before Obamacare. I&#39;ve worked for the same company since 1994 and have been paying for health insurance out of my paycheck every week for the last 21 years. I know what I&#39;m talking about.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s a scam designed to guarantee that insurance companies get your money. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, well, that&#39;s what you get when you vote for Republicans and conservative Democrats. Americans could have <em>any system they want,</em> but they have chosen a system dominated by the ultra-rich, religious fundamentalists, and ultra-conservative wackos. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We wanted free and universal health care, instead we got a marketplace to &quot;compare competitive options,&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know who you think  you are speaking for with that &quot;we&quot; stuff, but no, most Americans have been brainwashed into thinking &quot;free and universal health care&quot; is socialism and a reward to lazy minorities and illegal immigrants. Because that&#39;s what Rush Limbaugh and Ron Paul told them to think. We don&#39;t have free and universal health care because our politicians are conservative and our citizens have been brainwashed to support policies that only help the rich and powerful.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t tell me, let me guess, you&#39;re going to vote for Donald Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. There was a long, bitter fight in Congress that lasted well over a year. What we got was the absolute best that we could possibly achieve, and even that was only accomplished barely, by the skin of our teeth. The combination of Republicans -- opposed totally to any kind of real reform -- and conservative Democrats made true national / universal health care impossible. In order to pass, Obamacare required the votes of several &quot;blue dog&quot; Democrats, i.e., conservative Democrats, like Sen. Ben Nelson (Nebraska) and Rep. Bart Stupak (Michigan). And these guys would only agree to <strong>a market-based solution based on private insurance.</strong> </p>

<p>This plan was originally tried by Mitt Romney when he was the Republican governor of Massachusetts. The plan was devised by the ultraconservative Heritage Foundation.</p>

<p>That said, it has done a lot of good. There are almost 20,000,000 previously uninsured people who now have access to health care. There are millions more who have access to expanded Medicaid. (But not in red states, because red states would rather let their poor go without health care, because they are barbarians and moral degenerates.)</p>

<p>Still, despite Republican intransigence in red states, Obamacare is going to save a lot of lives - people who would have died with untreated conditions can now get health care.</p>

<p>But no, we&#39;re still a long way from the kind of systems you have in the UK, or Canada, or the rest of the civilized world.</p>

<p>You have to remember: Americans <em>hate</em> the poor. I mean, <em>really fucking hate</em> the poor and <em>love</em> to see them suffer. That&#39;s one of the main things that propels the Republican Party forward. Look at Donald Trump and his overwhelming support by conservatives. His whole message is based on hatred for the weak and powerless. And conservatives can&#39;t get enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was a ruse to fool the old whites into eventually conceding to single payer medicare.  And it will be inevitable as people won&#39;t go back to the old way.</p>

<p>But if Republicans are stupid and they do go back to the insurance market, then they have a darker agenda.  Because that will coerce middle to poor class people into non-insurance by even higher premiums they already can&#39;t afford (after all, insurance companies passed the switching costs onto the consumer and they&#39;ll do that again).  </p>

<p>Then people will get sick and not get care they need and will start dying at a remarkably higher rate since stress and administrative alienation are factors contributing to poor health outcomes.  This will be a direct result of bad policy and bankrupted leadership.</p>

<p>ERs will be flooded by uninsured white people, not just latins and they have to treat you, but that will cause hospitals to choose to close or give up their policies of the treatment of the uninsured.  </p>

<p>This leads to moral panic, widespread demoralization and more chaos as people begin to distrust the system deeply--it spirals out of control and america is finally ultimately lost.</p>
