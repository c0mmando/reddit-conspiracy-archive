       I work in the media, so granted I see headlines all day and that can be very stressful at times, but it seems like today, and since the attacks on Paris, there is much more bad shit.
Stateside: There were a number of government buildings evacuated due to suspicious packages, the states are announcing they plan to block refugees, then Saturday the dozen weapons were "stolen" from the Army Reserve Center.
      </p>
      <p>
       Globally, the German friendly was canceled because of a significant bomb threat,  France added new airstrikes, and then all the insanity with Putin's 40 ISIS financers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know, like I said, maybe it's all just getting to me, but I'm really curious to know if more people feel the same feeling of overwhelming dread that I feel.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just... those missing weapons are bothering me. And the FBI acting like it's not a threat bothers me even more.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Republicans are convinced that terrorists are hiding among the refugees when in reality they are probably already here hiding in plain sight and that thought makes me sick to my stomach.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR What the fuck is going on?

       So you're saying there is going to be a "terrorist attack" on US soil. As in, another reddit headline I saw was that Americans have forgotten 9/11, and we need to be reminded.
      </p>
      <p>
       I swear, this shit is terrifying me. It feels more and more like we are being manipulated and fucking toyed with by the very people who are supposed to protect us. How are we supposed to fight this??

       I have been feeling the same way this week. I just couldn't put it into words. I've noticed the public is torn and argues about whether or not to accept refugees, when, IMO, the point is being missed - we created this problem and relying on the same people to fix it makes me sick.

       It's our fault. We are not out there in public holding conferences and speeches about the knowledge we have. We are not professional enough to do such things. We don't spread the truth on Facebook as much as people with evil intentions spread falsehoods on Facebook.

       I don't think it is dumbness. Intelligence works in different ways for different people, intelligence shows itself in people in so many varying ways that i don't think you can say they are dumb. Most people know things are bad but it doesn't matter to them too much as long a they are OK. Vast swathes of people know things are bad but also feel powerless to stop or change anything, so they carry on as best they can with their lives. In many respects we all do.

       You think over 300,000 people on one forum are all insane? I have a problem with statements like that to be honest. It shows that you are at least in some ways ignorant.

       If you want extreme go to r/collapse. I get your point but OP was just making a personal observation. The world does feel like it's going to shit more and more but i agree it's important to keep perspective. Some people want big things to happen because they want change, they aren't happy with the world they live in. With the way things are now i can kind of understand that.

       According to the BBC interview with Bernays's daughter Anne, Bernays felt that the public's democratic judgment was "not to be relied upon" and he feared that "they [the American public] could very easily vote for the wrong man or want the wrong thing, so that they had to be guided from above"
The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. ...We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. ...In almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons...who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind.

       This ideal of Bernays' is republicanism.  I talked to a neocon today and realized that they hate actual democracy--this person said, "democracy is a tyranny of the majority." and then went on to say, "what if the majority decided to kick out all the black people?"
      </p>

       Well, you can't argue with that!  And by that I mean that nothing you say will matter to a person like that.

       Here's the deal. The US government in collaboration with the other top countries of the world are playing giant games of chess. They want to bring about changes that we are not comfortable with CURRENTLY but will be after global events lead to "changes" that need to be made. The best weapon you have in your arsenal is education. Just like their best weapon is the common populations ignorance.
      </p>

       How can you fight it? Don't fall prey to everything you hear/see. If there's cause for someone to manipulate you, they will. It doesn't mean you don't trust people, it just means you can't allow yourself to be a cow to be hearded.

       Changes are coming, whether or not you're okay with it.  You just need to be ready.

       You will have new forms of identification. More government control. Possible military state. Agencies like FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security will be household names as they increasingly become more and more militaristic. Out where I am we have FEMA QRF teams in training. Volunteers that are receiving SWAT style training and crowd control.  Learning how to heard people into stadiums.

There's at least a 50-50 chance Oswald wasn't JFK's assassin. Ancient aliens? I just don't know one way or the other. I read quite a bit about them in the 80's. Pyramid power? Doubtful. I assign about a 90% probability that almost all terrorism is state sponsored. GMOs have yet to be proven beneficial in any way. There are way too many side effects for vaccines and other drugs. Flouride in the water began as a way to dispose of toxic waste from the aluminum industry. Etc.

       No, I don't post or comment nearly as much as I used to. There's two reasons for that. I've pretty much said all I have to say previously and found that it just takes too much of my spare time to provide the sources that I used to (others do a better job of it nowadays) and my mod duties (trying to keep this sub a place where conspiracies and related events can be discussed without distraction) since this sub has grown so large takes up most of that free time. As for the rules here, I do my best to make sure they are respected and followed.

Or you could do like others have done in the past and start threads all over Reddit about yet another mod here being mean by removing a comment. Just about every mod here has had that happen to them, including me. Other than that, it's completely off topic in this thread and any further derailment or personal attacks against me will be removed.

       The term "faggot" is a derisive slur used against gay people (social order). Further, using it as an epithet for terrorists is associating gay people with terrorism.

       You greatly misunderstand the term.  It has nothing to do with sex.  It's about method.
      </p>
      <p>
       Faggots and terrorist are both very much culture warriors that use media to breakdown social order.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has nothing to do with gay sex.  It has to do with using media and fear to attack existing social order and society.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not about the people, but the method.  Terrorist using fear; faggots using false sense of entitlement, guilt, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       These groups do not deserve a protected status, since they are both attacking a social order.  They are not a social order.

       I'm talking about a group of people (not a social order), that is pushing a specific method to push a political agenda.

       I am talking specifically about subversion.

       I used to be afraid about this stuff.  Then I studied conspiracies, learned a bunch and became somewhat unafraid.  Knowledge is power.  And fear to quote Busey is 'false evidence appearing real'.  I want to try to convince you that terrorism is that "false evidence"
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR: freemansons
      </p>
      <p>
       The intense study of false flags in history all led back to the same group of people--the gnostics, or modern day freemasons.  Apparently, there's been an intrigue in play under our noses for several hundred years between Christians and Gnostics, a perennial game of spy versus spy.   Conclusions I've gotten to are: freemasonic networks have infiltrated our conventonal intelligence communities and are influencing them from within by siphoning off intelligence in order to stay one step ahead of our patriotic protectors, which affords them the ability to run false flags across the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       The false flags enrich their buddies financially and in terms of legislative dominance--buddies who either own, run, or are embedded within companies comprising the military-industrial complex, the pharmaceutical and energy/oil industries.  They subvert authorities also in order to sell drugs and they make a lot of money doing that.  So it's not wrong to say the CIA / DEA are the biggest drug traffickers, but it's more correct to say "those who have subverted" our intelligence agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, these people are smart.  They realized if you cut corners, you'll end up with a bunch of triangles--which is that sacred form they aspire to be: a triangle, not a square.  I'm talking about symbols now, which they revere and use to communicate through.  Once you 'have the eyes to see', the signs, symbols, (ex: 1113 was when knighs of malta were formed by the church, paris attacks happened 11/13 on a friday...(friday the 13th-- when templars were arrested and later burned at the stake in 1307(ish?)), you begine to realize that they leave their calling card on these events a lot of the time, affording us to be the dogged 'crime investigators' that can't quite seem to close the case on a serial killer.
      </p>
      <p>
       To become an investigator though, requires a crash course in metaphysical / occultic symbolism, astrology, alchemy, numerology, kabbalism, hermeticism, chaos magic, sigils, demonology, etc--all of which the freemasons are purported to use in their demon controlling rituals.  These domains of esoteric knowledge are considered woo and unimportant to most people inculcated into modern culture of scientism and exoteric knowledge, but that is precisely why you don't see for example the geometries and hidden symbols in corporate logos.  Freemasons derive from alchemists (solve coagula...V.I.T.R.O.L), who derive from rosicrucians and before that near eastern mystery schools, kabbalism, egypitan magic occultism traditions; basically magick.  Freemasons are mages and sorcerors depending what color tile black or white they happen to be standing upon, but at the end of the day, both are luciferian.
      </p>
      <p>
       Originally though, and according to the nag hammadi and dead sea scrollls, these gnositcs were cut from the same cloth as Jesus, a member of a jewish hippie vegan wizard meditator buddhist mushroom tripping cult called the
       <em>
        Nazarene Essenes
       </em>
       .  But at some point, they defected or turned evil.  Not sure how or when but a dark trend was curried into the gnostic tradition.  Or we were wrong about Jesus. Because of this lineage, they feel righteous in their mission statements of 'do what thou wilt' and 'the ends justify the means'.  They are basically Cartman.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you come to this same conclusion as many, you might get really scared.  But keep this in mind: they dont' get any benefit from us being unafraid.  They love our reaction to terrorism and the social shutdown and the spectacle it creates.  They love us giving up freedoms for securities that are absolutely never guaranteed and even more rarely delivered.  They are the true terrorists on the planet because they create mayhem sporadically and they rely on us not being able to do anythng about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, it's like a rapist.  It's not about the sex, it's about the power.  With them, it's not about the money, or the drugs, or the weapons they steal, or the politician they flip, or the organization/person they kill or takedown, or the child they sell into sex slavery, or any number of things they do.
       <em>
        It's about the power in being able to do ever-increasingly greater crimes, and having the victim (us) not be able to do anything about it whatsoever.
       </em>
       And secondarily, not having anyone in government agencies or police agencies able to do anything about it either because the ones that do end up getting fired, demoted, harassed and in some cases suicided, disappeared or murdered.  There are an embarrassing amount of examples.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, my point is being afraid is very unhelpful--it gives them what they want.  Don't do it.  Find a thing to love, as love is the only answer to fear.  It just so happens I've made the thing I love to be telling people about this and having the satisfaction of knowing that some people here will listen to me and it will have impact.  That every upvote I get is someone saying 'yep, goddamned freemason satanists' and I've raised the awareness.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also want to make a distinction that I have nothing against hermeticism and gnosticism generally--I think there are some people in the 'new age', 'self-help', spirit walker category of people--for example gaiam.com and that crowd--who are legitimately good, kind people who are into massage, yoga, meditation, etc; they are astrologers, tarot people, crystal folks, and they will never know that this is a watered down movement that was created by freemasons to throw people off their track.  Even though this is a misguided effort, those people deriving goodness for themselves in these esoteric studies is a legitimate use of their time if it makes them better people who want to help in the world.  I'm not worried about them--the freemasons' 'useful idiots'.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I do worry about these real happenings.  I tend to fall prey to 'damn freemasons' again...with everything that happens.  That's certainly wrong too.  But I don't ever fear and I don't hate them either.  I just think they are terribly misguided if I've described them fairly. And I say fair because I"ve made a best effort study of this from many angles, blogs, wikipedia, and numerous books on subjects tangential to this one.  If I'm wrong, well certainly the world and the sum total of human knowledge has conspired against me to form this opinion of the freemasons.  And so it's their fault, actually.  And if they want to convince me otherwise, they can come by with a pie they take the first bite of and we can talk.

       edit: everyone should see the new james bond movie Spectre, it's strikingly relevant to everything going on (and the above), hail hydra / spectre / illuminati / cabal / freemasons

       From "Secret Societies and Psychological Warfare" by Michael A Hoffman II I am currently reading.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "It's a deliberate psychological process they're taking us through, a psychodrama of enormous scale, though not really different from the principle behind the anonymous circulation of the Rocicrucian manifestos of the 17th century, with
        <em>
         their mocking hints of identity
        </em>
        .  The following is a statement which comes from within the British-intelligence wing of the Cryptocracy:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         "This demonstrates one of our simpler methods.  Realizing that our activities will sooner or later come to light, we structure our activities so that as conspiracy researchers unravel the, they will release information into the public consciousness in such a way that it mirrors our initatiory procedure.  In this way, the more we are investigated, the more masses of people are psychologically processed by the very people who seek to expose us.  The
         <em>
          meme
         </em>
         that constitutes our essential structure is then successfully mimicked within the consciousness of those who investigate us.  Success can then be measured precisely to the extent that our work is "exposed"."

       Im glad you took a news job, and I apologize for the situation youre in. Part of my cynical self wants to complain about how you didnt know ahead of time how controlled the media is, because theres other people exactly like you who are or will soon be pushing the agenda. My rational side thanks you for beginning to realize your situation and trying to make a difference. It also suggests that after the initial shock, fear, etc sets in that you contemplate staying in your position for exactly the reason it sucks for you. Obviously if it is overwhelming for you your wellbeing is more important, and I dont know how far up the ladder you are or how much info you will actually receive, but in the chance that you 'play the game right' you could be a good insider for a lot of people who are interested in the manipulation of news. Im not suggesting some Spy mission stuff, but you are certainly in a better situation than I am to provide new information to us such as what you are being told to say, what extra info do you know but arent saying in your job,  Etc. Thank you, and godspeed

       Honestly man, being informed is great and all but if you're feeling depressed and anxious, step away from this subreddit. It'll just make it worse.

       Take it a step further, go without internet or TV for a week. Don't let it eat at you, the shit you read about the world is fucking depressing.

       I recommend going without TV completely, myself. Certainly, go see the occasional movie. Watch something on netflix if you feel like. But avoid watching broadcast television programming, be it news or otherwise. Between the
       <del>
        brainwashing
       </del>
       commercials and the
       <del>
        propaganda
       </del>
       news, I found I couldn't stand it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for internet use, just ease off the news sites and serious shit. Look at some cat pictures or pictures of breasts every now and then. Both have been shown to relieve stress.

       I cant stop having this feeling that we are on the verge of something. Have this feeling that we have 2 incredible phenomenon happening at the same time and they are very close to a collide. Thanks in large part to the internet, there is a massive awakening going on all over the world. The age of information is real. The lid has popped off and information in flooding everywhere. I see more and more signs of an awakening everyday. Their preventing it somewhat but at this point the cat might be out of the bag.
On the other end there is a massive push by the elite to bring about the new world order. They see people waking up and they are getting motivated, coordinated, and desperate. They know that their loosing some grip and if they loose too much it could be a point of no return. However there is also so many people who are so programmed that if they can just heat up the assault on consciousness, say false flags, then they can slam the door.
I guess what im saying that were entering a situation of where we could fall all the way down the hole Orwellian style, or we could hit a mass awakening and real battle against this conspiracy thats been going on for sometime. To me it doesn't seem to be a middle ground but more of a one or the other. I know people will say the world has always been like this, but i just have a feeling that we are hitting unprecedented times and its one way or the other.

       But yes. I have many friends who refuse go go see movies or eat out. They are sure it is the end of days. Maybe I'm old and jaded but after about the 30th apocalypse scare I've lived through it just doesn't phase me anymore.

       Y2k, Mayan calander, 9/11, ebola, sars, mad cow, killer bees, disappearing bees, boston marathon. Remember for 2 weeks people thought Yellowstone was going to erupt and end all life? Race wars, police state, etc. God the more I think back the more times I can remember where we were sure this was the end of times or the proverbial straw breaking the camels back to ignite the war the ends it all.

       and it's a good point to remember. There will always be another spoon to stir up the pot. Maybe I'm jaded as well or slightly sociopathic but all the assorted craziness going on in the world just makes for good television. But what I really mean by that is that much of what is scaring us comes from a screen or words on paper. Is it real? Kinda. But our lives go on. Yeah, nothing's ending anytime soon.

       Think of it like this.  You have a massive whirlpool that is the economy...the global "market".  This is made up of trade, of policies, of..well, governments and people.  When you're in your boat, on the fringe of this whirlpool, things are rotating slowly.  You see shit come up, and say "Oh man, what a cyclical event!  We've seen these things before a while back!"  But the more you ignore the causes of it, the farther in to the whirlpool you're pulled.  The more central you get, the faster things start to swirl.  You begin to not be able to even turn your ship to face away from the impending central destruction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing "new" is going on to cause such a cluster fuck on a global scale.  What you're seeing now, is the results of decades of ignoring reality by our government and our people, and the other governments and people that make up our global market.  We're simply getting to the point where we can't just turn our ship away from what is inevitably going to sink us.

       i think a lot of it has to do with automation and robotics, we are reaching a point to where all of the work done by "surfs" will be done by machines or already is being done by machines and those people are no longer needed and the simplest way to get rid of them is through war. i would love to be wrong and think that we will live in a technological paradise free to do as we please but i don't see that happening. i think the powers that be would rather be rid of all the pissants. i am including myself as one of the pissants since i have watched my job go from being a very technical skill (machinist) into one done completely by machines in some cases. i will be obsolete soon.

       All of this at once. The bombings in Paris. Hell 3 hours ago they announce more bombings. The American media turning a blind eye to everything but what they want people to see- keeping them in fear. I see it its all the news has been these past couple of months.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then on top of that heres one thing thats weird to me. The bombings happened the day wt1190f hit. I have yet to hear anything else about wt1190f. I searched new on youtube and the latest news online and NOTHING. Ever since wt1190f shit has been hitting the fan. Someone please explain what happened with wt1190F!!!

       The terror humdrum just puts a spotlight on the festering fabric of society in times where it's forbidden to dance to your own tunes if they're not congruent to the extremely inflated, almost manically positivistic horseshit they want you to believe and adhere to.
      </p>

       In no way, shape or form is this globalist agenda of a neo-capitalistic revival on steroids any different from the forced contentment and complacency demanded from subjects in more obvious dictatorships.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what makes this system so vile, so all-pervasive and inescapable. Most of the plebeians still don't get it and start to engage in what's called substitute behaviour, like too many pigs biting each other's tails when they're crammed into a stable.

       I agree, things are getting pretty nutsy out there, or so it seems to me. Maybe what happened is starting to sink in for a lot of people, bringing back the terrifying memories of 9/11 and associated twitchiness.

       I had waves of dread earlier, a couple of years ago. So, I think this is a psychological thing where the individual can only handle so much bad news and then you start to shut down. Some people cut out media from their lives and feel much better for it. I am not one of those people but I can understand as much of what we are fed is lies anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, the international stress level is definitely being raised. To what purpose is another question. I think we can look forward to a major event in the next few years but it is hard to predict exactly what will happen when where.

       Syria + plains of Megiddo  + Syria/Iran/Russia vs. USA/Israel = Nice little formula for potential Armageddon. You guys in the media need to wake up to the Illuminati (World bank/UN/Bohemian Grove/ Bilderberg Group, and Trilateral Commision.

       The Oligarchs need the current order to be destroyed so a new one, by their design, can be created. How will the current order be destroyed? Like the old saying goes: "the easiest way to destroy your enemy is to have your enemy destroy itself." We are heading for complete war. We have been divided culturally for decades and when SHTF, we will end up tearing each other apart. Nation against nation, husband against wife, neighbor against neighbor, believer against the non believer. Whether it be a World War or a civil one, make no mistake, war is coming.

       It's the new normal. Entropy will continue to accrue until the wheels come off. By that point, we won't notice because we'll be too busy trying to stay sheltered and fed.

       I'm not worried about the stolen weapons.  There are 300 million firearms in the country in private hands.  If a radicalized person wants to borrow a firearm to go kill some people it'll be trivially easy.  None of the "gun control" shit will do anything to prevent someone already bent on breaking the law against murder.

       Six M4s and ten pistols. We could assume there are ten men now ready to use these weapons in a "Paris style" attack somewhere in the Northeastern US. Or maybe they were just stolen by some dude looking to sell them on the "black market" for a quick buck...

       Why if I am so nuts do you comment on damn near every post I have ever made since I brought up flat earth? Interesting right? Literally dozens if not hundreds of your replies for a guy you consider insane, what does that say about you? I know when I see insane posts I ignore and move on, yet you seem to want to attack me via ad hominem,  or other character assassination, I think it only adds more weight to what I am saying.

       If you watch TV and have degrees like the free masons do you are absolutely a mind controlled selfish immoral person. Is it right action to character assassinate someone who you do not know? The earth is flat and there is no amount of college degrees or doctorates that can change that. I meet so many smug folks like you who mock and laugh at me while I continue to show proofs that are ignored or the intelligence of the person is too low for it to enter their brains, they are brain damaged and insane as are you.
