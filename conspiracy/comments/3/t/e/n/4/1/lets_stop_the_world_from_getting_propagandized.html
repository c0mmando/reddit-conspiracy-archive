    <div class="md"><p>Oh, right, that&#39;s why we haven&#39;t stopped fighting in the middle east. With majority of countries involved. You are a victim of indoctrination, can&#39;t blame you.</p>

<p>Starting with the 1991 Gulf War, however, despite the end of the Cold War, we&#39;ve had two decades of non-stop fighting: Somalia in 1992, Haiti in 1994, Bosnia in 1995, Serbia-Kosovo in 1999, Afghanistan starting in 2001, and Iraq again from 2003. With Libya, we&#39;ve added another U.S. war.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say that you or me are all that elevated, advanced, or smart or whatever.  This is only to say that we seem to be willing to <em>not</em> go along with the bullshit.

    <div class="md"><p>absolutely!!! :) </p>

<p>I actually just had a really meaningful conversation with my long time bf about it, things have been strained with us for over a year when  firs spurted to her all this stuff when I was first learning about 9/11 thruth, when we talked recently they actually told me they had considered having an intervention for me. </p>

<p>but I managed my anger and told her it was ok. I said I know it makes all these feelings come up. I know. it;s hard for me too - I cried a lot when I first learned about a lot of this stuff - it was overwhelmingly painful - one weekend I spent just in a breakdown. BUT, I&#39;m better for it, and it&#39;s ok, and I want to share what I&#39;m seeing - you (my friend) don;t have to believe the same things at all  - I just want to be free to tell you what I think and esp why I think it. </p>

<p>and we had a long and at times hard conversation - but ended up really bonding deeper, and esp when I talked about paris - and how we have to be careful not to be sold war --- she really heard me, she didn&#39;t really hear me on 9/11 but for some reason she heard me on that one, and ---- it felt like a new day -- I know she&#39;s thinking about it now. (paris/more war)(and I know our friendship is renewed too) </p>

<p>I think a lot of really smart passionate people just need a little help to see it&#39;s not madness to look into this stuff, and we don;t think we are &quot;smarter&quot; because we &quot;know what they don;t know&quot; -- to the contrary it was dumb luck I stumbled on it - in the beginnig and I may have been on the other side of the conversation in a slightly different turn of events. and I told her so, I think somehow that humility/truth helped too. </p>

<p>anyway -- I really think we can talk to our friends ( based on that I just finally talked to mine :) ( only a little bias) and remind them we are very much still the people they know and love -- we just also learned some stuff we feel would be a dire shame not to try to share. </p>

<p>and what a shame is it not to keep trying to find a way to share it - and what a power it will be the more people share it, </p>

<p>public opinion is power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First and foremost, the fact that both your and my posts here have been down voted is a horrible testament to what we’re up against with regard to the mindset of many other people.  This is indeed a planet of deep sorrows.  Nonetheless, however, we should never let any naysayers keep us from knowing our truth - that truth that refuses to just sit by idly and let what’s happening to us and everybody around us go by without at least <em>some</em> sort of conscious refusal and struggle to accept it.  None of this is to say that any one of us singlehandedly will be able to stop this beast of manipulation from rolling.  Of course not.  However, I will not die having said that I did not at least try to stop it; that I did not at least stand against it in mind and action.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I actually just had a really meaningful conversation with my long time <strong>bf</strong> [“bf” meaning “BOY friend”, meaning “HE”] about it, things have been strained with us for over a year when firs spurted to [<strong>her</strong> meaning “she”, meaning “female”…referring to “bf”/boyfriend?  Boyfriend = “her”?] all this stuff when I was first learning about 9/11 thruth, when we talked recently they actually told me they had considered having an intervention for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Typo or are you in a trans relationship?  Either way, doesn’t matter, as I’m not judging, and am 100% cool either way - I’m not gay, but am also 0% homophobic and respect everyone, as we are all part of the One Whole - but that <em>did</em> catch me by surprise for a moment.  :)</p>

<p>(EDIT:  I see it was a typo now.  You’re a male and you’re referring to your girlfriend…I think…right?)</p>

<p>Either way, I had a <em>really</em> not easy transition with my own long time gf about it as well, and we got into some <em>really</em> strong “conversations” (practically almost fights) about the truths I was uncovering because she was <em>very</em> resistant to the information.  However, I simply kept showing her truth after inconvenient truth, until her reaction just started going <strong>O_o</strong>, and there was really nothing she could say about the connections and the evil that was really, truly involved.  Now she’s pretty heavily on board with a lot of what I research - not <em>all</em> of it, but a lot.  She’s not really as interested in the uncovering of all this deceit and information as I am, but she is pretty much in line with a lot of the things I discover nowadays.</p>

<p>It was <em>not</em> an easy transition for her, however, because it does pretty much challenge all the b.s. beliefs and indoctrination that we are all brainwashed with literally from birth.  One system of indoctrination she <em>still</em> has a very hard time with is religion, and she <em>still</em> cringes heavily whenever I’m critical of Christianity and “Jesus Christ”, etc, but since she knows that <strong><em>I</em></strong> know that there is very much a unifying cosmic, universal Force and Source manifesting all that exists, she understands that it’s not like I’m saying that there is “no” intelligent multidimensional force outside of this limited, physical and third dimensional realm we live in.  I’m just saying that the end all be all of creation isn’t some fucking white anglo saxon <em>human male</em> casting down judgement over human infidels. lol smh.</p>

<p>Either way, yeah…It’s definitely a <em>definite</em> transition when you’re stepping outside of the matrix of indoctrinated thought on this planet and in this Western civilization.</p>

<p>We are <em>definitely</em> brainwashed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I cried a lot when I first learned about a lot of this stuff - it was overwhelmingly painful</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep.  I had spells of crying fits when I <em>really</em> realized that our very own government and PTB on this planet really <em>do</em> purposefully kill us en mass and in droves, and do so covertly and to fill a negative, nefarious agenda.  I totally get it now, but I remember when it was first really dawning on me…I was like “<strong>O_o</strong> holy shit”, and it kind of blew me away for a bit when I first started uncovering just how fucking evil some of this shit really is on this planet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we had a long and at times hard conversation - but ended up really bonding deeper, and esp when I talked about paris - and how we have to be careful not to be sold war</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was really cool, because just yesterday my gf asked me what I thought about the Paris terrorist attack, and I showed her the entire clip of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxKIeAhi7ws">Gearoid O’Colman talking on RT</a>, and she didn’t even bat an eyelash at it, and we had a good,  long moment and conversation about all the insane deceit and false flag propaganda that exists on this planet and that we have to be aware of.  It was absolutely great really because it just showed how absolutely far she’d come in understanding that all is <em>definitely</em> not as it seems in the world and ESPECIALLY on the MSM.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>she really heard me, she didn&#39;t really hear me on 9/11 but for some reason she heard me on that one, and ---- it felt like a new day -- I know she&#39;s thinking about it now. (paris/more war)(and I know our friendship is renewed too)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good to hear.  Yeah.  It’s a long, drawn out process because people simply do NOT want to hear things that go against the things that they’ve been brought up all their lives believing - especially if some of those things are THIS fucking bad, nefarious, and evil.  The mind really rages against finding out that <em>this</em> much of what we’ve been taught to believe is the case…is actually absolutely, 100%, under no circumstances WRONG.  Shit’s crazy.</p>

<p>It’s definitely a long process to cause many to wake up, and some simply <em>won’t</em> wake up.  They’ll refuse to.  They’ll fight you…and convincing someone who only sees things one way that their perspective might not be quite as valid as they think almost always WON’T happen in one moment or one sitting or one conversation.  With my gf, it’s been an ongoing process, and it’s taken years, and even though she doesn’t look into these things anywhere <em>near</em> as much as I do, she’s definitely a LOT more open to PTB b.s. now than eeeeever before.  For anyone else who’s <em>not</em> my s.o., however?  I’m, of course, not going to spend all the long time it takes trying to convince them.  I just give them information that exists and let them make of it what they will.  What they do with the information and where they take it is ultimately up to them.  Sometimes people drop the info and let it go, but other times people pick it up and go on and investigate it further and that leads them on their own path of discovery - similar to how things happened, and are STILL happening, to me as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think a lot of really smart passionate people just need a little help to see it&#39;s not madness to look into this stuff, and we don;t think we are &quot;smarter&quot; because we &quot;know what they don;t know&quot; -- to the contrary it was dumb luck I stumbled on it - in the beginnig and I may have been on the other side of the conversation in a slightly different turn of events. and I told her so, I think somehow that humility/truth helped too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  Makes sense.  I admit that I can certainly be a bit of a fucking militant asshole sometimes, and I’m not super soft-handed at times.  If I know some information is factual and true, I can push it pretty damn hard regardless of whether others have problems with it or find it “controversial” or not.  Son’t <em>even</em> get me started on the truth of ET existence on and around this planet and universe.  However, I guess I at least occasionally <em>try</em> to be conscientious of who it is I’m talking to whether it be my gf (who, again, understands a <em>lot</em> more about the b.s. that’s really going on now after all these years than ever before) or someone who’s still super stuck in the matrix.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I really think we can talk to our friends ( based on that I just finally talked to mine :) ( only a little bias) and remind them we are very much still the people they know and love -- we just also learned some stuff we feel would be a dire shame not to try to share.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  I agree.  I wouldn’t say I actually <em>have</em> any friends (lol), but I don’t have a problem with bringing up these subjects to pretty much whoever it is I happen to be talking to if the moment is opportune enough.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>public opinion is power.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep.  And TPTB make sure and keep public opinion in a <em>very</em> militantly ignorant state, unfortunately.</p>

<p>We might be little more than small drops trying to put out a raging inferno, but that certainly doesn’t stop me from continuing to speak and live the truth that I know as best and as well as I possibly can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I say talk to everybody you know about why you question Paris attack (if you do) -- talk about what you do question -- find a way to help them question too. I think that&#39;s what we can do -- share our insight with people we know and hope it will spread,  </p>

<p>I say specifically let people know - this isn;t about conspiracy theory - but to be warry of being sold a war, be warry of who wants war - and how they have the ability to propagandize to us - and that we must be thoughtful about behind the scenes motivation when the news seems to be pushing us to want war too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes. this is very true, and very painful. I say regroup and try again. you don&#39;t have to throw the whole thing at them. you can really think about -- what they might be able to relate to, for example most people know the news is slanted -- but they don&#39;t realize it&#39;s chock full of literal lies. maybe suggest to them that the people who own news corporations choose which stories run. --- just thinking about the reality that the press is not as free as we like to think - could be a start. -- I mean probably tailor how you start for your specific friend -- but even the slightest bite of this type of information -- somehow could lead to more, if you can work on how to pace it. I mean I think it&#39;s imoprtant to try even when it&#39;s hard, sometimes changing strategy and pacing makes all the difference. </p>

<p>Yes.  You&#39;re right.  Totally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your sentiment...but <em>you&#39;re</em> not completely brainwashed, are you?  I don&#39;t feel like <em>I&#39;m</em> completely brainwashed - or I feel like I&#39;m at least a <em>bit</em> &quot;aware&quot; of the matrix.  So then what can we do?  What can you do?  What can I do?</p>

<p>We can make sure and at least TELL people what the fuck we know when we actually get the opportunities.  If we find ourselves in a situation where we happen to be talking to someone (small talk, at a get together, etc, whatever) and the subject of all the world political bullshit that is going on comes up, and somebody starts spouting off MSM bullshit that&#39;s actually <em>wrong</em>, then WE (i.e. you and me and people like <em>us</em> who at least have <em>some</em> sort of clue) should stand up and say &quot;Naw wait a minute.  Not really.  That&#39;s not what&#39;s really going on.  <em>This</em> is what&#39;s really going on...&quot; etc...or at least do/say <em>something</em> like that.</p>

<p>We should spread <em>our own</em> awareness as much as we can.  THAT&#39;S what we should do.</p>

<p>Will it make a difference?  It might not.  However, I think that so long as we <em>can</em> do and say something, we should at least attempt whatever it is we can, even if it&#39;s only a bit and might not seem like that huge or momentous of a thing.  We should speak the truth that we know that this world is a bullshit contrivance and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hfEBupAeo4">all wars are bankers&#39; wars</a>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not talking about becoming some sort of political Malcolm X powerhouse martyr or something like that.  Most of us won&#39;t be able to do that.  However, even though we don&#39;t necessarily have to do/become that, it doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t - again - make sure and spread the information that we <em>do</em> have to <em>whoever</em> it is we happen to find ourselves in conversation with.</p>

<p>It&#39;s about the <em>organic</em> spreading of understanding and awareness amongst the collective consciousness of the masses - of the civilization, of humanity.  I feel that the more we are unafraid to speak the truth about the bullshit that&#39;s really going on, the more and more people around us will simply start catching on and understanding that all this is in fact b.s.  Once that starts happening more and more, then TPTB will have a lot <em>less</em> power because they will not be in as much control over the masses as they currently are.</p>

<p>Start from the bottom up.  Do what <em>you</em> can.  Do the little you can.  Just talk when you can and state your truth when you can.  That&#39;s it.</p>

<p>But don&#39;t take the truth that you have and that you know and walk around and tell people you know that &quot;No.  We&#39;re fucked.  Don&#39;t even try.  Just give up.  Curl up in a ball and don&#39;t even try.&quot;</p>

<p>Fuck that.</p>

<p>Better to die on your feet than live on your knees.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my feeling on it anyway.</p>
