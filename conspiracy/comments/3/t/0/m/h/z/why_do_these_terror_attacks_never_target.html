       OK after some thought: It might be that Governments and terrorist organizations "bargain" with each other (not necessarily directly). The governments want the public to feel as though they need they need protection, while the terrorist organizations want their own continued existence and public support from radicals, simultaneously increasing their own power.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm trying to understand what the terrorists organizations receive from not targeting governments directly. Could it be because they know they could easily be wiped out with military power if they did? That's how I think of their relationship, terrorists organizations stay alive as long as they strike fear in people while increasing the power that governments have over their own people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does that sound right? I'm trying to sort out my own thoughts on this.

       It's time that we avoided using the word 'terrorist', as most people's definition of the word has been fed to them by a decade of propoganda. English settlers escaping tyrannical rule of Britain would have been labeled as 'terrorists', and now the the hundreds of thousands of displaced refugees and victims of the West's crazed and destructive search for power and complete domination have a better chance at being labeled as a 'terrorist' than those who truly pull the trigger.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can take something like ISIS (formed entirely by the West and allies such as Saudi Arabia &amp; Israel, and funded directly and indirectly by the like) and compare it to things like the cartels in Mexico, and we get a different idea of what a 'terrorist organization' acts like. Mexican cartels put the mutilated body of any government official or political influencer who does not cooperate on display as a bloodied and decapitated example to those who threaten the existence of the organization itself. This is never doubted and the examples of this corruption are many and horrific.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, the evidence of the existence of ISIS and it's 'terrorist' actions are consistenly inaccurate, and it acts using questionable resources such as American made vehicles and weaponry and financing from notable countries and powerful entities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though western government is mostly responsible for BOTH of these organizations, the problem with ISIS and this current spread of 'terrorism' is that it's illegitimacy is so transparent that the fact that it's working is disheartening. With so much about ISIS left to be questioned, videos of executions and propoganda constantly being called out; there is some intelligence insulting information available about these 'terrorist organizations', and the fact that most people believe it speaks for itself about what's left of our passion for truth and consciousness.

       It may be the certain politicians capitalise on a fear sentiment to spout tough on terrorism rhetoric but defer practical strategy to the MIC, which through a hierarchical compartmentalised structure, defers power to a select group of 'any means necessary' group of global strategists, who work in concert with governments and financial, media, arms and radical organisations to manipulate those original lazy politicians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though I think it's likely that those at the top also have assets as politicians and they are all negatively aligned in a paradigm of domination and control.

       But you just said that the terrorist cells are run by CEOs, if they weren't all in on it then they would just bomb their opposition to seize control of the entire marketplace. Otherwise what is the point of running a group that blows things up?

       With 'themself' I'm referring to the entire elite who are in the know of the global agenda. I have to make clear that not
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       CEO of every company in the world is 'in on the game' so to say. So they could very well be a target. But the same thing could be said for politicians, bankers or military people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hmm I'm starting to understand how you arrived at your questions and argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reminder that the thread starter specifically put "terror attacks" in quote, he is implying that he is aware that these are orchestrated false flag attacks. I am speaking from
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       side of the fence. Speaking with the knowledge that these false flags are carried out for specific agendas which we are seeing unfolding day by day.
But I can totally see your point now. I admit that I am a bit baffled right now because I couldn't immediately understand and answer your question, it really made me think. If these are indeed false flag events, why not attack high-profile people? Very good point.
Maybe having the general public as a target makes putting people into a state of fear and uncertainty easier? Since higher-ups are an extreme minority and the general public is everyone. This would make it easier to garner support or acceptance for their imposed solutions like more surveillance or invasions, because everybody feels threatened.
You have made me re-think this, very good.

       Think about it like this: lone wolf terrorism is a sole proprietorship, which means you can afford and have access to 1) gun, 2) bullets, 3) accessories, 4) homemade, primitve bombs.
      </p>
      <p>
       So whenever there's actual terrorism (not mass shooting), use of a powerful bomb for instance, you know that they stole it from the military or they are part of the military or they have military connections of some sort.  If they stole those bombs, that means a small militia or mafia is needed---which means you need lots of money if it's not an ideological militia.  Even still, a well intentioned but low-skill ideological militia that is self-supporting in terms of money, will get exactly nowehere when it comes to say, 'robbing a national guard armory' or some other quartermaster with advanced milititary grade explosives as these places are actually very secure.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm getting at is that terrorism requires 1) money, 2) mliitary skill, 3) manpower (mercenaries).  This means the operation will cost a lot of money for all 3, and all 3 are needed for success.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's almost a mathematical proof then, to say that terrorism is always funded by a financial elite and it's victims are nearly always
       <em>

       In other words, terrorism is an instrument used by the rich caste to wage illegitimate / unofficial war on the middle / poor castes.

       Just because some bankers died doesn't mean that they were from their own people. There could have been bankers who died in other 'terrorist' attacks, doesn't necessarily mean they are part of the elite.

       Yeah, I didn't know how to say that clearly.  By "statements of fact" I mean they say specific things you can go check out.  They don't just say "we didn't do anything wrong" or something, they make specific factual claims that can be verified or disproven.

       Well if you're putting it that way I'm willing to keep this talk going. You should have made this clear from the beginning instead of taking a fighting stance.
      </p>
      <p>
       In your previous post you implied that either bankers perform out these attacks or that they gain profit from terrorist attacks... This issue has never been about the banker. When I first said "They would never attack themself" I refered to the people working in their own system. Which could also include
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       bankers. Not that bankers carried out terrorist attacks. Or CEO's from other companies for that matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your question of what gains do they make from terrorist attacks isn't relevant to this discussion. It has nothing to do with why they are not attacked.

       If they killed a prime minister for his decision to invade a country, I wouldn't be scared. If they killed civilians in random places, I would be. "Terror attacks" are not assassinations, their goal is to spread terror among everyone.

       A little off topic, but what would have to happen to 'scare' the 'elite'? They want control of the people. They get it through control of the money. Their worst fear would be being 'poor' (aka regular). If we wanted to, we could try to 'terrorize' the 'elite' via a general boycott. Seriously, if people started cancelling netflix and retail sales plummetted these richy-riches would be shitting themselves.

       The elite will be scared the day the army and the police will no longer protect them. They are safe as long as they are in control of those with weapons. What needs to happen for the army to side with the people against the elite, I don't know.

       And that in itself is a flawed philosophy.. because surely if you're some kind of righteous martyr wannabe then you would be striking at the very core of the thing you hate. In this case - capitalism, the "kuffar" who run system and essentially propagate it's effectiveness - bankers, politicians, people of influence who are, in their own words, "attacking their way of life".
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention that by attacking regular civilians you are garnering support against you. It would seem to be a win-win for the "bad guys" to attack people with more power and influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       But of course - I know why they don't; I think most people ITT know why they don't.

       They are terrorists because they are committing terrorism. In the United States the term 'terrorism' means premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents. If they were doing something like assassinations, they'd be assassins.

       Well, from a straight forward point of view, it doesn't make sense. Why attack civilians instead of people that actually matter?

       But if you look at it from the viewpoint that they are trying to radicalize us against muslims, to then radicalize muslims against us to start a massive global ideological war, it sort of makes sense to target civilians.

       Remember when Obama was first made president and there were concerns he'd get assassinated by some racists?
      </p>
      <p>
       Those watching him in the crowds during speeches weren't concerned for their life given Obama was the target, not them. Now instead, if there was a trend of people bombing crowds at presidential speeches - Then the people would be afraid.

       He is right though. It's all done (partly) to justify new laws that will make you give up your privacy more and more.

       But I guess attacking politicians or bankers could be used as well for those means..... hmmmm like I said it's because they won't attack themself.

       So why would they want to spook the general population, instead of getting the general population to support them and their cause?  If they attacked Monsanto head quarters tomorrow say, you really think this would help or hurt their recruiting?

      <p>
       Citizens of these countries are mostly not "people who matter." If you attack the "people who matter" you aren't going to make the average Joe as scared as you do when you kill someone who makes them all say "Holy shit, that could have been me."
      </p>
      <p>
       If their goal is to scare a population, attacking civilians almost always makes the most sense. Not only that, but they are usually the easiest targets too.

        Why would Muslims want to scare the population?

      <p>
       This seems an odd question coming from
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . We talk about 'false flags' and how they are used to scare the population into acquiescing what the government wants. It's the same idea here, they are scaring the population into demanding or acting in a way they want. One of the theories of ISIS is that they want to drive a wedge between Muslims and the West. They
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       the West to hate Islam, so they can turn around and say "see? They hate you because of your religion. It's us against them!" making it easier for them to get willing recruits, rather than having to force people into helping them through fear of violence.

      <p>
       Not necessarily. This would be one strategy, but if you cannot win by attacking the actual oppressors, there are other strategies as well, as stated above.

       The answer to your question is that they have not openly stated their strategy, only their ultimate goal. Expecting "the enemy" to openly state why they are doing what they are doing is not something that is going to often happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I said is a pretty standard theory as to why they target civilians, and there seems to be a logical reason to do so. You initially asked why, I answered with my belief.

       For one, they're harder to get close to. They all have some form of constant escorts and, in some cases, bodyguards.
      </p>
      <p>
       For another, the point is to put the fear of "God" into the common folk. If you strike at high-profile targets, the damage is relatively contained - you had a single mark and focused on it. When people see it, they get scared and go "Oh shit, look at what those guys pulled off! What if they started doing that to the rest of us?" But if you target a site, as opposed to a person, the damage is everyone that happened to be there at the time. Not only that, now that you're targeting the regular folk, they start thinking that
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       could be one of the next 30-something fleshy smears on the pavement. Works a lot better.

       I disagree.  I'm just thinking here as if I were them, and trying to recruit people.  If I attacked a politician or CEO of a major global company, I would think that many more people would be sympathetic to me and my cause, which would cause others to join me in my cause.

       ISIS is like a kid who throws a snowball at the biggest guy in school, and lets a little guy take the blame. Then he convinces the little guy to team up with him to take down the big guy. And to do that, they need to make the little guy think the big guy is a bully.

       If their goal is to recruit westerners, they're gonna have to do twice the work: first to convert them to Islam, then to convert them to radical Islam. It's easier to just blow up the infidels, terrify the survivors and hope that the show is enough to sway more people back home.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seeking new recruits among people who are already in a shitty situation, thus somewhat primed, is probably the smartest thing that any terrorist organization has ever pulled. Though that's not saying much, is it?

       Quite literally, the term "brass" refers to the fact that officers have pins made out of brass (or at least did when the term came into favor, I can't say for sure what they are made out of now).
      </p>
      <p>
       But anyway, I thought I had edited. The highest rank was actually a Lt Colonel, not Captain. Although, you still wouldn't consider that high enough, I imagine.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, that being said, they did fly a plane into the Pentagon on 9/11. So who got shot at Ft Hood doesn't really change the fact high level military personnel were, in fact, targeted.

       That may be the origins of the word, but I don't know anyone who isn't fresh out of boot camp that would consider an O-3 to be considered brass.
      </p>
      <p>
       An O-5 has considerably more clout than an O-3. I'm only familiar with the navy, since that's the branch that I was in, but an O-3 is likely to be a division officer, where an O-5 is a department head.
      </p>
      <p>
       O-3 is the last promotion for officers before they have to be chosen. Up to O-3, it is automatic, as long as they don't lose their eligibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point, I don't even know if we are arguing the same point or not.

       Because the term is not tightly defined, it is convenient to use because it could mean anything you want it to mean. I am sure that if Abrams was targeted, someone would be saying it isn't "brass" enough because it wasn't Obama.

       Within the military "brass" always means the big bosses, even junior officers use this term to refer to their superiors. An O-3 would never be referred to as "brass".

       The Stade de France bombers were targeting the President (and any poor souls who would happen to be around).

       That failed, showing to terrorists around the world, that it's difficult to target politicians, bankers, CEOs, military brass.

       The fact that this question is being asked should signify the nature of these "terror organizations"... They are arms of the network of powerful families and cabals used to instill fear in the masses (the ones being targeted and killed by these "terror organizations") and to present the "enemy" image that society craves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only have these groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS failed to kill or harm any CEO's or political leaders,  they've failed to even attempt to harm them. So the question you raise is extremely valid and shows me you are critically thinking about the world right now

       Your comment added nothing. You make a sarcastic comment about Jews controlling the world, on a forum where you criticise people for saying the same thing. Now people will read what you wrote, think that you are serious, and criticise this sub for antisemitism. And the cycle continues. Be the change you want to see!

       We already have all the tools necessary to build a prosperous society but it will never happen. Intelligence agencies/police and businesses (if they can be called that) stand to lose too much. That's why they need their patsies because otherwise they are not necessary and have no reason to exist. They have to create trouble.

       I'm sure they'd love to blow up Obama or any other world leader but it isn't exactly an easy thing to do. Targeting some bankers or whatever wouldn't have the same level of wowzer as killing a hundred something civilians in one of the worlds greatest cities. Also don't forget the soldier who was pretty much beheaded in London a couple of years ago.

       Their command and control is obviously pretty shitty. They find suicidal people who can be temporarily amped up and then point them at targets of convenience. These "soldiers" are not stable and well trained assassins. They're suicidal nihilists who have been temporarily imbued with a sense of purpose by religious fervor.
      </p>
      <p>
       The better trained and more stable "leaders" don't dare leave their strongholds. As it is they spend their days dodging drone strikes.

       That's why it's 'terror'ism.  When people are targeted for no reason, what can you do to be safe?  The politicians, the military, and to a certain extent the bankers, are aware of the risk their jobs and their actions entail.  They knowingly put themselves at risk in order to do what they need to do, and while it's scary to think that such highly protected people can be touched, it's scarier to think that
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       might be a target.
      </p>
      <p>
       The terror comes from the idea that no one is safe- a school teacher in Iowa is at much risk as a guy directing drones at the Pentagon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from the psychological aspect, the political pressure exerted by a whole country of unhappy, scared people is pretty powerful.  Consider the repercussions of say, 9/11 compared to the Kennedy assassination.  Both are the kind of events where people can remember exactly where they were when they found out, but one resulted in nationwide mourning and the other resulted in a decade of widespread policy changes and war.

       at least people are asking Why they would have done this type of attack this time. its highly coordinated yet some how bumbling enough to wear masks, yet bring their passports.
      </p>
      <p>
       convenient how it targets the progressive parts of france, the same people who are probably most likely to be against military intervention in syria. seem like exactly the wrong group for ISIS to target if they want to keep france out of the fight.
      </p>
      <p>
       why would ISIS a group already being battered and broken by russian/syrian/iranian forces, and the occasional strike from the US on civilian power plant, want to escalate with france?  what the hell do they gain from it? is there not enough explosions already raining on them?
      </p>
      <p>
       but look at who really benefits from the aftermath, france is now "at WAR!!!" something their public has been resisting, all of a sudden nationalist groups have the "reason" to start the push to lock the immigrants and refugees up and blame them. obviously this also drags NATO in to the mix, "an attack on one, is an attack on all" right... so now we have NATOs entrance in to syria in some quasi legal attempt at legitimizing it. completely eclipsed the beirut bombings, the attack on the russian airliner, bringing the focus of the media back to the valiant NATO forces who must immediately remove Assad and his terrible regime (some of you might even then ask "but wait didn't ISIS bomb them")
      </p>
      <p>
       but hey, lets just sit back and see what happens. watch whose interests flourish in the aftermath.

       As soon as it happens, France bombs ISIS (don't ask me why they bomb their American allies, but I digress) instead of taking serious action against their own displacement.

       So use terrorism to rile up French (or whoever) to attack people in the Middle East while letting the same people into those countries.

       Simple targeting civilians is the only way to get unanimous support from the population for emotional reactions whereas targeting banks, military based etc wouldn't get that much support as some people would say it was their duty or for banks it's what they deserved. Also it's about creating terror, if they know it could have been any of them well it works better to deploy your agenda

       Kind of answered your own question. The governments are the conspirators although I'm sure some heads of state might not be aware of what the intricacies are.
realistically, French prime minister would have been an easy target but he was never in any danger. Near enough for the danger to be percieved however, thus reflecting that it COULD happen. 
Sooner or later the truth will hopefully surface, let's just hope we don't all self destruct before it does.

       Not in my book. You should put yourself in their shoes. The Israelis took their land and are murdering their people, their children, and on top of that rip their organs out to sell them. You can not imagine the intense anger that would make you feel. These are
       <strong>
        ISRAELI SOLDIERS

       doing this. You should
       <em>

       look at them, the instigators, before you try to label the Palestinian as extremists or terrorists. That's fucking despicable to ignore the oppressive genocidal Israeli goverment and then have the nerve to call the Palestinians terrorists.

       Put fear in the public. If the public know only politicians and bankers are targets, only those professions family and friends would worry. If anyone can think, I could be in that attack. You can cause hysteria, panic and fear. Though all these traits equally benefit the government as much as it does any terrorist group.

       Because in order to generate raw fear you have to make it appear that ordinary people just like you and I are in danger. If you attack high-profile establishment figures, then these people are only semi-real anyway (i.e. you've only heard about them in the media and/or seen them on TV) so the psychological effect isn't as strong.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're basically trying to create the impression that it could be you or I.

       Cantor-Fitzgerald, one of the 22 dealer authorized to trade securities directly with the Fed lost 658 employees on 9/11.  Other banks were positioned below the impact points and lost considerably less.  Still, 658 from one of the top level securities trading companies alone.  TPTB didn't seem too concerned about killing them.

       THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL QUESTION AND IT IS VERY IMPORTANT !!!
I see many answers that show the technique at work.
Terrorists - actual terrorists - are not out to cause panic amongst the everyday you and I public.  I would say more actual terrorists are political.  IRA  - Irish terrorism for example.  Political and social and religious and historically motivated bombings.  Yes, indeed, everyday people were killed and/or injured in the troubles in Ireland between catholics and protestants etc etc but  - check this up - the IRA directly went for the English establishment - They attacked the whole Tory party conference and the Royal family members.  As I say, there are other times in public places but the lives of the public were more used as a tool to threaten the power people..not the same patterns as current events whatsoever.  Is worth researching.
       <br/>
       If you are so motivated , politically, you are not daft about your politics and power structures.
       <br/>
       The modern events have very little historical backbone , make no actual sense (hate us for our freedoms...ehm....fuck off) and seem to follow a pattern or have distinguishing copycat features (passports, drills, already being watched or otherwise involved with the intelligence agencies etc etc etc ).  Think about it - a bona fide terrorist would THRIVE on the element of surprise - not follow a checklist.
      </p>
      <p>
       It really is a terrible big lot of shite we are being told - Most of our authorities have been , more or less, sold out or infiltrated by people who - honestly - are fucking ruthless, have not an iota of care at all about us or our people getting blown to smithereens , at home or in foreign places , they control the governments, the media , the military, education, they want more control of this - me, writing to you - the internet is a nightmare to them.  The more you study power systems and how they actually think and their histories and blood stained wealth accumulation stories and less and less the tactics work on your fear and bewilderment.  xx
One last thing, use this tool of the net for all it is worth and run in the opposite direction from mainstream tv and news and don't just go along with what the majority are going along with, because they are trusting people who probably never deserved our trust in the first place.  History shouts loud and clear - question your authorities!!!  If doing so makes you a freakzoid tinfoiler , so be it.  If you hate tinfoilers, fuck off our reddit .  ok nuff said

       I may get down voted for this but a thought just occurred to me.  We were labeled as terrorists or more to the point, enemies without morals during the revolutionary war because we chose to fight with gorilla tactics.  Hiding in trees and such.  We did not fight using the established rules of war.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people are inflicting the most damage they can in the only way they can.  They cannot attack our military bases.  They cannot attack our leaders.  They attack us.  As purely an academic thought, is this the new face of war?  If your not a super power and don't have a military, how would you fight a war against a super power?  I am guessing it would look a lot like this.

       Our Revolutionary war was nothing like this. I do not want to go on explaining why, there are hundreds if not thousands of freely available, online books and documentation (many if not most written during that time of Revolution and before and after) that explain the reasons. To think our patriots blew up people NOT involved in the war, and surreptitiously going in and just killing random civilians?? No- not in ANY way the same. No comparison whatsoever, please God just read! and I'm not being facetious, I'm serious.

       My point that your missing is that we were considered not honorable because we fought in ways that were not accepted.  The same that these terrorists are doing now.  They don't have standing armies to be able to attack military targets.  They are fighting in the only way they know how.  Your completely missing my point here.  I am not advocating what they are doing.  I am merely having a conversation about the nature of war.

       First, leaders can be replaced. It's not like if you killed the president that we wouldn't elect a new one, or as emergency procedures have it, he's replaced by the vice president or speaker of the house. Very few countries in the west still have kings or queens. This is one of the reasons that conspiracy theories are a complete joke. If there are puppet masters behind the scenes pulling the strings then any puppet will do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, Islamic militants consider everyone that doesn't believe the same things they do to be the enemy. Killing Joe Schmo on teh street is just as important as killing a political leader. Every infidel put in a body bag to them is a win. Seriously though, with CEOs and world leaders infinitely replaceable through already established law, what importance would one guy, no matter how talented be?
      </p>
      <p>
       Third: yeah, they do target these kinds of people. 9/11 they toppled the Twin Towers, a very important financial symbol and hub in the west. Another plane hit the pentagon. Charlie Hebdo prints cartoons critical of their religion and they attack them. These guys also can't stand themselves some jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last and not least, they'd love to kill everyone in Israel. The fact of the matter just remains that Israel and western militaries are so much stronger than them that they'd instantly be defeated in open battle.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just an enemy that has cartoonish black and white beliefs and is very determined to kill people. Like, spending every waking moment thinking about how to murder someone determined.

       You are assuming none of these killed people are muslims. There has been a confirmed dead Turkish girl in these Paris attacks recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are full of shit. Killing random people in the streets and theatres but not bothering to check their religious background? Yeah totally fits in with the idea of killing everyone that doesn't believe the same thing they do.
With this logic you are actually implying these terrorists do an in-depth check on the people they 'randomly' kill. Making sure that each and every one of them is not muslim. Unbelievable, the mental gymnastics you do.

       You're the sheep, dude. Do a little research on what these animals believe.  They kill themselves in these attacks, and consider it a great honor.  If other "righteous Muslims" are collateral damage in their attacks, their sacrifice is in the service of a greater good.  That's what they believe, and how they justify killing innocent Muslims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the Pakistani school attack in Peshawar last December.  Over 100 girls killed--all Muslims, by radical Muslims.  You going to say that was a false flag too?

       Dumb motherfuckers exist in every group, country or culture. But as you can see, those are always in the extreme minority, so are these radical muslims.

       Just ask yourself, who's easier to find? You can't necessarily just run into a specific person easily. After that, it's hard to take out someone who is usually protected.  Random people are the opposite, they are easy to find and completely unprotected. And if the goal of your attacks is widespread terror, killing randomly will accomplish that more effectively than killing a someone who's important.  It's not a conspiracy I don't think, just a matter of ease

       Quite literally, the term "brass" refers to the fact that officers have pins made out of brass (or at least did when the term came into favor, I can't say for sure what they are made out of now).
      </p>
      <p>
       But anyway, I thought I had edited. The highest rank was actually a Lt Colonel, not Captain. Although, you still wouldn't consider that high enough, I imagine.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, that being said, they did fly a plane into the Pentagon on 9/11. So who got shot at Ft Hood doesn't really change the fact high level military personnel were, in fact, targeted.

       Within the military "brass" always means the big bosses, even junior officers use this term to refer to their superiors. An O-3 would never be referred to as "brass".

       They are terrorists because they are committing terrorism. In the United States the term 'terrorism' means premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents. If they were doing something like assassinations, they'd be assassins.
