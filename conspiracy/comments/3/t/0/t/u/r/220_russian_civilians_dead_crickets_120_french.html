    <div class="md"><p>Selective empathy is no excuse in our global, connected world. Whether you like it or not, we&#39;re all a few clicks away from being able to see these atrocities firsthand. It&#39;s truly no different than the systematic extermination of so many races of people by fascist Nazi Germany -- at least some German citizens had the excuse of being unaware of the crimes being perpetrated in their name at the time. There is no excuse for the modern world -- the evidence is just a touchscreen tap away.</p>

<p>I feel worse for the innocent people of the Middle East than I do for the recent French casualties. GASP! Why? Because France <em>chose</em> war with Syria. Nothing forced them to get involved, except the greedy hands of the military industrial complex and the will of global policy makers. </p>

<p>Ultimately, the French should have been better prepared for this, because <em>they</em> chose to get involved in a sovereign nation&#39;s civil war. As much as I hate violence among <em>any</em> people, it isn&#39;t hard to see that this is a consequence of reaping what they&#39;ve sown. They can call it terrorism all they want, but it isn&#39;t -- it was an infiltrated military response from the very people they&#39;ve been attacking for weeks. It&#39;s naivete at its finest to think you can strategically bomb a nation, and not expect a response from those you&#39;re hostile against. That in no way justifies the actions or killing by either side, it&#39;s just a stone cold fact of warfare. We&#39;ve been insulated from the real impact of war for so long that it shocks the world when it reaches our shores, when in actuality these things should be expected <em>until we stay out of conflicts that have nothing to do with us</em>. Through painful events like these, the peoples of the Earth will be forced to take responsibility for the violent actions of their leaders if we have any hope of ever living in a peaceful world.   </p>

<p>I&#39;m so sick and tired of the constant war, fear, lies, spin, and senseless death I could fucking puke.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>so being mentally colonised isn&#39;t a thing for you? You&#39;re over simplifying everything by saying we are &quot;hardwired&quot; for tribal life. I don&#39;t give a fuck about french because of the same reasons as HTSMetal, because we understand (a little more than the media consuming people) what&#39;s going on. The majority of people don&#39;t, they just listen to what media tells them, so if media tells them to feel sorry for french people, they obey. My country doesn&#39;t have a connection to the french in anything but an embassy. Yet in here a lot of people gave a fuck about the &quot;terrorist&quot; attack. Why? we don&#39;t have anything &quot;tribal&quot; to connect us to them, we are not even their skin color. It&#39;s colonisation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What scares me the most is the even very smart people here in the U.S. are being taken in by the relentless FOX propaganda machine. I know too many people that aren&#39;t exactly put off at the idea of &quot;kill them all&quot; including most people outside of the USA and the minorities within it. For instance, we are constantly being told how bad Iran, Russia and China are, with a sense that war is inevitable with them. And there is a quiet undercurrent of racism here that ironically is being fed in part by a constant barrage of hyper-antiracism on liberal media channels. It may take some years yet, but it is feeling more and more like a powder keg. Anyone else get that sense of things?</p>

<p>No one draped the Russian flag colors for the 220 Russians who were killed by an apparent on-board bomb. </p>

<p>Selective reasoning I guess. Terrorism is created when people are oppressed, angry, or want revenge. America&#39;s constant interference in the Middle East created this current chaos, and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/civilian-deaths-drone-strikes_561fafe2e4b028dd7ea6c4ff"><strong>what do you think is going to happen when nearly 90% of people killed in drone bombings/attacks were not the intended target!?</strong></a> </p>

<p>Yeah, you&#39;re going to get a lot of angry &amp; vengeful &quot;terrorists&quot; who have nothing else to lose since they either saw their mom, dad, daughter, son, grandparents, etc. all blown-up to pieces, or saw what was left of them after a drone attack.

<p>What are they supposed to do? They don&#39;t control FB and the mainstream world media. They can&#39;t press the panic button and have the whole world change their profile pick like Western countries can. There were many acknowledgements of the tragedy in Russia and it was obviously the biggest story there for weeks (my wife is Russian and was in contact with her family there throughout). </p>

<blockquote>

<p>They don&#39;t want to escalate. Russia wouldn&#39;t even be in Syria Assad wasn&#39;t their very last resort. When Russia went into Syria, it seemed desperate to me (even though Putin puts on a good show). They know that any kind of major war would absolutely wreck Russia. (It will wreck us too but our leaders are too arrogant to give a fuck). When the plane tragedy happened, I&#39;m sure Russian intel had more info on it than anyone in public could be allowed to know but what can they do about it? Not much. </p>

<p>It&#39;s scary though, feels like we&#39;re on the precipice of ww3.</p>

<p>Quite the dick move if you ask me. It also paints a clear picture of the manifold diplomatic failures of the current administration. Pathetic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the Russians who died were Russians. Russia isnt in the most respected position right now in the world. After the mess in crimea, which is still happening, most countries dont care for them. Plus, it was a plane that went down. Planes going down is becoming very common, which means it wont garner those billions of clicks that websites are wanting.</p>

<p>Not saying its right, it isnt, but this is the explanation.</p>

<p>Frances terror attack on friday was a BFD, one of the worst terrorist attacks in a first world country of its kind. Usually its just bombs, this time it was bombs AND gunmen. Both events were horrible, but it really shouldnt surprise anyone that they were covered how they were. But, according to ISIS, Russia is next. We&#39;ll see. Hopefully the Russians can stop it before it happens. They definitely dont take this kind of shit lightly. If it does happen, hopefully the media wont pass it on just because its Russia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find the happenings with the Russian plane that was downed a couple weeks ago and killed 220 innocent civilians very sad, but as a Dutch citizen, I feel like this is nothing more but karma for Russia after they backed the eastern part of Ukraine who downed the MH17 flight and killed nearly 300 innocent people from my country in July last year.</p>

<p>I know people who have lost friends, colleagues and family members during the downing of MH17.</p>

<p>May the victims of the Russian plane rest in peace, but don&#39;t expect me or my country to talk about it in the news after what they&#39;ve done to us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s propaganda or not. Fact is nearly 300 people died in a plane that was downed in a part of Ukraine that was backed by Russia. Doesn&#39;t matter if they meant to do so or not. Fact is 220 people died in a Russian plane that was downed a little over a year later. Russia didn&#39;t care about our plane and citizens being killed, so why should we (Dutch people and media) care about theirs?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What your portraying are classic symptoms of statism, &quot;Us against them&quot;, and a nationalistic mindset. That had its place in the 20thh Century but look what it has brought? A world, divided; while so seemingly close to brotherhood. Here we are still fighting. Is it only bad when it happens to your family? That is such a narrow mindset. Never mind the Earth, it&#39;s flora and fauna, and the unified human spirit we all should be working to uplift. </p>
