       The Germans also intercepted a vehicle loaded with guns and explosives 10 days before the attack. It's GPS was set to Paris. Washington needs to be on high alert especially with Black Friday so close, no better way to attack our economy than on the busiest day of the year. Then less people will turn out on Black Friday for years to come.

       'Attack our economy'? The wasteful shopping that ramps up this time of the year is nothing but a part of the circus. The eCONomy is banking frauds, MIC, and resource extraction, with a dash of hollywierd. People not shopping would be one of the few ways we might be able to build an actual working economy.

       This is a good plan for actual terrorists.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a false flag, though? I doubt it will happen. Our corporate masters wouldn't be too pleased about losing their 4th quarter profits and receiving smaller year-end bonuses. Too much of US retail is already dependent upon the holiday season, so I'm not convinced that they're willing to burn that bridge just yet.

       Of course - the easiest soft target is a shopping mall.  Lots of people to kill plus it'll cause people to stop going out shopping for a long time.  Immediate physical damage plus longer-term economic damage.  I just wonder why it hasn't happened yet...

       Well if only those pesky companies would just turn over the encryption keys, I'm sure they would have prevented this from happening.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell said in an interview on CBS' Face the Nation on Sunday, "I think what we're going to learn is that these guys are communicating via these encrypted apps, this commercial encryption which is very difficult or nearly impossible for governments to break, and the producers of which don't produce the keys necessary for law enforcement to read the encrypted messages."

       I think the CIA claiming encryptions are hard or impossible to crack has 2 end-goals:
      </p>
      <p>
       1.To create the illusion that people have means of 'safety'. That encryptions are supposedly a way of keeping your documents and files safe from anyone, even the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "When you surround an army, leave an outlet free. Do not press a desperate foe too hard."
       </em>
       ~ Sun Tzu, The Art of War
      </p>
      <p>
       Explanation for the quote:
       <em>
        To make him believe that there is a road to safety, and thus prevent his fighting with the courage of despair. After that, you may crush him.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       2.Use this claim to justify implementing more privacy-invading laws.

       Except most of our encryption is open source and millions of eyes have seen every line of code.

       Even Snowdon says we can "trust the math"
      </p>

       That said, the terrorists have been using encryption all along - long before the regular normal "we" started too (besides built-ins) such as ssl or tls.

       Additionally, actual prism "records" have been shown and sure as shit, whenever otr or gpg was used, those parts of the record were listed as encrypted, unable to be decrypted.

       It's
       <em>
        highly probable
       </em>
       that they will stage a terrorist attack on American soil in the near future. It has been a long enough time since 9/11 and the American public has mellowed out way too much over terrorism and Islam. This is unacceptable. So America needs another beating to re-ignite the
       <strong>
        fear
       </strong>
       and
       <strong>
        hate
       </strong>
       and
       <strong>
        war-lust
       </strong>
       against muslims and Islam.

       They didn't produce evidence that this Reserve Army base's weapons were locked up to the standards recommended in the document they did produce.  Two does not equal five.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've heard a lot of conflicting stuff about it. That the silent alarms didn't go off because of ongoing construction. That the silent alarms did go off and base was set on alert but the burglar burgled them all the same. I read that the burglar burgled them through the ceiling and also that the burglar was a light skinned fellow about 5'8" in a red jacket driving a dark blue BMW.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've also seen similar stories from people all across the military about how multi-layered the security protocols are for weapons lockers. And I've read that these kinds of burglaries are few and far in between.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'm led to conclude that OP isn't completely full of shit. I still don't believe them when they say
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Believe me when I tell you this. NO ONE stole weapons from a U.S. Military Armory
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Because while I also don't believe the FBI when they say that someone stole weapons from a military arms base, and while I don't  believe the "military officials" when they say "a burglary of this kind is reported to be a first for the Army's 5,000 stand-alone armories." This guy's theory starts making a lot of sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because really, belief is stupidity. I weigh my options before coming to conclusions based off of government documents, protocols, officials, experts, propagandists, and mercenaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all a fucking lie.

       Just a shot in the dark, but maybe in Chicago? I thought it was weird that they started coming up with these shows like Chicago PD and Chicago Fire and now Chicago MD, all seemingly right after another. Maybe a way to get a vast majority of people to find a new place in their hearts for Chicago and be more inclined to feel angry that something happened there, even if not being a native or even visiting.

       Alternatively, and more sensibly, it could be that the fucking network execs decided that they wanted to do their own version of CSI, NCIS, Law and Order, etc with another series with a billion spinoffs. They did what any (network) executives do, take a successful show, spin it off as much as possible for many times the profit.

       Why wouldn't they just rob a freaking gun store? Hell in Kentucky we can buy rail guns, rocket launchers, .50 cals, whatever at Knob Creek . We keep the Patriots battle ready so they can maintain their minute man status. They got some semi auto rifles and some 9mm they sell at Walmart.  Who cares

       I got friends who wont come up to Detroit on Thanksgiving because they fear an attack will happen at the Lions game. Michigan has the 2nd largest Muslim population in the US.

      <p>
       I see it as ISIS wants to bring about the end of the world via a clash of Islam vs Christianity/Western World. These attacks on Russia and now France are too bring the other powers into the fight. ISIS WANTS the world to end. They plan these attacks with an agenda, not randomly. Imo, the US, UK, China, Israel, or Germany could be next. Maybe even Canada.
With Al qaeda it was more political but with ISIS it's strictly religious.

       They want the World to end in a biblical showdown/battle of apocalyptic proportions and their goals and actions are made to accomplish that.

       They don't need to smuggle in a bunch of guns into the USA.  All they have to do is go to a local Walmart for all their ammo and guns.  Shit, they can go buy a bunch of armor piercing rounds and AK47s at Billy Bobs Gunoporium.  He's got everything a person would need to successfully take down some "Elk" and "Deer".

       You try to shoot up anything in America (that isn't full of children in "gun free zones"), and you get end up riddled with bullets before the first 911 call goes out.

       I don't own a gun. I never want to own a gun. The only time I have ever seen a gun was when it was stuck in my face during a robbery.

       But this is the problem, no?  We are talking about terrorists using our own guns on us, but at the same time most of the atrocious acts of gun violence in this country (Columbine, Sandy Hook, Charleston) were done by people who bought ammo and guns at Walmart.  Our own people have committed more "terrorism" on US soil than IS.

       I never said we need 100% gun control like France.   What I am saying is putting vending machines on every corner for everyone to arm themselves is not the answer either.  You guys are making it sound like we need to pass laws which require every single citizen to carry a gun.  That will make us super safe.  Like the dudes who brought guns to movie theaters after the Aurora shooting.  You had people pulling guns on each-other in theaters for weeks.

       LOL, they don't sell AR's in Walmart's and haven't for a while now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Armor Piercing rounds are regulated by the government. Steel core does not mean "armor piercing" try youtube for some examples.
      </p>
      <p>
       The majority of "armor piercing" ammo is M43 Ball and the tip is steel and was only used because it's cheaper than lead (Hazardous Material).
      </p>
      <p>
       I could see someone try and say Russian ammo is armor piercing since they mostly rely on steel core rounds but of course that would be a straight faced lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as for your local gun dealer those "AK47's" are all semiautomatic. Just like the John Browning 1918 hunting rifles on the shelf over which happen to be allot more effective at killing any size targets.

       bullshit. it won't be "full auto", it will totally run away until it jams or runs out of ammo.

       that's not FULL AUTO, that's a malfunctioning rifle.

       Total and utter bullshit. You better have a history in gunsmithing cause I'm an avid gun owner and shooter and I at least know wtf I'm talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, some firearms can fairly easily be turned full auto. At the cost of structural integrity to the fire group. AKA expect it to only pull off a few magazines before your sear/trigger kick the bucket due to being tapered with.

       And your point is well pointless. Google Bump Fire. Enjoy the free heart attack. And then hit up this site to really hammer you 6 feet under

      <p>
       But lets focus on trivial things like automatics which haven't been used in mass shooting in the US ever. The closest would be the North Hollywood Shootout. And we know how well that went for the criminals.

       "Bump firing is great, if your a dumb ass that doesn't aim at his target." Same with your twerked auto. The thing will not stop firing until the clip is dry. And that link clearly shows you can put rounds on target while bump firing. Hell I've seen kids pull some very accurate bump firing...

       'Attack our economy'? The wasteful shopping that ramps up this time of the year is nothing but a part of the circus. The eCONomy is banking frauds, MIC, and resource extraction, with a dash of hollywierd. People not shopping would be one of the few ways we might be able to build an actual working economy.

       Of course - the easiest soft target is a shopping mall.  Lots of people to kill plus it'll cause people to stop going out shopping for a long time.  Immediate physical damage plus longer-term economic damage.  I just wonder why it hasn't happened yet...

       This is a good plan for actual terrorists.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a false flag, though? I doubt it will happen. Our corporate masters wouldn't be too pleased about losing their 4th quarter profits and receiving smaller year-end bonuses. Too much of US retail is already dependent upon the holiday season, so I'm not convinced that they're willing to burn that bridge just yet.

       I never said we need 100% gun control like France.   What I am saying is putting vending machines on every corner for everyone to arm themselves is not the answer either.  You guys are making it sound like we need to pass laws which require every single citizen to carry a gun.  That will make us super safe.  Like the dudes who brought guns to movie theaters after the Aurora shooting.  You had people pulling guns on each-other in theaters for weeks.
