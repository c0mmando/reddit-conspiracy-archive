       I'm not saying this was a hoax but...where are the bloody footprints? The smear marks, I assume, were made by dragging bleeding people out. Would that happen while the terrorists were shooting? And once Emergency responders got in, they'd be putting people on stretchers and there'd be parallel lines in the blood. Which there aren't.
      </p>
      <p>
       But where are the bloody footprints? As people were shot and fell there'd be other desperate people stepping around them or even on them, stepping in blood, trying to get out. So where are the bloody footprints? I don't understand.

       There is at least two sets of bloody footprints in that photo. See the

       blonde chick? with the white shirt and jeans? Look to the left of her. There's a line of tracks leading nearly to the exit, stage left. See the.. black chick? red shirt, right side, bottom cluster of bodies? Look up and right from her and you'll see more.

       It's not like the movies or Dexter. Blood doesn't leave huge, bright, easy to follow prints if you step in it. It wipes off quick after the first few steps
       <em>
        if it's wet
       </em>
       and leaves sticky little footprints that don't show up well on camera unless you're close. If it's beginning to coagulate, you either don't pick up much, or what you do pick up doesn't leave much of a trail.
      </p>

       See the S-shaped blood drag trail, left side, by that opening in the gates, below the dead guy with the gray/dark blue long sleeve and jeans? From about the middle of that S leading left to right, to near the feet of the blonde chick with the white shirt and jeans, is a series of footprints. More, likewise, where I said above the chick with the red shirt on the metal flooring.

       Also the bodies look like they are lying where they fell. How is it possible to kill the people at the front row and have the bullets go through everyone else?

       Gun training 101. If you shoot for self defense, use hollow points so the bullets won't go through and hit someone else. These guys here are looking for damage, their most likely using standard rounds.

       So that implies that the bullets did go through everyone else to get to the front row? How many bodies would it take to slow down a bullet? What I can't get my head around is this; if they shot from the back, and there were people injured in the crowd, where is the evidence of all the other people (around 100/200, depending on how many standing people that venue can hold) struggling to escape? where are the skid marks from people running through the blood. I read an article that stated that everyone threw themselves to the floor, so where are the signs of that happening?

       An ak47 uses 7.62 ammo, i assume this is what they used as it's their normal weapon of choice. something like that i would assume would go through 2 people. stop on the second. i've never shot an ak, so i'm not sure. so yes, it went through a few people.
       <em>
        EDIT
       </em>
       Especially at point blank range like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       after the first several gun shots, people would already be running and screaming. yes, there'd already be blood. but the way you're describing it, i think i see blood pouring out a lot quicker than it actually does. that means there wouldn't be skid marks from people running over other pools of blood because pooling takes a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       as for people throwing themselves on the ground, maybe some did. but i think it'd be a safe bet that they are some of the ones who ended up getting shot.

       Well...here's an interesting video, just for a reference
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6RVuISLJ3o&amp;amp;feature=iv&amp;amp;src_vid=qbZfxleCa64&amp;amp;annotation_id=annotation_2596737665">

       Let's say it went through three people, from the back of the cinema, and let's say it was from some distance (doesn't matter how much distance). There would definitely be blood splatter on the clothing at least, and probably a great deal of is. I understand that it probably wouldn't run out like some crazy japanese horror film, but with a venue that initially was packed by people you would expact it to get everywhere as blood is quite oily too; thick. It would spread everywhere. The video i linked was with soft pointed bullets, so we are assuming that they did only use that type. It would have been even more of a mess if they had used hollow points.

       if there were a few hundred people, blood got onto many people around the victims as well. however, a spatter of blood will only really come out of the back of whatever the bullet is exiting. even with that, a clean entry and exit wound wouldn't give much spatter in the first place. you can see where the bullets entered several people, and in the first group (closest to us) even has a mixed pool of blood running down towards the stairs. all of the people who look like they were in the front row have some pretty big pools directly around them showing they were killed right where they stood and dropped.
p.s  source on all this, studying some forensic investigation in school.

       Each of those dead bodies have been photographed from the angle where the bullets entered the body, so naturally the exit wounds are not visible, all just a coincidence. They all fell down with the bullet entry facing the camera.

       The blood patterns show that the group closest to the camera were shot first. Once that happened, everyone ran for the door and got shot while leaving. You can see some footprints leading from the close group to the door. As people piled up on the way out, they were dragged back in and walked on top of the blood trail back to the door and left.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm guessing they came in through a side entrance or somewhere backstage then proceeded towards the front entrance.

       Well, obviously once the initial tracks were smeared by the dragging of the bodies they would be rendered indistinguishable from the general oozieness of the scene.  Seeing as this grotesque happening unfolded at a death metal concert, the first responders would rightly expect the place to be dripping with the body piercing, tattoo and intravenous drug use borne diseases like hepatitis C, AIDS, and other ailments enthusiastically transmitted by such degenerates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Naturally then, said first responders would have made every effort to avoid stepping-in or rolling their stretchers through any of the drippy disease puddles on the floor.

       You've obviously never massaged a man's heart with your bare hands as he lie convulsing to death in your arms.
