       What are they going to do? Deny they lack those powers? No, power is not just what you can do, but what your adversary thinks you can do. It's like telling your poker opponent you don't have the nuts. You're always more likely to win when your antagonist chooses not to showdown and leaves the pot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Snowden is giving power to the NSA that they don't necessarily have to have.

       Snowden is part of the machine designed to disseminate information to the masses about
       <em>
        how much
       </em>
       power the NSA actually has.  After all, how are the masses going to know about and be appropriately scared of Big Brother if BB's surveillance powers are
       <em>
        so huge
       </em>
       that the citizenry aren't even aware that they exists in the first place?
      </p>
      <p>
       Gotta
       <em>
        make
       </em>
       them aware of it; gotta make sure the plebs know just how big and bad and powerful TPTB are.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you gotta have a patsy spokesperson for that...one that seems authentic and believable...that reveals enough to scare everyone, but that doesn't really reveal anything that wasn't actually available in the MSM already all along.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enter Eddy Snowboy making sure the American people know
       <em>
        all about
       </em>
       the NSA's abilities (or as much as the NSA wants the plebs to know anyway) - powers that were already talked about throughout the MSM for years but that were leaked and sprinkled so sporadically that the 99% didn't actually put two and two together on it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gotta have
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       central figure that can spill
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       the Limited Hangout beans in one fell swoop so that
       <em>
        NOW
       </em>
       the population will go "O_oh shit!  You mean the NSA can do all
       <em>
        that??
       </em>
       Now I'm scared!"
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "Yes, citizen.  Be afraid.  Be very afraid!  Edward Snowden told you so!"
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact of the matter is that both Snowden and Assange seem more like cointelpro than anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       freedom fighter?  The
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       figure that had the
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       bravery that each and every citizen should have?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah.  That citizen is currently rotting in fucking prison.  Key's are thrown away.  Almost complete MSM blackout w/scarcely
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       real information out about them except for a questionable (and
       <em>
        extremely
       </em>
       marginalizing) storyline about their being a crossdressing transexual.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, the two other figures get the full on hero treatment with movies made about them extolling upon "their great virtues and their great love of freedom!" and get serious MSM and independent media bombardment blasted out to the masses.

       Even if you're correct (which I don't think you are) I think it's a LOT more important to think your enemy has great capabilities when they don't, than to think they have NO capabilities when they

       You're talking about the lower levels of the surveillance state, however.  The deeper - "deep black project" - levels? can likely do everything Snowden's talked about and much more.

       Why do you believe that? Those aren't the only 2 options. The only options you've left yourself are to be wrong or to be wrong. You're limiting your reasoning.  That is to say you're limiting your understanding and more importantly, your actions.

       Surely possible, I've had similar thoughts myself.  I just find it more likely that he's limited hangout in this case because (among other reasons) technology these days is already pretty damn advanced in the public sector, so I can only imagine where they're at in the secret private sector.

       My main thing is that nobody gets so much MSM attention without certain powers approving of it.  Where was Bradley Manning's primetime interview with Brian Williams?  Where was Bradley Manning's primetime interview with John Oliver?  We've still only seen at best around 5% of the total documents almost 2 years later, nothing at all has changed with regards to NSA policies, no one has really been fired or punished, most people are completely apathetic to the NSA and its capabilities, does it get much more limited than that?

       Good question, and I can see the value in both.  It's my opinion that the private/military/intelligence sector is years, perhaps decades ahead in terms of technology when compared to what you and I have access to.  This is based on a lot of things but one example would be the evidence of certain technologies and knowledge being hidden and suppressed over the years.  Here I speak of people like Tesla, TT Brown, Wilhelm Reich, Ed Leedskalnin, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So perhaps I am extrapolating a bit here but I'm doing so based on my perception of the "big picture" so to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other reason is that very few of the documents have been released like I noted before.  Now of course they could all be totally bogus if your theory is correct, but if they're legitimate then right there we're seeing an obvious example of a limited release.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the NSA facility in Utah uses a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of water.  I guess that could all be faked too though.
      </p>
      <p>
       But above all, don't you think that the NSA's tech would have to be more advanced than what you or I can buy?  Do you have reason to suspect it isn't?  If so, how would that work?  You think the NSA is going to the Apple store and buying an iMac?  They're obviously sparing no expense and have a lot of smart people working for them along with many decades of top secret research to base their tech on.  How would they
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       be more advanced, even if only slightly?  And if they are more advanced, then what form would that take?
      </p>
      <p>
       It isn't like some of the things suggested in the leaks are too outrageous, a lot of it just involves building backdoors into the infrastructure and hardware.  We already know things like remotely hacking cars was possible years ago and if we assume, as I do, that the NSA's tech is more advanced then ours then we can assume, as I do, that capabilities like this and more are now available to them.

      <p>
       Perhaps, and this is the angle I've thought about before.  I do think it's possible, don't get me wrong.  But like I said before, the NSA pretty much has to have better tech than we do - it certainly isn't any worse - and they also have the funding, the law, and the government on their side, as well as decades of secret research.  I'm just weighing probabilities from my own perspective.

      <p>
       So it's two years later, everyone knows we're literally paying the NSA to spy on us, they're
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       doing exactly what they were doing before (and now with our implicit consent), the slow trickle of leaks means most have lost interest in the subject, we haven't been told anything others weren't saying decades ago, no one has been fired, people are self-censoring themselves because "the NSA is watching", and it's now out in the open that the NSA probably has dirt on everyone (including politicians, millionaires, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
       Granted, all of this would still be valid if your theory of them lying about their capabilities is correct, but from where I'm sitting they've certainly gained power in the last 2 years.  I mean, what power is it you think they've lost?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll give you an example: in my office at work, we were just given cameras to attach to our computers for webcam conferences.  Everyone in my group has a post-it note stuck to theirs to block the camera to "thwart the NSA".  Two years ago this
       <em>
        would not
       </em>
       have happened.  So how can anyone say they've lost power?

       Yes, but it doesn't have to be geared toward collecting dick pics or even toward individuals on the internet. It can be a bank of supercomputers that do anything but when the need for quelling online organization of ne'er-do-wells became necessary Snowden comes out and says 'oh, yeah the NSA can totally see all your shit.' But they've never stopped a thing their pals at the FBI weren't already all over.
      </p>

       Meanwhile they can be intercepting trade requests from Wall Street and going balls out with HFT schemes or simulating political scenarios over time with hundreds of variables to optimize the game.

      <p>
       So Snowden can be limited hangout on 1 issue, inflated on another and a red herring toward the whole thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is, it's ok to be unsure and dwell in the doubt. The conclusions are less important than the process because once you solve it you stop investigating and start advocating your conclusion. You don't, and in fact shouldn't sell me your conclusion, you should sell yourself the doubt. That's what I'm here for, to break the thinking away from one widely accepted conclusion so as to once again investigate instead of advocate.

       NASA has the capability to do the same thing, as do Google and any number of other bodies. Why is capability equated to mission? Because they
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       doesn't mean they
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The NSA would have to have the ability to hold the entire internet in it's own tubes for there to be more than Snowden is suggesting. I don't think they have that. I think they, like in every other department of government, have wasted money and been swindled and lack any real capability anywhere approaching what the perception would indicate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your position is different and your reasoning is solely, 'they have to have better tech'. No they don't. They might, but it certainly isn't a foregone conclusion based on forward deductive reason. If you reason backward from 'Holy Fuck the govrnment is omnipotent and not at all a boondoggle or waste of money and is perfectly managed" then you can corroborate your reasoning. I have never seen such a finely tuned government machine that isn't a killing machine. The propaganda comes close and the info we get is 3 moves behind. We get a guy who leaks some slides and we think we've gained a step. But we only examine 2 layers of the information so far.

         He's not saying anything we haven't heard before, except now I put paper over internet capable cameras. The NSA has much more power than they let on, so they released 2% of the information that has had a chilling effect on the very information they can presumably keep, hold and examine. Which basically means they get corrupted communications from people trying to foil them, they get less personal information that they would have gotten otherwise - the data pool is tainted and untrustworthy

       Now 3. The NSA is a boondoggle that overstates it's capability to make the people feel safer from threats of attack, justifies it's budget and existence, is spending it's money efficiently and effectively albeit fuckedupedly, and scaring evildoers (including normal Americans who have a problem with the system) from congregating in groups using the greatest tool for the good of the people the world has ever known. It could be a proxy trading floor for manipulating the stock exchanges and funneling money to who knows where for all we know.

       spy on everyone and store their data, they're going to do it.  Groups like Google are clearly doing quite a bit of data-mining themselves though of course, so it is by no means exclusive to the NSA or any other single entity.

       Not necessarily.  I'm thinking more along the lines of details about 9/11, details about financial corruption or how these super-computers are used in HFT, details about pedophilia rings or corruption among the government/elite, details about rendition or assassinations, etc.  So the limited hangout would then be in which crimes they
       <em>
        don't
       </em>
       reveal as opposed to which ones they do (which have been "ruled constitutional" anyway and were made legal in secret courts and thus aren't even crimes by definition).

       I guess I'm just failing to grasp what makes you think they don't.  Decades of suppressed technologies and knowledge, decades of government funding and secret research, steady supply of people willing to dedicate themselves to the technology, full protection from the law, facilities all over the world, collusion with other governments and agencies.  What here tells you that they
       <em>
        don't
       </em>
       have better tech than the public sector?  Sure it's an assumption, but it seems to be an educated one.  Unless they're just sitting on their 2008 Windows Vista PC's and dicking around all day, but that strains credulity to me despite it being possible.

       They also get less dissent of any kind against the power structure from the populace and normalize the spying so that it becomes "just the way things are".  And now we have people specifically using TOR and other advanced encryption techniques in order to transmit important communications safely -
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       the NSA is very advanced then this gives them a really easy way to find out who is just "going with the flow" and who is trying to directly subvert them.  Perhaps another angle to consider.

       Definitely possible man, no doubt about it.  Like I said, I've given this some thought as well.

       However, have the Snowden revelations actually made anyone feel safer or have they bred fear and mistrust?  Have they justified its budget and existence or have they highlighted that neither are justified at all?  Have they scared evildoers or have they scared people like you and I (well, obviously not actually

       I've considered that this may all be related to some of the banker/HFT deaths that have occurred over the last year or so somehow but it's obviously speculative.  Certainly possible though, those hundreds of trillions of dollars of "value" in the derivatives markets are trickling into someone's pockets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately though you're right, none of us know for sure.  The only thing I'm nearly certain of is that Snowden isn't an altruistic everyman who "just wanted to do the right thing".  Beyond that I can only speculate on what I think is more likely and what I think is more likely is that the NSA, if not more technologically capable than Snowden has suggested, is at the very least concealing many worse crimes and documents.

       If you presume they possess secret technology you should presume Tor is compromised as well as encryption. That would be step 1. If you believe what they're telling you, you believe encryption will protect you. If you believe the limited hangout, you believe there is nowhere to hide online.

       There's no way to know but i believe the effect would be greater than 0. No one is going to plot violent antigovernment activities on the internet, which would be the best possible tool to do it with. the internet has effectively been snatched away as an organizing tool for anything that is remotely pro-people, anti-status quo. Which is a tragedy. By the time the people get their courage back they'll be another generation of pacifists and government dependents and if any technological capability is lacking now, it will have caught up. But it won't matter, the window will have closed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having said that., there is always an element of the government that is an easy target. the vanquished. Yelling at the deceased and diseased old conservatives off the back of the steamroller is always in fashion and allowed.

       Like I said in my last post, perhaps it isn't the technology which is secret but the extent of their crimes and the extent of their involvement in covering up the crimes of various others.

       Here we are thinking they're jacking off to the nudes my girlfriend sent me or reading my e-mails to my Mom when really (whether they're actually doing any of that or not) they're aiding and abetting criminals (and are criminals themselves) while hiding behind the government, the limited Snowden leaks, and a veil of secrecy.

       Agreed, and those who are will probably use TOR or something like it, making them easy to spot
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       the NSA has the technology to break encryption.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the NSA doesn't have that technology then I'd wonder how much the leaks helped them since definitely more people are using TOR now than 2 years ago.  I'd be inclined to think that if TOR is compromised, it isn't the encryption itself but a backdoor somewhere being utilized which can probably be traced back to around when it was created.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is so much corruption and propaganda and deception in the world today though (and really always has been) that it wouldn't shock me if the NSA and Snowden were full of shit about their capabilities even though I lean the other way at present.  I don't know if it would be more funny or scary were that the case.

       No. It's pure reasoning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overstating the threat of a thing is usually done when describing an antagonist e.g. Saddam sought yellow cake, Iran is 6 weeks away from blowing Israel off the map.
      </p>
      <p>
       That could mean that blowback against the NSA or the government at large is the agenda of the Snowden op.

       Interesting. So when you say that blowback against the NSA or the government could be the agenda, does that imply that the Snowden op is being carried out by another entity other than the government? I certainly agree that it makes sense that Snowden could have been a planned thing. I read another theory that the goal was to normalize the idea of being watched by the government. The only thing that bothers me about it is the potential for outrage by the people.

       Yes, either a super-governmental body (or the true power inside government) or a subculture of revolutionaries who intend to reap power for sowing discord.

      <p>
       Whether true or not what it does for certain, on the surface, is convince the terrorists that they can't organize or they will be discovered and guantanamo'd. But every good op serves double-duty, at least.

       Fomenting rebellion and/or making the case that the US government is a rogue state and needs NATO intervention would be the extreme example.

       I see. I kinda get what your saying as far as super-governmental body. Controlling both sides of the board sort of thing. I'm kinda new to all of this stuff, so you'll have to forgive me for not completely getting it. Discouraging terrorists from organizing makes a lot of sense. I have a hard time wrapping my head around the idea that exposing the government as a rogue state would somehow lead to tptb gaining more control, which I assume is the goal. Is the idea that the public is so subdued that they would never be pushed to the point of taking power back from tptb?

       Sure. Or, the idea would be to instigate the people into attempting to. It's the perfect catch-22. It's checkmate whichever decision you make.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since they're perfectly prepared for such a scenario it would effectively be a trap. Americans would take up arms against one another because that's just what would happen and before long we'd be unarmed from exhausting our stockpiles. Then we're wide open for foreign or NATO peacekeeping.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happens then is competing interests crop up in the turmoil created. Whoever is most prepared to lead after such a period would be given control. Like in East Berlin when the KPD stepped up. America would no longer be a 900 pound gorilla but part of a larger global scheme. Probably a communist scheme since the  globalists love that shit and people are becoming disenfranchised with the capitalist system.
