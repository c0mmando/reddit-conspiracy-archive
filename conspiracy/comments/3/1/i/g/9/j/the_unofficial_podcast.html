        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Many of you have messaged me and commented on your concerns regarding <a href="/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway">/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway</a> and <a href="/u/Flytape">/u/Flytape</a> submitting and stickying  <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/31dy9y/the_first_official_rconspiracy_podcast_is_now/">&quot;The First Official /r/Conspiracy Podcast is Now Live, With Flytape as Our First Guest&quot;</a> Without and input or opinion from the r/conspiracy community. </p>

<p>I understand many of these concerns myself and would like to assure our readers that the podcast is in no way a collaborated effort between the entire mod team, <a href="/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway">/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway</a> and <a href="/u/Flytape">/u/Flytape</a> acted on their own accord and this alone has left me disappointed and frustrated with their actions. All moderators and the community should have had input and opinion with something like this, that&#39;s the way new ideas have always been handled on the sub, that&#39;s how it will remain in future. </p>

<p>My own personal thoughts are that the podcast itself was clumsy, poorly edited and has only served to marginalize the sub and cause infighting on the page, this can&#39;t go on. Originally i removed the post yesterday when i first became aware of it (I&#39;m based in the UK so time-zones are always a factor with my responses.) The original message from myself to the rest of the mod team is <a href="http://i.imgur.com/j7jQSJv.jpg">here</a>. Again and with much disappointment on my part i have found the post has been re-approved by <a href="/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway">/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway</a> and is still active and live on r/conspiracy, much to the anger of many contributors and readers. </p>

<p>Images such as <a href="http://i.imgur.com/6ESTYuk.jpg">this</a> can in no way be viewed as helpful or representative of this sub, it certainly isn&#39;t representative of myself and i find this kind of behavior, even if supposedly for comedy value, distasteful and troubling. As to why the podcast itself had <a href="/u/Flytape">/u/Flytape</a> masquerading as some kind of extra from Eyes Wide Shut with the bizarre mask and background settings is beyond me, any rational person could see that this was going to backfire. The idea of the occasional podcast isn&#39;t a bad one, but i would never have agreed to one being presented in such a oddball manner, many of you have expressed the same obvious concerns. </p>

<p>Moderating is a caretaker roll, the moderators do not own the page and it is right and just that if any ideas or concepts are to be implemented onto a page with over a quarter of a million subscribers they should always have a say in those decisions. That has not been the case here for some unexplained reason. </p>

<p>I also find it disturbing that trusted contributors such as <a href="/u/WideAwakeNWO">/u/WideAwakeNWO</a> and <a href="/u/George_Tenet">/u/George_Tenet</a> have now been banned without fair warning by <a href="/u/Flytape">/u/Flytape</a>. </p>

<p>The current situation with the moderator team has become unworkable and as such <a href="/u/Flytape">/u/Flytape</a> has been removed from the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> moderator team.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He banned Wide and George over all that?  That&#39;s a bridge too far IMO, they weren&#39;t even the ones driving the controversy.  You might wan to check on at least 3rdeyenavigator (I think that&#39;s what it was) to see if they were banned too.  None of us knew it was done without discussion between the mods first, I would liked to have seen community discussion too, but I honestly don&#39;t care that much, some of you are far more hung up on the collective guilt nonsense than I am.  From my perspective this all smacked of another contrived controversy to depose mods here, but again I don&#39;t buy into the collective guilt trope, so the whole thing didn&#39;t offend me like it did others apparently.</p>

<p>Flytape using it as an excuse to ban wideawake and George (again) <em>is</em> offensive to me.</p>

<p>Also that image, it clearly came out in the threads, was this entire image, but the person who likely sent that to you was only sharing a partial, which made it seem even more contrived.</p>

<p>Back to the original topic: We at r/conspiracy know that there are accounts and users with the sole purpose of disrupting our community and trying to make us look ridiculous. Therefore account age and more importantly content is the only way we as regulars can tell if the user is serious or not. You can therefore understand why I cannot trust a 1 month old account telling us which mods need to be removed and making so much noise about something that is for the mods to discuss. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah neat. Not sure what you mean about straw man.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think an ama is quite the same as associating with a podcast that launched like this one did. :/</p>

<p>I like James Corbett and I like the idea of interacting with him, but I am trying to be somewhat realistic here. This video was silly. The mask, the production value, the boring meta-reddit content, the fact that it presented itself as <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>&#39;s official podcast without engaging the community or even the bulk of the mod team, the banning of the moderator, upvoted allegations that it was <em>intended</em> to make the sub look bad, etc. All of this makes it a series that any smart person would stay away from.</p>

<p>Now maybe if it were done right, either as an official podcast of the subreddit, or an official podcast of the moderator team as a whole, then with some quality episodes/productions then it would be something Corbett would be interested in engaging with. Right now though it is just a debacle,  unfortunately.</p>

<p>I could be wrong. I would enjoy the podcast much more if he were in it. Just saying that without changes and considerable increase in quality I don&#39;t see it happening with this particular podcast.</p>

<p>I never wanted a moderator who performed poorly. The community agreed he is an irresponsible person with bad judgement. </p>

<p>Stop explaining away this fact and please realize you&#39;re just rejecting the the basic truth: flytape was a terrible moderator   </p>

<p>I can assure you (from my point if view as someone who missed this whole thing until yesterday afternoon) that this really just paints specific users as being unprofessional, not really a sub-wide issue. </p>

<p>To me (at least) it didn&#39;t look like this was something officially sanctioned, and in the scheme of things, the dust will settle on this and in a few weeks you, I, and the rest of the users here can chuckle about what a silly idea it was.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to give a big thank you to Mr. Dong for his leadership on this issue.  I also want to apologize publicly to <a href="/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway">/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway</a>, <a href="/u/TheGhostOfDusty">/u/TheGhostOfDusty</a>,  and <del><a href="/u/FlyTape">/u/FlyTape</a></del>. It really is out of character for me to get so emotional over a post that I start to take it personally,  and then start attacking others personally, even when someone disagrees    To all of you guys,  please accept my sincere apologies.</p>

<p>In terms of the podcast, I really agree with Mr. Dong, that if it is going to have <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> in the name,  we all should get to have input into the format and content of the podcast,  which was really my biggest complaint from the beginning. </p>

<p>If AATA or FlyTape had stickied the post BEFORE the show,  with something like: Hey <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> I Want to Do a Weekly Podcast, What Would You Guys Like to See in it?  Or something to that effect,  and allowed everyone to give their insight and ideas into the project first,  I really think the end product would have been better for this community. </p>

<p>I was actually quite disturbed that I had been banned without any warning or notification by FlyTape,  and again
I wanted to say thank you to Mr. Dong for reversing it.  I will make it a point to really make sure from this point on not to get so emotional over a post again where it gets to the point of attacking others even if they&#39;ve attacked me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not certain that it is best to choose a defeatist attitude when trying out a new project like this. Stickying a post asking for topic suggestions and the like might have some bullshit trolls, but the benefit of having potentially more community input outweighs the cost of having some trolls or propagandists in the comments.</p>

<p>I agree with the opposition to witch hunting. When everyone is pointing fingers at other people, it just disrupts shit. Yeah it&#39;s plausible that people here are trying to intentionally disrupt stuff, and the best we can do is adopt civil and rational discussion on topics, focusing on the content and arguments rather than getting all rabid every other minute.</p>

I can assure you I was not &#39;concern trolling&#39;. The fact that the podcast purported to speak for this sub aside, it was shitty, poorly executed and embarrassing in its own right. 90% of the top posts here in the last month have been decrying mod abuse; that those 2 mods would pull this shit and then downplay the outrage of the community is fucked up. Mods are supposed to be trusted stewards of their subreddits, and represent the views of the subscribers. I liken this debacle to a crooked politician saying one thing to get elected and then doing whatever the fuck they want once in office. We can champion free speech all we like, but the <em>reality</em> is, if we aim to &#39;wake people up&#39;, then we need to be aware of how we present ourselves. Hitler snoo and a fucking dick-nosed gimp mask are not helpful. This was a stunt, pure and simple, and it&#39;s about fucking time <a href="/u/Flytape">/u/Flytape</a> was sent packing. How the fuck are we supposed to be taken seriously as a sub when our own mods are trolling us? If there&#39;s one thing I despise, it&#39;s smugness, and the attitude of <a href="/u/Flytape">/u/Flytape</a> in particular was exactly that: smug. Thank you, <a href="/u/mr_dong">/u/mr_dong</a>, for doing right by the users of this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you realize that the image you&#39;re referring to <a href="http://i.imgur.com/6ESTYuk.jpg">here</a> has been edited by those that are always trying to cause trouble in this sub? <a href="http://i.imgur.com/6ESTYuk.jpg">This is the original</a> which was discussed a bit <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/31hg4g/psa_for_intentionally_misrepresenting_rconspiracy/">here</a>. It was actually an image pointing to the Hitlerian attitudes of those at the #modtalk IRC channel.</p>

<p>I agree with the idea that the podcast should have been at least discussed with the mod team prior to posting it. It most certainly should have either been posted as regular link without being stickied or gotten the mod team&#39;s approval. </p>

<p>By the same token, you should have discussed Flytape&#39;s removal with the mod team. What&#39;s good for the goose...</p>

<p>I wholeheartedly disagree with removing Flytape as a mod. If it weren&#39;t for him we&#39;d be completely overrun with the anti-<a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> group. There are only a few of them but they&#39;ve got so many alt accounts that they make it look like there&#39;s way more of them than there actually are. Flytape is probably the best mod we have at spotting and removing those alts. It&#39;s the same group that&#39;s been trying to get mods removed ever since I&#39;ve been here and, sadly, they&#39;ve been successful in a few cases. Luckily, they haven&#39;t been successful in getting one of their own group installed as a mod... yet.</p>

<p>I have no problem with calling out Flytape and AATA and possibly even censuring them with a reduction in mod abilities for a period of time. I do have a problem with removing either of them. </p>

<p>Once again, I&#39;m quite disappointed that you&#39;ve fallen for the tactics of those that wish to subvert this sub. I&#39;m also a bit disappointed that some of our better, regular subscribers have fallen for them too.</p>

<p>Finally, this sub is likely the most controversial Reddit sub. We&#39;re used to it and we should embrace it. Controversy is good for this sub. It&#39;s probably one of the biggest reasons for our growth over the years. </p>

<p>That&#39;s all I have to say on the matter.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with his decision to ban you, but we&#39;ve all made mistakes, and I&#39;m certainly no exception. We just peoples. </p>

<p>I rarely ban users (maybe 3 or 4 ever), and a few times I&#39;ve banned folks that in retrospect was not the correct call and I admitted my error in judgment.</p>

<p>As someone who has incurred the wrath of the cancerous subs like SRD and conspiratard many times in the past, things can get really rough when these type of storms are a brewing. </p>

<p>That being said, only <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mods can see the sheer amount of work that actually goes on behind the scenes to make this place what it is (whether you like what &quot;it is&quot; or not). </p>

<p>Flytape worked his butt off for this sub, and I&#39;ve really seen it over the last couple years.</p>

<p>Just because we don&#39;t always see eye to eye doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t respect the work he&#39;s put into this place.</p>

<p>This entire incident has played precisely into the hands of those who get their shits and giggles out of sowing discord amongst the legitimately inquisitive and intelligent folks that actually do frequent this sub. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>See I&#39;m actually not convinced by this.</p>

<p>Some very suspicious users very vocally jumped on this bandwagon, and I&#39;m extremely suspicious of the way the voting has gone in all of these threads, especially compared to &quot;regular&quot; <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> threads. It&#39;s likely that an unprecedented amount of brigading has taken place.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry you were (very) temporarily banned, but I hope you realize that one moderator&#39;s mistake doesn&#39;t reflect the entire mod team (and the sub in general). </p>

<p>I also hope you realize that we should be allowed to make mistakes, as long as we learn from them.</p>

<p>If every <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mod was ousted after each mistake, we would never learn anything and the mod team would be full of inexperience. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve made quite a few mistakes in my time as a mod here, but I&#39;ve never made the same mistake twice. </p>

<p>We&#39;re all in this together.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t let them drive a wedge between us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry I missed this post earlier.  I do want to be absolutely clear that I did not in any way ask for the removal of FlyTape as a mod in my message to Mr_dong, only that he reinstate me. This was his decision entirely.  </p>

<p>I can certainly understand the hard work he&#39;s put in here, but I think if you look at FlyTape&#39;s comments, you&#39;ll see that even before this episode, he had already lost the confidence of this sub, and his comments were consistently was down voted, and not just a little. Also his <a href="http://i.imgur.com/j7jQSJv.jpg">comment</a> to other mods calling those who objected to it as &quot;A bunch of uptight bitches&quot; proves he is completely close-minded on anyone who disagrees with his point of view,  which is absolutely not who I want as a mod here. </p>

<p>Whether that was caused organically or not, I don&#39;t have any way of knowing.  Also I&#39;ll ask you the same question I asked him, which was by him being a moderator here, and going on the premiere podcast of the sub in mask, did he really think that this would help the sub, or hurt it? The Hitler snoov, did he think that flashing that was going to help this sub, or hurt the sub? Did the Richard Gage AMA fiasco help this sub, or hurt this sub?  There&#39;s a very clear and convincing pattern of him doing impulsive things which end up hurting the image of this sub.  Again, whether this is entirely organic or not, I don&#39;t know.  </p>

<p>I also think the fact that he banned 3 different users in a single day, which as you&#39;ve stated you&#39;ve banned on 3 or 4 ever, indicates to me that he was abusing his power as a mod and punishing those who didn&#39;t agree with him.  If you saw George_Tenet comment which got him banned, I can&#39;t imagine you not agreeing. I certainly went overboard in my comment, but he could have just deleted it, and issued me a warning like any other responsible mod would have done, who wasn&#39;t looking to retaliate. </p>

<p>I too saw the usual suspects laughing and carrying on about this, and this is truly unfortunate, however it is to be expected from that crowd.  This is the entire purpose is to be a reactionary sub to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  They have always done this, and they will always continue to do this.  I would much rather see these guys talking and laughing amongst themselves, then I would seeing a Washington Post journalist write a hit piece on this sub with a picture of one of the moderators in a mask flashing a Hitler snoov.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>No absolutely not.  I think very highly of all the current mods here, and in the very few times which I&#39;ve interacted with any of the mods, you guys have always been very professional in the way you handle things.  In fact, before that post, I can&#39;t remember ever having an interaction with FlyTape, either good or bad.  </p>

<p>I completely agree with you, and had I have been the senior mod who handled this instead of Mr_Dong, I probably would have handled it internally myself, but I am not, and again I want to be absolutely clear that I did not in any way ask for him to ban FlyTape, warn him, or punish him in anyway.  My message to him was simply appealing my ban, and asking him to reinstate me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hmm. I suppose that is plausible. My impression of this whole thing is that flytape is either intentionally trying to provide ammunition to lob at &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; or that he is just kind of out of touch with reality.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s the latter, then i suppose it&#39;s a possibility... this would mean whoever else was involved in this process, whether it is the other moderator or someone else who convinced flytape to wear the mask and be video recorded, intended for it to look asinine. If flytape signed off on the finished product, which it seemed like he did, that consent includes the background stuff, the weird video effects.</p>

<p>But I suppose if he is as naive as I am supposing, then he may have accepted that it wouldn&#39;t be a big deal, that those effects were cool, and its about the discussion and topics and that those are what is important.</p>

<p>I really wish that we could get on top of the idea that appearances matter. We all seem to accept that propaganda and public relations are controlling people, and that it affects people&#39;s perceptions of conspiracy theories and criticism of the status quo, but time and again there is stuff like this that just says &quot;fuck it, they&#39;re going to treat me like I&#39;m crazy anyways so I&#39;ll just go ahead and look crazy, and hope that my message still gets to those who need to hear it&quot;</p>

<p>I dunno. Either way, I think it may be for the best for the subreddit that he was removed. I wish that there were some changes in place to prevent this sort of debacle from happening in the future.</p>

<p>edit: for the record, I&#39;d be comfortable amending my assessment of it from <a href="http://conspiraciesthatweretrue.blogspot.com/2007/03/conspiracy-theory-rating-scale.html">a class-2 theory to a class-3</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t thank you enough for understanding the severity of the situation. I want to reiterate to the community that my approach was transparent and in no way was I ever accusing Flytape of being a shill. He and his friends constantly harassed me rather than addressing the issues everyone else was angry about. </p>

<p>Instead they took it out on me with constant threats in Private messaging, calling me a troll, shill, and a even going as far as saying I&#39;m manipulating all the votes. The worst part was one of the harassers was a moderator here, and he constantly accused me of being a paid government shill while attempting to bait me into a ban. </p>

<p>I&#39;m glad the community&#39;s voice was heard and I hope we become more understanding and aware how <strong>important credibility and execution</strong> are when spreading our ideas and that moderators represent the community as a whole.</p>

<p>Flytape was irresponsible and aggressive. That&#39;s why I created the thread <a href="http://www.np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/31fl7t/psa_for_rconspiracy_last_night_a_controversial/">PSA for /r/Conspiracy: Last night a controversial mod here performed a major disservice to the community as a whole. Luckily my voice was heard and it was quickly removed. You may have missed what happened â€” check it out and let&#39;s come up with a solution together. [Serious]</a></p>

<p><strong>I did my best to entitle it responsibly but I do apologize for being very aggressive. I took it personally as a subversive act and felt like &quot;civil disobedience&quot; was in order.</strong></p>

<p>Edit: do not become divided and I hope there isn&#39;t any retaliation against me personally. Peace out and happy egg-bunny-zombie Jesus day! Mimosa time. </p>

<p>That being said, I would like to nominate myself as a new mod to take flytapes place. I am embarrassingly in tune with the meta discussion in this sub and I have had many posts that have been stickied and catalyzed much discussion, including the post that got solidwhetstone booted for asking <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> advice on how to moderate this sub. I understand and respect the authority a mod has and would never abuse that authority to promote my own material.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m extremely disappointed with this sticky, Mr. Dong.</p>

<p>I am also disgusted that your removed <a href="/u/flytape">/u/flytape</a> as a moderator without putting that decision to a vote of the modteam. That type of unilateral action is dangerous and makes me seriously consider the way in which this mod team is currently structured. </p>

<p>I think that there were certainly some valid concerns (and some very helpful suggestions) provided about the podcast (and flytape&#39;s  choice of background screens) but I am hard pressed to believe that those gripes are enough for you, Mr. Dong, to buy into the concern trolling spearheaded by the digitalcartel of all people. </p>

<p>There was a clear (and quite organized) artificial opposition to the podcast in an attempt to undermine any attempt to expand the media presence of this sub. </p>

<p>That you would buy into that nonsense (after seeing some of the usernames behind the &quot;complaints&quot;) is astounding and I would remind you that I spend nearly every waking hour working to make this subreddit better (modmail response time, having automod approve shadowbanned users, flairing reddit censorship, issues warnings for rule violations, etc), and to receive this type of disrespect for something that is in alpha (from one of our top mods as a sticky no less) is quite insulting. </p>

<p>I very much appreciate <a href="/u/WideAwakeNWO">/u/WideAwakeNWO</a>&#39;s sentiments regarding how a post could have been made (before the podtcast) asking for community input or questions, which would have allowed the discussion to more properly reflect the userbase of the subreddit. Perhaps, if the community will allow it, I will consider doing something like that in the future with a different guest.</p>

<p>The most disappointing aspect as i have said is the lack of communication with the rest of the mods, see if from everyone else&#39;s POV, how the fuck are supposed to know what you&#39;re going to do next?</p>

<p>It&#39;s a project I speardheaded and got quite involved with; and I do apologize for not keeping the rest of the mods in the loop. </p>

<p>For the record, if a user had PM&#39;d the modmail with a request to sticky a similar podcast I would have been just as amicable (if not more so) to that idea. </p>

<p>Take it from a <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a> and <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> regular - I would love nothing absolutely nothing more than for you and <a href="/u/flytape">/u/flytape</a> to continue to embarrass yourselves, and I thought your podcast was the best thing to happen on reddit in recent months.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think anyone was questioning your motives in producing a podcast, or your dedication to this sub, you have always been one of the mods I have respected the most BECAUSE of your clear dedication to making this sub better on a daily basis. </p>

<p>I only questioned the execution of the new podcast series,  and the fact that everyone, including your fellow mods apparently, were blindsided by the video and had absolutely 0 input into it.  Do you really think if you would have put the idea of hosting FlyTape as your guest in the premier of the podcast to this sub before doing it, they would have approved of this idea?  </p>

<p>I really respect you and what you have done here to this sub to make it better, and I want you to please know that I was not mad at you or the fact that you wanted to expand this subs media presence, quite the contrary actually.  I was only upset because you didn&#39;t consult with anyone else about it before you did it, and had you have done so,  we all could have helped you with it to make it better. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also a little insulting to me that you are writing off my opposition to this as an organized concern trolling by the digital cartel.  I can&#39;t speak for anyone else but myself when I say I have never posted or had a single discussion with any users in digital cartel, let alone conspired with them to try and prevent this sub from expanding, and that my opposition to this podcast was strictly organic and completely legitimate. </p>

<p>Honestly, selfishness on my end probably had some part in it as well.  I really like the idea, a lot,  and know that I could have helped you and added a lot to it,  in post production editing if nothing else.  I was rather upset that I didn&#39;t have an opportunity to play a role in it, let alone even know it was happening until it was over. </p>

<p>I also think it&#39;s a bit ironic that you are upset that Mr. Dong didn&#39;t put removing FlyTape from a mod position without having a vote on it,  while you and FlyTape created a new media channel representing all the conspiracy mods without telling them,  let alone letting them vote on it. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s stop bickering about it though,  and let&#39;s use all of the awesome users we have here to create a 1st class podcast which everyone here can proud of.  Don&#39;t let the digitalcartel win if there truly is an attempt to silence you from expanding this subs media,  let&#39;s keep it moving forward and learn from this incident. </p>

<p>In fact,  I like the idea so much that I&#39;m willing to fund some of the expenses with my own money,  that&#39;s how much I believe in it.   I think a new stickied post (which maybe replaces this one? ) is in order to brainstorm and gather ideas is in order.  This is your idea and you should still be the one making the final decisions on it,  I&#39;m not interested in calling the shots but just helping where I can. </p>

<p>I entirely understand this sentiment, and I apologize for failing to more properly prepare for the trial podcast. Again, I am learning things along the way, and I cannot thank the community enough for their constructive feedback (setting aside the jokers out only to rile up the user base against the mods) which I hope will lead to a more productive, successful and professional series of podcasts in the future. </p>

<p>I&#39;m tired of modding anyway.  For what its worth wideawake was spamming personal attacks while I tried to explain to him the snitler image.  I&#39;m not a Nazi and he just kept repeating the same attack.  George tenant was doing the same thing, DEA is and always has been a troll here.</p>

<p>This community is like a kindergarten full of entitled brats, everyone (minus about 20 normal people) wants the people they disagree with to follow the rules while they pester the fuck out of everyone else.</p>

<p>The concept that this community reflects on them personally and that for those reasons they need to limit what is acceptable to discuss here is stupid.  We are all individuals on the internet and this subreddit is a catch-all.</p>

<p>This community will suffer with me gone from here but that&#39;s fine with me, I&#39;ve got shit2do IRL.</p>

<p>Here is wide awake calling me a nazi , and the post deleted below is his emotional blowout that got him banned.  I guess by Mr. Dongs standards I&#39;m supposed to let people break the rules repeatedly after trying to talk sense into them.  </p>

<p>Pretty shit move Mr. Dong.</p>
