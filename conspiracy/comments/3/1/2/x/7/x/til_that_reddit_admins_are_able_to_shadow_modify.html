<p>And for convienence, I&#39;ve extracted all of the messages from the CSS that they are implanting on comments, probably related to April fools, but still.</p>

<p>*EDIT: Looking at the formatting of the CSS, its clear its programmatically generated along with all of the other changes made to a subreddit. I&#39;m no expert in modding subreddits, but I know enough about web development that this capability resides in an easily accessible tool, probably available to any script kiddie interested. Potentially inspired by this: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/csshelp/comments/pfl4r/how_to_display_random_quotesimages_which_change/">http://www.reddit.com/r/csshelp/comments/pfl4r/how_to_display_random_quotesimages_which_change/</a> </p>

<pre><code>  That said, I still think 9/11 was an inside job. How could it not be?
  I know this is a little off topic, but the moon landing was a hoax. It was all done in a Hollywood Studio.
  And yes, I think Monsanto is under the thumb of the Illuminati.
  One question, ever hear of the Bilderberg Group?
  I&#39;m part of a group of top minds that can see through all the propaganda.
  ... and don&#39;t forget about Sandy Hook.
  If I&#39;m being honest, this place is filled with paid shills.
  And then of course, there&#39;s the New World Order.
  Seriously. It might be cliche, but the only way to stop the electromagnetic waves is with tinfoil.
  Since we&#39;re semi-anonymous and being so open, I&#39;d like to add that climate change is a conspiracy put forth by the reptilians.
  It&#39;s probably because of the fluoride in the water.
  The Time Cube makes a lot of good points.
  Anyone up for a #OccupyArea51 movement?
  The mods here are paid shills. Paid by the Reptilian Lizard people who backed the Nazis.
  1 word: Contrails.
  Oh, have you seen the movie &#39;Loose Change?&#39; It opened my eyes and changed my life.
  Don&#39;t worry. It won&#39;t be long before there&#39;s an RFID chip in you too.
  The Holocaust? More like the fakecaust.
  This is totally irrelevant but there are two men in black outside my window watching me.
  The Federal Reserve is owned and operated by the New World Order. Nuff said.
  I&#39;m still waiting to see Obama&#39;s birth certificate.
  I don&#39;t really like talking about this, but have you heard of shadow people?
  All of our technology is the result of reverse engineering due to the alien ship we found at Roswell.
  9/11 was an inside job perpetuated by the Bush Administration at the behest of the lizard people. They need oil just like everyone else.
  HAARP. Look it up. The U.S Government controls the weather.
  Slightly off topic but cloud Seeding and contrails are proof positive the government is using mind control techniques on us.
  For this comment they&#39;ll only be able to see me using a VPN. And I&#39;m using another VPN on top of that VPN, so good luck finding me!
  Jet Fuel can&#39;t melt steel.
  This subreddit is where all the top minds on reddit (and in the world) gather and disseminate the truth.
  Pursuit of the truth means forgoing critical thought and facts if they get in the way.
  And just to let everyone know, I believe vaccinations cause autism. The pharmaceutical companies did it on purpose.
  Ever hear of the Skull and Bones group? Yes. Them.
  In the end, however, it doesn&#39;t matter. The Trilateral Commission has already made those decisions for us.
  Just ask Kevin Trudeau, author of &#39;Natural Cures They Don&#39;t Want You to Know About&#39;.
  I sort of disagree with the other commentor. I think the Freemasons actually work FOR the illumanati.
  Have you seen the faces on mars? That&#39;s proof right there. The aliens were here, they still are here, and they aren&#39;t going anywhere.
  Are you a shill? You can answer honestly. I&#39;m actually impressed.
  The Greys gave the Americans stealth technology. How else would they get it?
  The French control the media. There, I finally admitted to it.
  Have you seen the faces on the moon and mars? Don&#39;t tell me you don&#39;t think they&#39;re real.
  Freedom is an illusion handed to us by the Illuminati. Ironically, it&#39;s just another form of control.
  Cold Fusion is real and I&#39;ve demonstrated it in my basement.
  Fusion power was already created in labs back in the 70s. Energy companies are keeping a lid on it to protect their profits.
  By the way, did you know the cure for AIDS was developed in 1989? The Government isn&#39;t releasing it specifically to target select groups of people.
  I earned .50 cents for this comment. Wee!
  We&#39;re only asking questions, that&#39;s all.
  All you have to do is look for the clues. They&#39;re there in your newspaper and in your magazines. You just have to look.
  The magic bullet killed Kennedy. Which was shot by the CIA on orders from the FBI.
  MLK and Malcolm X were assassinated because they discovered cold fusion.
  Perpetual motion and energy machines are real. I built one in my basement.
  Shills don&#39;t exist, nothing exists. In this world, I&#39;m the only thing that&#39;s real.
  The answer you seek lies in metaphysics and the supernatural.
  It won&#39;t be long now until the North American Union owns this world.
  Everyone&#39;s worried about the NSA and surveillance but it&#39;s a moot point. There are listening devices in the water.
  It&#39;s all part of the zionist plan anyways.
  Open your mind to become a top mind.
  They had it all wrong anyways. Vaccines don&#39;t cause autism, autism causes vaccines.
  Ever hear of project blue beam? Yeah.
  The Twin Towers fell due to a controlled demolition. Have you seen the loose change documentary? Fascinating stuff.
  Snowden is a false flag used to distract the world from the real problem.
  Subliminal messages can be found everywhere if you look hard enough. If you can&#39;t find any, you have to look harder.
  Everyone bashes Hillary Clinton but she&#39;s one of the few remaining humans left in Washington, fighting for us in a sea of reptilians. It&#39;s a shame, really.
  Ever see the Matrix? Who is to say that&#39;s not EXACTLY what&#39;s happen to us now? They even allude to it in the movie.
  The moon landings were staged to throw off the Russians. There&#39;s really no point in arguing it. It&#39;s so obvious.
  Monsanto is at fault here. I don&#39;t know how, I can feel it. It&#39;s intuition.
  Read up on Opus Dei conspiracies. It&#39;s pretty powerful stuff.
  Nazis live on the dark side of the moon. If you play the Wizard of Oz backwards while listening to Pink Floyd, it&#39;s incredibly obvious.
  The spring of eternal life is a real thing. Unfortunately, it&#39;s under the control of the Freemasons. It&#39;s why the organization has lasted so long.
  Tin foil is the only true protection we have. I&#39;m being serious here. I know it&#39;s joked about, but trust me. It works.
  Big Phrama and the Illumanati doesn&#39;t want us knowing about natural cures like Homeopathy.
  We also need to free Kevin Mitnick. They say he&#39;s been released, but that&#39;s not him. He&#39;s been replaced by a body double.
  Contrails are actually for our own protection believe it or not...
