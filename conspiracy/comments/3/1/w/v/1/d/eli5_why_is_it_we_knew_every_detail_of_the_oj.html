       The OJ trial and other high profile trials (George Zimmerman, Casey Anthony) are covered ad nauseam and both the Boston trial and the James Holmes trial get periodic updates with courtroom sketches revealing nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Presumably they were/are on TRIAL right? Meaning they are technically still innocent until proven guilty? Wouldn't the American people have interest in learning the ins and outs of the case? Wouldn't they be HUGE for ratings?
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems strange.
      </p>

       Edit: I wouldn't worry about that lil guy.

       There are dozens of cameras in an around that theater. Either the footage of how he got into the theater will come out during trial or it's gonna be burried. Either way people should train themselves to ask 'why' when major national cases are missing huge pieces of evidence.

       I'd also like to point out that was saw the BB body but not Osamas. And there is literally no reason for this.

       Because any perceived "parading" of OBL's body would have caused the death of innocent lives. Probably some American lives.

       Now you "literally" have a reason for this. There are other reasons also.

       We saw Saddams dead sons, we saw Ghadafi and I bet we'll see Asad. You honestly think that people devoted to the terror and destruction of an entire continent would stand down when their leader is murdered but react if his body is shown on TV?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you honestly believe the only thing stopping more terror attacks was the fact that they refused to show his body? Even though in every non wester country gore on the news is common place and even within the west we see tons of dead bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you actually, honestly believe that the legions of terrorists loyal to or inspired by Osama are willing to stay their hand just because no one showed pictures of his corpse? Honestly. Answer that specific question in yes or no terms.

       I've met this guy recently who was on the Carl Vinson when they dropped the body.   He didn't see the event, but they broadcasted it on the TVs inside the ship.   I thought that was interesting though.   He said stuff like as far as he knows only one helicopter came to the ship.
       <br/>
       He also said it was rumored on the ship that after the event a couple 50 ib weights were missing from the workout area.

       Answer to your question: no.
       <br/>
       But I never said that anyone would stand down. You wondered if they would react to seeing a pic of Osama. These asshats kill over a fucking cartoon!
       <br/>
       I believe that if they saw OBL's corpse on tv every five minutes, there would have been many attacks worldwide. Not big planned shit, but a lot of small stuff.
       <br/>
       Spur of the moment if you will.
       <br/>
       And Hussain, Ghadafi, and Asad can't be compared to OBL. They were despised tyrants to their people, not beloved leaders in a religious war.

       It's not a cop out. I'm just saying images of dead OBL would probably push many to violence. They kill over cartoons for fuck sake!

       As for evidence, the eyewitness accounts of the soldiers who shot him is good enough for me. I don't need to view the autopsy.

       Google "Danish Muhammad cartoon". Or do I need to type slower for you to understand?  I joined this thread to point out a logical fallacy. That you can't equate photos of the dead BB with pics of a dead OBL.
       <br/>
       I stated my opinion that pics of Osama would incite violence. I used the violent uprisings that came after the cartoons of Muhammad as an example of how easy it is to get religious fanatics to kill.
       <br/>
       I have upvoted everyone who commented politely whether they agreed with me or not.
       <br/>
       Have I made a false statement? Have I called anyone names? No. I've been downvoted and insulted for trying to have an intelligent conversation. Why? Because I don't automatically disbelieve everything on the 6 o'clock news? Because I don't perpetuate every bullshit, tin foil hat conspiracy theory to fit a worldview that if it comes from the government or mass media it must be lies?
       <br/>
       Sorry I forgot. Only the internet is true.
       <br/>
       Now if I have said something that isn't true, or if you have anything to add to this conversation, please go ahead. Love to hear it. If not then just don't comment.

       im sorry you feel like such a victim, but all you've  done is repeat the same thing the news said.  it might be true, it might not be true.  the point  is, we have no way of knowing - we're  expected to take the word of known liars.  it just sounds  like plausible deniability to me.

       It is argued that Gaddafi's people revered him and the real reason for the invasion was to stop Gaddafi from starting an African currency based on some that's actually tangible and valuable. Like uhhhh, gold.

       What's wrong with jumping off with Google? Check your sources and be conscious of confirmation bias, and Google is a powerful tool. It's not like Google themselves deliver the answer to me immediately. I still have a responsibility to fact check.

       Also, I served in the US Air Force and was specifically deployed for Operation Odyssey Dawn and Operation Unified Protector, so I'm slightly more familiar with events than your average bear.

        Not "talking points", FACTS. Cartoons of the prophet Muhammad have caused violent uprisings more than once in more than one country.

        I never claimed to say anything unique. I only challenged a statement that there was "literally" no reason for the BB's body to be shown while no images of OBL were released.

       <li>
        I provided a very plausible reason not to show OBL's body thus disproving his statement.

       Again, I'm simply pointing out that everything you're saying here is something you heard on CNN or read in the NYT, whether it's actually true or not, and at this point a lot of us on this sub are skeptical about taking known liars' word for things at face value.

       So how do you determine truth if you start with the preposition that everything is a lie?
       <br/>
       Why do you find anonymous internet sources with no accountability more reliable than mainstream media?
       <br/>

       I don't presuppose everything is a lie but I also don't assume I'm being told the truth from those who've been caught lying multiple times about multiple things in the past.  When all we're given is their word, why would anyone take what they say on faith alone?

       Where did I say this?  The point is to be skeptical of all sources and make up your own mind (rather than repeat the talking points you saw on CNN).

       I've been forced to repeat myself because you apparently fail to grasp the very simple point I've been making which is that all you've done in this thread is repeat talking points.  I didn't think it was that complicated of a statement to understand but apparently for you it is.

        <strong>
         One of them was overseeing the installation of a new security system requiring every visitor to ring the front entrance's doorbell after the doors locked at 9:30 a.m.

        If they were buzzed into the front office, parents would be asked for photo identification.

       That matches my understanding of the limited system, and there's no mention at all of any surveillance cameras in the school beyond the front door.

       The sole camera was at the front door, for entry purposes only, so staff could buzz in visitors, and which had no recording capability.

       My mother is an elementary school teacher in PA.  They only have one security camera as well and it's also at the main entrance.  I don't think that is uncommon in most schools that aren't huge and have no history of security incidences.

       I have worked in a few schools. Typically they're shitty quality, and only used for buzzing in visitors to the school (subs, parents, student teachers, etc). The secretaries are able to see who the person is when they ring the buzzer. Again, typically the shittiest quality possible that just allows them to briefly see who the person is.

       Well, the James Holmes trial hasn't started yet. They're currently still in the last phases of jury selection.
      </p>
      <p>
       My wife works with someone who's daughter was part of the selection pool (I know, great reliable source) and was just eliminated after they cut the pool down to 100. She said they just kept going back and forth on death penalty related questions as it appears the prosecution is going to push hard for it.

       The case has been mentioned fairly often here in Colorado but most of the recent news has been about the jury selection and the size of the pool (originally 9000 people, the largest in CO history) and questions on the cost of sending out so many jury summons and conducting such a large search.

       The government has much to hide in both cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       The narratives do not add up. For example witnesses at the Aurora theatre make it clear that there were two people involved, one throwing pyrotechnics or something from the front-right while the other was shooting from the front left, or vice versa. Someone let the shooter in. James Holmes was found all drugged out in his car. But they have to make it out to be only about a lone crazed gunman.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the Isla Vista shooting, witnesses spoke of two people in the car--one was the "handler" (agent) who makes sure it goes down as needed, then he gets outta there. The records are scrubbed to make it appear as only a lone crazed gunman. Similar to the whole "Adam Lanza" BS but there never was an actual Adam Lanza. The Lanza's only had one son named Ryan.

       Thank you for the sensible answer, I was looking for this.  Also, I would mention that murder cases in Florida and California are more likely to get excessive press coverage because 1) the law there generally allows for cameras in the courtroom 2) specifically because of the regularity of high profile cases, news outlets in those regions are already set up and ready-to-go to cover these sorts of trial stories.

Just more coverage in general, more curiosity. More investigative journalism, more visibility.

       This is how you can quickly and easily spot a manufactured event.  When the most (ed) basic of questions the masses are being ignored and covered up, you know just how real the event really was.

       Spotting a 'manufactured event' should never be 'quick and easy'. So what is the acceptable amount of coverage that this would have been acceptable?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't live in the US, but if you can even slightly competantly use a search engine, you can get a fair amount of details for a federal case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hypothetical: 
Even if it had played out differently, they told you every detail of the prosecution's case, the defence's, and could hear the judge's
       <em>
        inner monologue
       </em>
       . He recieves the death penalty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even in that context, it would still fit to your 'FBI Plant' story. "Obviously the government already had this entire court back and forth rigged from the start. Their all in it, paid off. The reporters are all in on it because they were just shoving their corperate master's propaganda. Now they're just killing off the patsy. Its so
       <em>
        obvious
       </em>
       ."
      </p>
      <p>
       You see how easy that was?

       It's because the media needs controversy to attract viewers, and their goal is to attract viewers (one of the major problems with for-profit news).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing controversial about this.  To most people, the case against him is ridiculously solid, there is very little mystery surrounding the case and so there is very little the media has to draw viewers in.

       You'd figure they could find something controversial if they really wanted to. The events are controversial just by subject matter, no? James Holmes has a pretty intriguing story. Same with Boston's Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. A big mental health debate could happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       So many angles they could run at with this story. So I can't believe that there is "no controversy" or that viewers would not be attracted any less compared to whatever other shit show they are putting on the air.

       Your original question was as to why the trials haven't received much attention. If your question had been "why haven't this situations/people gotten much attention" I would tell you you were wrong.  Both the alleged perpetrators and the events have been covered extensively by the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, for the trials, there is very little question among the general public, right or wrong, about whether or not these people are guilty or whether or not they deserve to be punished. The media can definitely magnify controversy where there is little, but creating controversy out of nothing is not something worth their while.

       Once you understand the pattern of problem/ reaction/ solution, you can easily detect it being used.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, tighter internet restrictions are needed so stage Charlie Hebdo. They want to work towards taking our guns so they stage events like Sandy Hook. 9/11 also. Boston Marathon Bombing, Aurora shooting, Sandy Hook--all staged events.

       I'm fairly certain that federal cases can't be televised, which would explain one of the differences between this and the OJ trial (as well as other massive cases like the Clarence Thomas and Kennedy rape) in terms of level of coverage.  Furthermore, in Boston media, this is getting plenty of coverage.
      </p>
      <p>
       In terms of this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Meaning they are technically still innocent until proven guilty?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I would also suggest that it's likely that this is getting less coverage because they have already entered a guilty plea.  Therefore this isn't about "innocent until proven guilty" but rather "level of culpability" in order to determine punishment.  Much different again from the OJ case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, as I've shown above, there are mountains of information coming out of the trial for anybody who is willing to look.  Are there any details that you find lacking in that documentation?

       I've been wondering about this for a while.   Remember in the old days when there would be multiple in depth documentaries about these types of events?  And media circuses?  You get none of that anymore.  Ever seen a single documentary about Mohammed Atta?  Isn't that weird?  They have numerous documentaries about BTK, Ted Bundy, or any other serial killer you can think of, but not a single one about any of the 9/11 hijackers.

       I was just saying this same thing to myself. I personally think this trial would've made great tv and gotten killer ratings for the networks. Kind of bizarre they chose not to capitalize on this trial, makes you think...

       And we know all about the court proceedings - what evidence was submitted, what arguments the attorneys made, how the judge and jury ruled on various issues, etc. We just don't have video footage because federal courts decided a long time ago that they didn't want trials to turn into TV shows for mass entertainment.

       That isn't an opinion.  It is a fact.  I didn't create the law, but acts of terror are, as at turns out, federal crimes because even though they only occur in one state in this case it had an effect on the entire country (also the kid admitted that it was an attack against America as a whole).  Is this sub supposed to just be a place where people ask questions but don't really want any fuckin answers unless it is "yeah.. you are right!  This is 100% proof!111!!! we blew this thing open!"  Or do you want some people who are objective to actually give their 2 cents as well?

       Well, in a sense we all did. When we allowed tyrannical legislation like the The Patriot Act to get passed in the wake of false flag terrorism, enabling the U.S. Government to hide all court proceedings related to false flag terrorism from that point forward.

       Well no.. because Federal trails have had rules against cameras in the courtroom since 1946.  The Patriot Act sucks but it doesn't really have anything to do with why cameras aren't allowed in the courtroom during a Federal Trial.

       Because the defendant was charged with violating federal laws concerning weapons of mass destruction. OJ just used a knife, and the people he killed were not federal officials nor were they on federal property at the time, so he was only prosecuted under state law.

       As far as OJ, Judge Ito was starstruck and allowed his courtroom to become a media circus with wall to wall live coverage. That's really why we know all the OJ details.

       Since then, judges have seen what live courtroom coverage does and have been reluctant to allow that kind of spectacle.

       All evidence points to his involvement... it's a common tactic in cases like this to avoid the death penalty. You tie a remorseful victim
       <em>
        to
       </em>
       the tradgedy instead of removed from it. What would make a jury more sympathetic "my client says he didn't do the bombing" or "My client also suffers, as he was manipulated by his older jihadist brother"

       This should be thought of in the proper context too: the media had to be pulled off of surrounding roof tops because they were trying to freaking film the active stand off. I was listening to a guy describing the situation live and I remember him being pissed at the reporters for doing that. And piece of info makes the lack of TV coverage of the trial even more odd.

       I've seen a couple of answers regarding that interest comes from whether or not the public thinks they are guilty or not.
I can agree with that. Even though these are trials, the majority of people have probably already made up their mind on guilt already, so there isn't much drama there. At least not in the verdict.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can anyone think of a trial where the outcome was pretty much decided (GUILTY), yet still received a lot of coverage in the media? I'm at work, brain is fried currently. But I'm going to think about that.

       James Holmes father was due to testify against a banking cartel when his son went off the hinges.  Somehow the video evidence went missing.  He dyed his hair before being sedated and brought into court.  All of this is likely overseen by a secretive area of the government.

       Those other trials had a lot of media attention because the public was interested in them. The public was interested in the other trials (OJ, zimmerman, anthony, scott peterson, etc) because there was uncertainty and people fell into "guilty" and "not guilty" camps pretty evenly. It was a form of entertainment. The vast majority of people believed that boston bomber was guilty, so they therefore had no interest in following the case closely -&gt; little media coverage. Hell, even his lawyer said he was guilty on numerous occasions.

       Yeah, where's Jonnie Cochran telling the jury "if the pressure cooker don't fit (in the back pack) you must acquit"?
       <br/>
       You'd need a pretty good sized backpack like the one those guys in the khakis had to fit even a small pressure cooker inside.  You would also need to disable all the built in safety devices that a pressure cooker has and even then I think the cooker would just rupture at either the o-ring or the lid would deform allowing the gas to escape before it could build up too much pressure.  These things are designed to withstand 5-6 psi.

       Just going to go off of the Tsarnaev trial (it's a very personal case to me, so I've been following it very closely). Haven't really been paying attention to the Holmes trial so I can't comment on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look you can find plenty - the Tsarnaev trial has been followed every step of the way by the Boston and national media. There's a fantastic podcast from WBUR (local NPR affiliate) and the Boston Globe with two of their veteran journalists that's been re-capping every day of the trial. But he's not a public figure in the way OJ was long before his trial, so it's not getting the nightly news coverage of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       And quite frankly, at least in the guilt phase of the Tsarnaev trial, which just ended, the outcome was pretty clear. There's huge amounts of evidence to back up the government's case, and his lawyers are focusing on avoiding the death penalty rather than professing his innocence. So unlike the others you mention where there was no certainty about guilt or innocence, it's not a very interesting case in terms of what the outcome is.

       Nowhere in that statement did I make any reference to what I considered the veracity of it to be.

       Therefore it is just a statment of opinion. You
       <em>

       </em>
       it was a statement of fact. So, if I had said "I know..." that would be stating something I believed to be fact. Understand the difference halfwit.

       You probably believe a whole host of completely ludicrous things that you aren't capable of proving, but the pond scum you associate with, either lack the mental facilities, or have a basic shred of human decency not to challenge you to "back up" every mundane utterance.

       You dumbass. I called you out on your bullshit theories and you can't back it up, so now you've gotta spin it in some retarded way to try and defend it. You were trying to pass that shit off as fact, don't fucking backpedal now because I asked you to show how you know that's what happens. You know it. I know it.

       Another thing. Your last paragraph just confirms that you're a crazy conspiracy theorist. You fucks want EVERYONE ELSE to provide evidence to confirm something, but as soon as someone asks the same thing from you the conversation gets spun around. You want evidence about the ludicrous things I believe? Like what? How about we start with you providing evidence to confirm the bullshit you spouted that started this whole conversation? Quit backpedaling, quit spouting bullshit. Instead of throwing insults my way, show me how you know FOR A FACT that the absolute bullshit stuff you say is true with some evidence.

      <p>
       I wasn't trying to "pass" anything off as fact. I said something that I believe. That's called an opinion. It's your right to disagree with what was said. If you had even an ounce of intellect you might have even tried to engage me in a civilized conversation to learn why I believe this. But nothing you can say removes my right to say it.

       We saw Saddams dead sons, we saw Ghadafi and I bet we'll see Asad. You honestly think that people devoted to the terror and destruction of an entire continent would stand down when their leader is murdered but react if his body is shown on TV?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you honestly believe the only thing stopping more terror attacks was the fact that they refused to show his body? Even though in every non wester country gore on the news is common place and even within the west we see tons of dead bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you actually, honestly believe that the legions of terrorists loyal to or inspired by Osama are willing to stay their hand just because no one showed pictures of his corpse? Honestly. Answer that specific question in yes or no terms.

       I have worked in a few schools. Typically they're shitty quality, and only used for buzzing in visitors to the school (subs, parents, student teachers, etc). The secretaries are able to see who the person is when they ring the buzzer. Again, typically the shittiest quality possible that just allows them to briefly see who the person is.
