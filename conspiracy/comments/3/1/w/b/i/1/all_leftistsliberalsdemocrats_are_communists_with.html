       They don't believe in free speech, they don't believe in tolerating dissenting opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, if you disagree with a leftist, they won't seek to prove you wrong, or to explain the wisdom of their beliefs but instead will try to find your employer to have you fired, have you business boycotted have you harassed, or even send masked thugs to physically harm/murder you.
      </p>
      <p>
       National Socialists are the only ones who seek honest discussion in order to hammer out what is false and what is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Conservatives" "Neocons" etc. all act just like Communists if the topic is about Israel/Race. The Sean Hannity/Rush Limbaugh types all basically say "The Communists are right socially! We are all equal! They're just wrong economically!" (But when 'republicans' own both houses/presidency NOTHING CHANGES ECONOMICALLY)
      </p>
      <p>
       Will YOU (The non-National Socialist reader) find the courage to ABANDON EGO AND IDENTITY and instead deal ONLY WITH FACTS to reach a conclusion in a debate about RACIAL EQUALITY, THE STRATEGIC VALUE OF ALLIANCE WITH ISRAEL, THE FEDERAL RESERVE CENTRAL BANK, AND MASSIVE THIRD WORLD IMMIGRATION/CRIME?
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretend you've exhausted every single insult and label, pretend you've called us ever name in the book and now your ONLY RECOURSE, is to prove why racial equality is real despite GLARING INEQUALITIES in crime and intelligence/achievement. Explain why Israel is worth ENDLESS TOTAL WAR WITH NO BORDER DEFINED LIMITS AND NO CLEAR DEFINITIONS FOR VICTORY AND NO END IN SIGHT.

       We can both recognize the mistake of using all but the progressive march of the center to the left brings communist idealism closer to mainstream. Even the right has moved so far left that it's indistinguishable to a principled over-50 conservative.

       No it's a matter of reality. Equality, racial equality, open borders, massive government collection of all income and redistributing it to their party comrades.

       This is communism, maybe not your personal view of what communism should be but that is something entirely different, more like a psychological disorder.

       There is one conspiracy that stands above all the rest, and it has to do with all these issues i'm talking about and more.
      </p>
      <p>
       One could say "It's the globalists" like Alex Jones, or you can look into the names and faces of the globalists and realize it's a gang of talmudic jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why people go to jail for reaching the truth and questioning the relationship between the western world and the people of Israel and it's dual citizens infesting us.
      </p>
      <p>
       In America the same thing, you can be a Communist and good for you, but if you say anything about race/alliance with Israel then it is commanded that your employers be harassed into firing you, or your business boycotted and basically your subjugation into the ethnic cleansing of the white race via mass immigration that a high positive birth rate couldn't compete with.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the frog boiling in water, just slowly turning up the heat on us until the paradigm shifts and Whites even totally united couldn't vote/maintain our ethnic interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whites ended slavery, secured women's rights, came up with the very concept of human rights, against the backwards despotism you find in third world nations that still have these policies. Yet the Jewish monopoly media says "Whites are privileged and owe the poor people of color a free living and retirement, and if they commit violent crime it's not their fault but yours whitey"

       Whjte supremacy, national socialism... Sounds awefully familiar.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with white supremacy is that it is an ideology based on fallacies. Patterns truely exist within racial/ethnic parameters, otherwise stereotypes would all be made up. However, intelligence, achievements, and all the other things you imply whites are supreme at know no color. These attributes are human attributes, disseminated throughout the races. Ethnicity does not intrinsicly prescribe any of those attributes. Rather, these attributes are dependent upon many different variables.
      </p>
      <p>
       Socialism, on paper, is apparantly a good idea. But thats as far as this pidgeon flies. Whenever you introduce the human element into an idealistic situation, you will end up with errors. With socialism, this error results in despotism. Add white supremacy with socialism and you get something resembling the Nazis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Throughout history, those who harbored freedoms achieved more, and those who harbored freedom were happier. Those who lived in shackles and under oppression suffered the worst. When the People own the their own sovereignty, the People profit. When any other entity owns the sovereignty of the People, the People suffer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those are the facts im interested in. Not the crime/ethnicity statistics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I disapprove of many of the doings of Israel. But i suspect it is for different reasons than you.

       What fallacies?
      </p>
      <p>
       The only fallacy I see is the fallacy that every ethnic group and their civilizations are equal.
      </p>
      <p>
       National Socialism isn't economic socialism, in fact it places entire emphasis on private property and the individual mind/individual effort.
      </p>

       As for "White supremacy" if I am a supremacist for saying the concrete truth that Whites built the western world and it's culture and deserve to dominate in those areas then yes I am a supremacist.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone says white nations must inject so many third worlders that whites erode into extinction what does that make them?
      </p>
      <p>
       National Socialism is freedom for the white race, and in their short time as a free people Germany brought jets, electronic computer, synthetic fuel/biodiesel jet fuel, space faring rockets, nuclear energy (Werner Heisenberg) etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it so many people of different nations joined the Waffen SS if the Nazis were so 'supremacist'? Why did Germany have more "non white" allies than Germany's enemies? Why is it vastly more Allies/Comintern personnel defected to Germany and not the other way around?
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews are the ones who harbor racial animosity and desire an entire world of their own, they project their plans and desires onto Hitler and the National Socialists who sought freedom for their people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now it's Jews enforcing their totalitarian rule throughout the world via democracy spreading (a Jewish Marxist dogma), setting up "hate speech/hate crime" laws and "holocaust denial" laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       National Socialism has ZERO to do with economic/marxist socialism.

       Hitler Speech: March 23 1933
      </p>
      <p>
       "Great are the tasks of the national Government in the sphere of economic life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here all action must be governed by one law: the people does not live for business, and business does not exist for capital; but capital serves business, and business serves the people. In principle, the Government will not protect the economic interests of the German people by the circuitous method of an economic bureaucracy to be organized by the State, but by the utmost furtherance of private initiative and by the recognition of the rights of property....
      </p>
      <p>
       The Government will systematically avoid currency experiments."

       So ive looked at your history, and one of your subs that you mod (nationalsocialism) and i have a question:
      </p>
      <p>
       You claim that national socialists are, "We are the ONLY group that truly defends our nation's way of life now reduced to a memory," yet, you advocate for an america of one race (i.e. whites)? Do i get thst right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because if so, and i dont want to judge you yet until you answer, how do you deal with ghe fact that one of the founding principles of this country is thst all Men are created equal, and has always been a metling pot of immigrants?
      </p>
      <p>
       I support your right to believe whatever it is thst you believe, no matter if i may disagree. But it feels like your goal is to turn america into something it never was meant to be, while claiming you are turning it into exactly what it was always supposed to be. If this is true, itd be better if you amd your group created your own nation, where only you and your race could live (wherein if any other race resides in, they must be treated as second class when compared you to your race).
      </p>
      <p>
       But then, wouldnt that make you exactly the same as that which you claim is evil?
      </p>
      <p>
       Correct me where you think im wrong. Alledgedly, national socialists are proponents of open and honest debate. Lets see...

       Yeah, it did. I'll repeat it for you since you apparently have goldfish memory. Article 1 Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution, and the Naturalization Act of 1790. Segregated living space for different races.

       It's the truth. They tried to change our immigration laws before, but it didn't work because the politicians weren't all blackmailed/controlled/coerced into agreeing.

       The irony is hilarious though, you say Germans have no right to German land, but that Khazar converts to Judaism have a right to Palestine. Only an anti semite would disagree!

      <p>
       If you accept the label of anti semite then that's like another 6,000,000 because you rely on people going on the defense instead of saying "yes I am, now how am I wrong?"

       Quality retort. Even using that goofy metric, hunter-gatherer isn't even a correct definition. But I'll give you a pass on this one and assume that's just your propensity for non-sequitors and hyperbole and not simply your gross misunderstanding of anthropology.

      <p>
       Why? Jared Diamond makes a few good points wrapped in some very poor understanding of history. What does that have to do with anything?
      </p>
      <p>
       To his credit; he appears a lot more intelligent and understanding of societal changes through time than you. So sure-
      </p>
      <p>
       Jared Diamond's work is a flawed and simplistic view of the evolution of power and civilization but provides a good starting point to understand how conflicts resolve themselves over large timescales.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, all the criticism I've ever encountered about Diamond comes from
       <em>
        Historians
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        Anthropologists
       </em>
       who question some of his basic understanding of mesoamerican politics and his general eurocentrism. I haven't yet come across a single neo-nazi with anything resembling a reasonable refutation or even synopsis of Diamond or even Mcneil's work.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I didn't mention Diamond.
       <em>
        You
       </em>
       did.

       Leftists will have your "businesses boycotted" for disagreeing with their beliefs. Firstly as you seem to be classing everyone left of Nazi as communist then surely there wouldn't be private business? Also have you ever heard of Kristalnacht? Or any of the early nazi things against the Jews (such as boycotts).

       If the National Socialists conquered the USSR there would be Russia and no cold war, no communist china and Mao's "Great leap forward to 40+ million dead". No Communist occupation of Eastern Europe which was mostly sympathetic to Hitler.

       There would be more than 40 million dead. Genocide of the Jews came about because the nazis were losing the war. They wanted to murder millions of Slavs (eastern Europeans and Russians). Heard of the hunger plan? Planned to wipe out 1/3 of soviet union pop in one winter.

       No? The Bolshevik Jews are the ones that turned on the Russians and killed tens of millions of their own. Germany was a gag reflex to this poison.

       The allies were the ones that turned on the RLA and those Russians who didn't want to be Stalin's gulag slaves. Operation Keelhaul.

       The Russians betrayed the Nazi Soviet Pact by occupying Baltic States/Invading Finland/Occupying part of Romania. Stalin was building up his army to attack the Axis on July 7 1941, and Hitler beat him to the punch in June 22 1941.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you realize how lunatic it is for a state like the USSR to exist doing what it does, killing who it does, and supporting world revolution like it does and NOT develop a position like Hitler did?
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be completely negligent not to stop the Bolsheviks who were clearly planning to "liberate" all of Europe with their miserable system.

       Because the Soviets had a choice, they could have left no military presence there, or even evacuated the civilian population (which Stalin refused to do for Stalingrad).
      </p>
      <p>
       Germany offered peace over a dozen times, the western allies insisted on making total war on civilian areas and refugee cities that has no military presence.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The west didn't want the soviet union to get too far west"
      </p>
      <p>
       Not according to General Patton. Eisenhower took his fuel away and gave it to British General Montgomery in order to make sure Soviets would occupy Eastern Germany. So many military and army intelligence services confirmed this, as well as congressional investigations on the Communist infiltration of Franklin Roosevelts "New Deal" administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Institute of Pacific Relations etc were all working in concert to further communist objectives at our expense. FDR even sent Stalin about half of our uranium supplies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason the USSR was capable of fighting a war is because FDR set up unlimited aid to the USSR in his first year of office.

       More unbacked conjecture. You never list any sources at all. I can show you pictures of fat chubby people at camp "liberation"
      </p>
      <p>
       When Jews and others were asked if they wanted to stay and be "liberated" by the Red Army or retreat with the Germans, they chose to retreat with their "exterminators"
      </p>
      <p>
       This is it though, your entire argument justifying Communist expansion and wiping out Europe is the "six million" fraud.
      </p>

       It's the keystone holding together your lunacy.

       The SAS were a roughly regiment sized military group of special forces which focused on high value targets and materiel.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Einsatzgruppen were a paramilitary group which were tasked with extrajudicial killing and the murder of civilians and was composed of a half dozen battalion strength groups.

      <p>
       Germany pioneered the bombing of civilians during the Spanish Civil war and were the first to employ it, again, against civilians during WW2
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Germany was ready to negotiate peace at any time with the west.

      <p>
       Sure they were. They were ready for the West to leave them alone to their affairs while they invaded and killed without repercussion. Wanting peace and wanting to be left along while you kill people aren't the same.

       Einsatzgruppen generally did not handle anti-partisan duty. This was handled by the regular police and by either the Wehrmacht or SS though many reprisal killings were carried out by the Einsatzgruppen.

       This particular document and the resulting discussion only concerns a single particular instance; not whether or not Einsatgruppen killed civilians and whether or not they were in charge of anti-partisan activity.

       By 1933-1934, the US' economic activity was roughly half what it was the year before.  FDR's recognition of the Soviet state was not nearly as successful economically as some had hoped. Not that none of this was in the form of "aid" but legitimate two-way economic activity and investment extending from the NEP system.

       The dates for numbers given change all throughout. I never made reference to "the total amount given between the first five year plan and the end of the second world war". The only one to make any such declarations was you; and they were in reference to FDR's first year in office- which you were wrong about. That would be called changing the goalposts, and it's the same slimy tactic you continually employ whenever one of your points is debunked.

       Responding to a statement with a completely irrelevant anecdote would be considered a nonsequitor. That's evidenced by some fault statements about the einsatzgruppen and germany's bombing campaign repeatedly being met by statements about Mao Zedong. I'm actually surprised you haven't mentioned israel yet.

       You (and Masse) don't seem to understand how economics work by conflating "aid" with bilateral trade and diplomacy.  This is seen in one of your earlier responses which was typical posting of spam nonsequitors as a result of being corrected on a number of points.

       Patton had a tendency to disregard logistics and push forward at an unsustainable pace. He generally demanded a massive chunk of supplies to push a dangerous and unsupported salient.

       The USSR had been receiving allied aid since before the 1941 agreement, and while the amount received was considerable,  the lion's share of LL materiel was not received in Russia until well after the dice had been cast in the East. Only one lend-lease protocol was drawn up prior to Stalingrad while another three occurred after. After 1941 russia had only received ~2% of the total amount of LL she would receive across the course of the war. Trains weren't even shipped out until 1944. Lend-lease sped the Soviet advance but did not turn the German attack away, nor did was it the source for soviet victory in the east.

       During the first Soviet Five Year Plan, 1929-1933, Americans provided concessions, technical assistance and trade with the Soviet Union; that is, American companies consulted, shared patents and personnel to assist in the economic development of Russia. . By the mid-1920s, American business and industry supplied more than 25 percent of all of Russia’s imports—a figure which declined as the depression increased. In 1929, more than 2,000 American industrial and agricultural experts, engineers and mechanics worked in the Soviet Union. During the 1930s, hundreds of Soviet students and engineers studied in America and returned to the Soviet Union

       America's hesitation at trade with Russia, which peaked in 1930. Collectivization pushed foreign investment away and Stalin himself cut foreign imports considerably. Her grain exports were abysmal and couldn't generate much to buy with. The period of economic stimulation which accompanied the first five year plan saw considerably increased trade between Russia and America. So what? America was trading with everybody.

      <p>
       "Because Hitler invaded Poland"
      </p>
      <p>
       Poland should have stopped brutalizing Germans even children in the Danzig corridor and come to terms to let them be German again. Poland doesn't have the right to claim ancestral German cities just because a gang of Rothschild Jews and their Versailles Treaty says so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think America would care if Britain objected to us taking Texas back from Mexico? Funny how Israel today occupies Golan Heights, Gaza/West Bank and all we here is "Israel has a right to defend itself....but not Germans"
      </p>
      <p>
       Worst part is that actually is German land that owes it's development to German people.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Jews" today are just eastern khazars that claim to be hebrews with no real ancestral right to Palestine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once again you deliberately confuse the discussion with an attempt to narrow it to German media when I in fact was talking about ALL media (UK, France, USA) Not only did media conceal Polish atrocities against Germans which caused the Danzig crisis and Hitler's intervention, they also lied and said Hitler said he had no more goals after the Treaty of Munich when Hitler in fact said after the situation with Poland was resolved Germany would have no more goals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like the media concealed the fact that the Chinese Civil War was backed by Moscow and their puppet warlord Mao Tse Tung. Completely concealing the Russian presence helping Mao attack Japanese Manchuria and instead painting a picture of "Japanese aggression"
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why I brought up the Saddam WMD story.
      </p>
      <p>
       The lies told about the Axis nations are even more ridiculous. "Six million jews died! Hitler was going to take over the entire Earth! All non blue eyed/blonde hair people will become slaves!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Are we talking history or a comic book supervillain?
      </p>
      <p>
       "Lithuania, the Sudetenland, Poland and Austria were not "German Land unironically". Nor was Germany within their right to invade without repercussion. "
      </p>
      <p>
       Danzig corridor in "Poland" was German, Lithuania was annexed by the USSR so I guess you just got lost in your head, Sudentanland was German though, and so was Austria (which voted 99% to unify with Germany, what do you have to say about that?) Did Germany "invade" Austria? For an "Invasion" it seems odd for seas of people to come hail and salute Hitler who came in an open car convoy and walked around without fear of violence unlike every politician today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing you say stands up against reality. You know this but as a Jew you can't help but come disagree for the sake of disagreeing. It's in your nature to be greasy and underhanded.

       The Sudetenland was never German. It was Austro-Hungarian after being separately Hungarian and Czech; etc. Under Austro-Hungary, things were looking like Czechoslovakia might become
       <em>
        a thing
       </em>
       , then the war. Yadda yadda yadda. Germany took it upon herself to invade to take territory- it was never their right to do so. Of course only a short while after "freeing" their German bretheren they marched into the
       <em>
        rest

       of Czechoslovakia.

       Danzig was never
       <em>
        German
       </em>
       . Prior to 1918, it was Prussian territory which was won from Poland. During much of the late middle ages it was a self-governing autonomous city state. If you're wishing to invoke some kind of historical precedent, control of Danzig has far greater claim to being called Polish than German. However, I don't really care about invoking some dumb pre-Napoleonic precedent. Germany continually bullied  Poland in attempt to cede the territory; when it wasn't, Hitler didn't just take Danzing but invaded Poland. That's a far cry from really worrying about the state of Danzigers. Attempts at "peacefully" resolving the conflict were used the same as they were elsewhere- a pretext for invasion, trumped up justification and threat under violence- "give us this peacefully or we will invade" is not diplomacy.

The fact that German wasn't an aggressive expansionist power under Hitler. The Waffen SS was a large international force of people seeking to free their nations from Jewish finance and Jewish Communists. After ww2 ended Jews dominated Communist Warsaw Pact nations. (Ana Pauker, Matyas Rakosi, Erno Gero, Moshe Pijade, and so on) For a "holocaust" there sure was no shortage of Jews to be chairman of communist parties of X countries.

       No, National Socialism eliminated unemployment and brought about an economic/technological spring a new European renaissance.

       Yes, to end the war with Poland and force them to surrender German land back. However Polish cowards decided to flee to London and act brave calling for resistance safe in Britain.

      <p>
       Just like the cowards of France fled to London, made Philipe Petain PM and then made their "resistance radio" acting brave from across the english channel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Petain secured an honorable peace with Germany, and didn't lose French land. Britain could have had the same peace as well but refused because Jewish financiers guaranteed USA entry just like they did in ww1 in return for Palestine (Balfour Declaration).

       unemployment to be ended to make it so. They were masters of cooking the books. The actual unemployed figures were roughly twice what the Nazis claimed with nearly another half million invisible unemployed. The would achieve these figures by including temporary workers as full time employed, working on prestige projects, discluding women from the employment register and discluding jews from the emplyment register. Of course, conscription works really well too- rearmament works, temporarily.

       The depression occurring at the time of Hitler's rise to power wasn't unique to Germany, nor was its recovery. The rest of its recovery can attributed to re-armament. No democratic country has ever devoted a portion of its economy to military industry as large as Germany did.

       Germany was on its way to bankruptcy in 1938. Completely uncompetitive resources (thanks gold standard), huge raw materials and food imports.  The export subsidies of the mid 1930s stopped being effective.  Now they couldn't even afford to import. The military-industrial-complex it had used to pick itself up with had stagnated. Of course, assuming control of Czechoslovakia didn't hurt. What about all those loans she took out in 1933 that were due for payment in 1939???

Sorry, Jews/Israel isn't worth young Americans being maimed/losing limbs just to say that Jews/Arabs can vote in a democracy.
Instead we get greasy yid lobbyists saying "No goy the terrorists hate us because we have baseball and women in the workplace! It has nothing to do with what America/Israel does! That's just the inexplicable phenomena of 'anti semitism'!"

       Yes. Germany invaded Poland. They didn't just cartwheel into Poland. They didn't

       into Poland. They invaded.

       No Germans were

       to live in Poland. Moreover, any living in Poland were already doing so, regardless of any border-switching treaties. Poland was invaded. All of it. Not small pockets where there were Germans living that at one time sort of belonged to Germany.

       The conduct of the Western Allies was certainly not perfect but was an order of magnitude greater than German behaviour, which was generally less bad than Soviet. However, the Western allies didn't occupy any country in the capacity that Germany did.

       Yes. Once you continued to modify your stance, you finally arrived at a figure for russian collaborators.

       The ROA, and other soviet anti-Stalinist movements or even individual soviets serving within the Heer are not one and the same. Interestingly, the formation of the actual ROA was continually shot down by Hitler until things started getting really desperate.  Once formed, the ROA was composed of about two barely full strength divisions with some associated support elements and a handful of understrength ersatz divisions.

       See this is the problem with your godawful grammar and spelling. It's almost impossible to figure out what is just you fumbling a sentence together and what is your actual, lunatic opinion.

       But more to the point; the issue was never about "bringing in so many third worlers we become replaced" (whatever that means).

       Obviously racial identity is not a competition.  You either are it or are not and if you think it is you will just end up agreeing with the logic of Hitler when he agreed that the Germans needed to be destroyed.  Right from the get go you establish in peoples minds the idea of  the race you claim to speak for as transferable based on 'merit'.

       Big talk but in defining race by non-racial conditions of merit you are still pushing for it's conditions of transferability.  As Hitler did before blowing his unworthy brains out.   And by attacking Zionism you are most likely just trying to impose anti-racism on historically Christian societies (just as the Christian / feudalist attackers of the Pharisees try to do).

       The same could not be said for the Scots proper. Although famed poet Robert Burns once wrote an "Ode for General Washington’s Birthday," the Scots who had emigrated to Colonial America were seldom convinced by the patriots’ arguments. Many had fought against the Crown only thirty years previously, but when the Revolution broke out, the majority of Scots sided with Great Britain. Of this there is little dispute. In 1776 former Paisley cleric John Witherspoon, then president of the College of New Jersey and a staunch patriot, tried to change this point of view. He gave an address (later printed as a pamphlet) to the "Natives of Scotland residing in America" that noted: "It has given me no little uneasiness to hear the word Scotch used as a term of reproach in the American controversy." Virginian Thomas Jefferson included a condemnation of "Scotch and other foreign mercenaries" in an early draft of the Declaration of Independence, a phrase that Witherspoon discreetly helped remove. However, Jefferson continued to rail at the "Scotch Tories" for over two decades.

       Similarly, while they fought for Japan, they were never allied with Germany in any capacity, much less fought for them. So the INA doesn't count towards your "non white allies of Germany". (The Indian Legion would, however)

       Gandhi lent his support to Britain and its people, at least as much as a staunch nonviolence advocate can. Of course, the "friend" term was used when Gandhi addressed Adolf in a letter trying to persuade him from going to war. Another letter followed a year later using the same tone.

       Yes, I mentioned that. While there were many soviet volunteers, there was nowhere near army-strength amount of Russian volunteers. There were a variety of central asian ethnicities who fought, not many  of them  "non-white".

       The British lost the war completely and soundly, the American taxpayers were the ones lend leasing our prosperity away to Jewish Communism. My nation is the only reason the USSR wasn't a backwards state in civil war when Hitler kicked in the door. We sent unlimited aid to build up the USSR from the first year FDR was elected he set up unprecedented aid programs to build up the soviet state.
