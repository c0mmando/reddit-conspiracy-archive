        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">22</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2015-04-02 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/LetsHackReality.html">LetsHackReality</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Had an interesting experience this weekend. I attended an ayahuasca ceremony, my sixth, at a place down here in Costa Rica. About 12-13 other people attended the ceremony, most of them first timers.</p>

<p>The next morning, we all gathered and discussed out experiences, but then conversation continued to the control matrix, government corruption, media deception... the whole Great Deception. Everybody was hip to it and participated in the conversation. Everybody understood.</p>

<p>Today, I ran a poll in a FB group, &quot;Ayahuasca&quot; -- a FB group with over 30,000 members. I essentially asked them what they thought happened on 9/11. Before the poll thread was deleted, 25 people had responded -- 20 people thought it was an inside job, 1 thought they had advanced knowledge, 2 believed the official story, and 2 others had a write-in answer -- and the 2 &quot;official story&quot; people turned out to almost certainly be shills. (It turns out that group is <em>tightly</em> controlled.)</p>

<p>So there appears to be a link between ayahuasca and political awakening. Just what is going on here? I&#39;ve heard the pineal gland called the &quot;intuition organ&quot;, but I&#39;m struggling to understand how extra-dimensional visions and emotional healing could make a person more aware of 9/11, Ukraine, etc.</p>

<p>Or maybe I have it backwards: Maybe politically awake people more often tend to seek out ayahuasca. (That&#39;s what happened in my case.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The world is run by dark occultists, look around. We need to balance it with white magick. Look at the Lord of the rings for the allegory. Sauron was the blackest darkest Magician, Sarumon was the white wizard and Gandalf was the grey. The temptation for power turned Sarumon to a black wizard and in doing so it demanded Gandalf to turn white to balance it.</p>

<p>You can also pull from Star Wars too with the force being used for evil by Darth Vader and The Emperor while Ob-wan Yoda and Luke using the SAME force for good. It is all based on will of the user. If you know yourself 100% and tryst that ego won&#39;t take over  (unlike most of the Golden dawn folks Aleister Crowley) then it is safe to use. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to add that before Gandalf turned whit he battled demons these may be internal or external not sure that it matters but before becoming white you must transform yourself through battling all of your demons. I don&#39;t recommend everyone walk the path unless you are clear and have worked heavily on the self. Pharmahuasca and mushrooms are good for this. Acid is OK but prefer the natural occurring to the synthetic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve done a lot of personal work. I can trust myself with more power. When it rains, I&#39;ll seek out mushrooms and add them to the ayahuasca. I just started yoga (I&#39;ll move beyond hatha when I can), I know a bit about Kabbalah and holofractal theory -- still a beginner, but it&#39;s a start.</p>

<p>What I was looking for from you, if I may be so bold, is an example of the &quot;living God&quot; aspect in your own life. Can you give some examples of superhuman abilities or qualities in your own life? Feel free to PM. Really interested in this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s one of those chicken and egg things - most of those that feel the urge to explore ayahuasca have already began to search for meaning outside of the mainstream, socially sanctified paradigm...</p>

<p>Then again, it moves you so profoundly into your humanness. The mysterious core of existence that is not echoed in the scientific materialist society is shown in it&#39;s full glory, and inherent in that is a sense of love of the self and creation. When a sacredness is felt, I think it makes it easier to see the extent of madness and darkness on the planet, as compared to the apparently so far unrecognized spiritual reality and transcendental human potential. </p>

<p>I think planetary/societal unity is a vector that we have inside of us and that we wish to realize. When the realities of how beautiful that could be are glimpsed upon, the distance between our present moment and that possibility are much easier to see!</p>

<p>PEACE! :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Beautifully said. I have a theory that by aligning ourselves with the &quot;Christ Consciouness&quot; (love, intelligence, and courage), we are in effect assembling a super-organism -- much like the trillions of cells and bacteria assemble to form a human consciousness. That seems to align with what you&#39;re saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks! And yeah that definitely aligns with what I&#39;m saying, sounds like a good theory to me. I find it quite hard to talk about without sounding new agey, but If enough people were tuned into this conscious, caring and for the greater good type consciousness then I think it would result in a domino effect greater than the individuals inputs combined, which I guess is just like what cells do, like you said. We just need to tune into that. Have you drank ayahuasca, if you don&#39;t mind me asking?</p>

<p>Yeah I think New Age is a trap, designed to stop us at the internalization stage and never proceed to actualizing our intentions and thoughts. It&#39;s a conspiracy unto itself, worthy of a few posts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the New Age is a weird one. It&#39;s such a gimmicky term, and since every movement is a &#39;new age&#39;, it seems like a bit of a joke to proclaim the coming age as an especially new age. Then again, it kind of seems like it is?</p>

<p>And how do you think it is trapping us? By keeping the perception of the movement as a conceptual fad rather than a genuine thing?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re going to make a change in the world, the general process goes:</p>

<p>Intention -&amp;gt; Thought -&amp;gt; Action -&amp;gt; Manifestation </p>

<p>New Age thought tells you to stop at Intention or Thought and then some positive change will take place. &quot;Just change yourself and you change the world!&quot; &quot;Just imagine a better place!&quot; &quot;We create our own reality within!&quot; That&#39;s just the first part; we gotta get off our butts and do work! The stakes could not be higher.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It could be more of the <em>type</em> of person who would take part in an ayahuasca ceremony.  Most &quot;mainstream thinkers&quot; probably don&#39;t even know what ayahuasca is, so it seems likely that it&#39;s mostly more open-minded people who would take part and probably people who have looked beyond the superficial Matrix the huge majority of the world exists in.</p>

<p>Other aspect to this is: were the other 12-13 people American ex-pats such as yourself?  If so, that would be another reason since I&#39;d assume the majority of ex-pats are pretty aware of what&#39;s going on in the world and in the US (which is probably the main reason they left in the first place).</p>

<p>That said though, I think there&#39;s definitely a link there between drugs like ayahuasca and &quot;seeing beyond the veil&quot;, it probably does have something to do with the pineal.  I hope I someday get the chance to take part in an ayahuasca ceremony, haven&#39;t done so yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some expats, some European tourists, some local Costa Ricans. But yeah most expats I&#39;ve met down here know what&#39;s up.</p>

<p>Real interesting area of exploration. Whereabouts do you live? Ayahuasca is getting more and more common in the States, I may be able to find you a place.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard the pineal gland called the &quot;intuition organ&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yup. As your awareness rises, you start to rely more on direct perception instead of thinking. You get more comfortable identifying with &#39;awareness&#39; as your true identity rather than ego. You then are able to pick up on more information directly, since your ego isn&#39;t blocking things out or distorting them. </p>

<p>As for intuition and political awakening - obviously you can&#39;t intuit the temperature that steel beams burn at, etc. But things like the obsessive media coverage of 9/11 set off serious alarm bells. It starts to look fake. Like planned out, fear-based, repetitive programming that purposefully contradicts itself. &quot;They attacked us because they hate our freedoms, so we&#39;re going to respond by curtailing our freedoms.&quot; etc.</p>

<p>Intuition is hard to &#39;prove.&#39; It&#39;s not a magic power. It&#39;s more about being really in touch with yourself and the nature of things, so you know BS when you see it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Beautifully said. I have a theory that by aligning ourselves with the &quot;Christ Consciouness&quot; (love, intelligence, and courage), we are in effect assembling a super-organism -- much like the trillions of cells and bacteria assemble to form a human consciousness. That seems to align with what you&#39;re saying.</p>
