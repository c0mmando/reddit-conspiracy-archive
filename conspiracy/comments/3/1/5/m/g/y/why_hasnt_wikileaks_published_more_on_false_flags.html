       Hi, maybe I'm asking a dumb question. We just watched a Wikileaks/Bradley Chelsea Manning in English class today.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm kind of aware of false flags, enough that I'm pretty skeptical of things. Anyways, after watching the documentary I checked out Wikileaks and didn't find anything on false flags like 9/11 (besides a phone data interruption thing... underwhelming).
      </p>
      <p>
       I would have figured that with all the proof there would be SOMETHING more?

       You're just inviting blind speculation and wild assumptions when you say things like this, which doesn't do anyone any favors. The existence of particular conspiracies (or not) should not be a faith article, but based on actual information.

       Uh, you brought it up, man. Not sure why I should just believe something that you just kind of stated without even a whiff of support. Maybe there is evidence out there, maybe there isn't - you haven't even attempted to establish anything about it. Just kind of insinuating that I'm an idiot for not falling in lockstep with your assertions isn't constructive.

       I didn't bring up any of those things, but I can't help but notice that you divert showing any actual data. 'You don't feel like it', right? Instead, you're just vaguely waving at google as if your opinion is established by what undefined people have claimed elsewhere on the internet. If you believe there is good evidence, why are you reluctant to even link to it, let alone state it? And why should I believe the random websites that pop up on google any more than anonymous commenters on reddit? It's not like conspiracy blog #25 is any more convincing on its face than government shill #13...

       'My type?' I see you've established quite a lot about me from... two messages, perhaps? Pretty rich.

       I suppose I'm not a critical thinker because I asked you for sources regarding your claims, huh? Or maybe it's my doubt of your conspiracy theory in this thread which is problematic? Because I'm

       uncritical acceptance of google searches is a hallmark of critical thinking! :rolleyes:

       Look, if you believe Assange is your poster boy for "freeeddoooomm!!", then just keep on thinking it.  I've no interest in trying to pull ostrich heads out of the sand that are willingly stuck in it.  That's their own business.  If they want to continue being blind, then I just let them have it.  Meh.

       You are just putting words in my mouth that I at no point argued for - not even remotely. Also this is the second time you've basically said 'I can't be bothered' about providing sources, and it has nothing to do with my 'willingness to continue being blind.' I
       <em>
        am

       I haven't said a word in defense of Assange at all. The only thing I've done is request what you base your theory on, and you've just waved me off with excuses and condescension. Anything you interpret  on top of that is entirely putting words in my mouth.

       The fact of the matter is that I just literally couldn’t be bothered to explain how Wikileaks and Julian Assange are limited hangouts

If you want to defend him and think he’s “fighting the good fight”, then OKAY.  Have at it.

       I agree. The elite insiders responsible for 9/11 committed treason against the United States, and would have faced (and arguably still could) execution if their involvement was proven. There is no way that any genuine 9/11 evidence which could incriminate these individuals is recorded on an NSA database that many thousands of security cleared individuals have access to.

       This just seems incredible - in the not credible sense. Assuming 9/11 was a conspiracy, it would have to have been a
       <em>
        gigantic
       </em>
       one, because there's no plausible way to do even half the things asserted on this board without a very extensive plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay, maybe if the proposed explanation was that instead of the muslim hijackers there were americans flying planes into things, then you could get away with little paperwork. That would be a minimal effort operation for the desired results, I think.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not what people are saying, though. An explanation which includes rigging the entirety of several buildings with explosives for a controlled demolition - enormous buildings, incidentally - and faking one or two of the planes entirely when in reality they were something else (missiles?), plus hushing up an enormous amount of engineers, family members of victims, the whole shebang?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd sooner believe that
       <em>
        Canada
       </em>
       was responsible than that something like that can be pulled off without a hell of a lot of communication and paperwork, digital or otherwise.

       I believe the information that Manning had access to was military information, I think it's unrelated to intelligence information. It has been said that Wikileaks has more damning secrets, they are available in a encrypted bit-torrent file, the key has not been released.

       Well 9/11 revelations may not be there for a few reasons. Firstly, most of the leaks concern the period after 2005 or during from what I have seen. Secondly, it could be kept secret without a paper trail provided some important members were involved. Like the building owner, a powerful senator, a few cops etc. Others could be paid blackmailed etc. The Manhattan Project involved a 100000 people. There were whistleblowers and 9/11 has them too. Both times they were silenced. Third, if the building owner was in on it then he could do damn well he pleased in tge under construction areas.

       Why do you not see nuclear secrets in WikiLeaks cables? Why not the plans to our next-gen and still-classified stealth bombers, or details of black ops in the ME?

       This material is what's referred to as SCI, sensitive compartmentalized information, and would only be released to those with a TOP SECRET clearance on a need to know basis, and would not be disclosed haphazardly in diplomatic cables sent between low-level State Dept workers and ambassadors.

       Look, if you believe Assange is your poster boy for "freeeddoooomm!!", then just keep on thinking it.  I've no interest in trying to pull ostrich heads out of the sand that are willingly stuck in it.  That's their own business.  If they want to continue being blind, then I just let them have it.  Meh.
