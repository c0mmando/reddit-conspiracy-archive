However, I&#39;ve been finding that many of it&#39;s posts end up in the modqueue which requires us to either approve or remove it. I&#39;m finding it to be a bit too much. It also appears to me to be a distraction as it takes up quite a bit of one&#39;s screen requiring more scrolling than otherwise because it&#39;s typically the first comment.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll bring it up with the mods again and we&#39;ll revisit it.</p>

<p>Oh hey look, another accusation of being a shill for having a dissenting opinion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marginalizing &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; as being &quot;bullshit&quot; and separate from &quot;actual conspiracies&quot; is not a dissenting opinion, it&#39;s a blatant effort to discredit this sub and what it stands for.</p>

<p>You purposely choose to have an entirely negative opinion about this sub so that you can always use that as a defense whenever people call out what you&#39;re doing, &quot;Oh you&#39;re just attacking me because I don&#39;t agree.&quot;. Yeah, nice try, but that isn&#39;t going to work here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh hey look- relating my name to 9/11 when that wasn&#39;t my intention at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right, because your 3 month old account is completely legitimate, which is why you make comments like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/30lc71/mom_says_special_needs_son_at_east_high_told_to/cptmbs6">Ah, Jewish, lack of empathy all makes sense now</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/30u0ll/til_that_tim_curry_who_is_an_avid_scoobydoo_fan/cpwexcj">But dank memes can&#39;t melt jet fuel</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/30os6j/third_world_budget_gaming/cpuq543">No, but I did stay in a Holiday Inn Express last night.</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/30hvk3/my_boss_found_this_on_her_car_she_was_not_happy/cpt36cs">I had some Asian bitch in a new Mercedes come to a complete stop on the freeway in front of me, with no cars in front of her, in dead stop traffic (we were in carpool lane). No reason. Brakes locked up, had to get a new tire cuz I got a bubble in the wall. Hope that bitch dies of cancer</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh hey look, another instance of using account age to justify prejudice, regardless of the fact that I&#39;ve probably been on reddit and <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> before you even knew what reddit was.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once again, it is well known that new accounts are created all the time for purposes of shilling, trolling, and advertising/marketing. It&#39;s prejudice, and it&#39;s for a reason.</p>

<p>I sincerely doubt you&#39;ve been on Reddit and <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> before I even knew what Reddit was. How about you prove it? Or can you not because &quot;my original account was banned&quot;, the excuse they all use?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh hey look- no refutation of what I said, but rather ad hominem attacks because you have nothing of value to say.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t need to refute what you said, it stands on its own as a stupid statement that completely defies logic in the context that it was in response to an extremely well written and irrefutable comment.</p>

<p>The entire point of your comment was to attempt to completely marginalize &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; as being &quot;bullshit&quot;, which they are clearly not. They are working models (theories) to explain things ( possibly a conspiracy ).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You don&#39;t know my position of many events, but you are so quick to label me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, you plainly labelled yourself by trying to allege that &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; are &quot;bullshit&quot; unlike &quot;actual conspiracies&quot;, as if you&#39;re straight up pitching for <a href="/r/actualconspiracies">/r/actualconspiracies</a> .</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What a welcoming community.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is, we welcome all legitimate posters, but not people whose sole commenting purpose is to attempt to marginalize and libel the entirety of this sub.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Good thing I&#39;ve been here long enough to know what to expect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keep saying things to try and appease yourself, but you don&#39;t have to be here for any amount of time to know what to expect from nonsense comments like the one you made.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve actually been here long enough to know what&#39;s actually up, which informs what you should expect.</p>

<p>I called out <a href="/u/flytape">/u/flytape</a> on his recent &quot;official&quot; podcast which finally made him banned and no longer a mod, and when I called him out I said &quot;and don&#39;t you dare bring up death threats as your defense for wearing that mask&quot; and the first thing he does is bring up &quot;death threats&quot;.</p>

<p>I call a spade for what it is, a spade. I know what&#39;s up, and if you think you&#39;re going to fool me, you had better think again.</p>
