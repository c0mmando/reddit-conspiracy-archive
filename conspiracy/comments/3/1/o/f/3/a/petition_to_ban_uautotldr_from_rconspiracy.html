       That bot was addressed when it first started showing up and the mod team didn't see any problems with it. However, I've been finding that many of it's posts end up in the modqueue which requires us to either approve or remove it. I'm finding it to be a bit too much. It also appears to me to be a distraction as it takes up quite a bit of one's screen requiring more scrolling than otherwise because it's typically the first comment.
      </p>

       I'll bring it up with the mods again and we'll revisit it.

       This forum shouldn't really encourage TL;DR as a matter of principle.  Conspiracy is inherently complicated.  You need to digest an official narrative, evidence for it, evidence against it, multiple alternative theories, think about and weigh likelihoods, reliability of sources, and so on.

       3rd grader thinking or attention spans don't belong.

       You realize everything you're saying is regarding conspiracy theories right? Not actual conspiracies? Actual conspiracies are easy to digest. When you make up bullshit as you go along, of course it's going to be hard to keep up with.

       Oh hey look, another accusation of being a shill for having a dissenting opinion. Oh hey look- relating my name to 9/11 when that wasn't my intention at all. Oh hey look, another instance of using account age to justify prejudice, regardless of the fact that I've probably been on reddit and

       Marginalizing "conspiracy theories" as being "bullshit" and separate from "actual conspiracies" is not a dissenting opinion, it's a blatant effort to discredit this sub and what it stands for.
      </p>
      <p>
       You purposely choose to have an entirely negative opinion about this sub so that you can always use that as a defense whenever people call out what you're doing, "Oh you're just attacking me because I don't agree.". Yeah, nice try, but that isn't going to work here.

       I don't need to refute what you said, it stands on its own as a stupid statement that completely defies logic in the context that it was in response to an extremely well written and irrefutable comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire point of your comment was to attempt to completely marginalize "conspiracy theories" as being "bullshit", which they are clearly not. They are working models (theories) to explain things ( possibly a conspiracy ).

       No, you plainly labelled yourself by trying to allege that "conspiracy theories" are "bullshit" unlike "actual conspiracies", as if you're straight up pitching for

       Keep saying things to try and appease yourself, but you don't have to be here for any amount of time to know what to expect from nonsense comments like the one you made.

       on his recent "official" podcast which finally made him banned and no longer a mod, and when I called him out I said "and don't you dare bring up death threats as your defense for wearing that mask" and the first thing he does is bring up "death threats".

       TL;DR is against the very principals of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       . You have to know the full story, or you're just a conspiracy hobbyist.

       I'm not a conspiracy hobbyist, I'm an information researcher.

       Just do the right thing, get rid of the bot, there are already enough of them, and this one marginalizes the comment section.

       So for those who aren't aware this user is a bot that basically automatically writes a tl:dr comment on the posts content.

       It discourages people from reading the linked content. By doing this, the reader assumes they have a full understanding of the content, when- the majority of the time -you are not going to get that in a paragraph or two.
      </p>

       Furthermore, it encourages misinformation. Link an article, the bot quotes the wrong/not important/out of context portions.
