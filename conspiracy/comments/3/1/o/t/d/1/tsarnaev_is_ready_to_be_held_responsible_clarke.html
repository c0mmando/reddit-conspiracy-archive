    <div class="md"><p>Let me tell you a little something about this defense team.</p>

<p>Judy Clarck is a defense attorney specialized in maintaining life in prison when faced with the death penalty. When the government was picking a lawyer for Dzhokhar, it&#39;s kind of funny how they chose someone they know would cut the shit and get straight into the penalty phase (of course going through the regular trial because the defendant wants to plead not guilty). Then this hell-of-a defense attorney day 1 admits that she believe Tsarnaev took part in the actions the week of April 15th. Let me give you a brief run-down of what lawyers are not supposed to do. The list is pretty long, so I&#39;ll number it for you. What not to do as a defense attorney:</p>

<ol>
<li>That</li>
</ol>

<p>An attorney is not supposed to do this. I spent my fair share of time talking to lawyers on this site, including an askreddit thread asking defense attornies what it feels like to defend clients who they know are guilty. They said that should never affect a good attorney. It is not the defense attorney&#39;s job to decide who&#39;s innocent. That&#39;s the Jury&#39;s. It is not the defense&#39;s job to investigate who did it. That&#39;s the prosecution&#39;s job. It is the defense attorney&#39;s job to present the facts before the court on everything pertaining to their subject, and even though if they know their client is guilty, to still lay out the case for them. The defendant should do everything in their own right to fullfill the defense&#39;s right to a free trial. But by claiming he&#39;s guilty first day of the trial, the defense is directly denying their client a fair trial on the grounds of an impartial defense team. You can tell this is an impartial defense team by simply looking at the exhibits presented in court (if you are still interested in this thread at this time, I&#39;ll get the whole set of everything presented un court to you). If you take a look at the evidence, you&#39;ll notice there is not a single exhibit that shows the compelling evidence that led me and you to believe Jahar is innocent. There are bits of evidence that can be interpreted either way, such as Jahar buying a gallon of milk, or videos of bystanders helping the victims. The point is, this clearly shows the defense let the prosecution take jabs at the client and put the nail into the plywood. Not a single exhibit shows the defense attempting to take saide nail out of the plywood using the back of the hammer. The prosecution loaded the jury with 10&#39;s of tweets involving Jahar doing drugs and expressing his hatred for the police, but not one mentions his lifeguard tweet or any tweet that would make him look like another human boy. The prosecution doesn&#39;t care enough as to at least humanize their client through the tweets he sent out.</p>

<p>If I were any older, I would be taking advancements and looking into how to file lawsuits, getting in contact with a lawyer (simply asking them about things pertaining to what I could do), and seeing if I could feasibly file a lawsuit against the (whoever assigns the attorney to the client) on the grounds of an unfair trial by impartial defendant.</p>

<p>Oh, and don&#39;t even get me started about his &quot;confessions&quot; and &quot;apologies&quot;. I&#39;m not going to yell too loud about it right now, but him confessions and apologizing about the bombings is utter kiss-assing bullshit. He&#39;s obviously saying this because his defense team has fucked him over and now he has to kiss ass to save his life. But guess what? I&#39;m all for his kiss-assing that&#39;s going on, because what it means is Tsarnaev will live long enough for some logical lawyer to come around and say &quot;Hey, your trial was bullshit, you are innocent and I&#39;ll save you from death row!&quot; Anyways, this kiss-assing is fake (he told his own mother on a once in a blue moon call that he was alright and he did not do it, which was filmed and but on air), but beneficial to us all. I pray Tsarnaev makes it out alive and is allowed to live his life how he was supposed to: free from confines. But now I have to live with the fact that any minute now, unless his death sentence gets repealed, the next time he&#39;s leaving my state (Indiana, where he is currently present), he&#39;ll be behind a glass wall, strapped to a chair and injected with deadly, inhumane drugs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My mistake.  He plead not guilty and then they admitted guilt at the beginning of the trial.  The same thing this lawyer did with Jared Loughner to save him from the death penalty.  You plead not guilty at the onset so you can negotiate for a plea deal to get the death penalty removed.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well then that is crazy.  If they think no bombs actually went off I don&#39;t think they thought it thru well enough.  This would implicate hundreds-thousands of people who would have to be in on a hoax.  All of the people who were allegedly injured.  All of the doctors and nurses at the hospitals that were treating these people.  All of the witnesses that were nearby and weren&#39;t hurt but helped the injured people.  The family members of all of the people involved, etc.  If it were going to be a false flag it would be much easier to detonate real explosives.  Not to mention that at any moment anybody can go and talk to any of these people.  They still exist.  Wouldn&#39;t it be much easier to detonate real bombs if they wanted to pull off a false flag?</p>

<p>I get so confused by this idea that the government is too squeamish to actually kill anybody.  They are evil enough to trick people but they don&#39;t actually want anyone to get hurt.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because they don&#39;t know they have real explosives.  That&#39;s how it works.  You give people 30 bags and tell them they all have fake explosives. 2 of the 30 bags actually have real explosives though.  They set that shit down thinking it is fake and a little while alter they explode.  You can&#39;t actually get hundreds of people to fake this without it being found out.  That is way too many people to be in on it.  You just blow up a couple of real bombs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did address the drill.  I told you how that works.  That is literally how it works.  The drill is so they can get the explosives where they need to be.  If anyone asks what is going on they say &quot;it&#39;s a drill.&quot;  They don&#39;t announce the drill so they have evidence against themselves.  They announce the drill as cover for moving the explosives in.  These stupid &quot;everyone is just an actor&quot; theories are just distractions that make everyone look crazy.  Now when somebody asks a legit question about the Saudi connection and why they released the Saudi kid (who had shrapnel in his leg because he was too close to one of the bombs when it went off and that&#39;s why he was a person of interest) with ties to terrorists and flew him back to Saudi Arabia in the middle of the night even though he was wanted by the FBI for questioning the response you get is &quot;ohhh you are one of those lunatics who thinks everyone is an actor...&quot;</p>

<p>Tell me how fake this explosion is?  So fake that clothes gets blown off of people as they stand there?  Also bear in mind that you are saying that everyone in this video standing around Tsarnaev (and including Tsarnaev apparently since he is right where the bomb is about to go off and runs away from it) are a bunch of actors.  Those are some pretty god damn impressive effects.  That sure as hell is something more than just a smoke bomb.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This video shows Tsarnaev walk with a backpack to a point where there will be an explosion.  He puts the backpack down.  A first explosion goes off up the road a little bit.  Everyone turns and looks in shock and he starts to walk away before anyone else starts to move (because he knows there is about to be a second explosion) he then starts to run and other people join him and the second explosion hits.  How fuckin ironic that he just so happens to leave his backpack right where the second explosion took place.  Figure the odds.  And all of the people in that area were comfortable to stand so close to that &quot;fake&quot; explosion because they are real professional actors who aren&#39;t afraid of a little fire in the name of acting.  Or... it could be that those are real explosions... and the people standing nearby are real people...</p>

<p>And I&#39;m not ignoring that there were fuckin drills in Boston for 2 years.  That is true.  They have disaster drills all over the country.  This, unfortunately, wasn&#39;t a drill.  You think the doctors and nurses would just lie for years?  The surgeons and chief of medicine who was giving the media updates was just lying for the sake of a drill?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are willing to ignore anything to make this ridiculous &quot;hundreds of actors&quot; theory work.  It&#39;s unbelievable.  And there were a few people who lost their legs after the marathon.  Some people were in the hospital for months before losing their legs.  You can see pics of them at the marathon with 2 legs and now with one leg or no legs.  But I guess those are just really committed actors who let their legs be sawed off for their craft?  So committed they laid in hospital beds for months and then sacrificed a leg or 2.  Because that makes sense.  Much more sense than the idea that bombs went off... Nevermind that I can watch a video of a bomb going off.. That&#39;s probably just cgi..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You think a story saying they had drills in the past is evidence that this also was a drill.  That is insane.  Google the 17 marathon bombing victims who lost limbs.  You can find pics of them before and after.  Those are some dedicated actors.  But the Saudi kid obama flew home in the middle of the night (even though the fbi wanted him) with shrapnel in his leg and terrorist ties and a rich father who rubs shoulders with our government.. That&#39;s nothing of interest to u?  And the fact that the news was reporting about him and then after he was flown home they just shut up and never mentioned it again? Just this stupid actor thing is what you focus on?.  Don&#39;t you see how this is a distraction from a very obvious real thing that should be questioned?  This is like the 9-11 people who say there were no planes and it was really just holograms.  It&#39;s bullshit to discredit everyone and distract from legitimate questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No you are either extremely slow or you are fucking with me.  There is no way that you can believe that having a drill one day means that any crisis at any point ever after that is fake.  Give me one reason why the government would use hundreds of actors and pay off emergency responders and doctors and nurses and witnesses instead of just using real bombs.  If you can think of any fuckin reason at all that makes any sense I will be stunned.  You can&#39;t though.  Your response is &quot;but the newspaper said they do drills sometimes so that means everything that ever happens must be a drill!&quot;  Military people also hold drills where they use actors and realistic explosions and realistic weapons to prepare for war... does that mean they never actually go into combat?  Is every war just a movie too and nobody ever dies or gets hurt?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did look at the website.  It didn&#39;t say anything about having a 2+ year long drill tying up millions of taxpayer dollars to hold a Federal terrorism court case.  Now what about the military?  They have these same exact drills that Boston had to prepare for a disaster.  Does that mean the military doesn&#39;t actually go to war?  And when the Air Force has drills to intercept planes/jets that enter our airspace, does that mean that they never actually have real situations where they need to track a plane in our airspace?  You get that just because you have drills doesn&#39;t mean that you never have the real thing happen, right?  Just because the army uses actors to train their medics doesn&#39;t mean their medics never go into combat and have to treat real wounds.  If an amputee actor is used in military training it doesn&#39;t mean no soldiers ever get their legs blown off by IEDs.  Because when you are saying that this marathon bombing is a drill based on them saying they had drills using actors to prepare for something like this, that is what you are saying.. you are saying that because a drill was done, the real life situation could never happen.  It&#39;s insane. </p>

<p>And Tsarnaev&#39;s friends don&#39;t recognize him?  What does that mean... I thought this was a drill.. so what do you suppose happened to him?  And the cop who was killed by he and his brother?  That was part of the drill I assume?  That funeral that was televised was also part of the drill?  </p>

<p>When they want to do something where they disguise an event as a drill they get their participants and they give them 30 backpacks (just for arguments sake) and tell them &quot;here you go guys... for this drill I want each of you to take one of these backpacks and drop them in a location you think would be an ideal spot for a terrorist to plant a bomb.. then we will send our bomb sweeping crew thru and see if they can find them.&quot;  The trick is that of the 30 backpacks, 2 of them have actual bombs in them.  Now 2 of the bombs go off and the people who were in the drill say &quot;wait a second.. I thought this was a drill.. what the fuck happened?&quot; and it becomes an active situation.  It is no longer a drill.   Then they say, we had a drill going on at the time, and coincidentally there was an actual terror situation.  We missed it because all of our guys thought they were in a drill. (similar to the way on 9-11 where there was a drill going on and then actual planes got hijacked).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well no I don&#39;t need to do that because all you have to do is think about it.  There are hundreds of people injured and a couple killed.  So the people who are injured (whose names were released) are in on it.  This means their families are in on it.  The 2 dead people had families left behind who then had funerals which had to be fake.  The coroner had to be in on it because he pronounced them dead.  The hospitals where the fake injured people went had to be in on it because they kept giving updates on the victims and talking about the surgeries and such.  The good Samaritans who were at the marathon and helped some of the injured people would have to be in on it.  You are talking about hundreds-thousands of people you have to control and make sure none of them decides to admit it was all bullshit.  Why would the government risk that?  If they wanted to stage an event they would just blow up 2 real bombs.  Only a handful of people would need to be in on it then.  It&#39;d be much easier to control.  Plus why is the government suddenly squeamish about hurting/killing people?  It just doesn&#39;t make sense to not have real bombs.  Not to mention all of the victims who survived are still around... you can go and talk to them.  The government would have to make sure these people keep their mouths shut for the rest of their lives if this was all just acting.  Much cheaper and easier to just detonate 2 bombs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You raise good questions, what is your theory on what actually happened that day? The family guy pre Boston bombing with peter activating 2 bombs ties in with the real bomb theory. As we know  there are many predictive programming examples that took place prior to 9/11 indicating prior knowledge of some event. One thing I know for sure  is that the mainstream media can never be trusted, especially when you actually see the $$ flowing from the useful idiots as a result of these shenanigans. </p>

What are the odds that a kid we flagged as a potential terrorist is right there when a bomb goes off and is the first person the FBI names as a suspect and then after Obama meets with some Saudis they immediately reduce him from Suspect, to &quot;person of interest&quot; to &quot;witness&quot; and the MSM refuses to cover any of it?  </p>

Your response is &quot;but the newspaper said they do drills sometimes so that means everything that ever happens must be a drill!&quot;  Military people also hold drills where they use actors and realistic explosions and realistic weapons to prepare for war... does that mean they never actually go into combat?
