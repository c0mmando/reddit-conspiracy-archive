       This x1000 OP they are agents and legally bound by contract to STFU about it too but it is a major revenue source. Real people can use disguises and play multiple roles using pseudonyms and you can even legally use a pseudonym and run for public office by using the VOUCHED FOR or PERONALLY KNOWN loophole, more can be seen here.

       There's all kinds of weird shit going down in Hollywood, including human sacrifice and mind-control and some of the most deviant and degrading sex cults you can imagine, so nothing would surprise me. But I think the timing of these murders are not as pre-ordained, though Heath Ledger never should have been spending so much down time with the witchy Olsen Twins.

       Natalie Wood, Bruce Lee, John Candy, Heath Ledger and Paul Walker have all died mid production and the movie has gone on to be successful. Success from what I think is based on the interest of the individual and not the movie.

       Seems to be a trend, possibly started by James Dean; Rebel without a cause was released 1 month after his death and Giant was released 13 months after he died. Others that have had production released posthumously also include Whitney Houston, Britney Murphy, Aaliyah, Brandon Lee and Tupac.. remember Gridlock'd?

       But people die all of the time... Actors are obviously going to die while they are filming shit.. that is their job... it's really no different than a construction working dying of a heart attack while he is in the middle of building a house.  The house is still going to get built the same way that a movie is still going to get made in spite of an actor dying.

       don't view them as people view them as glorified idols, manufactured characters you read about or see on a screen. The flesh and blood people behind the pseudonyms can move on using disguise. They are pro actors. Far better than most give them credit for.

       These movies make a ton of money before the actors die so why would they need to kill actors off to make more money?  That doesn't really make much sense.  A guy like Heath Ledger was making a shit ton of a money on his movies and he was just hitting a stride after the Batman movie where his future movies would have made even more.  The movie he died filming made a lot less than the Batman movie.  The theory doesn't really make sense.

       Don't let the likeability of the celebrities fool you into tunnel vision. We don't know who any of them really are we only know what they tell us. Always remember that the information given to the masses comes from those who have the power to deceive.

       But what does that have to do with facts?  I could care less about celebrities but the fact is true that Batman made a ton of money and Heath Ledger was at his most popular/critically praised after The Dark Knight came out.  He would have made a ton more money for Hollywood if he didn't die.  This idea that actors have to die in order for Hollywood to make money is ridiculous.  Adam Sandler puts out shitty movies every year that makes hundreds of millions of dollars even though they aren't even good.  People will mindlessly watch movies regardless of the actors being alive or dead.

       You are referring to them as people which is your first mistake. What you refer to as people are basically manufactured "brands" so to speak.
The illusion is that "Heath Ledger" is a flesh and blood human. The trick is that "Heath Ledger" is essentially a brand or product manufactured by the studio.
What I am saying is that in order to do good business... the big time execs who are in control of Hollywood own all the celebrity names/images. These big Hollywood companies create back stories/legends about their product (the CELEBRITY) and hire an actor who is signed to a NDA to play the role
      </p>
      <p>
       This allows for total control of the "Celebrities Name" brand and keeps the person playing "Celebrities Name" controlled.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the actor behind the character has a drug problem and gets into trouble... the studio who owns the personality  doesn't have to deal with a scandal because the actor is on record for doing whatever he did but not the fabricated character who doesn't really exist. The Hollywood execs save themselves from lawsuits this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another reason this is done is to prevent talent from going to rivals. Lets talk about the  recording artist Prince here as he is a good example. 
  In order to still be relevant after a dispute with the higher ups. Prince changes his stage name to a SYMBOL and starts calling himself "the artist formerly known as prince".
This is technically is not breaking his contract and allows him to work become independent, free from the overlords who own "Prince" and everything about "it".

       But Heath Ledger was a flesh and blood human... that was his birth name.  Hollywood didn't invent this name and then assign it to some random actor who also had a 2nd name.  Heath Ledger was his actual name.  You can look at his yearbook and birth certificate, etc and see he was real.  People who knew him when he was a kid knew him as Heath Ledger.  To believe that he was really somebody else who Hollywood assigned the title "Heath Ledger" to, you would have to believe that every single person from his parents to his school teachers to his neighbors and childhood friends all are lying about actually knowing him.  This is absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as your idea that this protects Hollywood execs in some way from anything an actor does that is also ridiculous.  That is like saying if I work for McDonalds and then in my free time I get drunk and crash my own car into a family killing them all McDonalds will somehow be held responsible for my actions.  That's simply not true.  It's no different in Hollywood.  Actors there have a screen actor's guild which is basically their union that gets them their insurance and shit.  Hollywood Execs have no responsibility for any actor's actions regardless of their names.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as your point about Prince goes.. Artist's hire a lawyer (typically their agent) to hash out their contract.  Their contract will be whatever they both decide on.  If an artist is an idiot and signs the rights to his name and image away that is under his own doing.  That isn't some name trickery done by anybody.  I know people in the music industry and they are who they say they are and they weren't assigned fake names or anything like that.

       I am not going to touch these statements in depth because you provide 0 proof and do not back up your claims. You are making assumptions based off of your flawed viewpoint.

       Just Google Heath Ledger.... you can find all sorts of information about him as a child thru his adult years.  All of this information would have to be manufactured... So everyone (including his parents who speak of him as Heath Ledger and his siblings who also do the same) would have to be in on it.  That is crazy.  Especially when there is no benefit to Hollywood or anyone else for lying like this.  This doesn't protect Hollywood in any way or create more profit for them.  It's just senseless.  It's a conspiracy for no sake.

       Oh ok so you don't actually know people in the music industry that know why Prince did what he did like your earlier claim.

      <p>
       But google sure  is to be trusted unquestionably. Did you hear that
they are even fact proofing their search algorithms now? 
Hahaha give me a break . Heath Ledger's Mom? his Family? How can a studio owned identity have such things?

       The answer is more actors, there is an endless supply of them and they are filiming green screen stock clips round the clock in ariziona that will be used years later in future boogieman stories

       So every actor has an entire history made up and actors pretending to be their families and friends and teachers etc?  That seems like it'd cost a hell of a lot of money.. certainly more than could be gained by doing this.  Again.. why would this be done?  What purpose would this serve that a simple contract couldn't handle?  Instead of just believing that Heath Ledger was a real person (as all information suggests... you can view his yearbook and see him in there with the name "heath ledger") you believe that he was just some random guy who was given a fake name and that every single person he knew his entire life is lying about who they are.. but why?  How does that make Hollywood any more money.  If anything it costs them money because they have to pay off hundreds of people.  There's simply no good reason for this.  It's literally a conspiracy just for the sake of a conspiracy.  Not to mention a lot of actors and actors' families are still alive.. so you can literally go and meet people and find out for yourself what is true and what is bullshit.  It wouldn't be very difficult to meet someone who knows a famous actor from his childhood.

       And I do know people in the music industry.  My best friend from college does directing/production work and one of the bands that he worked with is the Lumineers because he went to high school with 2 of the guys in the band.  They are a very popular band and the 2 guys my buddy was friends with in high school have the same names now that they did before their band got famous.  I never claimed that I knew Prince or that anyone I knew in the music industry knows Prince.  I simply said that I know people in the industry who have their own names that they were born with and are still successful.  Artists have contracts drawn up with record labels.  Everything you are saying needs to happen by way of fake names is unnecessary.  Legal contracts handle everything.  You are creating a conspiracy where none is needed.  There is no benefit to it.

       However you repeatedly and tactically asking questions, the same questions again and again after I have already answered them with my inital posts. This leads me to believe that this is a dead end conversation.
You are either someone who is unable to think outside of their pre conditioned subconscious thought pattern, unknowingly stuck in tunnel vision....  that or you are deliberately attempting to derail the spread of this important knowledge.

       No.. Don't get patronizing and think you have some higher-level thinking that I'm incapable of.  I just see no sense in what you are saying and I question if you ever actually thought it thru.  You can't explain how your little theory is more profitable to anyone.  This is one of the flimsiest conspiracies I ever heard and it's an example of why this sub gets berated for being full of loons.  You invented an entire conspiracy which would require paying off hundreds-thousands of people to accomplish something that any standard contract would accomplish for free.  And I'm not taking you out of context.. Our whole conversation is public.. The entire context is there.

       Is it really though? Actors, especially these actors, produced much more alive then they will dead. Especially when you consider the billions in movie revenue lost to films that hadn't even been started yet. I don't think people like you have though in any great detail about what you have posted.

       Respecting your right to have an opinion and respecting your opinion are totally different. If this were a discussion you wouldn't be so hostile to opposing opinions. If you were really interested in "free thinking" than you would recognize my right to an opinion and engage me in real discussion instead of getting offended and whining about the sub guidelines.

       I know calling somebody a troll or a shill is an easy way to try to devalue their opinion but I think it's pretty clear that im not a troll.

       Anyone can be a troll and not even realize it due to simple conditioning. 
 I and most others in this modern "civilization" have always been somewhat conditioned into believing whatever we are taught by so called authority. But you can fight back if you take the first step and realize that we are just simple meat sacks who have been programmed over time subconsciously to think a certain way. When our belief system is challenged it is a natural impulse to lash out but you can train yourself over time to use that impulse to expand your mind and think from another perspective.

       Well I don't think people like you have anywhere CLOSE to enough information to make statements like that. You have no idea what goes on behind the scenes, legally or financially, so who are you to assert anything to the contrary?
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel that these actors are killed for other reasons, and the fact that they "almost didn't finish their last movie" is just the final way to capitalize on the "tragedy".
      </p>
      <p>
       The amount of lawyers and producers and others trying to get money out of these celebrities is ridiculous. Not to mention the potential for these "tragic accidents" to only happen to the celebrities that refuse to go along with the plan and stay in their lane. Just ask Randy Quaid!

       Obviously, that is just a single example. Do your own research, there's plenty out there on this topic... once you filter out all the religious, Illuminati, satanism bullshit, that is.

       It makes sense that you think those perspective are bullshit, and you watch television and post about basketball games.  You're not fully aware.  I very much recommend you never watch TV again.  I've gone 14 years and it's great.

       You need to expand on your own personal definition on what a "role" is. The hint here is a role isnt just a spot in a movie or a part in a play, it can mean something far more sinister. Acting is lying, when its entertainment that is OK but there are more than just entertainment roles out there for these actors, and there are no shortage of actors.

       You know, you started well by saying 'maybe' in the thread title, but then totally lost it by treating everyone who opposes your opinion like an asshole. You can post ridiculous theories if you like, but expect intelligent opposition.

       Ledgers performance as Joker was incredible. He would have gone on to make billions of dollars for Hollywood after that. The Dark Knight Rises made more than The Dark Knight, and I'm pretty sure Tom Hardy is still alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Profits of the Fast and Furious Franchise have been consistently improving massively since the 4th movie. Fast 6 made over
       <em>
        1 billion dollars.
       </em>
       And killing the main character is a good way to continue profiting from this franchise you think? The next one will be a dud now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, hollywood kills people as all these shady elite groups do. This does not mean what you're saying in this completely ridiculous thread. Thanks for making me waste 5 minutes of my time.

       The form is simply an example of the corrupt government system in the United States of America. I am sure  3Try8 that if you try and are determined enough you may possibly find forms for other states where you might possibly see a box similar to the Florida form that allows this Pseudonym loophole to corrupt government.
