       I am talking about the taxes they collect. And the inflations they create. Would like to hear what you think about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       (I come from India. And I was learning about the Federal Reserve conspiracy, and they seem to be a privately owned institution. And that Obama is planning a bigger evil scheme by taxing people and using that money to help immigrants.
       <del>
        His name, after all, has "Hussein" in it.
       </del>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       Would like to know what do you think the American government is doing with our money? Any links or conspiracy theory backed up with facts will be helpful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: That Hussein concept weren't my words - I read it here on Reddit. Found it interesting, and funny, and thought that it was "extreme."

       Well, considering that Cern's electromagnets are 100,000x stronger than earth's natural magnetosphere, they can just crank that bitch up and tear away the atmosphere, no portal opening necessary.

       I'm open minded. Why would a conspiracy of governments, along with the top scientific minds, be bent on destroying earth? If it was just incompetence and you just seem to know better than them, it wouldn't really be a conspiracy. You'd be in
       <a href="/r/science">

       If I may without being hate dved, but maybe not upvoted because it's not what you were looking for, they're not using to it collyapse the earth. Though it is a bluff to higher power. All that said, I can safely say, cern doesn't accidently create a black hole or intentionally. The earth is staying put. Tpt(shouldn't)b would never blow up the only place that substains life, and certianly not while on it. They like death rituals, but not thier own lol

       This might be part of their strategy. They have a long way to go to catch up and may not want to rock the boat. They are also quite nutty. Conspiracy culture is unknown to the past generation. The younger generation is a little aware, but feel helpless and parents are hard to convince. In any case, India is relaxing place to be after all is said and done. I'm from India too.

       His Obamacare. I read stories of people paying every month, even though they are healthy. And if they refuse to pay, the IRS comes knocking their doors (please correct me, if I am wrong).
      </p>
      <p>
       And then there are lies told by Obama.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am just wondering if there is any connection to Federal Reserve and Obama. Or why Obama is taxing people so much (again, I believe the taxes have gone up in the last few years).
      </p>
      <p>

       Uhhh.... you don't seem to understand the concept of insurance. I think a single-payer public system would be much preferable. The "Obamacare" model is actually the idea of the far-right wing Heritage Foundation. We should call it "HeritageCare".
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't have enough money to pay for your own insurance than there are plans that cover you. If you do have enough money and just don't want to pay, then you are just manufacturing the problem.

       The Federal Reserve was setup over a hundred years ago. It's been crooked this whole time without Obama's help. He is uncomfortably close to Wall Street money. The bailout could have been handled better, probably because of that favoritism.

       Taxes are at a historically low. We are right about where we were before the Great Depression, low taxes, soaring income disparity, etc.

       is a swamp of misinformation. The things that the mods tag, like the sidebar about George HW Bush assassinating JFK, are usually on the money. There really is something to that. Fascinating reading.

       His name, after all, has "Hussein" in it.  Idiotic statement.  Take part in India's anti gmo, natural seed movement and smarten' up kiddo.
Helping immigrants is far from evil. Should he only use his own money... so much evil in this world and you say the dumbest possible stuff

       You need to learn to read in a more intelligent way. Im sorry if i attacked..that was wrong of me. But you need to know.. having Hussein in your name means nothing. Helping "immigrants" is not evil or bad or a negative.. and taxes ALWAYS go up, directly or indirectly. When you read that obama is taxing us MORE, its usually a propaganda tactic being aimed at programs designed to help the poor/"middle class". Trillions get spent on shredding childrens bodies with bombs and bullets, directly paid for by "our" tax dollars. We pay countries like Israel BILLIONS to massacre women and children and men.. but when someone needs $180 dollars a MONTH for FOOD, cold food at that, no hot food/cooked food alowed, and they get it from a food stamp program, you will come across articles and individuals claiming we are taxed too much for it. You want to cut taxrs? Cut the war/black budgets.let the children eat something and cut the taxes from the machine gunsand bone snaping, skin melting,  body contorting weaponry. Google that. Google THE WAR  ON THE POOR

       Thank you so much. Great answer. As far as helping immigrants is concerned, the conservatives believe that the citizenship that is given to them is unfair. They get the job. And a permanent entry into the United States. If that wasn't enough, they didn't have to pay tax and even get tax money from the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this isn't right. Or at least that's what "they" have been saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Didn't know the government is using these tax dollars for such purposes. Now, how does this impact the economy? I am watching videos of US economy crash, and want to know your thoughts on this. How does the money used for something else, something possibly unnecessary, impact the country and its people?

       Sorry if the "Hussein" comment was extreme. As mentioned in the title, I am looking for "extreme" conspiracy answers. And I know, adding Hussein bit is an extremely silly thing to do... but I "read" this right here, found it funny, and posted it.

       Inflation is a funny term because it can implicate product price or money supply. The Fed targets the average joe schome's purchasing power in its published policy reports (gas, milk, bread, etc) while doing the money supply magic in the background.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many American's, if surveyed, would know that very recently the Fed instituted the payment of interest to banks holding excess reserves on its, the Fed's, balance sheet?

       The following scenario is purely hypothetical. Well, partially hypothetical:
      </p>
      <p>
       Inflation is one thing. Hyperinflation is another. You can thank the Fed for this and the end of the USD as we know it, once it occurs. At which point, be prepared to welcome the arrival of a newfound EU-like currency for the NAU region, a digital, possibly silver-backed currency previously referred to as the Amero. In the meantime, expect QE to drag on, as the national debt continues to rise and asset bubbles continue to inflate solely for the of benefit certain banks for the privilege holding our economy hostage. Wages will remain stagnant, jobs will continue to be outsourced, and new trade agreements will only worsen the problem as inequality rises substantially as a result, until we reach that breaking point, the bubble bursts and hyperinflation takes hold. And it will only get 'better' from there.

       If I may without being hate dved, but maybe not upvoted because it's not what you were looking for, they're not using to it collyapse the earth. Though it is a bluff to higher power. All that said, I can safely say, cern doesn't accidently create a black hole or intentionally. The earth is staying put. Tpt(shouldn't)b would never blow up the only place that substains life, and certianly not while on it. They like death rituals, but not thier own lol
