<p>(I come from India. And I was learning about the Federal Reserve conspiracy, and they seem to be a privately owned institution.

<p>Would like to know what do you think the American government is doing with our money? Any links or conspiracy theory backed up with facts will be helpful.</p>

<p>Edit: That Hussein concept weren&#39;t my words - I read it here on Reddit. Found it interesting, and funny, and thought that it was &quot;extreme.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uhhh.... you don&#39;t seem to understand the concept of insurance. I think a single-payer public system would be much preferable. The &quot;Obamacare&quot; model is actually the idea of the far-right wing Heritage Foundation. We should call it &quot;HeritageCare&quot;.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t have enough money to pay for your own insurance than there are plans that cover you. If you do have enough money and just don&#39;t want to pay, then you are just manufacturing the problem.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve was setup over a hundred years ago. It&#39;s been crooked this whole time without Obama&#39;s help. He is uncomfortably close to Wall Street money. The bailout could have been handled better, probably because of that favoritism. </p>

<p>Taxes are at a historically low. We are right about where we were before the Great Depression, low taxes, soaring income disparity, etc.</p>

<p>Whoever is telling you things about America is doing you a great disservice. Stop listening to them. They can&#39;t be trusted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need to learn to read in a more intelligent way. Im sorry if i attacked..that was wrong of me. But you need to know.. having Hussein in your name means nothing. Helping &quot;immigrants&quot; is not evil or bad or a negative.. and taxes ALWAYS go up, directly or indirectly. When you read that obama is taxing us MORE, its usually a propaganda tactic being aimed at programs designed to help the poor/&quot;middle class&quot;. Trillions get spent on shredding childrens bodies with bombs and bullets, directly paid for by &quot;our&quot; tax dollars. We pay countries like Israel BILLIONS to massacre women and children and men.. but when someone needs $180 dollars a MONTH for FOOD, cold food at that, no hot food/cooked food alowed, and they get it from a food stamp program, you will come across articles and individuals claiming we are taxed too much for it. You want to cut taxrs? Cut the war/black budgets.let the children eat something and cut the taxes from the machine gunsand bone snaping, skin melting,  body contorting weaponry. Google that. Google THE WAR  ON THE POOR</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you so much. Great answer. As far as helping immigrants is concerned, the conservatives believe that the citizenship that is given to them is unfair. They get the job. And a permanent entry into the United States. If that wasn&#39;t enough, they didn&#39;t have to pay tax and even get tax money from the government. </p>

<p>All this isn&#39;t right. Or at least that&#39;s what &quot;they&quot; have been saying.</p>

<p>Didn&#39;t know the government is using these tax dollars for such purposes. Now, how does this impact the economy? I am watching videos of US economy crash, and want to know your thoughts on this. How does the money used for something else, something possibly unnecessary, impact the country and its people?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The following scenario is purely hypothetical. Well, partially hypothetical:</p>

<p>Inflation is one thing. Hyperinflation is another. You can thank the Fed for this and the end of the USD as we know it, once it occurs. At which point, be prepared to welcome the arrival of a newfound EU-like currency for the NAU region, a digital, possibly silver-backed currency previously referred to as the Amero. In the meantime, expect QE to drag on, as the national debt continues to rise and asset bubbles continue to inflate solely for the of benefit certain banks for the privilege holding our economy hostage. Wages will remain stagnant, jobs will continue to be outsourced, and new trade agreements will only worsen the problem as inequality rises substantially as a result, until we reach that breaking point, the bubble bursts and hyperinflation takes hold. And it will only get &#39;better&#39; from there.</p>
