    <div class="md"><p>All of the black powder makes a big puff of smoke when detonated. It was more just a loud, scary, smoke bomb, with no real destructive force. The destruction was just a result of the post-production work.</p>

<p>But of course, they banked on people not asking questions like you or me... We don&#39;t know how bombs work, so just listen to what they tell you happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you think that hundreds-thousands of people are just faking this?  All of the people there and their families and the emergency responders and the doctors and the nurses?  They are all just play-acting?  And the nurses and doctors who were in on it still continue to work at the hospitals because they are actually real doctors and nurses outside of being actors?  Wouldn&#39;t it just be easier to set off real bombs if this whole thing was a set up?</p>

<p>Also was Tsarnaev in on it?  Or did he just coincidentally leave his backpack where an explosion was going to be and start running away just before it explodes?  He an actor too?</p>

<p>Unless there&#39;s a cover story that keeps the govs name out of people mouth. There&#39;s also a hidden contigency plan, imho.  Kind of like the retracted part of 9/11 potentially implicating the Saudis.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that there was a lot of fuckery afoot.  The Saudi kid who was their initial person of interest who was hospitalized with shrapnel in his leg was a key element to this.  His father is a Saudi dignitary who rubs shoulders with our government.  They also have close ties to terrorists.  Obama had this kid flown back to Saudi Arabia in the middle of the night while the FBI still wanted him for questioning.  After that the media stopped reporting about him all together and once the Tsarnaev brothers were the targets they immediately went with the story about these 2 brothers who were acting on their own.  There is no doubt that Saudi kid had a hand in this.  When people just blow the whole thing off as &quot;the bombs were fake and everyone was acting and nobody was actually hurt&quot; it makes everyone asking legitimate questions look crazy.  Look how the 9-11 truth movement looks ridiculous now.  A group of people started saying there were no planes and those were actually holograms and now everyone associated with the truth movement looks crazy.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree that they Tsarnaev brothers could have been a part of something bigger.  I was asking questions of the person who said that the bombs were actually just smoke bombs and the destruction was just the result of &quot;post production work.&quot;  I ask these questions because I honestly believe these people haven&#39;t thought it thru.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glenn Beck actually ran with the Saudi thing for a while after the mainstream media dropped it.  I don&#39;t normally listen to him but he at least kept asking about it.  It is awfully unorthodox to ship a kid back to Saudi Arabia when he&#39;s the prime suspect in a terror attack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would you submit the most outlandish version of the story as the general consensus? It&#39;s dishonest. The most likely alternative to the orthodox theory is that the feds equipped and enabled the Tsarnaevs but didn&#39;t take them down before it happened. That has nothing to do with hundred of thousands of people and crisis actors and whatever that nonsense about the nurses was.</p>

<p>If that&#39;s how you approach all unorthodoxy, it&#39;s no small wonder why you are so bent out of shape.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not bent out of shape but the person I was commenting to said that it wasn&#39;t actually a bomb.. it was just a smoke bomb.  I was responding to that.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that&#39;s what some people believe. Or say they believe. Or model what they think you should believe. Or put forth to stretch the extremes, to push it to the fringe. A lot of people are deceived by these tactics.</p>

<p>If that&#39;s what they actually believe, they can be left to their own devices, they&#39;re largely irrelevant. In all other cases ignoring it saves you time and resources.</p>

<p>The feds don&#39;t hire actors, they&#39;ll just fucking kill people. If they get caught they can just say they saved 1.1 people by doing it. </p>

<p>Gene Rosen and the Harley guy are suspect as fuck though. Fake ass witnesses are one thing, crisis actors quite another.</p>

Most people think there is some sort of conspiracy allowing police to go around murdering people and then getting off without even being charged... but suddenly in this one case the government is extremely concerned with morals and decides &quot;I&#39;m definitely gonna fuck with the public... then I&#39;m gonna use millions of dollars of tax payer dollars to shut down a city and then eventually hold a trial... I&#39;m gonna drag this entire event on for years... but I&#39;m also still somehow moral because I&#39;m gonna trick everyone with actors instead of having anyone actually die or get hurt...

    <div class="md"><p>Do you generally cherry pick one sentence from a broader argument as if that&#39;s witty? Obviously everyone understands how bombs work: explosions suck for those nearby. But what they were clearly implying was that most are not <em>experts</em> when it comes to how they work, so the assumption is that the public is supposed to passively listen to the experts, thus not question it. But when two bombs go off in a dense crowd of people and only a handful are injured.... How can you not question that?</p>

<p>This same &quot;shrapnel&quot; that magically tore countless people&#39;s pants, yet left the skin beneath perfectly intact.  Sans the fake ass legless actor Jeff Bauman.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But most people think they at least allowed thousands of people to die on 9-11.  Most people believe they killed their own president in 1963.  Most people think there is some sort of conspiracy allowing police to go around murdering people and then getting off without even being charged... but suddenly in this one case the government is extremely concerned with morals and decides &quot;I&#39;m definitely gonna fuck with the public... then I&#39;m gonna use millions of dollars of tax payer dollars to shut down a city and then eventually hold a trial... I&#39;m gonna drag this entire event on for years... but I&#39;m also still somehow moral because I&#39;m gonna trick everyone with actors instead of having anyone actually die or get hurt... Psychologically torturing the public isn&#39;t immoral at all...this way nobody will ever be mad about it.&quot;</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>
