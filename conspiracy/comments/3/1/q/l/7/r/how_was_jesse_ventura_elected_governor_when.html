       The name "Jesse Ventura" is a pseudonym (fake name) that is not even registered to his person. Doesn't this expose a glaring loophole in the systems that be?

       He changed his last name to Ventura many years ago. Jesse is often times a nickname for James. Not that complicated.

       There's no law that says you can't go by nickname in office.

       You know "Bill Clinton" isn't his real name as well I would imagine.

Exactly, all you need is a 3rd party to vouch for your identity no I.D. is needed to be the president of the "Country" (Coporation)
The possible conflict of interests are endless.... it astonishes me how you could shrug this off as no big deal.

       You really think someone could possibly ever get even a million miles within becoming president without an ID....?

       You think we need that as a rule? That's like making a rule that in order to be president you must be a living person... it's useless as it will never matter

       No what needs to happen is the loophole needs to be closed allowing the use of pseudonyms in public office. Here is Candidate Oath form that I found on the internet from Florida to show you that I am not full of shit.

       Please tell me a single hypothetical that is even slightly possible where this could make any difference in any possible way. You seem very upset but there is literally no instance or theoretical situation where it matters one bit.

       You honestly don't see how hiding behind a pseudonym in public office therefore disconnecting all accountability to your true identity isn't an problem? You can tell me how I seem and attempt to marginalize me and downvote the Flordia Oath of Office form all you want but that won't stop people from waking up to this con.

       Did you know there's also a loophole that a zombie with no heartbeat and no blood can be president too? If he is a zombie and signs the forms and is the proper age... he can do it!

       You have literal actors who could be using disguises to pass themselves off as "ANY FUCKING NAME AT ALL" who weasel their way into the government with help from others of their kind. You also can run state to state and use fake names trying to get elected and if you fail you can just pack up and try again elsewhere until it works.

       Wow... there is so much wrong with what you've said.. I cannot believe you aren't a troll.
      </p>
      <p>
       What exactly are you going to run for 'state after state after state'?
      </p>
      <p>
       Governer? Pretty much every state you have to prove you have been a resident for 5 years previous to running.
      </p>
      <p>
       Senator? You have to be a resident of the state. Also, you aren't going to be running from multiple states and not get noticed ... that is retarded...
      </p>
      <p>
       How about a Town mayor? Practically every single town has a residency clause, as well as a "you must be a resident for X many years" to run for even small town mayor.
      </p>
      <p>
       What the hell are you going to run for here that will even let you on the ballot, let alone from state to state to state?

I committed /worldnews thought-crime by withholding judgement on MH17. The accusation that I was part of "Putin's FSB" went viral in the thread and I was gang-downvoted and targeted with creepy PM's. by shark_shank in conspiracy

       It's funny that my point was basically that a lot of people actually can't stand disagreement, and go straight to crying shill.

       And this is my thread so i'll respond how I want, another effect is you could have a massive conflict of interest say two brothers who have the same loyalty/ties to whatever corporations that can use fake names and run against each other ensuring that the political seat is bought.

       So i call you out for ad hominem arguments, and you proceed to say "Who cares"  "it's an insane thought" in your next post, real smart. Then you bring a RED HERRING argument into the mix by talking about OBAMA who used the very LOOPHOLE to be elected as a senator and was vouched by Nancy Pelosi. 
  Sure he released some nonsense after they marched out that gatekeeper Orly Taitz to make a fool out of the entire thing, but that doesn't change the fact that this loophole is there. They ARE faking their way into office LEGALLY and their peers KNOW and are HELPING them.

       I gave it a genuine look and still don't see why it matters. If he wanted to run as "Bamboloo  Bamboobear" who cares? What would that negatively effect? In what way would the people he represents be harmed because of a pseudonym?

       So you agree that you're wrong? Because I could charge Bamboloo Bamboobear if that was the name they went by. You don't need their name. I can charge "that guy over there" if I want to.

       That's not how any of this works. That's what Freemen on the Land think, and they're some next-level stupid. You aren't magically immune to prosecution just because they don't know your name. If that was true then everybody who got arrested just wouldn't say their name.

       If you want to charge somebody who's name you don't know, you can. They'll just arrest "the person known as" and then whatever descriptor you gave them. It's not a red herring, its an objective fact that directly contradicts your view.

       Exactly but that allows time for them to retire the character with whatever scandal they concoct and a real scandal or crime involving "the person known as" who is not the name we are familar with goes unreported.

       This is some fascinating paranoia. Usually my thoughts on schizophrenic delusions are "that would be terrifying if true." But this is the exact opposite. It's "parts of this could be true but you need to be ill to care or think its a problem."
