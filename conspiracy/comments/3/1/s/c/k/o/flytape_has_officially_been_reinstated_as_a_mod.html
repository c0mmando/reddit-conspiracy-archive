       By a vote of 80% for and 20% against the mod team has re-instated Flytape as a mod of
       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
        /r/Conspiracy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       We realize that there are a select few subscribers here that will be vehemently against this move but we feel that it's best for the entirety of the sub in light of the value he brings to the mod team and in spite of his penchant for inciting controversy. He has a unique ability to spot the embedded detractors of this sub and spends a lot of time in other subs as a means to that end.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please consider this post a free-for-all. This will be an absolute free speech thread. Say anything you like. NO RULES WILL BE ENFORCED (except
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/rules">
        Reddit's sitewide rules
       </a>
       of course).
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if you have anything to say about it say it here and now. Then we're going to move on and continue to try to make this sub what it was intended to be... discussions about conspiracies, actual or theoretical, real or imagined and, as always, controversial.

       Who knows and who cares? Man I have become the poster child for zoloft when talking about reddit. I deal with lego more. Its the only real topic and sub I care enough about to have a view I will defend if challenged
      </p>
      <p>
       Mainly cause for the most part its a good sub with good people. Plus playing lego with my (6) years old tommrow son is a fucking blast. Debating the inner workings of reddit or bitching about a person that wants to become a mod for free really isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub is full of hate and fucked upness lol. So many are quick to call you a shill or worse as soon as you don't agree with them. You post a link to defend your view and its from a shit site with no creditability to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The user base of this sub is what killed it. Not the mods. It was all the people that started posting shit about current news topics that devolved this sub. Used to be like an art bell coast to coast episode in here. I liked that. Then it became like an episode of Rush.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you participated in the circle jerk you became accepted. I was sucked in too. Then I saw the truth one day and all this sub was about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its all a lie. They want you to be upset so you create more content. Happy people don't make for good posters. Everyone wants drama so they can think to them self that they are better then that. Truth is we are not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not a fucking one of us on this planet.

       Used to have the hatred bother me so much. These days I see its just others wanting to start and argument. I have come to think that most of the arguments are created so the reddit higher ups can get a bonus check.

       Tag them and be done. That way you know forever. Well till you get shadowbaned, and have to make a new account. Then do it again so you stay busy. Lol.

       You can see them clearly in this thread, remember their names and now glance through posts made in the last 2 hours and you will notice multiple posts calling for him and the rest of our mods to be removed. This is clearly a brigade attempt to mess up our sub in any way they can. Frankly I would not be mad if Flytape banned these guys.

       Mess up the sub because the community doesn't want moderators that ban people for no reason and act like 12 year old girls?  How dare we want the moderators of the community to act like adults, instead they throw tantrums, attack members of the community, and ban people who disagree with them.

       Here is my two cents. I felt mr_dong made the appropriate decision after Flytape swung the ban hammer out of spite. I do not think a mod that compromises his ethics of censorship over petty insults should remain a mod. Sorry Fly, but that's my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I do believe that Flytape should be given an opportunity to make his defense, and let the community decide whether he stays or goes. In an open vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       By open I mean with Yays and Nays, not upvotes. In order for your vote to count you must comment Yay or Nay. In effort to limit trolls, socks, and Tards I suggest we come up with voter standards. My suggestion would be that they must be a contributor (comment or post). Have a minimum account age of at least 3 months, and of course no posts history to anti-conspiracy sub-reddits.

      </p>
      <p>
       1)
       <strong>
        An "official podcast" was released on Friday night by AssuredlyAThrowAway and the first guest was Flytape

      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        He was wearing a weird mask

       <li>
        He was smoking a vape-pen

       <li>
        He had a trippy shifting background animation
       </li>
       <li>
        The Podcast lasted a few hours

       It appears to be that as you said, having him on gives us all a bad name. This sub reddit is a community of people.

       Well,  you have my vote,  for whatever that's worth. You keep a rational balance. The problem with a growing/controversial sub is promoted mods cant be 100% vetted. Noone can really. Politics at every level is an eternal struggle .  Everyone has their own personal feelings,  agendas,  bias etc.  One thing I've learned is to take each comment on its own merit.  For every Jim cole,  there's a rockran or drytruth.  It's unfortunate really,  but thanks for fighting the good fight.

       Frankly, I haven't seen much of any benefits from the moderation here to date.  Shills still run rampant.  Votes are brigaded without any regard.  Innocent members are banned.  /New is flooded by a small well-defined group of shills, likely to dilute meaningful discovery and discussion here.

       Not only do I agree with the critiques that you have made previously, I fully commend your insight into this problem. I believe that everyone who frequents this sub and contributes, should have the ability to vote on the moderators, hold elections, through a democratic process, majority winning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though this is not necessarily the best form of voting as there will always be a dissenting opinion (see John Jacques Rousseau on democracy in the Social Contract). I do believe it is the best for the community to have their voices be heard, whether in favor or against.

       I am not here to attack any mod or other members, but to voice my opinion that we should keep "power positions" in rotation. Let other hardworking contributors also get chance to mod this sub. This will keep everything balanced and  hopefully unnecessary extremism can be avoided.

       Because of the actions and performance by 2 mods (axolotl and flytape) last year around 9/11, Abby Martin decided she would never perform an AMA here. Ben Swann also declared that the toxicity and focus of the place is too risky to be associated with after all the hitler and holocaust stickies.

       From my point of view this axol guy is lieing. My face to face communication is a better source than him sending an email to Abby's brother and not getting a response. That's not considered being in contact with the person in my opinion.

       People are listening to him because they can't trust their mods; which is incredibly annoying in a sub about uncovering the truth.

       I've always liked you Axo, but try looking at this whole mess from an outsiders perspective, not from the POV of a mod on the team. Things are getting shady as fuck in this sub.

       Can you tell me how many people were involved in the vote for Flytape's reinstatement? I'm going to assume that there were 5 people present with only one voting against Fly's reinstatement.

       That may be true, but my point is that he's
       <em>
        lying
       </em>
       (or is misinformed) and people are still listening.

       For a sub devoted to uncovering the truth, as you say, this is the first huge red flag.

       How on earth is he getting upvoted for saying Abby Martin refused to do an AMA here when he
       <em>
        clearly
       </em>
       is confusing her for Karen Hudes?

      <p>
       What I can tell you is that I'm a little confused as to where the 80%-20% came from. Even mr_dong didn't object to Flytape's return. As far as I could tell, no mods unequivocally voted against it, although some expressed hesitance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, we have a few largely inactive mods, so obviously they didn't participate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially, all the mods that actively participate in this sub supported this decision.

       This is kind of exactly what the guy is talking about. You don't really seem to be looking at it from a sub perspective, only a mod perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think the huge red flag is a possibly misinformed person, when the INSANELY MASSIVE red flag is that a huge percentage of people here have lost confidence and trust in the moderation team.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats the difference between a mod and a sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       The worst part is that most people only lost confidence in 1 person, but now we've lost it in the whole team for the way they handled that 1 person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not that I'm guessing it matters, we all know from past experience the subs don't really matter here. You guys have shown you can do as you want, it'll blow over each time with only a slightly heavier buildup from the last time carrying over.

       Does content also mean nothing to you? As a moderator I would have thought that maybe you'd have the logic to realize content is more important.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of us talk about things here we don't want tied to us for our own safety. Thus new accounts afford us such safety.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not that it matters, all I've seen you do is quote people's post history, and ignore all actual content.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like you've just done. I'll bet that you can't even recognize any concerns outside of your mod mentality, all you do is go defense mode instead of understanding mode.

       I'd watch a 5 hour vid of Slavoj Zizek in moonlanding quality if the content is interesting as is always the case with Zizek, but Flytape is making one cringe up to a point where one does not expect more cringing ever even remotely possible.

       It's hard to keep track, but most of this drama appears to be coordinated by a handful of accounts (and their alts).  I'm really happy  about the decision but it's also means the ante has been upped.  The wedge to divide has been set.

       just because this is a "free speech thread" doesn't mean you can spam it incessantly with filth, so I've removed some of your extra insulting comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just edit one of your remaining comments with what you want to say, don't spam the shit out of this thread.

       EDIT: nevermind. Spam away.

       Obviously that's not what I intended. I just assumed that it would make sense to post at most two comments with everything you wanted to say instead of 20 and turning the thread into a clusterfuck.

       Yes, but where does the "money" come from (and I put it in quotes because it exists only as a piece of paper and/or as 0's on a computer screen)?  What I'm suggesting is that money is an
       <em>
        idea

       invented by man.  And not just "man", but men - some specific ones.

       Damnit man you making me think.

      <p>
       Money comes from control. Or lack their of at the time it was created. Value in elements or whatever when in practicality they are of little to no use. Take diamonds.
      </p>
      <p>
       What can you do with a diamond? Or gold. What can you do with it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Both are useless to man. But somehow it became valuable because of its scarcity. Not because of its use. Well not diamonds they are not rare really. So what someone can cut it to make it sparkly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know a place that makes the best tiramsu and that is way more useful then a fucking diamond.

       I don't know the answer to your question. It is one that should be answered.

        Money comes from control.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But did the control come first or did the money?  I've always pondered this myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, was there a group of people who controlled another group of people for some
       <em>
        other
       </em>
       reason and then realized that money would be a way to accomplish the same thing with far less effort and far greater reward?  Or did the money come first and a select group somehow take ownership over it and use it to dominate the rest of the people?

        What can you do with a diamond? Or gold. What can you do with it?

      <p>
       Well a diamond is used in tool building because of its hardness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gold is malleable, relatively rare, maintains its composition (never rusts) even after
       <em>
        thousands and thousands
       </em>
       of years, is fairly heavy and difficult to traffic, etc.  So they actually do have
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       intrinsic value or you can at least see why they might be valued - gold has been used in trading for thousands of years.
      </p>
      <p>
       For diamonds, the argument becomes more questionable because "diamonds are a girl's best friend" and all that BS was invented in the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Beers">
        19th and 20th centuries.

       I agree - in my opinion it's

       I do agree with this though to some extent, and can see how the idea of money (i.e.: store of value) could be useful.  The issue has come with this new idea of debt-based fiat, where every dollar made creates more than a dollar in debt - it's totally unsustainable.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, almost certainly worst of all, the huge majority of it is held and controlled by an incredibly small number of actual people.

       Hmm, more interesting question.  My answer would be that it's always been mostly used for trade, and in that way I could see it used effectively in the future - for instance currency backed by gold (as it has been for hundreds, in some cases thousands of years).
      </p>
      <p>
       But what we have now isn't that.  What we have now is debt owned by a small number of people who use it to siphon actual wealth from everyone else.

       Exactly my point. We as individuals have no use business and industry do. So its a system for us to gather it and them to buy it. Kinda like when the devil says your soul isnt worth anything then you would say they why do you want it so bad.

       Is this some kind of weird psy-op? I get that people are pissed with the whole podcast and they have a right to be but this 3rdeye guy is working WAY to hard (obvious to anyone following this) to get him removed for my liking. This is the same behavior we see from the people trying to take this sub down. It all feels weird and shady to me and since we've been dealing with this whole mod censorship bullshit on reddit for a while I'm hesitant to change up our mod team to drastically I guess. He'll I'm even hesitant to comment negatively about thay 3rdeye guy cuz I feel like him and what seems to be a small crew will down vote the shit out of everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess what I'm saying is when someone complains about mod corruption on other subs I lean towards it being true but when it's done here I'm very suspicious of it and I have trouble believing it's genuine because we've seen them pull this shit time and time again.

       IT has nothing to do with the podcast.  Flytape banned users for no reason so he lost his moderator privileges.   Now he has been given them back for no reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also for some reason there is a handful of users like
       <a href="/u/fakeintel">
        /u/fakeintel
       </a>
       spreading around lies trying to detract from the issue at hand which is mod abuse.  Just look threw flytapes post history.  You can see him doing everything from attacking members of the community to straight out saying everyone in this community is a bitch.   Look threw his post history for yourself and you will see the abuse.

       I have never been there but you constantly bring it up and link to it. are you a member?  Why do you keep ignoring the fact that flytapes moderator privileges were removed for abusing them not for making a podcast?  Instead of having an actual level headed adult discussion on the topic your only response is personal attacks.  Your acting like a child.

Stop trolling, your either incredibly stupid to ask a question when the answer is literally right in front of you or your a troll.  So I will give you the benifit of the doubt in that you must be a troll because no one would be that stupid.

       Maybe because his moderator powers were not removed because he made a podcast.   How do you not understand that?    He lost moderator privalage because he banned people for no reason not because he made a podcast.

       Your clearly a troll so this is it, just because the recent abuse (out of many cases) happened on a thread that was the podcast doesn't mean the situation is about the podcast.  No matter which way you swing it he lost his mod rights for banning people for no reason and abusing his powers.

       If I am a shill why have I been a part of this community for twice as long as you and have 4 times your comment score?  What exactly in my post history signifies shill?  Your account has barely any history and hasn't been on reddit for even a year.

       He would not have had his moderator powers removed several  times if this wasn't a problem.   If this was the first time he abused it would be a different story.  How many times is he gonna be allowed to abuse his powers because his friends keep giving them back?   There is a reason the community wasn't given a say in this.

       To me it looks like a guy who is heavily invested in this community... did a thing he wanted to be good and it was not I guess. I haven't listened. Dress him down but by the explanation of the mod team I get it.  We know fly tapes foibles.  He is on watch.  Of any community we know what the answer should be to who watches the watchmen?  The watched do.  That is the only answer.  From there I would strongly argue better the devil you know.  He should be dressed down severely, and maybe even have a dedicated mod to review his mod actions on occasion, remove a few privileges if possible would be great.  But I agree he should stay in some fashion.

       No matter my opinion on the matter, I think he cant be a good mod, even if he wanted to.  At this point in time flytape cant post without people downvoting just because who he is.   He can not effectively be a moderator when the community hates him and he hates much of the community.   The right thing for him to do would be to step down.  Just look at all his recent post, he is downvoted before his comments are even given thought (not saying this is right just making a point).
      </p>
      <p>
       There are basically two types of users in this sub(those who comment and those who just skim and vote) and he doesn't have very many fans in either camp as this thread proves.  Just look at all the hate and general downvotes.  At this point he just cant be effective as a mod.  Too much contempt going both ways between the community and the him  (unless the European crowd just love him and things change in 12 hours lol).  And the further this situation drags out the more distrust builds for the other moderators who gave him back his powers.

       Mods don't need respect, to do their job.  It can be useful, but at the end of the day he weilds the power and is in charge of whatever rule dispute he us policing.  And our mods are pretty good at self policing. That's all I see here honestly.  They caught him in a rage, calmed his ass down and voted he could stay.  I agree 100 percent. He isn't a cop, he is a member of this community, and has been for years.

       Until their community ups and leaves because they are sick of the abuse.  Or worse children get all worked up and next thing you know people are getting DDoSed. Imagine if 10 or 20 butthurt users got together and decided to hurt this community because the moderators do not care about the will of the community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine what would happen to the face of this sub if the new queue was manipulated by these said people?  The new queue is literally the lifeblood of this community since most people just look at the hot tab.   These users could easily control what hits the hot queue by manipulating the new queue.  Only posts with 10-15 upvotes even make it to the hot queue so they could keep everything they want suppressed downvoted while upvoting garbage filler.  Imagine those users manipulating the hot queue so its all anti-semite, radical home grown terrorist type posts; people would start unsubbing like crazy, reddit would go crazy with drama.  It wouldn't be the end of the sub, but damage could be done easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is the mods are only as powerful as their community allows them to be.  Its probably like the whole politics in the US thing though and most people don't give a fuck. This leads to small groups of people being able to manipulate the system (im talking both politics and reddit lol), so is that a good thing? and does any of this even really matter?  since the small group currently in control is the moderators and they are clearly doing what they feel is right and not asking for the communities input, and the community is content.  Wow this is really a mirror of politics in general.

       Currently our mod ding team is decent at stopping people who attempt to manipulate the queue now.  So.  If we are effective now as much as I think is reasonable, and by introducing new mods we introduce more people with potential agendas that actually are out to discredit this sub, such a person could contrive events far worse than an emotional ban or twelve from a mod to discredit and ''destroy'' this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who manipulate like that tend to get the banhammer, that is the whole point.  No it is not a democracy, it's a forum with a list of rules, first few years online?  I learned this shit in the 90s.  But guess what, organic from a small number and carefully you can manta in pretty sane and stable online communities.  The fact there is no ''head mod'' actually makes this one of the absolute most democratic social grouping systems I have used online.   Corruption happens, weird people happen, that is humanity. Any change in the people in charge is a roll of the dice.  So we rolled a 17 on the nodding of this sub so far.  Care to speed up the timeline until we need to roll again by witch hunting dedicated mods that have been around forever?

       Prove it?  I promise the mods do not do as good of job as you think.  That is just like the NSA or the DOD claiming they have been stopping all these terror plots.   You have no proof that they are doing anything.  I bet it is a hell of a lot easier to manipulate posts here then you think.

       He just made a really shitty, 3 hour long podcast along with another mod and now trolls from
       <a href="/r/subredditdrama">
        /r/subredditdrama
       </a>
       are capitalizing on the (admittedly embarassing) event to fracture the community and possibly even the mod team.

        /u/AssuredlyAThrowAway
       </a>
       pursued this project unilaterally, and did not ask for feedback from community members or mods before posting their shitty podcast as a sticky. That's what's alleged, anyway. I could be wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I know is that podcast was shit, and SRD trolls are also shit. Combine the two and it's no surprise that this whole drama is just a big pile of stinking shit.

       The IRC channel is not

       You're right, but I still think there'd be a difference between having discussed it in the IRC chat with a few other users beforehand and never announcing it at all to anyone.  But that's neither here nor there though since I don't know if it was or not, this whole thing has just been really strange and a good reminder not to take reddit too seriously.

       I mean in the sense that it isn't worth getting upset over.  At the end of the day it's just a website, despite whatever good we've done or are doing, and if the power went out tomorrow then it would be as if this site never even existed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying there isn't value here or that it isn't worth trying to make the site better, I'm just saying that I acknowledge it's been on a steady decline for years and will probably only get worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it really worth getting angry and bent out of shape because of something some anonymous stranger on the internet said?  Is bickering over meta drama really a valuable way to spend one's time?  To me it isn't.  Acknowledging and discussing issues with the site is fine but to me dwelling on them is a distraction from talking about things that actually matter.

       Well not everyone can be Howard Stern (which is something he would love since he trashes any podcast).  If its just that the podcast was a bit pants then does it really matter.  So some other dudes are making fun of it.  If he was trashing subscribers or mocking this sub then I would think its a bit strange, but hey leave them to it.

       Yeah it doesn't matter. At all. I was pointing out their mistake in acting unilaterally because if they'd asked for feedback before posting it they would have known it sucked. Its pretty lame to publish it as the "official" podcast when it fucking blows because you didn't ask your associates what they think, you know?

       So what? Really what does it matter?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does it matter what they do. If they ban you come back with a new name change your narritve and say it again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have any idea who flytape or anyone else that mods here? Do you know them as a person. They act different then they do IRL I bet. Probably a group you would let come over and fuck your sister if you have one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point is that realize reddit is entertainment. It isn't something that should matter to you or anyone else. Be you and don't worry about acceptance for your own ideas and values.

        It's not an issue that you can't find any place to post this. It is a problem that you posted it here. I will be watching your posts.

       Bwahahah.  If those upvotes are "suspicious" it's because you don't like them.  That's remarkable, that you turn an actual consensus into a fantasy conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for my comment history, look at the context.  If it's crap that belongs in a sci-fi subreddit, I say so quite firmly.  I was correct in every case.  The truth is, I should be a moderator here -- and apparently you shouldn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub is full of ridiculous nonsense, and would be nicely served by moderators who did something about that.  As things stand, if it weren't for rude subscribers, there would be no negative feedback to the remarkably crazy posters that wander through.

       That is exactly the kind of ridiculous f* **** attitude that makes me side with fly tape axoytlyl and the 80 percent.  This sub is not the place to ''filter nonsense'' and it never has been.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub is Camelot from Monty python.  It is a truly silly place, but that is, in my opinion it's value.  Cruise through and ignore the stuff you think is garbage, don't go in the comments.  If you do you could find the thread that agrees with your logic and assessments and understanding and work constructively off that, rather than having a mind to dig up the entire garden to make more space for YOUR specific favourite flower.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really, your personality is more prone to power abuses than fly tapes seeming ideology which is to push his ideas out whilst also tending the garden.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fly tape should stay if only to ward off the necessity of needing to bring more mods on again and risking having someone like YOU ''infiltrating the modding clique''

       There are mods that are friends, social circles form.  These are humans.  As to how insular those groups are it probably varies.  Not like highschool though more like an office. They all work together. And gossip. Etc. Ah life.

       ... no it really makes perfect sense to me the happenings as you call them in that context.  Some may indeed have nefarious agendas, but flytapes personality and motives fit better with an idealist who can be dragged down emotionally to making mistakes.  That is a flaw common to idealists of any stripe, and many pragmatists and others as well.  I don't see his actions totalling to a nefarious plot, quite the opposite.  I have viewed flytape as a known quantity for a while now.  One that I don't see as always agreeable on the topics he supports, but he is not misaligned with the spirit of this sub.

       Because there are raids that happen here by kids looking for a little fuckery fun and then a nice layer of actual real honest to god shills in the wild, so when the fun runners go trolling on moderation (a pretty tight moderation group at that) there will be reaction from the community too.  Because it's hard to tell friend from foe from naive and gullible asshats looking for a laugh at someone's expense in a world filled with them.

       You are doing it wrong, and the upvotes to my comments are evidence of that.  You can call them "suspicious" and make yourself look retarded, it doesn't change the fact that apparently many subscribers agree with me that you're doing it wrong.

       Of course you do.  You're the jerk devaluing what should be a credible and useful sub by posting insane science fiction as if it were fact.  My right to stalk you and downvote nonsense stems from my right to self defense.  Your behavior is dangerous to everybody.  You're effectively part of the NWO.  Each of us is either part of the problem or part of the solution.  You're the former and I am the latter.

       Your contribution, which consisted of ridiculous science fiction presented as if it were factual,  was worse by far than if you had made no post at all.  I realize you don't get that,  but it's true.  You are a net negative here and your post should have been deleted.  If only this sub had good mods.

       YOU HAVENT EVEN POSTED ANYTHING! The whole point of this sub is to talk about things, whether or not they are true. You imply that I was posting it as if it was 100% truth. So many links on here can have their authenticity or source questioned. That's what this whole sub is about, to talk about something. And you're acting as if I'm the only one who posts things like that. My comments here have gained far more points than yours have, so no, I think I'm a net POSITIVE here and YOU are the net negative. Obviously people here like what I have to say, not everything, but most/some things.

       Vaguely off-topic but if you wanted to do a podcast why the fuck not keep it audio only? It could be an interesting format, but no cringe, no hyperbole and more investigative and informative learning about views than persuasion and rhetoric.

       Why would you even call me a shill? Shills have agendas. Look at what I post, read my comments. The only agenda I have is getting rid of a moderator who has proven multiple times in the past that

        he can't be trusted with the power he has.

       He probably won't but so what if he does. Did that person deserve it from your perspective? If so then who cares.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really who fucking cares. Admin banned the mods of srd then sporkacide unbanned them for the lukz. Reddit don't matter in any aspect of anynfacet of day to day. If it does then you need to grow up.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you owe a goddamn person here man.... Really who compensated you or any other mods of this sub for your time? You are working for free. You are working for reddit for free.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about that. Do you have a real job? If so think about the time you work there for the time you also work here and do the math.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do what you want and the rest of mods here.... Ban everyone if you want. Hell I do in sub's that I mod. They piss me off boom you are gone.

       Don't have many subscribers to the ones you listed cause the legosales one was created by someone everyone hated more then me. He and I get along.

       The legocharity one is new. We don't really have many people asking for lego. If we did then we would help as many as we could.

       Into doing the podcast? nah he did it willingly, we were talking about it for at least a few days beforehand in the IRC from the sidebar, assuredly had the idea, and Flytape agreed to be the guest.

       This was their first time making one and it's unfortunate that hardly anyone is taking that into account when considering the quality.

       I know flytape is a big target, I've seen him targeted time and time again so I'm curious who is roping him into controversy.  He has a wicked relaxed stance towards non kosher conspiracies and that makes him high priority.

       The negative attention the podcast received was in my opinion, a little over the top regardless of how controversial it was. I think the 'controversy' is being blown out of proportion tbh.

       He has been and gone 3 times now since I have been on reddit. The inconsistencies with reasons is fucking retarded. Just leave him or fucking don't. You other mods will do whatever you please anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       The podcast, fucking up an iama, and reinstating a mod. This isn't a democracy. This is you telling us what you are going to do any fucking way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally flytape has never done me wrong. I like the guy. So what about his views. Didn't like the podcast when they were saying it was the oppion of the user base in this sub. Oh well he learned from that I hope.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just do what you want mods its clearly a totalitarian system on reddit. Admin, mods, and others are using this site as a platform to further their own agendas. You all are no different.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its for entertainment people let let it be that. There never was nor will there ever be free speech on reddit. You can't say what you want without being criticized. So to hell with dreaming about it. Accept you won't have it and vow to change the status quo or let it continue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moving to whoaverse or voat... Whatever akto wants to call it. Won't change these people are going to he there too. Be an adult and say fuckem. They do this to encourage you so you will post more. Therefore making more content for free.
      </p>
      <p>
       It all generates revenue for reddit. Realize that your time is their money. So if it is something you are going to say to a user then send them a message instead. Make reddit completely bare of content.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really make the difference and fuck them up. You won't do that cause you can't. You mind wants you to defend yourself.

       You want anything then pay them. Just pay them. But you can't cause reddit says no. So they are doing the best they can for free. So realize that.

       Let me get this straight
      </p>
      <p>
       1)
       <strong>
        An "official podcast" was released on Friday night by AssuredlyAThrowAway and the first guest was Flytape
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        He was wearing a weird mask
       </li>
       <li>
        He was smoking a vape-pen
       </li>
       <li>
        He had a trippy shifting background animation
       </li>
       <li>
        The Podcast lasted a few hours
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       2)
       <strong>
        Flytape bans people who are in uproar about this performance
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The users were mad because no one consulted with them properly and timely before the announcement of the podcast
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They were mad that the podcast was being used as an "official" representation of
         <a href="/r/conspiracy">
          /r/conspiracy
         </a>
         by AssuredlyAThrowAway on YouTube
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They thought Flytape was pushing hitler memes
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       3)
       <strong>
        Mr_dong comes in later due to UK timezone differential and removes the Podcast sticky due to the community uproar
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       4)
       <strong>
        The story feed has multiple threads blowing up discussing the incident
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        SRD crossposts the thread and it goes viral
       </li>
       <li>
        memes are created by users on reddit "justconspiracythings" with flytape's mask/vape-pen
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       5)
       <strong>
        Mr_dong comes back with an announcement that countless users have complained about the situation and he looked into it more.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         He finds that the podcast should not have been "official"
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         He finds that Flytape was banning people who did nothing wrong
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         He finds that the conflict is so divisive that the only way to resolve it is to remove Flytape for the overall community's benefit, even though some mods disagreed.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       6)
       <strong>
        The next day Flytape posts an apology thread
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        He magically appears on mod list again
       </li>
       <li>
        He deletes his thread after a poor response by subscribers
       </li>
       <li>
        People start posting about the deleted thread and reinstatement
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       7)
       <strong>
        SovereignMan posts an announcement thread
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The mods had a vote behind the scenes
       </li>
       <li>
        It was an 80% - 20% victory for flytape
       </li>
       <li>
        The votes will be kept in secret
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       8)
       <strong>
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        explodes in dissent
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Multiple threads with hundreds of combined comments
       </li>
       <li>
        People accusing others of being shills from SRD with no evidence
       </li>
       <li>
        People asking for transparency in the vote
       </li>
       <li>
        People complaining that Flytape abused his powers too many times
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       <strong>
        In my opinion, the huge problem before us here is - now no matter how great Flytape is, he is tainted with so many scandals just having him as a mod creates massive disruption in
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        .  This alone should result in removal from moderation powers + the fact that he abused his powers by banning people for no reason
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't his first chance, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's just my observation.

       Let someone else be a mod.  Don't bring back mods that have a sketchy past.  We don't need distractions.  There is bad shit going down in the world and this crap is just drama to distract.

       Does anyone have a link to the original podcast? I need to check this out and see if it's as bad as everyone says it is. Either way it's hilarious that there is so much pent-up, ball-shriveling rage over a failed podcast.

       It isn't about the podcast,  He has been constantly abusing his power, attacking members of our community, and banning people for no other reason other then they disagree with him.  He is a known neo nazi who in the past has panted nazi propaganda all over the sub making us look like a bunch of ignorant bigots.

       Well I personally believe that Hitler was a decent guy and the holocaust was atrocity propaganda made up by the Allied powers working in association with Zionist Jews.

       Difference is, you aren't allowed to ban people who disagree with you. I support your right to say what you believe, although I think you are an appalling person to think that way. But as long as you don't stray into hate speech and appeals to violence I will read what you have to say.

       Why do you find him appalling for having a different opinion to you?
      </p>
      <p>
       He didn't say "the Jews deserved it", or "the holocaust was awesome", he doubts the the fact that it happened and views it as propoganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reminds me of feminist logic where if you don't believe someone was raped, you are supporting rape and are a rapist etc.

       You saying the podcast is part of that tactic or the ball-shriveling rage? In my opinion the podcast was truly awful but the temper tantrum over it is the real distraction.

       I don't really care if flytape is a mod, but my fine-tuned bullshit detector was set off here and I couldn't resist:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        He has a unique ability to spot the embedded detractors of this sub.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Unverifiable as a fact and untestable as a hypothesis.  If he is the only one who can tell, how can other mods concur?  How is it known that he is correct if there is no alternative metric other than his opinion?
      </p>
      <p>
       Did the rest of the mod team actually believe this when they told themselves it or is there perhaps another reason for keeping him such as the amount of time he dedicates to detractors rather than some special powers which make him better at it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or perhaps and even more sinister reason?

       The subs here have no power, nothing you can do to the mods here. They will walk all over you because they simply have all power, and you have zero.

       Zero.

       The only way it will change is if someone takes reddit to court over false advertising.  Free speech is not protected, but the all mighty dollar is.  If some one organizes everyone who has spent money here via reddit gold, ad space, or purchaed based on the ads here, than that might get thier attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit on their wiki page boasts about the "culture of free speech" and what they built their user base on said enviornment, (or valuable list of potential buyers that draws money from advertisers.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact they have put a disclaimer on this
      </p>
      <p>
       "Please consider this post a free-for-all. This will be an absolute free speech thread. Say anything you like. NO RULES WILL BE ENFORCED (except Reddit's sitewide rules of course)."
      </p>
      <p>
       tells you they are not as advertised, and people can say they misrepresented their service, and wouldn't have spent any money here (advertisers or users) if reddit hadn't done so.
      </p>
      <p>
       And per
       <a href="http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/False+Advertising">
        http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/False+Advertising
       </a>
       the meet the conditions of the law or the violating of the law, with the injury being money spent under reddit misrepresenting them selves.

       It appears to me that some outsiders are using a video that was made (unfortunately using sub "cred" without sub approval) as an excuse to cause disruption and general havoc.  Many people slamming
       <a href="/u/flytape">
        /u/flytape
       </a>
       have recently-created accounts, although there are a few here who seem to harbor a grudge against him for being quick to draw his ban-hammer; I would probably be pissed about that if it happened to me, and depending on the circumstances, I might carry a grudge myself.  However, I don't see the video as an impeachable act.  If it hadn't been attached to the sub, none of this bee ess would've gotten traction.  No biggie.  Just don't release another vid in our name w/o our approval (and we've already been assured that won't happen).

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Not perfect?" Did you frost it with your feet?

        If somebody gave me that cake I'd probably kill myself.

       and:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is nothing in this topic that is not a complete failure on every level.

        I'm not a conspiracy theorist.

        Curious, what do you think the room Flytape was broadcasting from smells like? I'm thinking stale french fries and foot sweat.

       You've contributed nothing of value, whatsoever, to

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       It baffles me why your opinion matters on this subject, and it's equally suspicious that you're writing multiple insulting comments, with no substance, and you're getting upvoted.
      </p>
      <p>

       I don't believe that 6 million Jewish people were killed in the holocaust. I do however believe that if you add up all the homosexuals, jahovas witness, mentally ill, deformed, retarded, anyone else the Nazi party didn't like and then the Jewish then maybe.

       I think the gulf wars are about heroin and money from sub contractors. Not about freedom and the betterment of society there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think that Isis and all that terrorist shit is made up for us to praise our protectors of freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
       That TSA is a fucking joke. I work with airports all the time. When you go out to the tarmac its usually rent a cops from a third world country that can't speak English.

       So let me get this straight.
      </p>
      <p>
       A sub that has dedicated sites whose sole purposes are disruption and ridicule suddenly cares that there is a controversy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is what I want from the Mods--
-An environment where I can discuss topics of interest. A place where anything against the mainstream will not immediately down voted to oblivion. 
-I do not want to read the press release put out by the very offending party stated and reinforced as fact. 
-I do not want the best, most engaging comments down voted so they cannot be seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can get the alternative, what this place is turning into, literally anywhere. I do not care what Flytape did and honestly I don't care if he is a Mod or not as long as he does his job. His job is to make r/Conspiracy a place for Conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now watch as the offending groups down vote this and continue to execute the 'Divide and Conquer' strategy to perfection.

       It's funny how mods are just like the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       They do all kinds of shady shit and no matter what they come right back and keep on doing it, and no matter how much people raise their voice against it, it just gets ignored until it simmers down and goes away.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's interesting to see how much damage a couple of corrupt mods and users that have nothing better to do than literally conspire to seed drama and conflict for fun.
      </p>
      <p>
       Makes you wonder what someone can do when they are on a payroll.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I don't really have an opinion on Flytape, but anyone can smell the stink from miles away, and we have all seen it a hundred times already.

       That is not what any of this is about.  Flytape banned users who simply disagreed with him,  this isn't the first time he has abused his powers either.  No one in the community wanted him back, no where will you find a thread on this community where peoople are begging for his reinstatement.  He is abusive, and is gonna continue to abuse like he does EVERYTIME he is reinstated he abuses EVERYTIME.  Yet the moderators keep bringing him back why?  If this was the first time it happened this wouldn't be a big deal, but he is a racist fascist who constantly abuses his powers as moderator.   Just look threw his post history, should a moderator of a community attack members of said community?  Or should they act like an adult and not throw tantrums like children?

       If subscribers had zero power, why all the drama from the mods, then? They could just do whatever they wanted without having little sockpuppets running around insulting those of us going, "Give me a break, guys." Why spend so much time/effort to steer the opinion of subscribers? (Not doing a good job of it, from what i can see, but they're expending no little effort to manufacture drama and infighting amongst subscribers in defense of a guy who isn't really all that into conspiracies unless it's Reddit gossip-type stuff.)

       Respect was always important in my family.  It was instilled in us at an early age.  I dont know if its because my family immigrated from Sicily to Chacago in the 1920's, but for whatever reason, I have always had the old school mentality of respect being the most important thing to convey.   I give it until i'm shown otherwise.  This is otherwise.

I do and would gladly assist any way I can if you guys decide to pursue something like this in the future. We have the talent and the means to create compelling content -- have you guys ever seriously considered creating a sanctioned YouTube channel?
       </p>
       <p>
        Anyway you guys see where you went wrong, right? Speaking specifically to
        <a href="/u/flytape">
         /u/flytape
        </a>
        and
        <a href="/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway">
         /u/AssuredlyAThrowAway
        </a>
        : You made a
        <strong>
         THREE HOUR LONG
        </strong>
        podcast about subreddit drama and
        <a href="/u/flytape">
         /u/flytape
        </a>
        's related anecdotes. That is not compelling content.
       </p>
       <p>
        If your content had been interesting then the users would have forgiven you for your atrocious presentation. But it's just bad. Even for an alpha. Don't be fucking lazy. Seriously. I wouldn't turn this shit into a high school level media production class and expect to pass. Would you?
       </p>
       <p>
        It's kind of astounding that you guys didn't pursue advice from your circle before publishing this -- let alone as a sticky and an 'official' podcast. I assume you didn't because any half-impartial observer would have told you that you're out of your mind, scrap it and come up with something better. Maybe your mistake was born from arrogance and the unilateral actions you took?
       </p>
       <p>
        Something better could have been easily achieved. Just scrap the creepy, stupid, blurry ass mask/background combination and replace it with something sensible -- even a black screen with text would be preferable. Then, shorten it to about 45 minutes to an hour, because this is a test run for a podcast, not a fucking
        <strong>
         SEMINAR
        </strong>
        . Finally, talk about something interesting or compelling related to
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        . Do you know how many big stories have launched from
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        and gone viral? How about the SLC Daycare story? That weird video of those two kids who claimed satanic ritual abuse? What are your thoughts on police brutality? On the holocaust? Any cool new conspiracies you've been reading about? What's your favorite conspiracy? Do you believe in aliens?
Any of those subjects would have worked, but instead you guys jerked each other off for 3 hours and nobody wants to see that.
       </p>
       <p>
        Are any of you willing to do something like this again? If you are -- and you really should -- then it needs to be done right. I'm sure I'm not the only person who has experience in this field and could help you guys put together something compelling.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Why not make a sticky thread and ask the community about their thoughts on this sub expanding its media presence?
        </strong>
        Maybe casually poll for some talent or willing contributors? Would be a great way to reengage the community on a positive note, instead of leaving hanging on this fiasco.

       This isn't about the podcast.  Flytape has been abusing his powers as a moderator by banning people for simply disagreeing with him.  It is about whether or not the community whats to continued to be attacked by a fascist bigot.  No one in the community was asking for flytape back.  The moderators did it to further their own agenda.

       I called flytape a fascist bigot.  Are you admitting to being flytapes alternate account or are you just here to troll?  Because it is clear your not here to have an actual discussion, your not even comprehending the posts your replying to.  You just attack anyone who disagrees with you and you have no proof to back up your claims.  Anyone can look at flytapes post history and see he calls the members of this sub everything from bitches to brats.    You have done nothing but attack anyone who disagrees with you or flytape, why is that?  Why are you detracting from the point of moderator abuse and trying to make it about a podcast?

       No it is not, that is just the picture you and a small handfull of people are trying to paint.  Flytape didn't loose his moderator privileges because he made a podcast, he lost them because he abused them by banning people for no reason.

       The fact this has been sticky posted for over 8 hours now and sitting at a solid 0 should give the mods the pulse of the sub, and the opinion of the community.  No one here can respect flytape, and if the mods want to back him, they run the risk of having the same loss of respect for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that is the case, who ever wanted to turn this sub into a joke, have succeded.  Most people here are serious in their beliefs, and the activity from the mods totally undercuts them.

       Here's a conspiracy for you. I am thinking this mod drama bs that keeps happening every few months is actually contrived by the mods. It's too often.  It is silly and nonsensical. Stop it.

       Flytape is a Nazi apologist, and so is axolotl_peyotl while we're on the topic. The BS both of them spewed during that Hitler Did Nothing Wrong sidebar movie debacle is reprehensible. It's no surprise that this sub has lately been overrun by holocaust deniers when people like that are running the show. For me, investigating conspiracies is about fighting fascism, not promoting it. Sack them both.

       i really am confused by the outcry here on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       about this "moderator" being "reinstated"...
      </p>
      <p>
       lets run thru the checklist of the events at hand as i understand them:
      </p>
      <p>
       the so-called "flytape" did something that pissed someone off...check
      </p>
      <p>
       this person may have/did break stated rules that have been in effect for a long time...check
      </p>
      <p>
       this person is abusive, manipulative, is a little tyrant in his/her capacity as a reddit functionary...check
      </p>
      <p>
       other reddit "mods" voted him back in, despite the aforementioned facts...check
      </p>
      <p>
       question...why does any of this surprise any of you people?  its typical bullshit that goes on everyday everywhere in the world  with people in positions of power - even in a trite, meaningless power position like this "flytape" individual - lie, cheat, conspire, manipulate, rig games/votes to get ahead, and
       <strong>
        they get away with it!
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       to wit...hillary clinton destroyed federal government documents contrary to black letter law and policy, and will never see the inside of a courtroom for it!
      </p>
      <p>
       barack obama and eric holder intentionally allowed assault rifles to be sold to mexican narcoterrorists in a nefarious effort to destroy FFL holders' ability to sell to american citizens!
      </p>
      <p>
       a major faction of british government and english elites have been engaging in an apparently industrialized kiddie raping operation, and they have been aided and abetted by other powerful people!
      </p>
      <p>
       why does this ridiculous flytape crap surprise any of you?  as a whole, folks on this subreddit dont seem to be that naive, but the amplitude of the hue and cry here about this moronic situation amazes me.
      </p>
      <p>
       a goofy website like reddit is not immune from any of this horseshit...if anything, it is more prone to it because you have simpletons and half-wits who arent smart enough to gain manipulative power, so they end up as a "mod" on some trivial website.
      </p>
      <p>
       i think you guys need to re-evaluate your priorities with this whole thing.

       reddit's pretty weird. it's like a concrete canvas that random people smash their face against.
      </p>
      <p>
       the mods of random popular subs are super-weird. They have their own motivations for organizing the blood and snot that sticks. I'd say a defining attribute of these fellas is that they just can't let shit go.
      </p>
      <p>
       They, from time to time, say to themselves in the quiet of their mind that they moderate a section of the internet. The same way someone might say they run their local boys and girls club or animal shelter. they say it like they're a positive contributor to a community.
      </p>
      <p>
       tomorrow I'll wake up. do some laundry. clean my bathroom. but while I do that some mod will think that he has influence in my life.
      </p>
      <p>
       you can't actually prevent me from thinking what i think. you can delete comments but i can repost them. you can delete accounts but i can remake them. you can get admins to ban/poison my IP but i know what tor is and other services/programs/tricks.
      </p>
      <p>
       mods can't truly moderate anything. I wonder how many of them know this.

       <p>
        Technique #6 - 'GAINING FULL CONTROL'
       </p>
       <p>
        It is important to also be harvesting and continually maneuvering for a forum moderator position. Once this position is obtained, the forum can then be effectively and quietly controlled by deleting unfavourable postings - and one can eventually steer the forum into complete failure and lack of interest by the general public. This is the 'ultimate victory' as the forum is no longer participated with by the general public and no longer useful in maintaining their freedoms. Depending on the level of control you can obtain, you can deliberately steer a forum into defeat by censoring postings, deleting memberships, flooding, and or accidentally taking the forum offline. By this method the forum can be quickly killed. However it is not always in the interest to kill a forum as it can be converted into a 'honey pot' gathering center to collect and misdirect newcomers and from this point be completely used for your control for your agenda purposes.

       Makes no sense.  Only reason to reinstate is he is a stooge for somebody, sent back to a post he doesn't want by a supervisor.  What a waste of everyone's time.  What a shame for this sub.  I maintain that Reddit was gutted because of what this sub generated interest wise around the Boston Bombing and Sandy Hook false flags.  Somebody must still be paid to watch us, if just to make sure we don't have too much influence on the Reddit community because of pariahs economic impact to investors or because the government did get pissed we called out their fake events.

       Well I hope he shapes up and asks the other mods before going on a tangent of self willed idiocrisy. Now i think a podcast would be great if the entire mod team put it together and it was not a goddamn video cast, you know since a podcast does not ever contain video...Does not even compute why it was called a podcast.. Anyways I am not sure about this decision but time will tell.

       Flytape is disliked across reddit - just use a search engine and you'll see his absurd track record.

       So firstly this threads comment section is mostly a complete clusterfuck of derogatory comments posted by users I have never seen here before.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly I think voting on this is a better way of sorting this out than an instant ban regardless of the actions causing it. Flytape has always been fair to me and while he obviously feels strongly about certain things I have not seen anything that warranted his immediate ban.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said the podcast was a bit strange and made me uncomfortable when I watched it not due to the content so much but the atmosphere it created.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as we (the users) are informed of the outcome of votes and why they are taking place I don't see a problem.

       It isnt the crime, but the cover up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The video was unwatchabe for its appearence alone.  I couldn't get past the first 2 minutes to get to the message.  When dealing in controversy, like this sub often does, people look for any reason to discredit the messenger, and the message at that point.   Why help them do that?
      </p>
      <p>
       How you could think looking like that would let anyone take the message you were trying to convey seriously, is piss poor judgement imo.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was worse judgement to not review the video and post it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even worse than that would be to have reviewed it, and still think it came off as something that would represent the 300k people here.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that being said,  i dont think he should have been removed as a mod for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The retalation in banning users here on his part was the exact reason he should have been banned.  There should be no place for that type of behavior here.
      </p>
      <p>
       That action in itself should have told the mods that flytape does not posses the maturity to be a mod, nor the responsibility to have banning priveldges for any sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       He should not be anywhere near a position of authority.  That is the exact thing that has been giving this site a black eye, and has done so again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought the initial reaction from the mods here was correct and gave me hope that maybe they are finally getting it here.  Almost restored a little faith in this site.
      </p>
      <p>
       Turns out, instead of fighting the fire that has been going on here for a while, there was gas in the bucket instead of water.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can any mod vote to reinstate his mod priviledges, when he clearly showed he does not have the maturity to be trusted as a hall moniter in an elementary school, let alone the ability to be able to censor or delete the posts of 300k free thinking adults that are supposed to be his piers or to kiss his ass like some mods expect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mods have to be respected.  How can you expect anyone to have respect for flytape at this point?
      </p>
      <p>
       What is he going to do when someone throws it in his face that he acted like a punk ass kid that didn't get his way and took the ball and went home?
      </p>
      <p>
       He changed overnight?  Please.  He has done things like that before and will do it again.
      </p>
      <p>
       In effect by reinstatiing him you are telling adults that are twice his age and maturity to respect someone who showed to the 300k people here that he doesn't have the respect for them.  Or himself by the video he put out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, its not the video, (even though that was bad) but the reaction to opinions on it where he banned the user.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even Tricky Dick Richard Nixon had the decency to resign.  If flytape doesn't, he should be removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this isn't nipped in the butt right now, you can expect people to show him the respect he showed the users he banned because he was butt hurt.  In turn, he will pull the same shit and start banning them.
      </p>
      <p>
       For anyone to think other wise, mod or subscriber are fools.  How can anyone respect him?  Or the mods who voted to reinstate him?  How can anyone expect him to not react like a 4 year old?
      </p>
      <p>
       With all due respect to the OP, how you think that it is a benifit to the people in this sub rewarding him for doing what cuased the majority of people to split time between this site and another.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not saying ban him from posting, but it is in nobodys benifit that he has mod prividleges.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, shouldnt all posts be considered a free for all outside of Reddits sitewide rules?  Espically in this sub, and the "culture of free speech" reddit advertises it self to have on its wiki page.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact you had to put that disclaimer in says alot about the way things are here, and are a far cry from the "culture of free speech" that reddit has prided and built itself on.

       This post is sticked and pinned to the top of the subreddit. I am seeing a post of a guy who was suspended, be reinstated. This is a moderator who has the ability to online mute or ban someone, seriously?

       I demand to be made a mod of this sub because I have a very large penis and my farts smell like fresh baked bread. I will assume that any disapproval of this request means that all of the mods are being paid by Obama to keep me from my rightful place as overlord of this sub.

       This is good news, the shills and well known trolls, utterly despise him, which makes him the perfect person to mod conspiracy.

       I have only ever had good interactions with Flytape, actually, the only people who dislike him are the drama subs like SRD, SRS and the late (before the admins muzzled it) conspiratard.

       I know my account is not old but I have been here a long time.  Just remember that we are all humans and have emotions.  We are not rational when emotional.  There was really no actual harm done, other than some butthurt, and familiarity has a quality all of its own.  Flytape is not the most shining example of the pinnacle of a moderator, but at worst I would judge him as mostly harmless.  I get the frustration and anger... weigh the pros and cons.  People are not going to leave in the thousands because a couple people were very temporarily banned.  The sub is however placed somewhat more at risk whenever it requires more moderators.

       It doesnt matter if they were a voluenteer at the local YMCA, you put a kid in time out because you dont agree with them or they tell you your fly is open, (and it was) then you have no business with that authority over anyone.  You have to have a thick skin, and be willing to accept scrutiny of other adults without being butt hurt and banning them to be able to effictively moderate anything.

       He should have said I respectfully disagree with you, or apologised like he originally had posted, then deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
       My issue was not with the video, but the banning of the users who called it what it was.  It speaks to the maturity level of the person who does that.  That is what has been giving this site the black eye it has.

       All I ask is that you stop posting virulent anti-Israel material... actually I don't give a shit, free speech and all, so I'm willing to look past it.  However, holocaust denial should be where the line is drawn IMO.  It hurts the sub more than it helps it, and if you're going to harp on about free speech and a hearth for alternative ideas, then realize those few users who decide to leave the sub because they can't have their little holohoax circle jerk, is better for everyone, including the appearance and legitimacy of the sub.

       Not only do I agree with the critiques that you have made previously, I fully commend your insight into this problem. I believe that everyone who frequents this sub and contributes, should have the ability to vote on the moderators, hold elections, through a democratic process, majority winning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though this is not necessarily the best form of voting as there will always be a dissenting opinion (see John Jacques Rousseau on democracy in the Social Contract). I do believe it is the best for the community to have their voices be heard, whether in favor or against.

       This isn't about the podcast.  Flytape has been abusing his powers as a moderator by banning people for simply disagreeing with him.  It is about whether or not the community whats to continued to be attacked by a fascist bigot.  No one in the community was asking for flytape back.  The moderators did it to further their own agenda.

       Yeah it doesn't matter. At all. I was pointing out their mistake in acting unilaterally because if they'd asked for feedback before posting it they would have known it sucked. Its pretty lame to publish it as the "official" podcast when it fucking blows because you didn't ask your associates what they think, you know?

       I am sorry I said I was done responding to you but the last comment was so dumb I just had too.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Thank you for admitting that the podcast is relevant.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Do you even realize I do the exact opposite of that?

       <p>
        just because the recent abuse (out of many cases) happened on a thread that was the podcast doesn't mean the situation is about the podcast.

       If I am a shill why have I been a part of this community for twice as long as you and have 4 times your comment score?  What exactly in my post history signifies shill?  Your account has barely any history and hasn't been on reddit for even a year.

        I'm only defending him because you guys are blowing up my shilldar.

       Just saying this looks like the pot calling the kettle black when your purposefully detracting from the topic at hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now I will definitely disable my inbox replies this time because I am done feeding the troll.

       Into doing the podcast? nah he did it willingly, we were talking about it for at least a few days beforehand in the IRC from the sidebar, assuredly had the idea, and Flytape agreed to be the guest.

       This was their first time making one and it's unfortunate that hardly anyone is taking that into account when considering the quality.

       You are diluting credible conversation because you want attention.  That's narcissistic personality disorder.

       In my experience, not true. For every one person like that in this sub there's 6 downvoting him and telling him to shut the fuck up.
