       I hear so many crazy stories mixed in with a lot of very plausible ideas. So I would like to hear what you guys think is the extent to how deep this conspiracy goes and why if you would. If you think this is too broad you could narrow it down to the thing you are lost concerned about, or what you think is the root of it all.

       I will share if you don't want to feel judged. But I'm on my phone now so I don't wanna have to type it put on this god forsaken iphone 4.

       People are at different base levels of awareness. Humans dominate animals because we
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       more. Adults can manipulate children and elites dominate the masses for the same reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Powerful individuals are more awake than your average person; they have more energy, live more in the moment, see more clearly etc. This isn't some occult concept; think of charismatic or really successful people you know. Note how they consistently make better life choices, are highly focused, often intuit the right things to say, and generally get more out of life than your average person. This is not to say that the elite are good - just that they are living in a more powerful manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       From this follows that there is a lot of manipulation going on. Some people are living like it's fucking Roman times and pursuing the archetypal path of emperors or sages. Others just want to watch TV. If you give away your power (as most do) history has shown you will be used as a pawn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore I believe everything is more centralized than most people realize. Democracy doesn't really matter when you have genius level technocrats and billionaire tycoons working around the clock to build personal empires.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Council on Foreign Relations, Royal Institute on International Affairs, Bilderberg group, CIA, etc. all are more powerful than any national government. I believe people in these organizations are highly aware, have tremendous resources, and (at the top) basically live like modern day emperors. Of course these people manipulate the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the media is highly controlled and designed to create passivity and a consumer lifestyle. This isn't really a conspiracy - it's openly admitted, since capitalism couldn't function otherwise. But I believe the manipulation goes even deeper and involves lulling people into a hypnotic and fearful state.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also believe that nations are really tax farms for the elite. The fact that the kings of England, Russia, and Germany were all first cousins during WWI, for example, should raise some eye brows. An examination of any empire throughout history further confirms that taxes and wealth are forcibly taken from the public and moved up stream to powerful elites who historically lived in palaces, castles, (today we call them mansions), etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the Law of Attraction is real, but is a bit more complicated than what is portrayed in the popular media.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe we create every aspect of our reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any ways, I'm rambling, but basically I believe our lifestyle is almost entirely artificial and very far away from the natural order of things.

       I definitely agree with a lot of your points. Have you ever read "Crowds" by Gustave Le Bon? If not, you should, its a text from the late 19th century that outlines the psychology of crowds and the unconscious. It inspired Freud and Jung and specifically states that it could be used by future rulers to control its people, which I definitely believe it is today in the form of "public relations" or propaganda. As you say, this is something pretty much explicitly stated by corporations and no one seems to see anything wrong with it. This type of thinking and manipulation has created a runaway effect in power of the wealthiest men.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure if you were alluding to this point at all, but it seemed you were with your CFR/CIA etc. comment goes, but the one thing I don't agree with is a supreme and organized power working at the top of this system pulling the strings with each step laid out perfectly. I agree these organization pull strings for people and have insane amounts of power, but I don't think its very centralized, its more of a web of favors, debts, and plans, with each organization working independently with independent goals. They probably let their goals be known to the others and accept help when offered/needed, but I still think each group is out for themselves in the long run. This includes nations and individual corporations (or groups, anything independently run).

      <p>
       This is kind of what I meant. Having a web of powerful individuals/organizations at the top - even if they aren't always working together - is a lot more centralized than how most people view the Western world (i.e. "democracy represents the people! constitutional checks and balances prevent one group from becoming too powerful!" etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing to consider: let's say there
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       exist a web of competing individuals/organizations. Surely some would form strategic partnerships? After all, competition is bad for profits/just lessens the power of the ruling class. That's really what fascism is all about: corporations and the government team up to bone the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there a board somewhere with ultimate power? I have no idea. But there are a lot of clues that the power structure is more hierarchical than we could ever imagine. If you haven't, you should definitely check out Carrol Quigley's
       <em>
        Tragedy and Hope.
       </em>
       This guy wasn't some conspiracy nut; he had a B.A., M.A., and Ph. D. from Harvard, taught at Princeton, and then was a renowned professor at Georgetown University for decades. He also spent decades in 'elite' circles. So when he writes:
      </p>
      <p>
       "For the first time in its history, Western Civilization is in danger of being destroyed internally by a corrupt, criminal ruling cabal which is centered around the Rockefeller interests, which include elements from the Morgan, Brown, Rothschild, Du Pont, Harriman, Kuhn-Loeb, and other groupings as well. This junta took control of the political, financial, and cultural life of America in the first two decades of the twentieth century."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's pretty damning. Also, I'll definitely check out
       <em>
        Crowds
       </em>
       ; sounds totally down my alley!

       sounds great, and globalism (or the Rockefeller interests as he puts) is pretty much the last line on how deep I think this goes, mostly because it makes sense. But also I'm not sure with how much I disagree with it. A world power is something we
       <strong>
        will
       </strong>
       need if we want to last as a planet, I only hope that the groups to do it aren't a "corrupt criminal cabal" or at least don't intend to stay that way once there goal is completed.

       That's the thing; the 'conspiracy' is often a lot more rational than people realize. Some issues would best be solved by global governance, as you said. And with technology advancing the way it is, it's very possible that the nation-state could become obsolete in the near future. But the problem is, the elite know all this (often times decades before the masses) and thus can manipulate these developments into their favor.

       True point, I guess we just have to either wake up the masses, teach them, and let them decide how to form a global government (but we've seen how that has worked out so far), or hope for a new breed of elite (this wont happen).

       You can't just say something like that as if it were a fact.  You've never experienced a world that isn't stuck in the paradigm of governments, so you have a hard time envisioning one where there are not.

       I mean, I didn't mean it as fact, but as an opinion that I can't see a way out of. Anarchy always gives way to government and power centers. In any system of human interaction, people will find a way to get power from the people, and people will always be willing to give it up. To me its a fact of human nature. And with that in mind, I don't think the human race will last in this "warring states" period that we find ourselves in and a unified earth is the only way I can see our race surviving.

       It's difficult to single out the most important points of your post, but these here are (in my view) are the crux of the problem, and fixing the first part here
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       lead to the fall of the other and I believe (like you said) one cannot exist without the other.

       Human beings live in an energetic matrix system, organic technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Immensely powerful spiritual beings feed off of our energy, thus perpetuating the matrix we live in, a sort of give and take, parasitic relationship.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has been going on for thousands of years.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is going on transcends the physical level.
      </p>
      <p>
       The powers that be are slaves themselves.
 They "sold" us to get a better position in the slave system.
 They too have masters, and they are not human. And no, before any say, I am not suggesting that those in power get orders from lizard people. That's bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are the archons of gnostic lore. However, their true names are not given by gnosticism as a whole. Led, the lioness is one of them. There are four total.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's going on is an occult conspiracy against the consciousness of humanity. It's been going on for so long that people think that it's the way things are supposed to be, or always have been.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not the case. 
We've been duped. Deceived.
      </p>
      <p>
       Human beings have amnesia. We do not remember who we are, why we are, or why we are here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Human beings are physical universes. Everything that occurs on a larger, universal scale occurs on a smaller scale in the human body.
      </p>
      <p>
       Creation is not an illusion, that implies you're  sensing something that is not "real".
      </p>
      <p>
       It is mental projection of the source. A dream. We are in the mind, or womb, or leb, the archon I mentioned above.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regain your soveriginity, realize you are a god, equal onto them all, but yet higher in the scale, or higherachy of evolution, a supreme being.

       I sincerely wish this were not the case, but, from my research and experience, to me, it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, your truth will be totally different from mine. That being said, it doesn't imply you're right and I'm wrong, or that I'm right and you're wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is what it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it is what you, having perception and awareness, make it.

       Well, we'd have to first narrow down a bit what you mean by "how deep this conspiracy goes," and I'd like you to share maybe a bit more as to what you mean.

       Also, maybe a bit of background? You're on a conspiracy board so we don't share much more here than we have to, so I'll go first.

       If you're talking about shills, I understand that concept, and that is a factor in the way I take in this info. I think my primary way of doing this is by taking in all the info I can get, picking out anything without evidence and any inconsistencies. Not to say I disregard that info, but more so just take it into account. Also, biases are extremely important in understanding media. So with all of this into account I can usually at least figure out the mentalities of groups of people involved in situations which, to me at least, can tell me a shit ton about what is happening, especially if you assume nothing is accidental.

        What if I told you the American governmental system was a business, and it's industry is telling others what to do? And it has been subject to numerous hostile takeovers since the Crown (corporation) granted charters to the Virginia Company?
...how deep do you want to go?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The American government being a business is something I take as fact, and I think most people do if given the definition of business that I'm assuming we share (as in run for profit of few). This notion of power transfers and incorporating the Virginia company is also something I could definitely get into learning more about, since I haven't heard anything about that in my travels and seems plausible / interesting. And as far as how deep I want to go, I know that the money that stems the power in our country goes back very far, but the part that I'm skeptical on is the level of centralization that it experiences. I outlined in some comments farther down, but I really don't think there's some Illuminati shadow government holding round table council meetings to decide the fate of the masses. Everything we are experiencing is just the ability of those with power to use it, and the notion that there is some central force (in my opinion) is just a formulation of the human need to have an adversary that they can see and fight, rather than have to fight human nature itself. I hope that gives some direction to this, lol.

       It's dumb to create and live under systems that reward the least appealing aspects of our nature. It's strange how much sense it makes to share the toys on the playground yet it seems impossible to grasp the same simple premise on a larger scale for most people.

       As a salesman, you can't make money unless there is an opportunity to sell, and the best opportunity is when there is change in your customers.  Taking this to the most extreme, there has to be two sides to every war, and each side needs to borrow/lend/build/destroy.  Prescott Bush did it, and so did the Kennedys with prohibition.  It's a great money maker.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all know the CIA was originally the Central Intelligence Group, and most of its members were Ivy Leaguers.  Incidentally, also former international bankers.  Not a coincidence.  Don't you think it's odd that both Putin and Bush SR were directors of KGB and CIA respectively?  Both countries leverage their power to help their respective business interests.  It's about money and power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enter personal income tax.  If the Fed Reserve has the ability to create money, why do you think we have an income tax that applies mostly to wage workers?  To shrink the money supply for the less advantaged, and leave the rich with what they had.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's the end game?  All currencies crash, so owning actual assets is probably the end game.    Another reason to take care of our natural resources, because when the groundwater gets all fucked up from fracking, who do you think will be there selling us bottled water?  It'll be privatized, I promise.

       We live on a planet where there is a constant battle over its limited resources.  Governments, corporations, and organizations have been born and have died or morphed over the ages; or remain thriving and dedicated to their ideals.  New ones appear, only to follow similar paths as their predecessors or current relatives.  Ultimately, anything is acceptable  to win - war, corruption, deceit, discovery, treason, murder, truth, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       The masses are duped  into believing the impossible or reasonable theories alike.  It is impossible to know what's truth or lies, fact or fiction, honesty or  deception.
      </p>
      <p>
       The universe is not so simple a place to suggest unlikely phenomenon is farfetched.  Possibilities of the strangest kind, more than fiction or science has/will dictate, abound.
      </p>
      <p>
       The true intellects of this planet question everything, but believe cautiously.  Understanding the great mysteries of existence and what looms in the shadows of time and awaits in the hall of destiny is of the most importance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, just when you think you have it figured out, when you think you finally see the light you had better think again; question it all.

       Well we are heading to cultural colapse wherr first world countires will wage war over resources. America has already started. But the main thing for me is the devestating carelessness for the natural world. Deforestation, overfishing, gmo crops that are not a science heaven for intelligent crops but a marketing gimmick.

       Climate is shifting, humans are too consumed by new shiny things that have a built in 'life' that no ammount of recycling can keep up with.

       Maybe its all treehugger talk, but noone cares, currently far to preocupied with ISIS and other terror groups which are most likely supportrd by USA to in crease global insurgence into middle east and for all them oils and war money.

       Buissnesses now face to have a huge influence over a goverment. Laws are already being shaped to support one large group of people over the wellfare of the nation/world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracies aside, complacency and gimmick media is turning a tide of human carelessness, which is going to have dire consequences in the upcoming decades.

       I am about a day late, but I'll share here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think about 90% of the stuff that is discussed in conspiracy theory forums like this falls in the
       <a href="http://conspiraciesthatweretrue.blogspot.com/2007/03/conspiracy-theory-rating-scale.html">
        class-1 to class-2 range of the conspiracy theory rating scale
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that there are indeed people who are paid to post and discuss things on the internet to control the public perception of events, groups, brands, countries, and public figures.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that 9/11 was something that really demonstrated the media complicity in some seriously shady stuff. I don't think all people working for news companies are
       <em>
        in on it
       </em>
       , but that the people who make the final call on what goes in to the broadcast are to some degree complicit in the practice of manipulation of public opinion and perceptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, I believe that propaganda and mass mind control via propaganda and public relations etc. does exist and is used to manipulate the public into a desired line of behavior and conduct. The details are not well established, but it does exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that the large banks do indeed have much more influence than most people suspect. I believe especially the federal reserve has a tremendous amount of influence. Who controls the fed? Who knows. I don't. But by looking at the evidence, it's apparent that they are pulling a good number of the strings.

       I think Israel gets a weird amount of support that doesn't make logical sense. This suggests to me that there is some level of control that they have over those supporting them.

       I think that the president does not really have much of a say in how things go. I think he is well tended to by the oligarchic group that brought him into the position he is in. I think that he is not evil, but just a politician.

       I think that a good number of the fear-inducing conspiracy theories are created and fed by propagandists. I think that the illusion of control can often be cheaper than actually controlling people or their environments.

       I think that the term conspiracy theory has been intentionally given a negative connotation via propaganda to reduce the ability or likelihood of normal people investigating collusion and crime.

       I think jfk's assassination was another big event that the media was complicit in covering up the conspiracy over.

       I think that a lot of the ufo stuff is psyops. I used to be an advocate of all of that, but it's one of those things that is so murky, and when you have the rockefellers financing the disclosure project, it really doesn't look too good. It's hard to say what's going on there. I think it deserves some real evidence, beyond just witnesses saying shit. I think a lot of ufologists are sincere in their beliefs and interests, and i think there are some real deceivers out there.

       I think the rose cross stuff that Bill Cooper talked about merits investigation, as does the UFO/alien stuff he talked about, but i don't think we should take his word for anything.

       I think alex jones is either a COINTELPRO mouthpiece or a heavily manipulated person. Same for David Icke - i strongly suspect that in Icke's case that he believes what he says, and he says some real and inspiring things, but the details are where he is manipulated. Credit where credit is due, both have done great things for waking people up. But there is a real problem with being too comfortable with the ideas they share just because they seem sincere.

       I think Ron Paul really did get shat on by the media. I think that his success really educated the powers that be on the dangers of social media, and prompted a more dominant approach to control over the internet.

       I think net neutrality was a big manipulated trick in order to give government control over all methods of communication. It sets a precedent that you are no longer allowed to have a computer network to share whatever you want however you want, because the FCC is in charge of that.

       I think that a lot of the feminist movement has been taken over by people who really do intend on making everyone incapable of speaking their minds or even having opinions for fear of offending someone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that people who know which way the wind is blowing sign on with these plans even if they don't agree with them from a moral stance, but because it is profitable to do so - and it means they are not left in the dust.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that there are people in positions of power and influence who believe the majority of people really
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       sheep, and
       <em>
        need
       </em>
       to have rulers. I think that these ideas have caused society to behave in this manner, to form a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy. I also believe that humanity, with the right steps, can become much more than it is. I believe that most people have the capacity to think for themselves, to understand the same things that these rulers do.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am also optimistic. I think that we can work together to give the people in positions of power what they want and to ensure that everyone else has what they want. But it's going to take some work.

       oh also, the wars are in order for the US and NATO to establish control over the middle east. Why? I don't know. lots of possibilities.
oh and monsanto is literally run by evil fucking scumbags who want to control the world's food supplies, they're intentionally killing pollinators and non-terminator crops.

       thats a good bulk of some of my conspiracy theory beliefs/suspicions. hope you enjoyed reading. if not, sorry.

       That's the thing; the 'conspiracy' is often a lot more rational than people realize. Some issues would best be solved by global governance, as you said. And with technology advancing the way it is, it's very possible that the nation-state could become obsolete in the near future. But the problem is, the elite know all this (often times decades before the masses) and thus can manipulate these developments into their favor.

       You can't just say something like that as if it were a fact.  You've never experienced a world that isn't stuck in the paradigm of governments, so you have a hard time envisioning one where there are not.
