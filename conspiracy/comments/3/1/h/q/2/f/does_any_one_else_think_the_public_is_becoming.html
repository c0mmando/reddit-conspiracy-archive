        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Could just be me getting older, but I notice a surprising amount of people are generally &#39;out of it&#39; or have low-grade mental illness in every day life. I even know a lot of people who are successful in the traditional sense, but are clearly mentally imbalanced, self-destructive, and just generally messed up. The fuck&#39;s going on?</p>

<p>Science seems to support my observations; turns out there has been a massive increase in depression, anxiety, and mental illness in the United States over the past couple decades. Yes, there is less stigma around these issues now so more people are probably willing to seek out treatment. But still, the numbers are off the charts: <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/08/26/how_our_society_breeds_anxiety_depression_and_dysfunction_partner/">10-20 times more depression now than 50 years ago, 2.5x more Americans received disability insurance for mental health issues in 2007 than in 1987, and a 400% increase in antidepressant prescriptions during that same time period.</a></p>

<p>People shouldn&#39;t be THIS stressed/confused/sickly. It doesn&#39;t make any sense. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s the food supply, fluoride in the water, excessive TV watching, or what but I see people hardcore stuck in the Matrix every day. What do you guys think is going on?</p>

<p>One in four women and one in seven men are on depression medications. 50% of Americans are on at least two medications. 25% are on at least five medications. 13% of the total US population are taking anti-depressants. 13% on opioids.

    <div class="md"><p>Hey buddy. It seems like you&#39;re really struggling. Forgive me for chiming in, if it&#39;s unwanted, but if I may make a suggestion?</p>

<p>I, myself, took lexapro (amongst many other medications) for my depression. What worked best for me was cognitive-behavioral therapy. Biofeedback is another avenue that has been clinically proven (unlike prescription anti-depressants) to help with depression.</p>

<p>Depression being a &quot;chemical imbalance&quot; is a misrepresentation. Every time your brain feels or does anything, it is a carefully constructed system of firing neurotransmitters (brain chemicals) through the synapse. Yes, depression is a chemical imbalance, but so is everything you do, think, or say.</p>

<p>Think of it this way: if you had a tough life, are currently dealing with stress, and/or are unhappy with what you&#39;re achieving vs. what you want to achieve and these things are causing you to be depressed...how is a pill going to change that? Most people need some form of cognitive behavior therapy to help them deal with maladaptive thoughts and not be overwhelmed by the stresses of life (whether you experience many or few) to overcome depression.</p>

<p><strong>using antidepressants (most commonly SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors)) synthetically alters your brain chemistry and alters your body&#39;s ability to naturally manage serotonin (one of the main chemicals involved in mood, sleep regulation, etc). Upon stopping these medicines your body may struggle worse than it ever did with the natural regulation, exacerbating depression symptoms</strong></p>

<p>Your body is a finally tuned machine. If it consistently gets help elsewhere, it will recalibrate itself to not overprovide. But when you strip away the medications, you find your body is now less adept at dealing with things it dealt with previously.</p>

<p>(OP, because you took yourself off of your meds, I am assuming this is an end-goal for you: working through your depression and living your life med-free? If this is the case,  PM me and I can work with you to find a psychologist in your area that works on your specific issue without relying on medications.</p>

<p>OP, if I totally missed the mark, then I thoroughly apologize for bombarding you with unsolicited advice!)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>5-htp is an acronym for 5-hydroxy tryptophan, which is a precursor to serotonin, a neurotransmitter that some patients are deficient in, which experts say leads to depression.</p>

<p>Lexapro (escitalopram) and other SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) trick brain cells into keeping serotonin levels higher than usual (by preventing their uptake, get it), which helps some patients.</p>

<p>However, they were initially studied as adjunct (ie. Extra or side-therapy) therapy with counselling/cognitive behavioral therapy where they were shown to work best.</p>

<p>Just taking the drugs alone isn&#39;t usually the best idea (at least for long term health - as if you&#39;re depressed you:d most likely benefit from some CBT or just talking to someone about your problems instead of finding it in Lexapro 10 mg once daily.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no interactions with those two specific drugs, but that&#39;s a question I think is more appropriate for the pharmacist you interact with to get your Klonopin (as there may be other drugs you are on or supplements that can interact with both of those guys).</p>

<p>I&#39;d also suggest you take a minute or two at the pharmacy to make sure that they have any herbal supplements or other things you are taking listed, as that database helps us check for interactions and other potential bad things. That&#39;s all.</p>

It&#39;s natural, and you can find it in seeds. It&#39;s a supplement of serotonin, not an SSRI, but natural. Much like people who take vitamin D in the winter, which curbs depression. I&#39;m not a doctor, but I can tell you it help me and friends. It&#39;s natural,might as well try it before something else, especially chemicals. Cheers :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suffer from anxiety and depression; I was put on klonopin and prozac, everything was wonderful for about 4-6 months then it didn&#39;t seem to help as much anymore so the prozac was upped and added in welbutrin, when the welbutrin didn&#39;t help they upped that and I ended up having a manic episode. Because of the mania my doctor wanted to then diagnose me as bipolar because I must be and it was just hiding and the welburtrin brought it out, he wanted to put me on new medication and when I researched what he wanted to switch me to I decided I wanted to get off all medication. </p>

<p>I got pissed and quit prozac and welbutrin cold turkey, I&#39;m still taking the klonopin for anxiety because coming off the prozac has increased my anxiety but I will slow take myself off. Going to doctors and saying you want to be off medications is like telling them the world is coming to an end. </p>

<p>Now that I&#39;m off I feel worse than I did before, like the prozac really fucked me up. I&#39;ve always been extremely sharp with an amazing memory, there&#39;s times I walk out of my room and can&#39;t remember why or what I was going to do so I have to wonder around and go over everything I&#39;ve done or thought so I can figure out what I was trying to do. It sucks! </p>

<p>Someone below mentioned 5htp, I have some just haven&#39;t started taking it yet but I want to give it a try because I&#39;ve heard from others that it works. I&#39;m changing my diet and adding in more exercise because I&#39;ve had people say that works. I&#39;m willing to try anything so that I can be normal again. </p>

<p>I know how you feel so if you ever need to talk feel free to message me or check out the depression board, there&#39;s lots of help and support there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a DR but I&#39;ve been in your same place.  </p>

<p>I kicked the Lexapro and it was hard...physically hard to stop.  This really bothered me because I was only on it for a few months but I know others who have been on it for years.   </p>

<p>It makes me angry because of this quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>my family was begging me to take it again because my unhappiness was affecting everyone else</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your unhappiness is most likely the reality of the world we live in.  The others don&#39;t want the truth or to pull back the curtain to find the wizard is just a man.  The illusion is far easier to live with than the reality and so they need you drugged up so they can live easier.   </p>

<p>This is why I believe my people were pushing for me to get on these powerful meds.  And once I made the realization I stopped taking them and learned to keep some of my unhappiness to myself or only share with those of like minds.   Feel free to PM if you need anyone to talk to.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s a complicated issue. I work in the mental health field. I think there is an overabundance of prescribing&gt;therapeutic interventions. Drug therapy was a huge portion of my psychology courses when I pursued my degrees, represented as one of the main &quot;healing&quot; models. </p>

<p>For insurance companies, it&#39;s way cheaper to pay for meds and check in with a psychiatrist every month/6 months than it is to provide on-going cognitive-behavior therapy to actually fix the problem. Additionally, psychiatrists often get kick-backs from pharmaceutical companies to prescribe the drug of the day. I think this is particularly apparent when a psychiatrist writes a script for Prozac using a xanax clipboard, writing with a pen that reads &quot;Metformin&quot; on the side.</p>

<p>I think the push for pharmaceuticals encourages an attitude of having mental illness, rather than times of transitory sadness/anxiety/etc. It used to be &quot;my grandfather died, I&#39;m depressed,&quot; now it&#39;s: &quot;my grandfather died, I&#39;m depressed, I saw a doctor and they said I had depression&quot; (cue prescription medicine).</p>

<p>Then people start taking the medications and it can often make things worse. There are very few reputable studies that suggest antidepressants do anything to help. There are many studies that show antidepressants do nothing, and in some studies, have been shown to worsen depression than those in control groups (ie those taking a placebo).</p>

<p>This is obviously an abridged version of the issue. If people are interested in more than a synopsis I can go into more detail on how antidepressants affect brain chemistry, why they often don&#39;t work and provide sources that support these conclusions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you got it right on the head - everybody&#39;s got ADHD, depression, anxiety, panic attacks - but I think there&#39;s more to it. I mean, everybody&#39;s got a mental disorder according to a health professional (psychiatrist&#39;s I&#39;m looking in your direction) that could be cured by persistence and exercise which we just prescribe medication for. </p>

<p>But shit man, take television for an example. Got damn addictive isn&#39;t it? And these assclown marketing professionals (of which I am one) do research and campaigns to make it more addictive. &quot;What makes these people NEED to watch it and how can we do MORE of it?&quot; They all say. Well, fuck that. I mean shit, we&#39;ve had decades of time to spend cashola on finding out how to get the general public roped in for the season premiere of Big Brother, yea? And they&#39;re goddam good at it, aren&#39;t they. </p>

<p>So while mental health professionals (of which I&#39;m a serious fan) try to get to the root of all problems and create a healthy solution, you&#39;re fighting against the addiction of the internet, television, sex, medication, harmful drug use, video games, and general douchebagery that have all been imbued with horrible, effective, marketing research that fucking works better than Albert Ellis&#39;s CBT can. So who wins? Money! Woot! Fuck.....</p>

<p>So these people when faced are faced with a serious life dilemma (who really need someone to talk out their problems) they are going to turn to the above (sex, Big Brother, American Idol, the internet, Porn) before they resort to any therapy, because it just works faster.</p>

<p>As crazy as it (I) sound, you&#39;re fighting a fucking losing battle, and that&#39;s some sad shit. </p>

<p>Edit: I meant therapy, not &#39;medication&#39;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great points. And I think also that it depends on what type of mental health professional you&#39;re referred to.</p>

<p>If you go to a primary care physician (covered by your insurance) they will often referred you to a psychiatrist. </p>

<p><strong>Many people don&#39;t know that a psychiatrist is a medical doctor with <em>some</em> psychological training</strong> their primary mode of therapy (as taught by their discipline) is <em>medication therapy</em>. Psychologists are trained for years in different effective therapies but can not prescribe medications, so these professionals will often find different avenues to treat mental health issues.</p>

<p>As I previously mentioned, longer-term mental health care (by way of regular appointments with Psychologists) costs way more than check-in visits with psychiatrists where insurance companies and Big Pharma receive revenue from life-long prescription refills.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. I think it is vitally, vitally important for people to know the difference between a psychiatrist and a psychologist. They would provide two very different solutions. </p>

<p>It&#39;s going to cost a shitload more money for a psychologist, but I think by the end, anyone who has spent any significant time  with a psychologist will feel miles and miles better than anyone who has been on any medication for the same amount of time. </p>

<p>This whole big-pharma kickback thing has got to come to an end by these nutbag, mental health pro-hat wearing skinbags. </p>

<p>But my question is: are psychologists also incentivized by big-pharma and if so, why don&#39;t they do the same thing to push the drugs? If not, why not? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t speak for all psychologists, but I don&#39;t believe they are incentivized the same, because as I said, we can&#39;t prescribe medications. But we can refer to psychiatrists who can, so perhaps some may receive incentives that way.</p>

<p>But I think for psychologists, and psychiatrists, the issue may be in the teaching. As I said, in my psychology courses (although we can&#39;t prescribe meds) there was a huge emphasis on medication therapy. Perhaps the biggest focus on this approach of any approaches I learned. I don&#39;t know who developed the curriculum, but when you have so many professionals in the field learning that medications are a very effective way of treating mental health issues, if you don&#39;t look deeper into the effects of such an approach, you just go along with what is considered &quot;common knowledge&quot; in the field. You have a patient with depression, you prescribe Prozac (or refer to someone who can), duh. Next case. </p>

<p>I think it colors the interpretation of many professionals, even those not receiving kickbacks, because that&#39;s just the way the system is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is interesting, because I feel that psychologists (especially with the amount of schooling it takes)  are encouraged to think outside of the box. From what you say, it sounds as though most just accept the status queue and in short, we&#39;re boned - unless more of those who receive higher education can ask more questions  (but I thought that in a field like psychology in university it WAS about critical thinking) about why we think our standard of therapy is how it is. </p>

<p>Is that really what the industry has come to believe is the status? I mean, we had all of these wonderfuls like Jung that challenged the accepted methods. I guess that&#39;s what we need more of. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, I think I may have misrepresented psychologists. Its very true that there are many different modes of thought. We do learn of Jung, Wundt, Titchner, Skinner and so many others. </p>

<p>There are many truly fantastic Psychologists (those who you read about in books and those you see in movies) but that is not everyone. Just like not all scientists are Stephen Hawking and not all computer techs are Bill Gates. It&#39;s not to say that these professionals don&#39;t exist, it&#39;s just that they&#39;re harder to find. But you <em>can</em> find them if you know to look.</p>

<p>As with all professionals, there are people who are mediocre (or worse) in the field. People don&#39;t like to think of doctors, dentists, psychologists, etc as potentially being &quot;C&quot; students, but some are. In fact, &quot;C&quot; being the average- many are. And there are many factors besides talent that play into how good the care you receive is. There is a very high burn out rate for people in psychology because the system is so frustrating (and at times clients are so frustrating or have such horrifying stories psychologists can&#39;t deal). </p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is <strong>do your research</strong>. Not all psychologists are great.</p>

<p>Psychologists are not the same as psychiatrists. Therapists/counselors are not the same as psychologists. Psychologists also have specializations. You wouldn&#39;t see an oncologist for foot fungus- you would see a podiatrist. Just like a psychologist that specializes in adolescent eating disorders wouldn&#39;t be the best match for someone with adult ADHD. There&#39;s a lot of room for error, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s common knowledge yet that people need to thoroughly research to choose the psychologist that is right for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The one in four/one in seven is data specific to antidepressants--and it&#39;s data from <em>2011</em>. The 50% number is from a study from <em>2008</em> and doesn&#39;t specify psych meds specifically - i.e., 50% of Americans are on two or more of some kind of daily meds (this can be statins + blood pressure, for example).</p>

<p>The statistics are outdated, but all we in the public have to work with. You can imagine that being 4-7 years old, the numbers are much higher now.</p>

<p>What really bugs me is that I have these numbers on hand from recent reading and was under the impression based on the articles I read that the 1 in 4 and 1 in 7 numbers were recent - after all, that was how they were presented by the news articles I read - but they&#39;re 4 years old!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bingo bango. Your entire post is accurate of my experience. I&#39;ve posted about this here before, but basically, I went in complaining about focus and motivation and ended up being diagnosed as bi-polar. The drugs they gave me turned me into an apathetic zombie- emotionless except for my anger, which became even worse. Although I never became violent, I was very aggressive and mean (mostly on the internet because I could easily vent my anger). </p>

<p>I lost control of myself, my behavior devolved, and I ruined relationships and didn&#39;t care. I got cocky and did stuff IRL I&#39;m not proud of / was bad decisions I wouldn&#39;t make in a normal state of mind.</p>

<p>I managed to break out of it through meditative tripping, but it took months before I felt okay again. I still don&#39;t feel...right, but much better than I did during the time I was on drugs that were supposed to &quot;fix me.&quot;</p>

<p>Yep, good point. If people fully accepted this, they would be much better off IMO. We&#39;d return to values that encouraged critical thinking, individuality, toughness, survival, etc. Now it seems like movies and TV <em>are</em> the Real and confuse the shit out of people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with the dude above you but I still enjoy my life. Simple as that, just because you see the reality of what the education system and being in the vast majority of the workforce does (breeding likeminded individuals who&#39;ll all think and act similarly but give them a semblance of individuality so they can be &quot;happy&quot;) not mean you don&#39;t enjoy life. In fact the truth is I enjoy life more knowing that about the way things work. </p>

<p>It isn&#39;t angst. The fact you think it is angst is exactly what you were told to think. No one has critical thinking anymore, no one concludes things on their own. Religion is told to you. History is told to you. News is told to you. And all of it everyone believes without question because they were taught that way through conditioning.</p>

<p>Everyone trying to be authoritative when the only authority you have is upon yourself. But people have been taught to forget that and forfeit that authority to other greedy and evil people who want it. Think for yourself man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can definitely confirm that. I have been working third shift for five years now, and while the money has been nice, my social life/mental health has taken a serious downturn.</p>

<p>When I was younger (age six to sixteen), I was on an all-you-can-eat buffet of ADD drugs and mood stabilizers. I was also seeing a psychiatrist twice a month for ten long years. Then suddenly, my parents decided it wasn&#39;t doing any good, and it all just ended.</p>

<p>The next three years of my life were a rolling dumpster fire. Mood swings and confusion, mostly. Lost a lot of friends, made a bunch that I would later cut out of my life when I realized they were just toxic people. </p>

<p>I am 27 years old now, and things have improved, but honestly, not by much. It&#39;s a constant uphill struggle. Still get mood swings, but they aren&#39;t as rapid as they were when I was a kid. I might be happy for a week or two, but then something always happens, and I slide back to the bottom.</p>

<p>The point I wanted to make is, every single day, when I go out into the world, I see little kids acting just like I did when I was that age. Now I can&#39;t help but wonder when children acting like children became a bad thing. Who benefits from making the human race boring and monotone?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it goes hand in hand with financial instability. Tons of people lost their retirements and homes just a few years back. Almost all university students are destined to become wage slaves. Public schools can now cost upwards of $70k for a 4 year degree, and that&#39;s just tuition, you can bet it&#39;s closer to $120k if you include room and board. That sort of debt can crush a generation and since the rate keep going up it is now going to be multiple generations of kids who feel helpless. They can&#39;t get jobs that pay near enough to get out from under their loans within the next 20 years. If they can&#39;t find jobs at all then their lucky cosigners (parents usually) are on the hook and that means dipping into retirement or savings. The old and young are both getting fucked by student debt and the housing crisis. Old people can barely keep their homes and students will never have a chance to own one. And then medical bills are insane, one ER trip could put a lower income family in debt for a year and that&#39;s just for the ambulance ride.  The system is rigged against lower to middle class people and its getting worse. So all around you see people living in quite desperation, feeling more depressed each day. That crushing feeling of ongoing hopeless will zombify a society. This is especially true when the media keeps telling us that there is no hope of things getting better. Throw in the fact that anyone with enough money to buy them will consume drugs of some form to ease their suffering. Prescription drugs, weed, booze, etc... on top of gouging depression  and negative news feeds these will definitely keep people in a stupor.</p>

<p>All in all most of society is poor and getting poorer, this leads to depression, to using distracting substances and to the media constantly telling you things won&#39;t get better.  This whole system is horrible and it is why so many people are not doing well, even to the point that their despair is obvious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can confirm, losing your life savings to an endless parade of theft from above and below can lead to a downward spiral of mental health.</p>

<p>By the end the banks were jumping in to help steal everything from me. The system is broken, and you&#39;re surrounded by crooks. Slowly you realize the American dream is really just a dream, and the money you earn has all gone to people who didn&#39;t earn a dime of it. This is when you give up and start demonstrating the qualities that the wealthy people knew you had all along. Which is why they are better than you.</p>

<p>Luckily I experimented with drugs and psychotic violence years before I had anything, so by the time I went into bankruptcy and lost my investment property I knew what paths not to go down. I imagine if someone had been &quot;good&quot; all their life, they might just check out and let big pharma unzip their pants every time the feels intruded. If the doctors already made you into a pillhead when you were a normal, unhappy teen, you might just numb yourself like you were taught.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to note that it could be a result of our rapidly changing society. Technology is able to advance at a rate that biological life forms can&#39;t come anywhere close to, so I personally think that decreases in mental health are a response to becoming more stressed out and just generally not doing anything that we&#39;re supposed to do. Humans aren&#39;t supposed to sit in chairs all day and stare at screens and live in a heavily organized, scheduled society. We&#39;re designed to spend all of our time outdoors in the sun being active and just generally surviving.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a professional or anything, but I&#39;ve just always associated these two things together. If any has any evidence to support this or disprove it, please share.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think its almost the opposite... my age group (20 - 35ish y/os) seem to be starting to wake up, we all hate our jobs and realize we are underpaid, we don&#39;t know how we will ever be able to afford mortgages like our parents, let alone retirement. Majority have realized religion is bullshit. Politics are too corrupt for voting to matter. </p>

<p>The problem is that once people reach that point... Intelligence and awareness of how the world works is such a burden that people need to actively bury their head in the sand, look for distractions again, or medicate to keep from killing themselves or at least being very unhappy. I have met way more very smart depressed people than stupid ones. Would you rather stay awake of the truth and depressed or cluelessly blissful? Only the strongest continue to cling to truth. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if past generations all hated their jobs and lifestyle too, or they just sucked it up or had some kind of &quot;greater good&quot; / &quot;for the family&quot; mentality that kept them going. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t comment on the next generation / people &lt;20 either as they seem to have gone full retard into social media, but I guess I only see the vocal/visible portion, I&#39;d like to think they are still just as disenchanted -- or at least they will be once they graduate.</p>

<p>I can only comment on the people in my age range that I speak to the most regularly and in the most candid manner... And we are just sitting here either waiting for something in the system to break in a manner disasterous enough to force change (we know we can&#39;t bring about meaningful, non-corrupt change via current politics because that system is broken), or for the older generations to die off so we have enough critical mass and shift in ideals to actually create the change we want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am 17 and can confirm your statements. It&#39;s mindblowing that people straight up believe EVERYTHING being said on social media and regular media. People my age barely know anything about news and politics, conflicts in the world, let alone 9/11. I don&#39;t take these theories for granted either, especially back when I came here first. But after reading for while, my eyes are opened (the put options part about 9/11 did it for me). I used to think that the US was the good guy, but the opposite is true.</p>

<p>Whenever I bring this up, people say that I should provide sources. They want sources on the conspiracy, but they take EVERY item on the media for granted? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the truth will ever get out. WTC7 burned down with all the secrets it was hiding. I just hope I can live my life without too many interference from the government.</p>

<p>people <em>are</em> depressed, unhappy - with their lives, jobs, the world, i don&#39;t think medications are helping, just seems to keep them on the drug treadmill, there&#39;s a pill for everything &amp; doctors have become pushers for big pharms. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know whats really sick about it?  A lot of the medicines these people are on they take literally to stay alive.  There has been a huge wave of thyroid problems.  My sister has hypothyroidism, my mother had thyroid cancer.  My poor mom had to have her&#39;s removed and now she has to take medication daily or she will die a slow, painful death.  If the country collapsed, how is she going to be able to get the medications that keep her alive?  It is a system of control.  Flouride has been linked to thyroid problems; my mom was made to take chewable flouride pills in her adolescence.  I know its lose, but its me grasping at straws trying to speculate any sense into this because OP is right, these problems are becoming increasingly prevalent, specifically in american society (where 2/3 of our water supply is flouridated, and the chemtrails)...sigh.</p>

Have family in the same situation and traveling when the script runs out is just always an adventure.

<p>People <em>should</em> be this fucked up, because our situation is that fucked up and we are doing nothing to deal with the problems, much less even admitting there are problems at all. If a problem is not addressed directly it will surface in different ways until people do something about it or it destroys them. </p>

<p>It&#39;s screens, its our food, its our hyperpostmodern obsession with being entertained/satiated/numb 25/7. </p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of beautiful if you think about it; we are being forced to choose to evolve or else that same force will get rid of us to let something else try. All the systems imploding are the ones that need to go. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey OP,
I honestly think we are born into unconsciousness on a variety of levels, social, global, but also physical and mental. The human body is so weak and tired all the time, the ego&#39;s lack any critical thinking skills, the food and water supplies are filled with poisons that make u sick and eventually kill you.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very difficult to stay conscious in this modern world, but I think eventually, maybe after WW III it will change for the better</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the world of lies truth is treason.  </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s hard for many to come to terms with the endless lying they have to do to themselves to justify and maintain their beliefs they hold dear.  </p>

<p>Religion is hard to believe when it&#39;s quite obvious to be just a controlling mechanism. </p>

<p>Politics are chock full of frauds, cheaters and thieves that even the most hopeful candidate promoting change turns into being worse than the preceding scumbags throughout all history.</p>

<p>Economy is totally fucked but watch the news or read a paper and everything you read has no basis in the reality you live every day.</p>

<p>Those who work spend 3 months of the year just to cover their tax obligations while they watch a larger percentage of their friends and family just staying home and becoming &quot;disabled&quot; or &quot;mentally ill&quot; and unable to work collecting checks, free insurance, energy subsidies, food subsidies etc.  </p>

<p>Old folks who have watched their parents grow old and enjoy pension plans and retirements paid out from interest on a life time of savings have nothing themselves.   CD&#39;s and money market accounts that don&#39;t even pay 1% interest they find themselves cutting into their savings to just make ends meet.  </p>

<p>Increasing costs on food an energy and everything that you NEED while decreasing prices on the things we WANT.  </p>

<p>Just some brief observations.  I could go on.  But you get the idea.  </p>

<p>TLDR - Inconsistency in a belief structure, what we&#39;re being constantly told (propaganda) and what we live day to day in our &quot;reality&quot; leads to mental issues which could drive physical issues.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have noticed that too. With technology advancing it&#39;s a lot easier to become more zombie like. As if we try to live day by day... &quot;same thing different day.&quot; just letting life pass by and not making a difference..</p>

<p>I know there are people who don&#39;t fit this description. And humanity is lucky to have people who do make a difference and don&#39;t conform to  a zombie like state. But the majority of the population does. </p>

<p>People should stop and notice how life is becoming more zombie like. How were becoming slaves as consumers. And how it seems to be what society is letting happen. </p>

<p>The corporations feed us crap food to make more profit. the pharmaceutical companies give us drugs that don&#39;t work or just work enough to profit from. the pollution has increased. The media has become a huge manipulation, for profit and other. </p>

<p>of course were becoming zombies. and we chose and still choose to let it happen. its sad really.. </p>

<p>Change needs to happen. Man kind should be more self sufficient honestly. So we use our brains, Have healthier options, and end the zombie like state of being a consumer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Americans live the pointless lives of slaves, and that lifestyle is directly sustained and supported by some of the most murderous tyrants in Human history. Some might pretend to not know, or have gotten really good at ignoring it. But intrinsically, we all know. </p>

<p>Have you ever noticed that Americans are reflexively quick to vehemently defend America? It&#39;s the response of a child mob caught in a lie that they desperately need you to believe. But if you get AN AMERICAN alone s/he is most likely to profess a deep loathing for the government and corporations that cheat us at every turn, the constant calls for more war, and no small worry that they exist in an endless police state wherein they have no voice, no choice, and no hope. </p>

<p>Living with this level of cognitive dissonance is bound to manifest as mental disorder in a vast swath of the population. Everything about public life in America is a lie, and people are discovering that in ways unheard of even 20 years ago. </p>
