<p>Is this a fucking joke?</p>

<p>Not only is this mod the most scrutinized in the sub — now got him doing live chats in pinned threads voicing his opinion with a mask on?</p>

<p>Flytape has been involved in so much controversial BS (alongside his buddy axolotl) that this new &quot;live chat&quot; interview seals the deal— he is a COINTELPRO wet dream. </p>

<p>As a subscriber to this subreddit, I highly disapprove of this ridiculous situation and I am <em>very</em> disappointed in the execution. </p>

<p>it&#39;s like this subreddit was actually gaining ground with great TILs, public exposure site wide, and no disruptive stickies or AMA — constant WTC 7 posts and even a post about HW bush that went viral on reddit — then BOOM you guys come in and make a decision that reflects on the whole user base, which coincidentally involves flytape wearing a fucking mask rambling about shit. </p>

<p>So where, exactly, did I use hyperbole? He referred to Flytape and the entire podcast as being COINTELPRO, which you have to admit is an exaggeration, ergo hyperbole. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="/u/quantumcipher">/u/quantumcipher</a>[2] , your cards are showing very clearly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What cards would those be? I&#39;m stating my opinion on the matter. Nothing more, nothing less. If you knew the shit I&#39;ve had to put up with in defense of this sub, you wouldn&#39;t say this. </p>

<p>Example: I&#39;ve received multiple death threats in the past for supporting this sub and for posting controversial material regarding false flags and black ops, I&#39;ve been trolled relentlessly by r/conspiratard and SRD trolls (repeatedly referred to as a &#39;retard&#39; &#39;crazy&#39; &#39;schizo&#39; &#39;anti-semite&#39; &#39;piece of shit&#39; &#39;basement dwelling neckbeard&#39; who should &#39;kill myself&#39; etc on a daily basis at one point), I spent a few months as a mod here dedicating a few hours a day solely to removing similar comments directed at the sub and being the only mod at the time who would bother to ban dozens if not upwards of a hundred trolls / shills / JIDF / occasional white supremacists, now have stalkers who &#39;follow me around&#39; (according to the admins) downvoting everything I post on reddit and trolling me occasionally in random threads as a result, have done nothing but defend this sub in others in the past only to be brigaded and ridiculed repeatedly as a result.</p>

<p>Are those the &quot;cards&quot; you&#39;re referring to? Or is it the accusation from one user in this thread for not being as harshly critical of the mods here for doing a stupid, meaningless podcast where they didn&#39;t feel the need to take themselves too seriously? Which is it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where did <a href="/u/3rdEyeNavigator">/u/3rdEyeNavigator</a> do that? You are making a false claim.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this thread. Rather than focusing on actual shills and users who actually post antisemitic content here <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1z4c85/rworldnews_moderator_bipolarbear0_was_previously/">as I have done in the past</a>, he is referring to the mods here as &quot;COINTELPRO&quot; over a stupid podcast.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And <a href="/u/flytape">/u/flytape</a>[4] </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay. Where did he post legitimately racist or anti-semitic material here? As far as I&#39;m aware, he&#39;s what some call a &#39;holocaust denier&#39;. This is a topic I do not necessarily agree with and one I personally consider a waste of time. Yet, I do not recall seeing him post this material here, in this sub, as you suggest, let alone anything legitimately anti-semitic (i.e. racist against jews). This is a claim made often by JIDF and trolls who feel the need to sensationalize the activity of the mods here, accusing the entire mod team as being &quot;Stormfront&quot; which is absurd considering I&#39;ve never seen any of them being legitimately racist, and that one of them happens to be Jewish and considering myself who was once a mod here is only half white (not exactly &quot;Stormfront&quot; material). If you have evidence to suggest otherwise, that Flytape did in fact post racist material here, I would like to see it, and if there is any I will apologize for being wrong in that regard and adjust my view accordingly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stop lying, it&#39;s clearly not for &quot;personal&quot; reasons. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not lying about anything. I&#39;m expressing my personal opinion on the matter as honestly as possible, which I had a feeling others would give me shit over for not conforming with the sub&#39;s hivemind of constantly attacking the mods over petty bullshit. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see any other reason to hate Flytape so much, other than for his personal views (i.e. holocaust revisionism) or as the result of a personal interaction with him in the past (where he can be admittedly be crass and even rude at times).</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This is a podcast, hosted by the mods. Hence, it is reflective of the mods and the mods themselves, until they have any other guests, at which point it will be reflective of the guest&#39;s as well. I think of it as an AMA. The person doing the AMA isn&#39;t going to speak for the entire community, nor are the users who post questions in the AMA speaking on behalf of the entire sub. It&#39;s two individuals entitled to their own opinions and sense of expression. If you disagree with that, that&#39;s fine, however I do not consider it reasonable to equate this to COINTELPRO or JTRIG when we have actual examples of this found throughout reddit (i.e. r/conspiratard and peppered throughout the default subs) more worthy of that distinction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>JTRIG 101 indeed, and you appear to be defending it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not defending or agreeing with it, entirely, other than to defend their right to say or do whatever they please as individuals, on a fucking podcast, and not take it too god damn seriously. To call that &quot;JTRIG&quot; is an offense to all the legitimate examples of JTRIG-like behavior I myself have pointed out here in the past.</p>

Those people want very badly to doxx him and ruin and/or end his life because of their zealous hatred of antisemites.

<p>No, in reality, you pretending it&#39;s not real doesn&#39;t make it less real, nor does you trying to laugh it off, a clear sign that you know you&#39;re wrong and have nothing actually intelligent to say in support of your stance.</p>

<p>Myself and at least 50 other users that I have had correspondence with.</p>

<p>Why and how? He is wearing some crazy looking mask and using some insane looking background when he could just make a normal looking video that shows the appearance of an intelligent person who is not acting strange in any manner. That is not what was done, so how is me questioning it &quot;childish&quot;?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Been there done that, and this is real input, which I have received multiple times in the past in multiple other threads where <a href="/u/flytape">/u/flytape</a> is being called out for his seeming subversion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>instead of trailing a conversation about a podcast</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not trailing anything, this thread came up in my feed, and I already feel this way about <a href="/u/flytape">/u/flytape</a> based on my past interactions with him, and the interactions with him I have been told about from other users, who in most cases provided either links or screenshots, like the one I linked you previously.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>throwing accusations out that don&#39;t really have much support</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s hard to gather evidence from comments which have been deleted and screenshots which have been removed.</p>

<p>There was a whitewashing of a lot of information from Reddit about 2 years ago.</p>

<p>I made a post about trail derailment, analyzing over 50 cases and categorizing them based on the evidence in the case as either being a normal actual accident, or an accident that appears intentional, for oil and coal trains.</p>

<p>I can not find this post on reddit, or through internet searches.</p>

<p>Reddit has been 100% compromised for at least the past 2 years, if not possibly 3.</p>

<p>2 years ago is where the shift really became noticeable, and today it is far more severe, if it wasn&#39;t made plainly obvious by <a href="/r/todayilearned">/r/todayilearned</a> mocking <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> through their subreddit style just recently.</p>

<p>did you post it on r/conspiracy?
cant you use repost it? and keep an eye on it and see what happens?
Id feel more inclined to support you if there was more than one case of this. So far I havent seen things being removed and if so they were reinstated.</p>

<p>There you go painting false narratives again. I didn&#39;t start a witch hunt, and you telling me to stop calling you out for what you are isn&#39;t reasonable, so no, I didn&#39;t listen to reason.</p>

<p>I backed off because I&#39;ve been a member here for longer than your garbage account has even existed for, and I didn&#39;t want to be banned by you because I know that&#39;s who you are and how you operate, because of what you are.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh shoot, people are on to me, better threaten them with false claims of &#39;witch hunting&#39; and then ban them if they still persist.&quot;</p>

<p>Why? Are you ashamed to voice your opinions? You have no valid reason to have worn that mask, and don&#39;t even try to start with the &quot;death threats&quot; BS excuse you always claim whenever anybody questions you.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care how many people have sent you &quot;death threats&quot; online, none of them are going to act on it because they&#39;ve already implicated themselves as guilty by having sent that electronic communication which is instantly logged by the NSA and analyzed and flagged for being an actual death threat, serious or not.</p>

<p>You didn&#39;t &quot;act&quot; crazy, you appeared crazy, which is a part of acting. You don&#39;t have to act how you would imagine a crazy person to act to seem crazy, you just have to look crazy.</p>

<p>To &quot;normal&quot; people, that mask makes you look like some kind of nut.</p>

<p>Why could you not have worn a balaclava?</p>

<p>Why can&#39;t you just show your face?</p>

<p>You don&#39;t want to expose your actual real person because it would lead to us being able to find out who you actually are by being able to look up your personal information because that would reveal things about you that you&#39;re trying to keep concealed from us? Is that it?</p>

<p>I see no other logical valid reason for you to have worn any form of a mask.</p>

<p>LOL, says the mod to the user who has been a member on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for longer than your account has existed. This is how you behave as a moderator? How are you fit for this position when blatantly disrespecting well known positively contributing members?</p>

<p>Nope, false, it&#39;s not obvious. Nobody outside of people who you have told knows that you have had ANY death threats sent your way.</p>

<p>What is obvious, is that you explicitly choose a very bizarre looking mask that does not have a &quot;normal&quot; appearance, thus making you look not &quot;normal&quot;, perhaps a little &quot;crazy&quot;, which appears to have been the intention.</p>

<p>Keep making excuses all day long, I know they&#39;re excuses and I&#39;m not buying them.</p>

<p>Rofl, the man was literally trolling in an explicitly offensive manner just for the sake of his own amusement.</p>

<p>There was no witch hunt, he just slipped up and blew his cover of &quot;anonymity&quot; and his terrible inhuman behavior finally caught up with him.</p>

<p>He allowed himself to be exposed, people viewed the information and figured out who he was, and it all caught up with him.</p>

<p>Give me a real example of somebody who actually had something unfair happen to them, because this guy was rightly exposed for the piece of trash that he is.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Because you lost your job for posting sexually explicit pictures of women to the internet without their knowledge or consent. The fact that they &quot;brought it upon themselves&quot; by wearing skirts in public that allow people to take upskirt photos doesn&#39;t act as any form of defense for his actions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, to a point. At what point is it taken to the extent of censorship? Those who oppose this sub would love nothing more than the mods and its users to censor themselves out of fear of ridicule, which is precisely why they use ridicule against us. We shouldn&#39;t lose sight of that in pursuit of our cause. I&#39;ll admit, however, I was willing to do that on occasion for the benefit of the sub, as a mod, but do not expect nor want the other mods to do the same. It should be a personal decision and not one mandated by others, and if we did it would be hypocritical to the concept of this being a free thinking ground that respects freedom of speech and expression, of one that allows controversial content not allowed in other parts of reddit but arbitrarily censors content that certain users happen to disagree with.</p>

<p>c) continue to disallow arbitrary shill accusations, unless they meet the aforementioned criteria</p>

<p>d) ban any legitimately racist content even if a slur is not used, to ban white supremacist websites (i.e. davidduke.com) and remove any posts that refer to &#39;the Jews&#39; &#39;blacks&#39; &#39;whites&#39; or any other race as being inherently negative unto themselves</p>

<p>Users who do not post here constructively and violate the rules may be subject to an immediate ban. Regular users would receive a warning and have their violations removed without exception. Repeated violations may result in a ban, however.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had planned on implementing them in another sub, an alternative to r/conspiracy, at a time when this sub had been heavily brigaded by trolls from r/conspiratard. As their sub is no longer allowed to link to here directly, a result of their persistent brigading, and considering the sub in question would have but a fraction of a percentage of our users, I ultimately decided to abandon the concept entirely. I consider it now more of a backup or redundancy measure, a last resort for a later point in time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Moderators can&#39;t wear two hats, moderating impartially on one hand and advocating their personal beliefs on the other hand.  Eventually there will be a conflict.</p>

<p>It&#39;s similar to a public school teacher advocating their political views in class.  It&#39;s a misuse of power.  Even if there are &quot;safe&quot; exceptions to advocacy, there will eventually be a conflict.  So mods must choose one or the other.</p>

<p>Especially in the case of Flytape, who mixes ad hominem with banning people for ad hominem (I keep a file of screenshots of examples, if you want them, or better yet just look through his comment history), the conflict is egregious.  And to your comment that &quot;nor is it reasonable to expect otherwise, it just isn&#39;t possible&quot; for a mod to behave like an umpire or an impartial judge, this is the first time I&#39;ve ever disagreed with you.  It&#39;s not only reasonable, it&#39;s non-controversially minimally expected in any position of authority.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make some entirely valid points, some I&#39;m inclined to agree with. The problem is you imply the mods can&#39;t express express their personal beliefs, which in and of itself is contrary to the spirit of the sub. Considering the mods are typically chosen from users who post here regularly, it isn&#39;t necessarily or reasonable to expect them to be devoid of an opinion, or to not at least occasionally if not regularly contribute their own point of view or content. As for FT, I agree that his approach to moderation isn&#39;t always helpful, however not nearly as detrimental as some claim it to be, let alone being worthy of the label &quot;COINTELPRO&quot;. In the latter portion of your comment, you&#39;re taking my words somewhat out of context. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And to your comment that &quot;nor is it reasonable to expect otherwise, it just isn&#39;t possible&quot; for a mod to behave like an umpire or an impartial judge, this is the first time I&#39;ve ever disagreed with you. It&#39;s not only reasonable, it&#39;s non-controversially minimally expected in any position of author</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is what I actually said, in its entirety:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The mods each have their own views and conspiracies they believe in and others they do not, which is standard for any user here and perfectly fine as far as I&#39;m concerned, even if they happen to believe in something controversial I strongly disagree with. You&#39;re never going to please everyone. It just isn&#39;t possible, nor is it reasonable to expect otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In saying this, I was referring to their posts and comments expressing their own personal views and opinions on certain conspiracies (i.e. believing in one conspiracy or another) and in how they choose to conduct themselves when not moderating, specifically. I agree with the need for moderators to be as objective and transparent as possible, strongly, which is exactly how I&#39;ve conducted myself as a mod here and elsewhere, as politely and professionally as possible in the process. I apologize if I inadvertently led any of you to conclude otherwise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alot of people are in here shitting on you, and its being done in a bit of an aggressive way. i would like to add some constructive criticism if you would like some, i have listened to so many podcasts that i feel i can help you guys <a href="/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway">/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway</a> and <a href="/u/Flytape">/u/Flytape</a>. </p>

<p>here goes:</p>

<p>1) get a whiteboard for all your topics, have both the same primary points duplicated on both your whiteboards for you to refer to for the entirety of the recording</p>

<p>2) critique your information/content that you are using for your show. </p>

<p>3) record your show and then both watch it together, if possible to pick up on anything that you feel is necessary to add/unnecessary to delete from the show(s)</p>

<p>4) i noticed there was some &quot;dead air&quot; in the recording, anything more than 2 seconds is bad. while this does happen unintentionally, it can make the recording look amateurish. this has the unfortunate effect of damaging your credibility. it sucks, because your content might be great, but it has a negative subliminal effect.</p>

<p>5) The mask. The mask can work if it has a point related to the conversation. it doesnt matter if you wear a bird mask, but it has to make sense, otherwise, you just look like a guy smoking wearing a fucking bird mask. it makes you too easy a target unless it actually means something. if it was me, and i wanted to do the mask thing, id probably do something like a Nixon mask or something similar. my advice? grow a beard and wear a pair of sunglasses or get rid of the bird mask.</p>

<p>6) If you decide to lose the mask, add something interesting &amp; relevant to the background picture/video. even screenshot conversations or video/pics from recent world events would be good. </p>

<p>thats all i can think of at the moment, if you have any questions i&#39;d be glad to help. this podcast has real potential, id like to see it work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We talk about surveillance almost daily here.</p>

<p>We talk about people who are anti-tptb and call for action being monitored.</p>

<p>We talk about people dying in mysteriously, convenient, ways that benefit tptb.</p>

<p>Then after all that, when someone actually attempts to do something, anything - as we&#39;re always encouraging people to do: some form of action - they chooses to do a pod cast, and because of the reasons aforementioned they wear a mask, we then call them crazy and childish? </p>

<p>So you might not have liked the topics? Fine, give them constructive feedback, or produce content of your own as an example, collaborate, but what does tearing down someone&#39;s genuine effort achieve?  </p>

<p>Do not place the entire weight of representation of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> on their shoulders, that&#39;s counter productive, they&#39;re as they state, just individuals with their own opinions. They may be moderators, but a moderator is just a person entrusted to enforce and enact forum rules, a moderator isn&#39;t a an absolute subject authority.</p>

<p>This sub doesn&#39;t operate as a one narrative fits all, and just because something&#39;s posted, or someone&#39;s said something, doesn&#39;t mean we all agree and join the circle jerk we see so often in other subs - so he&#39;s said something you don&#39;t agree with? So fucking what, that&#39;s the nature of free thought and an open forum to present your ideas. It doesn&#39;t mean we have to agree and rally behind them.</p>

<p>For the people advocating they only choose certain content because they&#39;re moderators, content we all agree with somewhat, is really just a form of censorship - Yeah get out there, talk about the big issues, but only talk about the big issues that make us look good - the fuck. Not only is it limiting content, you&#39;re then censoring yourself on what&#39;s perceived socially acceptable to talk about, may as well make this place into another <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> then.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest, this two hat point is probably mostly due to how moderators are selected for this forum - afaik, they&#39;re generally content posters who are active, and are voted for by the community to become moderators.</p>

<p>So, you&#39;ve got a long time poster who generally does well, receives up votes, gets discussions started. Then the community votes this person into a position of moderation because they&#39;re well known. Then you expect the them be impartial, magically, from that point on? Even though their impartial behaviour that has rewarded them to this point, is the very behaviour that made them a moderator? </p>

<p>Edit: delete them</p>

<p>But the fact is, he gave all his documents to journalists a long time ago and has nothing to do with what journalists decide to publish in relation to the documents he provided.</p>

<p>This is a common misconception among a lot of people.  (I can see how this misconception happens when articles are often titled &quot;New Snowden leak...&quot;).</p>

<p>But Snowden is not &quot;trickle-truthing&quot; anything.  He dumped the documents to journo&#39;s he trusts and THEY are deciding what to release.</p>

<p><a href="/u/George_Tenet">/u/George_Tenet</a> may be well-intentioned but he/she is just flat out wrong when the implication is made that Snowden is strategically and selectively leaking information.</p>

<p>Bullshit.  The Holocaust lies are every bit as important as the 9/11 lies.  We are forced to cater to Israel because the media forces We The People to sit through Holohoax stories almost daily.  And it literally takes just a couple of minutes to do the basic math and find that 6 million is a bullshit lie.</p>

<p>Now you eastern european &quot;semitic&quot;-converts, rush to my comment page to see all the horrible jew-hating comments I must have posted on <a href="/r/stormfront">/r/stormfront</a> or whatever.  You&#39;ll find none. I have no affinity for Hitler, I am not a skin-head nor a neo-nazi, nor a supremacist of any type. I despise all sorts of superiority, whether it&#39;s kkk, aryan nations, muslim brotherhood, zionism, new black panthers, whatever. Thinking that any one race is better than any other race is bee ess. This has nothing to do with hating anyone. It has to do with hating a lie that people conspire <em>daily</em> to promote.</p>

<p>1) You destroy central banks and their money printing to &quot;control inflation.&quot; </p>

<p>Why do economists swear we need central banks? Because they print new money needed to keep the money supply from deflating. This is needed because the economy GROWS. If the economy is growing and there is no new money then the worth of your dollar/currency goes up, because there are more goods available and the same quantity of dollars/currency in circulation. In an isolated context this becomes a problem (increases value of debt) and in a global context this also becomes a problem (you price your goods out of global markets). </p>

<p>So it&#39;s obvious you need to print money to keep in line with the growth of an economy. That is what central banks are supposed to do. But they do it through mechanisms that benefit themselves (debt to governments), buying treasury bonds from a government&#39;s Treasure Department for which the Treasury Department has to pay monthly interest payments (bond coupons) to said central bank, thus sucking money out of the government&#39;s budget. So this is obviously an issue. You&#39;re adding a huge burden on governments for something that should be a simple mechanism, with no cost.</p>

<p>2) You REMOVE ALL TAXES and you allow governments to print new money for themselves based solely on the growth of their economy. </p>

<p>An economy grows 3-4% then they print 3-4% new money and this is their annual budget. When they spend this money, this money enters the money supply and you control deflation/inflation. This is practically an exact science, we know very close to reality how much an economy grows annually. It can be measured with high degrees of precision. </p>

<p>But but but, this cannot be! There is no country in the world where the annual growth of their economy is equal to their government&#39;s annual budget! Look at the US for 2014, 2.2% growth on $16.7 trillion, that would be a budget of $367.4 billion versus the $3.02 trillion they made by taxing America. You&#39;re off by an order of magnitude! </p>

<p>Yes, we are. But you are forgetting that you&#39;re stealing 30-40% of America&#39;s money each year. Imagine how much America&#39;s economy can grow each year if you stop cutting off it&#39;s legs every year and taking 1/3 of everybody&#39;s income.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that all countries on this planet could grow at sustained rates of 10-20% every year if their economies were allowed to keep 30-40% of their income. It&#39;s simple fucking math. You&#39;ll spend more and you can even save money! If the USA grows at 10% (which is highly conservative after injecting 30-40% more money into people&#39;s pockets) you&#39;ll have an annual budget of $1.6 trillion. When you reach 15% per year growth that&#39;s $2.4 trillion, at 20% a year you&#39;re making more than the government steals from it&#39;s people (i.e. $3.2 trillion).</p>

<p>It&#39;s FUCKING SIMPLE. It&#39;s easy. It has been studied. It is known. It must be done.</p>

<p>It obviously can&#39;t be done overnight. You&#39;ll need to lower taxes slowly but immediately destroy the central bank and have the government print it&#39;s own money. You start by lowering taxes to 25% and printing 2.2% of the money based on the growth. In one year you&#39;ll see the growth of the economy shoot to the roof to 3-4%. You lower it to 20% and you&#39;ll see it go to 5-6%. You lower taxes to 10% and you&#39;ll see America and all countries on this planet explode in MASSIVE GROWTH. When you hit 0% taxes we&#39;ll have colonized Mars.</p>

<p>I know it sounds insane and simple. Because it is. This is the terrible mechanism by which the planet has been enslaved and humanity is made to suffer.</p>

<p>It must end now. Do not get caught up on divisive side shows and who needs to be made more of a slave through taxes and &quot;equalization/fairness.&quot; WE ARE ALL SLAVES. And there is a simple thing we can do to free ourselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are indeed examples of &#39;false flag&#39; racism here, of users posting content they do not believe in to troll and brigade this sub and make it appear racist, as evident in the mod leaks and as admitted to by certain users previously. I also acknowledge there is indeed a handful users who unfortunately post legitimately racist material here and there, users I would ideally ban were the other mods not opposed to it out of concerns of censorship, which is at least somewhat of a valid point. In regard to the Hitler doc posted on the sidebar, that was a decision made when I was not active as a mod here nor using reddit in general, and one I would have opposed vehemently if I were. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said.
Well then what do you suggest, because sometimes I feel like our freedom is being used against us, when I see posts like the Holocaust being a lie (even if it is a lie) that message is being used by people that want to destroy this sub by calling attention to it in a negative light. The fact that we support things that are questionable.. even for me... I dont know what to think
I dont really know what is true any more. But I know its being used against all of us to draw us closer to fascism so people in power can use that to create wars and violence.</p>
