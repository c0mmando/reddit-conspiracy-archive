        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It wasn&#39;t until after a few months of dating my girlfriend that she started to produce a wart-like welt on her wrist that was located on the tip of her tattoo. We naturally thought that she had an allergic reaction to the ink. It started to itch bad and spread to her hand and wrap around her wrist. The welt grew in size. She was in agony every day wanting to scratch this off of her. So she finally went to a dermatologist to diagnose it for treatment. They told her that it was possibly an allergic reaction and to take some pills. Well, of course that did not work. They took a culture of it and found nothing.</p>

<p>After a month or so more it kept getting worse and spread more around the welt. She had a naturalist friend who runs a clinic up North from us that she had went to see for her thyroid issues over a year ago who helped her with that. She decided it was time to go see her again. Once she got there her diagnosis of it was scary. She had just thought maybe it was from lyme disease or it was truly an allergy thing.... Nope. She was told it was in fact something called Morgellons disease. She took a culture of it and found these black and blue fibers underneath the skin around and on her wrist. What the fuck? We immediately started researching.</p>

<p>I have heard of this before but never thought much into it for it only affected a small percentage of people. It is all over the internet. People are saying it&#39;s a nanotechnology that has invaded our bodies and this is a side effect, there&#39;s others saying that it&#39;s a new parasite that&#39;s eating us, and there&#39;s the people who are saying we&#39;re crazies. </p>

<p>There was actually a study done by the Center for Disease Control that said people who are suffering from &quot;Morgellons&quot; are actually just under delusional parasitosis (DP), <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029908">Which their report can be found here on PloS One</a>, yeah. This is complete bullshit for I&#39;ve seen these fibers and the side effects created by it first hand over the last few months. My girlfriend is in no way shape or form delusional in any way. Upon more research I found one person who actually sides with the sufferers, his name is Randy S. Wymore, Ph.D., assistant professor of pharmacology and physiology. He has actually done his own study on Morgellons himself to uncover if it&#39;s actually real or not.... His conclusion is that it is indeed an unknown condition where fibers are found in the patients that is of no known plant, animal, or synthetic nature.  <a href="http://www.healthsciences.okstate.edu/morgellons/research.cfm">Here&#39;s the official Oklahoma State webpage featuring his study, and complete position statement.</a> Make sure you click on his position statement for the complete rundown of his findings. He also sent the fiber samples to a Tulsa, Oklahoma FBI crime lab to see if they can match up a source for the fibers just to have it come back as negative for any known fiber they have on record!!!</p>

<p>So we have the CDC conducting their own research with the conclusion that people are just under DOP (delusions of parasites). On the other side we have a professor from Oklahoma State telling us that is really is something that is infecting people. </p>

<p>My girlfriend is going through different treatments at this time that she was given by her naturalist friend from the clinic up North. I hope it works. But, until the I&#39;ll be digging to find out more. If anyone has anything else on this please leave a comment.</p>

<p>-Thanks</p>

<p>*Edit. 
Here&#39;s some pictures of her wrist.</p>

<p>She then took the needles out and soaked it in 2.5 PH water, which is highly acidic, and after a minute or two <a href="http://i.imgur.com/8aMnwRh.jpg">this shit shot out of the raised area.</a> this is a picture of what came out into the plastic bowl.

    <div class="md"><p>Just letting everyone know that this is another disinformation thread.  Nobody really believes in this disease; when someone believes they have it, it&#39;s delusional parisitosis.</p>

<p>I was very interested in John Titor at the turn of the century and while discussing it with my mother, mentioned Morgellon&#39;s in passing.  After I stupidly gave her the book of Titor&#39;s postings, she &quot;contracted&quot; Morgellon&#39;s in a year-long manic-depressive episode.  It was very difficult to get her to stop picking away at her skin, causing sores all over her body.  And when she finally stopped picking, guess what went away?</p>

<p>Obviously she has had problems all her life that made her susceptible to the suggestion, but all the same: Please don&#39;t promote this nonsense as if it were suppressed fact.  It causes real damage to real people who can&#39;t maintain a strong internal self in the face of outside influences.  It&#39;s the same thing that propaganda in advertising does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How can physically pulling long threads out of your skin be psychosomatic? Appears to me that the skeptics appear to believe in magic moreso than Morgellon&#39;s sufferers. Their nasty reactions say more about them than people dealing with this condtion, too.</p>

<p>Kind of wonder if it&#39;s just accumulation of ingested foreign particles making their way out, the way a splinter or piece of metal eventually will worm its way out of your skin. But the long tendrils and the not-matching-known substances...weird... </p>

<p>Also, I love this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“In my experience, Morgellons patients are doing the best they can to make sense of symptoms that are real. They’re suffering from a chronic itch disorder that’s undiagnosed. They have been maltreated by the medical establishment. And you are welcome to quote me on that,” she adds. ... Joni Mitchell is not a malingerer.</p>

<p>What I do know, though, is how this would have to be one of the most frustrating diagnoses to receive. I couldn&#39;t imagine everyone telling you that your condition is based on delusional paranoia, and for every doctor to become instantly condescending should it be brought up as a possibility in conversation. It&#39;d also be tough knowing that the only possible remedies are those which are not supported by the broader/mainstream scientific community, ie, colloidal gold or silver, herbal detoxes, etc. That must be a very isolating experience. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did I say medicine wasn&#39;t natural? Of course it is! Everything is &quot;natural&quot;! That&#39;s why it&#39;s such a meaningless word, aka snake oil. if it works, it&#39;s called medicine. A few &quot;natural&quot; medicines that are real. Melatonin, aloe Vera, aspirin, penicillin, LSD, psilocybin, and a couple more worth mentioning that I&#39;ll save for time sake. None of these &quot;herbal blends&quot; or any of that shit are real, regulated, or proven with any efficacy to work. Where are <em>your</em> answers? You seem to forget that burden of proof lay on the snake oil salesmen. Aka you. Not me. I don&#39;t have to answer anything. Scientific study and tried and tested medicine speak for themselves in results. Yours do not. Show me the data on your natural remedies. Oh, you can&#39;t, because if there was data it would Yield no correlation, and certainly no causation. Even if you get a positive result, you have to account for placebo effect. Which you can&#39;t. </p>

<p>Oh, wanna talk about vitamin blends and shit like that? That&#39;s no secret, and the CDC/FDA have set and measured values for vitamin intake on a daily basis based entirely on the science and anatomy of the human body and how it works and uses these vitamins and to what degree. You can offer no such thing. That&#39;s known as being a useful idiot, not what I&#39;m doing. </p>

<p>You declared this thread bullshit, OP a liar, his girlfriend delusional, and all doctors who use natural remedies frauds.  None of which you&#39;ve provided any evidence for and all of which remains unsubstantiated.  So yes, if you want anyone to listen to a word you&#39;re saying, you do need to back these claims up with something beyond your word - which is all you&#39;ve offered so far.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Show me the data on your natural remedies.</p>

<p>You already listed some above and there is ample data showing the effectiveness of aloe vera for example.  This conversation is also about Morgellon&#39;s, you&#39;re focusing on one specific part of my response to you and ignoring all of the others.</p>

<p>Some natural remedies work, therefore at least <em>some</em> doctors who use these remedies aren&#39;t frauds, period.</p>

<p>Now answer my other questions if you can since I&#39;m sure you didn&#39;t just pull those 1-5 bullet points out of your ass...</p>

<p>Peer reviewed research and information: <a href="http://www.thecehf.org/morgellons-disease-research.html">http://www.thecehf.org/morgellons-disease-research.html</a></p>

<p>Extracts from peer reviwed study: <a href="http://omicsonline.org/2155-9554/2155-9554-3-140.pdf">Morgellons Disease: A Chemical and Light Microscopic Study</a>.</p>

<p>&quot;The filaments have not been matched with known textile fibers, and dye-extracting solvents have failed to release coloration; the fibers are also very strong and heat resistant [4,5].&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In conclusion, MD lesions were not caused by self-mutilation or delusions in the three cases presented here. The photographic evidence clearly demonstrates that the unusual fibers or filaments described in this study are not self-implanted textile fibers.  All three patients had symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with systemic illness and indicative of tickborne disease.</p>

<p>Neuropsychiatric testing was normal in two cases and influenced by the disease in the third case, and all three patients were examined by a medical practitioner who confirmed the presence of fibers underneath unbroken skin compatible with a diagnosis of MD.</p>

<p>We have demonstrated that filaments found in MD patients have chemical, physical and immunohistological features of keratin. The presence of individual filaments attached to epithelial tissue is consistent with keratin and suggests that the filaments are produced by keratinocytes. Morgellons filaments have been photographed growing from pavement epithelial cells, and this process resembles the evolution of filaments seen in BDD. Because BDD is a disease in which spirochetes have been identified as primary etiologic agents, and spirochetal sero-reactivity has been associated with MD, it is reasonable to assume that spirochetal infection plays an important role in MD filament production. Further immunohistological and electron microscopy studies are needed to solve the mystery of Morgellons filaments.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Influenza virus kills perfectly healthy people every day. Even with an ineffective vaccine like this years, we still stand to prevent tens of thousands of hospital visits and some amount of deaths. There is one theory in the community right now that if they increase the strain count in the yearly vaccine from four to six it might be enough to bring effectiveness over the 50% margin. The issue with Influenza is how widespread it is and how quickly it can evolve.</p>

<p>To give an example, I got the flu shot this year. About a month later I got infected with the flu. Due to genetic drift I was infected, the virus had evolved enough that my immune system didn&#39;t immediately remove it. In the end however, because I was inoculated against a very similar virus, the flu was gone and out of my system within 2 days instead of the usual 7 to 12 days of sickness. It was mild. I barely noticed it.</p>

<p>So even with an ineffective vaccine, it still saved me a lot of trouble and time and money.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Hygiene didn&#39;t eradicate diseases from entire continents. Vaccinations did. Immunologists did. We have a lot of proof on that subject that we can readily pull up. The layman evidence is generally easy to understand graphs of infections over time. They are well sourced.</p>

<p>Indicating that even in a population which is half vaccinated, nearly a thousand healthy people die yearly as a result of complications caused by this virus (most not being vaccinated). Then again this sounds too generalized to be taken seriously and definitely does not account for infant influenza deaths.</p>

<p>A quick google search on the subject turned up all sorts of relevant material. Here are a few links.</p>

</ul>

<p>I really can&#39;t stress how much that is just a tiny snippet of all the stuff that can easily be found by anyone. Of particular interest there is the Canadian statistics as Health Canada keeps those updated quite frequently. Note the activity and death rate for this flu season.</p>

<p>Further I will add that many people get light colds and mistake that for the flu. If you get the flu you are most likely bed ridden for at least a couple days unless <sup>you</sup> <sup><sup>are</sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup>vaccinated.</sup></sup></sup> Even if you still get the flu after having the vaccine, its more often then not much more milder like I described what happened to me in a previous post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I stand by what I say. Even the CDC website claims that influenza related deaths aren&#39;t properly tracked which leads me to believe that most of these other &quot;credible sources&quot; can easily be overestimating numbers due to misdiagnosis.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll leave this here too.

    <div class="md"><p>Granted, there&#39;s always a 1 out of 10 chance that a seemingly healthy person can succumb to complications arising from the flu, here&#39;s an interesting article where <a href="http://www.wisn.com/health/kenosha-woman-26-dies-of-flu/30626302">a Healthy Wisconsin Woman Dies from Sepsis Caused by the Flu (Vaccinated)</a>.</p>

<p>Another interesting article that bubbled up to the top today:
<a href="http://www.ksbw.com/news/pertussis-outbreak-at-monterey-park-school/31881324">Pertussis Outbreak at School in Salinas, CA</a>
It&#39;s only 4 students, but they&#39;ve been vaccinated against the whooping cough.</p>

<p>I could also bring up the measles outbreaks caused by previously vaccinated people, the Merck lawsuits, vaccination courts and the fact that pharma companies hide behind the court with immunity from any damages that arise from their vaccinations. Pharma companies don&#39;t seem to give a shit if their products (un)intentionally ruin someone&#39;s life. They are neither morally or financially responsible, none but the fool would follow their rhetoric without question.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve had mostly the same vaccines for 20+ years, it&#39;s no longer a grand medical achievement nor the best we can get. You don&#39;t think we could come up with a better, safer vaccine? Incorporate antibody Titer tests, remove toxic heavy metals, move the vaccination schedule age back a couple years, perform exhaustive studies when a vaccine causes one of the many elusive, yet debilitating complications so we can better determine who&#39;s at risk, these are all things which would greatly improve the state of vaccinations today.</p>

<p>But we don&#39;t do that, cause vaccines are good enough. /s</p>

One study does not equal all of science and its probably not even related to this. You have a legitimate physical condition here. That could be a rare skin cancer. Get her to a real doctor and get some real tests done. Stop gambling your girlfriends life on alternative medicine. I could sit here until I&#39;m blue in  the face showing you a mountain of good evidence indicating acupuncture is bullshit but you&#39;re probably not open minded enough to accept that at this point are you?

    <div class="md"><p>I had a lump on my neck that I got &quot;diagnosed&quot; by a real doctor - he said it was just inflammatory and to &quot;take these antibiotics.&quot; I went to see another doctor after that failed to resolve the issue and the second doc lanced it and pulled out a massive ingrown hair. </p>

<p>My point here is this: sometimes docs just tell you what they think the most obvious answer is to get you in and out of their clinic as quick as possible to fit more patients into the day, as they&#39;re a business after all. So, your first response should be to seek a second opinion from another doc. If you want to see the naturopathic doc too that&#39;s fine, just see another not-naturopathic doc as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s an interesting paper disputing the whole &quot;delusional&quot; aspect - their hypothesis based on analyzing the fibers is that the strings are generated by keratinocytes: <a href="http://omicsonline.org/2155-9554/2155-9554-3-140.php?aid=5477">http://omicsonline.org/2155-9554/2155-9554-3-140.php?aid=5477</a></p>

<p>I wonder if there are commonalities between sufferers, for example, long-term steroid or antibiotic use (i.e., for asthma/Lyme/etc) or other immunocompromising factors (in the paper, all patients were bit by ticks and two of the three were tested for B. burgdorferi and came back positive. The third patient became understandably doctor-averse due to his experience and they don&#39;t say whether or not he was tested.).</p>

<p>Also, according to the paper, cows get these weird filaments, too. Do the vets give the cows anti-anxiety meds, too? Is the CDC publishing screeds on how these cows need to treat their mental health? Our medical establishment done be broke. ;)</p>

What I find very odd about it, is the fact that it seems to mainly affect women (mostly middle aged white women) The more popular media outlets on the web take the cdc&#39;s side of the story ie; it&#39;s patient delusion, while the more independent sources claim it&#39;s real with a few vague pictures of fibers here and there. I&#39;ve been misdiagnosed before with having common flu, when in all reality I had acute Bronchitis and Bronchial spasms. That being said, if doctors misdiagnose something as simple as that you have to wonder what they diagnose someone with that were to have something completely foreign to them in their bodies. Maybe try reaching out to Mr. Wymore and inquire about any known treatment from him?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll look into the agro-bacterium idea but I&#39;m more inclined towards some new type of synthetic and/or nano-technology.  Either way, the reality of the condition and the cover-up surrounding it are both glaringly obvious from where I&#39;m sitting.</p>

<p>Peer reviewed studies, research and other articles on Morgellons:  <a href="http://www.thecehf.org/morgellons-disease-research.html">http://www.thecehf.org/morgellons-disease-research.html</a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t get it either.  The debunker types and the like are so obstinate, so confined within the box of rigid skepticism, that they are blind to truth even when put right in front of their noses.  It is some combination of media brainwashing, authority worship, cognitive dissonance, arrogance, and plain denial that causes a dysfunction in their thinking that should be recognized as a legitimate mental illness.</p>

<p>Reply your edit:  OR they are just shills who don&#39;t want the link between Morgellons and Agrobacterium, a soil bacterium that has been widely used in creating genetically modified (GM) plants to be discussed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gah, this is some next level stuff; from <a href="http://www.gingersavely.com/upload/JInvestMed07.pdf:">http://www.gingersavely.com/upload/JInvestMed07.pdf:</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Background: Morgellons disease is characterized by dysesthesias and dermatologic lesions that range from minor to disfiguring (Savely VR, Leitao MM, Stricker RB. Am J Clin Dermatol 2006;7:1-5). The disease has been reported primarily in Florida, Texas and California. Although an infectious etiology of Morgellons disease has been postulated, treatment of the disease remains problematic, with many patients having inadequate responses to antimicrobial therapy. Skin biopsies of Morgellons patients reveal non-specific pathology or an
inflammatory process with no observable pathogens, often with fibrous material projecting from inflamed epidermal tissue. Morgellons skin fibers appear to contain cellulose. This observation indicates possible involvement of pathogenic Agrobacterium,
which is known to produce cellulose fibers at infection sites within
host tissues. </p>

<p>Methods: Skin biopsy samples from two Morgellons patients were subjected to high-stringency PCR testing for genes encoded by the Agrobacterium chromosome. Screening of the same samples for Agrobacterium virulence (vir) genes and T-DNA sequences in the patient’s genome was also performed. </p>

<p>Results: PCR screening indicated the presence of Agrobacterium genes derived both from the chromosome and from the Ti plasmid, including the
T-DNA, in tissues from both Morgellons patients. Conclusions: Our preliminary results indicate that Agrobacterium
may be involved in the etiology and/or progression of Morgellons disease. If these results are confirmed, it would be the first example of a plant-infecting bacterium playing a role in human disease.</p>

<p>Further testing is ongoing to validate this observation and to determine whether Agrobacterium not only resides in the infected areas, but also transforms them genetically.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, Morgellons disease could be proof that this GMO modifies our DNA.</p>

<p>&quot;Agrobacterium not only infects human and other animal cells, it also transfers
genes into them. It was SUNY professor Citovsky and his team that made the
discovery some years ago [10]. Until then, the genetic engineering community
had assumed that Agrobacterium did not infect animal cells, and certainly would
not transfer genes into them.  </p>

<p>Agrobacterium was found to transfer T-DNA into the chromosomes of human
cells.&quot;</p>

There is no doubt whatsoever that something&#39;s going on with regards to Morgellon&#39;s - there is a cover-up here, and has been for years.  How the CDC can just blanket dismiss it and claim all of the people around the world suffering from it to be delusional is beyond me and is literally criminal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your photos and description are help to show this isn&#39;t delusional parasitosis.  Do you know what the fibers are composed of?  Are they biological or non-biological?  In other words, are the fibers alive?  The page you linked to mentions DNA analysis but no details are given. It&#39;s hard to believe anyone studying this hasn&#39;t compared the DNA with other known forms of life if it is in fact a living organism.</p>

<p>Some speculation: It&#39;s some kind of fungus or worm, and/or people are used as experimental subjects and something is put in their body that produces these fibers.  All kinds of genetic experimentation is happening such as spider DNA being combined with other animals and plants.  Google &quot;spider dna&quot; and the drop down list shows *goats, corn, tomatoes, human....&quot;  Spider dna comes to mind because it&#39;s common knowledge researchers are fooling around with it and also Morgellon&#39;s produces fibers in the body.

<p><em>Someone</em> knows what it is, and the fact that no one&#39;s saying tells me we probably wouldn&#39;t like the answer if we heard it. I mean, delusions? Really? There are thousands of pictures of these things - we can see them with our own eyes.</p>

<p>So many questions and so few answers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there are thousand of pictures of this thing then obviously there are thousands of samples. So how can it still be &quot;unidentifiable&quot; (&quot;not animal, plant, synthetic fiber&quot;). We have everything from electron microscopes to elemental analyzes, even this was some exotic type of matter or even some new element, it would be identified, specially with thousands of samples !!!! Unless the fibers disappear before analyzes or never happen to be analyzed, otherwise OPs claims of &quot;not animal, plant, synthetic fiber&quot; are incoherent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have an answer for you, I haven&#39;t looked into the subject enough to speak definitively.  What I do know is that the CDC claims all of these people are suffering from delusions, but I&#39;ve spent a few hours looking at pictures and videos and listening to testimony of some of the victims of these things (like Joni Mitchell) and they very clearly are <em>not</em> delusions.  Something is causing them, which makes me think someone does know what they are since, like you said, how can they be totally unidentified?  Unless the implication is that they&#39;re from somewhere other than Earth, but I&#39;m hesitant to jump to that without something more to go on.</p>

<p>I mean look at some of the pictures, what do you think they are?  I agree with you that someone knows, but no one&#39;s saying - and the more questions you ask about Morgellon&#39;s the fewer answers you get.  The whole subject is just very strange and creepy to me, something about it is very <em>off</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are analyses - and the mystery filament disease has actually been well-studied among livestock. An interesting quote from <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3257881/">this paper</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A key difference between BDD and Morgellons disease is the veterinary community’s response to BDD versus the medical community’s response to Morgellons disease. While digital dermatitis has been the subject of extensive scientific investigation, unravelling the “mystery” of Morgellons disease has been hampered by claims that it results from delusions of parasitosis,26–28 and meaningful scientific studies have been carried out by only a handful of investigators.20,22,24,29,30 This report compares the clinical and laboratory features of the veterinary and human diseases.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the link, but BDD is identifiable along with possible patogens and compostion. But OPs claim that the fibers were &quot;of no known plant, animal, or synthetic nature&quot;, has no standing whatsoever. It&#39;s as if the samples <em>couldn&#39;t be analyzed</em>, despite the plethora of methods available. This is a constant statement used by most pseudo-scientific <em>researchers</em> to justify how <em>exotic</em> and <em>unexplainable</em> (and hence outside scientific method) their <em>studies</em> are.</p>

<p>Maybe there might be some connection between &quot;Morgellons&quot; and BDD (though doubtful since the former is multi-colored and of different appearance). And while many scientific postulates have been re-written, such statements as the above, just add to my scepticism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s weird, because the papers I was looking at yesterday, one claimed cellulose, the other &quot;we don&#39;t know, but we think keratinocytes cause it to grow&quot; and they had some really gorgeous magnified photos of the fibers themselves, from both human and bovine samples. </p>

<p>It seems odd that they can look at them so closely and still not know.</p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth, it sounds like OP is going with what doctors and the Internet are telling them - which you can&#39;t really use as a justification for the disease being made up. </p>

<p>BDD and Morgellon&#39;s seem to have similar links in Borrelia burgdorferi almost always existing. That and the testing showing Agribacterium genes in affected skin samples is mondocreepy. </p>

<p>The cotton-fiber-like appearance, floral patterning in initial cells, and the fact that they appear to be growing right the heck out of hair follicals with the bottom bulb and tapered tip just like a regular human hair...but not is not actually hair and is blue, green, red...is just downright weird. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t understand how anyone looking at the actual data would consider it to be delusional parasitosis. If so and even if not, get those people into a study stat, it&#39;s fascinating stuff!</p>

<p>This does not make me someone who will only accept ideology from the modern scientific system. It makes me someone who is capable of critical thought and carefully chooses which beliefs to integrate. Anyone can make a website on the internet :)</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible to argue that the the issue of Morgellons is unsettled, but I find that hard to believe. Morgellons, or ideas like it, has been around for at least 75 years. It is quite a leap of faith to believe that medical research on Morgellons is being stifled. It takes a $150 microscope to examine the &quot;fibers&quot; that sufferers claim afflict them. Nobody, in all this time, has bought a microscope to prove that these fibers are not clothing fibers...?</p>

These people are suffering (not in quotes) from a real and disturbing condition which amateur debunkers like you have dismissed as &quot;laughable&quot;.  Yes, you do owe an apology.</p>

<p>&quot;In conclusion, MD lesions were not caused by self-mutilation or
delusions in the three cases presented here. The photographic evidence clearly demonstrates that the unusual fibers or filaments described in this study are not self-implanted textile fibers. All three patients had symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with systemic illness and indicative of tickborne disease.</p>

<p>Neuropsychiatric testing was normal in two cases and influenced by the disease in the third case, and all three patients were examined by a medical practitioner who confirmed the presence of fibers underneath unbroken skin compatible with a diagnosis of MD.</p>

<p>We have demonstrated that filaments found in MD patients have chemical, physical and immunohistological features of keratin. The presence of individual filaments attached to epithelial tissue is consistent with keratin and suggests that the filaments are produced by keratinocytes. Morgellons filaments have been photographed growing from pavement epithelial cells, and this process resembles the evolution of filaments seen in BDD. Because BDD is a disease in which spirochetes have been identified as primary etiologic agents, and spirochetal sero-reactivity has been associated with MD, it is reasonable to assume that spirochetal infection plays an important role in MD filament production. Further immunohistological and electron microscopy studies are needed to solve the mystery of Morgellons filaments.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your first quote isn&#39;t in the paper as far as I could search.</p>

<p>The second only states that they were not self implanted.</p>

<p>The third merely says that &quot;fibers&quot; (not specified) are present.</p>

<p>The fourth, when read with more context simply states that Morgellons fibers are hair and skin cells growing oddly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Influenza virus kills perfectly healthy people every day. Even with an ineffective vaccine like this years, we still stand to prevent tens of thousands of hospital visits and some amount of deaths. There is one theory in the community right now that if they increase the strain count in the yearly vaccine from four to six it might be enough to bring effectiveness over the 50% margin. The issue with Influenza is how widespread it is and how quickly it can evolve.</p>

<p>To give an example, I got the flu shot this year. About a month later I got infected with the flu. Due to genetic drift I was infected, the virus had evolved enough that my immune system didn&#39;t immediately remove it. In the end however, because I was inoculated against a very similar virus, the flu was gone and out of my system within 2 days instead of the usual 7 to 12 days of sickness. It was mild. I barely noticed it.</p>

<p>So even with an ineffective vaccine, it still saved me a lot of trouble and time and money.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The single most preventive action to combat COMMON sickness was proper hygiene and living conditions. Polio Vaccine, small pox, Ebola, yes I do agree with you about. Flu? Not so much.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hygiene didn&#39;t eradicate diseases from entire continents. Vaccinations did. Immunologists did. We have a lot of proof on that subject that we can readily pull up. The layman evidence is generally easy to understand graphs of infections over time. They are well sourced.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s what all of your type does. If they don&#39;t go along with what you believe is the best for everyone they &quot;must need a doctor&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now I am not innocent of lumping a group of people together around here but I&#39;d just like to point out that is exactly what you are doing and its uncalled for.</p>

<p>Edit: That downvote button, you&#39;re only supposed to use it if people don&#39;t add to the conversation. Its not a &quot;I disagree&quot; button...</p>

<p>I believe the estimate is <strong>9 out of 10 people</strong> who die from Influenza in the US are over the age of 65.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indicating that even in a population which is half vaccinated, nearly a thousand healthy people die yearly as a result of complications caused by this virus (most not being vaccinated). Then again this sounds too generalized to be taken seriously and definitely does not account for infant influenza deaths.</p>

<p>A quick google search on the subject turned up all sorts of relevant material. Here are a few links.</p>

</ul>

<p>I really can&#39;t stress how much that is just a tiny snippet of all the stuff that can easily be found by anyone. Of particular interest there is the Canadian statistics as Health Canada keeps those updated quite frequently. Note the activity and death rate for this flu season.</p>

<p>Further I will add that many people get light colds and mistake that for the flu. If you get the flu you are most likely bed ridden for at least a couple days unless <sup>you</sup> <sup><sup>are</sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup>vaccinated.</sup></sup></sup> Even if you still get the flu after having the vaccine, its more often then not much more milder like I described what happened to me in a previous post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the link, but BDD is identifiable along with possible patogens and compostion. But OPs claim that the fibers were &quot;of no known plant, animal, or synthetic nature&quot;, has no standing whatsoever. It&#39;s as if the samples <em>couldn&#39;t be analyzed</em>, despite the plethora of methods available. This is a constant statement used by most pseudo-scientific <em>researchers</em> to justify how <em>exotic</em> and <em>unexplainable</em> (and hence outside scientific method) their <em>studies</em> are.</p>

<p>Maybe there might be some connection between &quot;Morgellons&quot; and BDD (though doubtful since the former is multi-colored and of different appearance). And while many scientific postulates have been re-written, such statements as the above, just add to my scepticism.</p>
