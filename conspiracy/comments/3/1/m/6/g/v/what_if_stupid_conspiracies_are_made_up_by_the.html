<blockquote>
<p>Also the fact that they made it past the van Allen radiation belts.</p>

<p>A super short explanation of the Van Allen belts is this: </p>

<p>They travelled through the belts in a sufficiently shielded shuttle, at a sufficient speed, to experience a low enough time of exposure to not be at risk of any short term health effects.</p>

<p>The Van Allen belts were a concern, but not enough to jeapordise the mission. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m on my phone can elaborate later. There are videos where they jumped, they don&#39;t jump very high, too similar to someone jumping on earth. Even their walks are similar to someone walking on the earth. I would imagine it to be recognisably different.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still not convinced about the van allen belts especially because they seem to be trying really hard to solve that issue today. But then again, I might be wrong. I&#39;m just more critical than the average person if you can&#39;t already tell. And since 9/11, I don&#39;t believe a lot of things that comes from america. They are quite good at deception and the smoke and mirror game.</p>

<p>Also I would imagine they would conduct moon missions much more frequently and knowing america, should have even set up a base there.</p>

<p>Also them planning a moon mission was in reaction to Russia launching the first satellite. They had something to prove. They could not stand failing, so given the various challenges in sending humans to outer space, successfully landing your manned probe on moon and then returning to earth, they decided to stage it cause the alternate to that was that they failed. Given the cold war climate of the times, I don&#39;t think they were ready to admit that.</p>

<p>Whilst the moon has substantially weaker gravity than on Earth, their equipment weighs a lot. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Equipment today, despite being more technologically advanced, is still vulnerable to radiation. The issue of shielding electronics will always exist. Even more so when electronics become more prevalent. </p>

<p>Electronics are more difficult to protect against than for humans. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also I would imagine they would conduct moon missions much more frequently and knowing america, should have even set up a base there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A moon base would be extremely expensive. </p>

<p>There is little to be gained by establishing a base on the moon. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>If they failed, the Russians would&#39;ve noticed and called them out on it. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Incorrect. </p>

<p>The radiation has always been a threat. Just that back in the day OH&amp;S wasn&#39;t as much as a concern. </p>

<p>The Astronauts can perform their mission just fine, however radiation at that level doesn&#39;t have any short term effects - It&#39;s all long term. </p>

<p>In regards to electronics, the more sensitive some electronics become, the greater the requirements to shield them. </p>

<p>For example. In a thunderstorm, my computer will shut down after a strong bolt of lightning, but my TV will stay on - Different electronics behave differently in varying conditions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is certainly the case - not just to cover up real ones, but to discredit other targets. For example, it&#39;s a proven fact that the &quot;US government created AIDS&quot; conspiracy was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_INFEKTION">fiction of the KGB</a>. That&#39;s certain not to be the only example.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a very easy way to distract from the reality. The aliens at Ares 51 is another likely good example. Maybe the &quot;no-one died at Sandy Hook&quot; theory is a government fiction, say, to distract from Adam Lanza being a test of a government assassin program i.e. &quot;Let&#39;s see how rock-solid our programming is - will he obey orders to kill six-year-old?&quot;</p>

<p>I really think this is going on a <strong>lot</strong> more than many would think, or like to admit. </p>

<p>guys...</p>

<p>hey... look what if the moon landing was fake and could be proven beyond a doubt, those involved would feel good about themselves, and then what? What would it accomplish, besides entitling you to a pat on the back? It was decades ago. DECADES. Nobody even cares about the moon anymore, it&#39;s just a big orbiting rock, and I&#39;m not sure if moon rock even has a practical use. We&#39;ve all got our sights set on planets that can used as a resource, like Mars and other systems.</p>

<p>Does any of it matter at all? Takes a whole life time to travel to mars, and that is by far the closest planet that looks like it could be a resource or habitable. Going to be long after we&#39;re dead of old age that populating other planets will happen, so I don&#39;t feel like it affects us personally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You really don&#39;t think it would matter if it were made obvious to everyone on the planet that the Moon landings were faked?  Immediately, overnight, we would know without question that the Cold War was a fabrication, that to this day Russia and the US are on good enough terms where Russia has never revealed the hoax, that to this day no other government around the world has either, that NASA is a fraud and thus everything they&#39;ve done since the 60&#39;s at least would come into question, that we were deceived by our own government for decades all while footing the bill (probably hundreds of billions of dollars) etc., etc.</p>

<p>It would be a far bigger deal than you&#39;re suggesting above.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re underestimating human apathy, especially in todays digital world where we spend so many hours a day with phones and face book, checking up on our local gossip columns and obsessing whether or not your facebook profile is going to ruin your professional career or job application because your boss thinks you and or/friends are assholes. Most of these facts you quoute have faded into obscurity, and been buried under an avalanche of social and celebrity media so if there is any window at all for a fake moon landing to cause a huge controversy, it&#39;s not going to be there for much longer..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m on my phone can elaborate later. There are videos where they jumped, they don&#39;t jump very high, too similar to someone jumping on earth. Even their walks are similar to someone walking on the earth. I would imagine it to be recognisably different.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still not convinced about the van allen belts especially because they seem to be trying really hard to solve that issue today. But then again, I might be wrong. I&#39;m just more critical than the average person if you can&#39;t already tell. And since 9/11, I don&#39;t believe a lot of things that comes from america. They are quite good at deception and the smoke and mirror game.</p>

<p>Also I would imagine they would conduct moon missions much more frequently and knowing america, should have even set up a base there.</p>

<p>Also them planning a moon mission was in reaction to Russia launching the first satellite. They had something to prove. They could not stand failing, so given the various challenges in sending humans to outer space, successfully landing your manned probe on moon and then returning to earth, they decided to stage it cause the alternate to that was that they failed. Given the cold war climate of the times, I don&#39;t think they were ready to admit that.</p>
