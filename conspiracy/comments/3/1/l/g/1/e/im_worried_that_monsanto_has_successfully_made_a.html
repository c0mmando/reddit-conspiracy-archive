       Probably true. I would put it that in any case they should be labelled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally my biggest problem is the whole issue of patented seeds and plants.  We are going to end up in a world where no one will be able to grow food without paying people who own patent on the genes, and seeds that cannot be reused.

       One of Monsanto's patents, for its last generation GMO seed, just ended, and now the seed is open for anyone to sell. I haven't heard any further developments on it, but I would expect farmers to just reuse the last generation now, which was against Monsanto's policies.

       We need to consider the full ramifications of gene patenting.

       The new TPP trade agreement allows corporations to sue governments for passing laws that could 'harm current or future profits'.
      </p>
      <p>
       A fully realized extension of this could be Corporations blocking governments from passing laws that would outlaw human genetic manipulation and ownership.

       Good point.

       And my biggest gripe is that it basically sets industrial farming practices in stone and reduces the natural variety by extension, by putting ecological and financial pressure on biodiversity, smaller agricultural structures and research into natural mechanisms of pest control.

       But the patent does expire, and the seed still exists, thus nixing the notion that they will control food supplies indefinitely. There will be an array of off-patent seed that could be used.

For applications filed before June 8, 1995 and for patents that were still in force on June 8, 1995, the patent term is either 17 years from the issue date or 20 years from the filing date of the earliest U.S. or international (PCT) application to which priority is claimed (excluding provisional applications), the longer term applying.

       Copyright Act of 1790 â€“ established U.S. copyright with term of 14 years with 14-year renewal
Copyright Act of 1831 â€“ extended the term to 28 years with 14-year renewal
Copyright Act of 1909 â€“ extended term to 28 years with 28-year renewal
Copyright Act of 1976 â€“ extended term to either 75 years or life of author plus 50 years (prior to this, "[t]he interim renewal acts of 1962 through 1974 ensured that the copyright in any work in its second term as of September 19, 1962, would not expire before Dec. 31, 1976.");[11] extended federal copyright to unpublished works; preempted state copyright laws; codified much copyright doctrine that had originated in case law
Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988 â€“ established copyrights of U.S. works in Berne Convention countries
Copyright Renewal Act of 1992 â€“ removed the requirement for renewal
Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA) of 1994 â€“ restored U.S. copyright for certain foreign works
Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998 â€“ extended terms to 95/120 years or life plus 70 years

       Again: my point is that copyright has been where they have had decades of fighting and success.  Patents, not so much.  They added 2 years in 1995.  Relatively speaking, patent terms haven't changed, but copyright has.

       this is exactly it for me too.  How can 1 or a few companies legally owning the rights to food be considered a good idea in any way, shape, or form.  And that is what I believe is the purpose of GMOs.  You can't just patent normal seeds, but if you install a new aspect to the seeds you can claim it as your own property.
      </p>
      <p>
       We see the effectiveness of the bug resistant plants is questionable, and the production of the plants isn't any better or only minimally better from standard seeds.  So what's with such a push to get everyone believing in the power of GMOs?

       Long term control of the masses via food.

       Nonsense. The laws allowing seeds to be patented came about in the 1930's; some half a century before GMO seeds were created. Seeds created through more traditional breeding are patentable and have been patented for decades.

       Yes I see all of your well researched documentation to prove me wrong.   Also, it doesn't matter to me what you believe.  I am not here to convince you of anything.  I simply don't believe control over food supply via patented seeds is good for humanity.  Maybe you do, and that is your right.  I don't have nearly as much faith in letting the future of our food supply up to corporations as you do.

       Your response to my patenting seeds comment doesn't make any sense.  I think you're confused.  I'm saying companies make a slight or major variation in the genetic make up of a plant (which they did not create) and then claim it as their own.  Then when all farmers are pushed to using these patented seeds you have control over food supply.  That is my point, and you addressed none of it.

       See above, if the plant doesn't have an advantage over the previous variety why would I buy it and grow it?  If I have a McIntosh apple tree and you develop one with a slight different trait and patent it, why would I buy yours?  There has to be a benefit or no one is going to use it, and these patents expire, soybeans are a great example.

       All he said is that he hates how pro-GMO they are. Farming should not equate to pro-GMO.

      <p>
       In reality, these companies coddle the farmers and build a program for them to just slide into instead of being independent farmers. So the farmers latch onto them and get in line with their propaganda.

       aFarmers are pro-GMO because the technology makes their lives so much simpler and they understand the practical science behind GMOs. The problem is most anti-GMO advocates have no understanding of modern farming practices, so the suggestions they make would send farming practices back to the 1920s. Since the population is so much larger now than it was back then, it would be virtually impossible to continue feeding everyone in America without either raising food prices substantially, or continue using GMOs.

       The world produces more than enough food to feed every single person on this earth a well nourished diet. The reason it doesn't happen is because people overproducing corn in the US for e.g. have no incentive to use it to feed people in Africa.

       Well the majority of the corn grown in the US is animal feed, biofuel or for making other ingredients. They are not suitable for human consumption.

       Not to mention, even if they were edible, what do you think would happen to the farming infrastructure in countries that we send free food to? They'll collapse (as no one will buy food if they get it for free) and suddenly, they have absolutely zero capacity to feed themselves and will have to 100% rely on the west to feed themselves, which would be a disaster.

       True, and that's because of aggressive marketing of a single kind of seed (that's GMO) to take advantage of the lopsided, subsidized corn market in America. The animal feed, biofuel, corn-syrup industries are created from and in concert with this exponential cultivation of a single crop. They could very well grow other kinds of edible corn or crops with the same agricultural scale, ability and technology. The point is not this is what they grow now, but if you could suspend disbelief for a moment and imagine a post-nationalist globalized and unified world, there's more than enough food for exponential population growth. NOT in the tradition of American/Western over-consumption of course (but that's another topic)

       Actually it wont be free it would still be sold. Besides, the US has exported a hell of a lot of food as aid in famine struck countries around the globe for decades. It's not impossible, but we humans are known to only take on logistical organization like that in case of war.

       They

       grow more, but as we're discussing, volume of food (or lack thereof) is not the issue. Plus animal feed and biofuel growing has a market that is demanding this crop. That's why it exists. It would make no sense to force farmers to stop selling to this market and change to fill further an already saturated food market.

      <p>
       That's fine as a temporary solution to a sudden widespread famine, but as a long-term solution it would be disastrous. Even selling it will damage their own farming industry as it will flood the market with (arguably) better quality food. It would be better to assist them with developing their agricultural industries to grow better crops, and GMO has a role to play in that.

       I just wrote a long response to someone else on this thread so pardon me if I paraphrase here. Your point is valid in terms of looking at the world here and now. The state of Bihar, the poorest in India, beat the world record for both rice and potato yields (
       <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/feb/16/india-rice-farmers-revolution">

       ) and did it without any GMO's or herbicides.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a myth that GMO's are somehow integral to increasing crop yields, they are simply the most profitable way and thus has been pushed into the public consciousness. There's great advancement in irrigation, hydroponics, permaculture and other sustainable methods of increasing yields. The problem with GMO's is that locks farmers essentially into contracts with seed cycles, something which is ridiculously unsustainable given the poverty of most of the worlds farmers. This is the reason countries like India are the ones fighting the US on food security issues in the international trade talks.

       A tractor is largely a one time purchase, with the help of subsidies and loans, that a farmer in the developing world can potentially afford or rent and put to good use. GMO seeds are recurring expense, year on year, a poor crop may mean you lose your tractor to the bank and have to go back to the bullock cart, but a poor crop under GMO means you literally can't afford next seasons seeds. See the difference?

       The logic that gmo isn't bad just because it costs money? Nothing monsanto is doing keeps farmers in less developed nations from farming the same way they have for thousands of years. If a farmer plants gmo it's because they think that their investment will make them more profit. If their investment doesn't pay off, that isn't monsanto's fault.

       That's hyperbolic. If a farmer wants to reuse his seed, then he needs to find a supplier that allows this. Plus no one is "locked in" to a seed contract for a long duration. Once the crop is harvested, they can go elsewhere for seed.

       That's not how farming works in the majority of agricultural world. Certain amount of harvest is always saved as seed for next season, so next season you have to buy less seed. Stability is achieved when you've created enough seed stores to survive a drought or bad season (which have a much worse effect on small to micro holding farms in the developing world). With GMO seeds Monsanto makes them sign an agreement that they will not save or resell any seeds and will sue. (
       <a href="http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/pages/why-does-monsanto-sue-farmers-who-save-seeds.aspx">
        http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/pages/why-does-monsanto-sue-farmers-who-save-seeds.aspx
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a locked in program. GMO's come into the market and is priced as low as possible, aggressively marketed to more-than-likely uneducated farmers who need every boost they can get, farmer signs up. His next crop looks great, his neighbors notice and also invest in it. As low as they are priced GMO's will still be more than local variants so the poorer farmers are enticed by small loans or deferred payment programs. They are essentially locked into a pattern of buying GMO seeds every year and depend on prices for that crop to be good enough to sustain their yearly costs, with no seed bank to depend on if anything goes wrong. This is not hyperbole or conjecture, this is what has actually happened to millions of small and micro holdings farmers in developing countries with unregulated GMO proliferation.

       This hasn't been standard practice in large-scale agriculture since the 30's, with the invention of modern hybrid seeds. Hybrid seeds drop drastically in quality with every subsequent generation, so it is always better for a farmer to buy the better strains than to try and scrimp by reusing poor quality seeds for free.

       what are you talking about this is still standard practice for majority of farmers in the world, it's not standard practice in the west anymore because small holding farms barely exist there, but the west represents at tiny fraction of farms in the world. HYV's are hybrid seeds that were bred to make them disease resistant and High Yield. They've been saved, sold, reproduced since the 1960's. Most wheat you find in the world today will have a big chance to be directly related to HYV's made by Norman Borlaug and his colleagues.

       Food security is not a major risk in the western developed world, mainly because your ratio of population:arable land is more than favorable. Food security is a major issue in the developing world, which is where GMO manufacturers are pushing for more unregulated proliferation.

       It's equally naive to think that GMO's crucial in helping farmers increase yields, or that it makes sense for seed prices globally to become distorted due to patent laws and rights, similar to drug prices and the pharmaceutical industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       The State of Bihar is one of the poorest in India, whose own history has been plagued by famine due to a distorted ratio of population:arable land. Yet it is breaking record after world record for crop yields without using GMO's or new pesticides

        Source
       </a>
       . They currently hold the records for both rice and potatoes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet these are the same farmers that the Monsanto and other western companies want to push GMO's onto, using the argument that it is better for their food security. They're using this shit as another technocratic example of how western technology will save the world while ignoring the innovation going on in organics, permaculture and farming in the very places that have to deal with these issues on a daily basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       And none of that is to mention pure waste in the supply chain. Fuck me the single most economic thing they could do is work for better, cheaper and sustainable cold storage solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR we don't need GMO for food security, it's a myth.

       That's actually not GMO, Norman Borlaug did research genetics but the HYV (High Yield Varieties) Seeds he developed were from selective breeding, a practice thousands of years old, basically as old as agriculture. He also held no patent on these seeds and were allowed to be re-harvested, re-planted, re-sold.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not some anti-science guy who thinks GMO foods have poison in them because they are genetically modified. I'm against them because a) the economics of it will subjugate farmers to practices primarily concerned by profit, not food security and b) their proliferation has a very real possibility of undermining genetic diversity and becoming the cause of famine rather than a solution.

       Increasing yields is pointless in some areas as it will only produce further waste. The problem comes down to spoilage and improper infrastructure for storage in a lot of areas. Look at India for example. Instead of throwing money at an unsustainable solution there should be efforts to create long-term, viable solutions. On a small scale would you suggest a household obtain more food while a lot of it is rotting away or invest in a fridge and freezer?

       You say that, but there are real concerns. There are major water shortages happening worldwide - this is an undisputed fact, and it's only gonna get worse. This will lead to more failed crops, and less available land to grow on.
      </p>
      <p>
       One day we
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       have a better distribution system, but the issue of food security will not go away. It is better to have a solution prepared before the problem than to wait until it happens to do something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, 95% of labs working on this issue aren't run by corporations. They are public funded institutions, many universities. The lab underneath mine is doing research not for profit, but to create knowledge the benefits of everyone. They don't intend for patented seeds or restrictions. They want this to become available to everyday farmers.

       Yeah, I agree with this type of technology. Something like should totally be adopted where possible, and has huge potential. And yes, if this can be used instead of GM - do it!
      </p>
      <p>
       But a blanket "NO GMO" stance is not good - as there are still problems that at this stage GMO is better suited to dealing with, especially as there are GM products (and those in development) where the safety of it is highly unlikely to be of any concern (due to the nature of the modification - better stress response or metabolism modifications are completely different to implementing Bt or other pesticides and pesticide resistance. And yet they are being lumped in together and generating a
       <em>
        blanket

       anti-GMO sentiment not based on science or any other evidence).

       I think most people here aren't blanket anti-gmo dumb dumbs that you have this preconceived notion of.  We are mostly anti-biotech because they're essentially petrochemical companies trying to monopolize the agricultural market and their track record of blatant disregard for humanity and massive poisoning of the environment (PCBs) proves that they definitely deserve our ire.
      </p>
      <p>
       We hate biotech for the same reason we hate Halliburton and Goldman Sachs, they are corrupt crony-capitalist douchebags.  We will never support genetic engineering until it's fully in the hands of independent scientists without profit motive.. unfortunately that doesn't exist anymore.

       and tell me that using GMO in this situation is not one of the best (and in that case, one of the safest) solutions we can currently do.
      </p>
      <p>
       GMOs that provide better drought resistance are not like GMOs for pesticide or herbicide resistance in terms of health risk.

       You're sort of making my point for me here.  Like I said, infrastructure and transportation are two of the main concerns.  The amount of water on the planet is easily sufficient for everyone living on it.

       Nope, I'm not saying that at all.  I'm saying that the action we should be taking is to address the problems I listed above and the food scarcity would disappear.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example: everyone living today has access to water or else they'd be dead.  So the questions then are: can we get them this water for cheaper, more conveniently, and with better service?  I think the answers to all three questions are yes.

       Right, but I'm sure the implementation of such infrastructure is currently prohibitively expensive.
      </p>

       However, I will gladly open it with open arms! I agree wholeheartedly with the principle you are making. Better infrastructure would have a much bigger impact.

       However this still doesn't invalidate the use of GMOs - there are many potential uses for the technology. And... until such infrastructure is implemented? ;)

       On one had I agree with the stance that GMO is simply part of the evolution of farming, part of the same process that gave us the common wheat or rice today from their wild ancestors.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time I find it near impossible to believe that GMO research doesn't have private investment behind it. It is simply too much expenditure on research to not have an incentive. You can say publicly funded but in a world where the US govt tries to patent Basmati Rice, a strain cultivated in India for eons before the United States was even established, it doesn't mean much whether it's public or private.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this is also ignoring the much bigger food security issue, that of diseases that become resistant to prolonged use of the same pesticides and the possibility of super bugs that could wipe out entire crops if those crops have no natural variation in their genes (i.e. if everyone is growing the same GMO stuff, the threat to food security from disease is much higher than if it was all naturally grown).

       Actually, both.

       Yeah, I agree that this is an area we need to keep a careful eye on. I do not doubt there are private interests to obtain as much money and control as possible. But there are more noble interests too. I do agree care needs to be applied to this. Transparency is key, as well some freedom of GM technology for purchase by farmers, etc.

       I do think Bt is something that will be very difficulty for a resistance adaption to, due to the nature of it's mechanism (and may require a complete change in the insect digestive system if a resistance is to be evolved). But yes, this is also something that really needs to be watched and continuously studied. I personally am not interested in the whole pesticide/herbicide use of GMOs (I'm more interested in the metabolism side of things), and do not really have much to bring to that topic (I am neither for or against) - but for the majority of farmers (and it seems, consumers) it's an important issue, and their concerns in general should not be ignored.
      </p>

       So yeah, overall I agree with you :)

       YES! My first shill accusation! This going to go framed on my wall!
      </p>
      <p>
       I love this - unable to produce evidence that supports an opposing opinion to a discussion? Accuse of shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       To lazy to discuss - accuse of shill.

       Unable to have a civilized discussion using reason - accuse of shill.

      <p>
       When I was younger I learnt the valuable skill of conceding an opinion. As an indirect result, I went from very much a Pro-GM to being a middle road guy (with a slight pro-gm slant) asking for everyone to chill the fuck out and consider both sides to the debate - as making an informed decision requires being
       <em>
        informed
       </em>
       and that involves many, many long term studies on many issues. A stance that is much, much healthier.

       C'mon dude. Accusing someone of being a shill is terrible practice. It makes your opinion look even more "incorrect". I know you have an opinion and wish for your concerns to be heard - please do! Having different opinions is healthy for humanity. But why would you want your opinion to be viewed as even further "incorrect" due your own actions?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can't post a rebuttal or write something supporting what you're thinking, just do not respond. Or even just say so - nothing wrong with saying "I don't know what else to say on the subject, but I am not fully convinced by what you've presented to me" - it's definitely a lot better than saying "I disagree... you are a shill!".
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is, you don't even think I'm a shill, you're just saying it to anger and frustrate me. But that's not working, so what's the point?

       Every GMO is harmless. What do you mean?

      <p>
       That is the line. Not every GMO is harmless. That's why they have to be tested and approved. And some of us doubt the honesty of a testing system funded by those who are being tested and approved. We look to Europe or other systems that aren't as influenced by Monsanto and see that their "science" shows something different than the US's "science."

       From a scientific point of view, the science and the views in Europe are identical to the ones in the US. The European Union's own scientific body are part of the global consensus on GM safety.

       that's a massive assumption. how do you know aeroponics wont run into the same issues? and if you expect anyone, especially large argo companies, to test their products for 25 years before market, that's insane. no product gets that kind of testing. even medical testing is much much shorter, and you have to test it on various animals before human trials

       They've not approved them for protectionist reasons, not health or scientific ones. They are concerned, understandably, about a scenario where a chunk of Europe's seeds are sourced from a foreign company, and the political issues that could present in the future.

       I don't even think you need to go into whether or not they're harmless.  They provide ZERO value to consumers, there's no extra vitamins or lower calories in them.  The sole reason they exist is (in theory even though it's not true) lower farmers' workloads and costs by allowing them to douse everything in herbicide or let the plant grow with built in herbicide or pesticide.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why consume it?  There's no reason to.

       No it's not, they're on golden rice 2.0 and it's still not in the market last I've heard.

       All those years (10+ i think) and all of the talk about golden rice saving lives, Monsanto could have given vitamin A out to all of these starving kids and saved lives.  Instead, they've used it as an example of how they plan to save the planet.  They're a joke.

       Syngenta (basically Monsanto's hand in the Golden rice project) aren't obligated to distribute their products or anything at all to the public market in .  They just make the technology available for developing countries, which are supposed to use free government institutions to distribute it themselves.  The problem is that countries like India lack the infrastructure to distribute.
      </p>

       I never said Monsanto was a shining  beacon of humanitarian hope, I'm just saying that something was developed with no strings attached use that has the potential to help people,  but it's not their fault it's not in the market.

       But it is their fault partially because it's been tested and found to be lacking in terms of production.  What good is extra beta carotene if the yield for your crop is horrible?  They just like to blame people fighting it for it not being on the market.

       And after they found it lacking in terms of production,  they've already said they will focus on increasing yeilds of Golden Rice.  You don't have to admit Monsanto isn't the antichrist,  or that gmo's are 100% safe,  cause they're not. All I'm saying is that if they're used correctly,  there can be benefits for society.

       I'm not saying it's bad.  I'm saying they use this as the sole example of how good GMOs are when it's not even worth growing.  Show me a real world, in production GMO product that benefits the consumer in any way, shape or form.

       It took hundreds of not thousand of years to develop what we consider corn today. Clearly they've been releasing better and better strains of Golden Rice,  so where's the harm in that? And I don't need to show you anything, because that's not what I'm arguing,  and I'm not even sure if I believe that there are.  My only problem is that you claimed there can be no nutritional benefits,  which is not true.

       That's what most of us have a problem with. I agree that Monsanto does adopt bad practices. But when people who are against this also shift their argument to anti-GMO, that's where most of have a real problem.

       This is like saying "OMG Ford produce really gas heavy cars which are bad for the environment. Everyone ban ALL cars!" While ignoring that a fucking Tesla and other companies exists, or that better fuel technology and carbon capture exists etc.

       GMO is NOT the problem. You would get a lot more support if you emphasised that GMO is a good technology that does have, and has had, proven uses. But make clear the issue is with the business practices of Monsanto. You would get a lot more of those "smart idiots" understanding and even supporting your viewpoint.

       Yeah, but what I'm saying is to not do the reverse! Do not associate all of GMO with those companies! Associate the companies with themselves. Identify the areas that people have issue with and refer to those issues by their name!

       I'm not fully clued up the last two points. Do you mean not revealing the modifications they've made? Although I understand the need for protecting business secrets -  I agree, I do think that's totally terrible practice. I personally hate the "patenting" of genes - science needs to be free and accessible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not agree with mandatory "GMO" labelling. There is "GMO-free" labelling and that should surely be enough (but that's not a debate I want to get into). Should there be mandatory MSG labelling (when there is optional "MSG-free labelling)? As MSG, although earning a bad reputation is, based on the limited information I've read on the topic, still safe (I mean fuck, it's in bloody Doritos!).

       There is mandatory msg labeling in the idea that ingredients are labeled.  And so companies find loopholes by calling it something other than msg.
      </p>
      <p>
       But more importantly, why would GMO labeling be bad? Shouldn't we be allowed to know where our food comes from and how it's made? If GMOs are completely fine then it won't matter if they're labeled, and besides I assume they're already on everything anyway so people will just realize it's what they've been eating already.
      </p>
      <p>
       And lastly, i wouldn't assume anything is good because it's in doritos. In fact I would presume that it's probably completely unhealthy if it's in doritos...

       There was a great post on reddit I found that explained why perfectly - but I can not find and do not have the time or energy to try and replicate myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the labelling of GMO should be done in a way that isn't basically marking foods containing GM as "bad". Especially if there is no difference in the quality of ingredient (as in... no difference at all in composition). I mentioned once before... allergens are written in bold in the ingredient list of foods. Maybe GM foods, if they
       <em>
        had
       </em>
       to be labelled should be labelled by simple italics.
      </p>
      <p>
       e.g.
Ingredients:
       <strong>
        <em>
         Wheat
        </em>
       </strong>
       , water, sugar
      </p>
      <p>
       Bold as allergen, italic as GM sourced. I feel this is a good compromise if it had to happen. Available to those wish to find out. Not shoved in the face of those who don't even know what GMO is and easily scared/reactionary.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it will likely move many consumers away from buying GM (and although up for debate, they would
       <em>
        unnecessarily
       </em>
       be moving away from GM), thus manufacturer's would not sourcing GM foods, and thus could potentially taking away funding and research into GM.  Although this is conjecture and highly opinionated.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not happy with the strength of the argument above, and do not wish to debate it as I've seen it better explained elsewhere (and I'm sure there are holes in what I said) that covers points that I did not even consider, and covers them better.
      </p>

       That's just your opinion though and one I personally disagree with.  Let's take an extreme example and say that I think that little martians are infesting my brain when I eat GMO foods and thus want to avoid them.  Regardless of whether I'm correct or not, it is my prerogative as a consumer to avoid it for whatever reason I choose - it's my body, it's my mind.  Why does Monsanto get to decide for me what I can and can't know when it comes to the food me and my family are eating?  What logical sense does it make for them to hide their products?
      </p>
      <p>
       Their lack of transparency certainly suggests that they have something to hide - I can't remember any other company fighting so hard against having their products put in the spotlight.

       You said "they want to sell you their products". Except they don't. They want to sell farmers their products. While as a consumer you will eventually foot the cost to the food producer to cover the food producers buying from the ingredients distributors buying from the farmers buying seeds from Monsanto, that doesn't in any reasonable way equal "Monsanto selling you their product", any more than John Deere don't sell you their tractors. They sell tractors to farmers.

       And there you go mentioning John Deere again.  Do you really not understand the difference between using a certain tractor to work a farm and literally modifying the genes of various types of food in a lab somewhere?  Because it's a massive difference and a really bad comparison on your part.
      </p>
      <p>
       But besides that, none of this has anything to do with the two important facts here which are that 1. the consumer is the one consuming the product, and thus should know what they're buying and 2. the consumer is the one ultimately footing the bill for the product and, thus, is the one providing Monsanto and the other GM companies' profits.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I'm not the one Monsanto is selling its products too, then why would it matter if their products were labeled or not?  I mean, I'm not the one buying them right?  This is the type of nonsense logic you're attempting to use here when the obvious, blatant facts are that the consumer is the one both consuming and paying for GMO products.

       Whether one is a tractor and one is a seed modified in a lab has zero bearing on the fact that you do not directly buy either from the manufacturer directly, so your statement of "they want to sell

      <p>
       The consumer ultimately foots the bill for the rental of the tractor. Therefore they have a right to know the manufacturer of the tractor harvesting the food too.

       Do you not remember your own comment? The one where you said that people should get labelling because they don't like some companies? So should I not get labelling to help me if I have a thing against John Deere? Or does labelling to help people's political or personal vendettas against a company only apply to ones you views align with?

        Because the push for mandatory labelling is a deliberate effort to damage their business. You're literally saying you don't understand why they would not be supporting a move designed intentionally to undermine them, which would see them breaking their legal responsibility to their shareholders. I'm not sure why this is confusing to you.

       No, you've been telling me that Monsanto isn't selling their products to me but to farmers.  If they aren't selling to me, then I'm not buying from them.  If I'm not buying from them, then it shouldn't matter whether their products are labeled or not, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       However, since it's obvious that consumers are in fact the ones consuming and paying for GMO products, this idea of yours is totally illogical and irrelevant as I've pointed out to you multiple times now.

       When you eat an orange harvested by a piece of John Deere machinery, you aren't eating any of the John Deere machinery.  Do you get that?  John Deere didn't directly change the food's content or flavor or yield or look or genetic make-up.  It isn't an

       Arguably correct, and I can assure you 100% that all Monsanto products are labelled GMO when sold to their buyer. If you bought GMO corn or canola, or any GMO seed from them, the bags would all be labelled GMO. However when you buy food, you're not buying from Monsanto in the same way as if I buy a Ford Fusion, I'm buying from Ford and not Mittel Steel, regardless of the fact that Mittel steel sold them the materials to make the car.

       GMO isn't an ingredient. It's a method for getting the seed. The ingredient is corn (or HFCS, most probably) which is functionally identical to non-GMO corn. While I genuinely get your request to know if it's GMO and fully support a label, the current non-GMO voluntary label is perfectly sufficient.

       Sorry you don't agree, but indirectly demanding the regulations surrounding labelling be ripped up just to entertain you (which is the inevitable consequence of making GMO a mandatory label) doesn't provide enough benefit to warrant doing so.

       "Ripping up regulations" wouldn't be required at all (perhaps you can elaborate on what you even mean by this) nor is my desire to be "entertained".  I simply want to know what's in the food I'm eating and as a consumer I have the right to know what I'm buying - and I'm not alone in this.

       it's sufficient because the purpose of lifestyle labels are to identify to those who are interested what foods they
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       eat, not to highlight the vast majority of the foods they
       <em>
        cannot
       </em>
       eat. Vegetarian labels show vegetarians what foods they can eat. Kosher labels show Jews what foods they can eat. Halal labels show Muslims what foods they can eat. Vegan labels show vegans what foods they can eat. "Non-GMO" foods show those who want to avoid GMO what foods they can eat. Therefore a non-GMO label is sufficient as it shows you what foods you can eat. The only reason it's a "non" label is because there's not a generally accepted term for people who avoid GMOs or food that
       <em>
        specifically
       </em>
       caters to those who avoid GMOs.

      <p>
       Sure thing. Currently as things stand, lifestyle labels (GMO, vegetarian, kosher etc) have a voluntary labelling system, and essential health or nutrition information (calories, fat content etc) has a mandatory labelling system.
      </p>
      <p>
       GMO foods pose zero health problems to humans and are functionally identical to non-GMO foods. Therefore since they aren't a health or nutrition concern, they qualify as a lifestyle label and are voluntary.
      </p>
      <p>
       The recent push has been to try and make the GMO label mandatory, which would put them in the "essential health or nutrition information" category, but those pushing for it have been completely unable to give any reason
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       it needs to have this status, instead only saying that some people want to know". While it is understandable that some people want to know if their food contains ingredients derived from GMOs, it doesn't fit the criteria of a mandatory label. Therefore to make it a mandatory label, you would need to rescind all the rules surrounding labelling and make "some people want to know" a fitting criteria for mandatory labelling. The problem with this is that there is a seemingly endless list of things that would fall under the "some people want to know" criteria, and with the precedent of the GMO label, there would be no reason not to entertain any combination of crazy mandatory labels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look; it's not that I'm against your desire to know. What I'm saying is that you'd be best pushing for the expansion of the current label rather than demand a second label that defies all the current regulations surrounding labels that
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       lead to the public mistaking it for a warning label and
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       lead to lobby groups purposely misleading the public so they can grow the turnover of their respective industry. That doesn't suddenly become OK because it lines up with your politics.

       Maybe you missed the point that the stated intention of these labels is to do the
       <em>
        opposite
       </em>
       of educate the public. This makes them similar in that regard to those "evolution is only a theory" labels that used to adorn some textbooks: they weren't about educating the public on the fact that evolution is a theory (which is correct), but is an attempt to mislead the public into thinking that it's merely a hypothetical guess. These mandatory GMO labels are specifically designed to mislead the public into thinking there is something wrong with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well then the organic industry should be promoting the current label rather than trying to deceive the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the non-GMO label is identical in that regard to every other lifestyle label. It is designed to appeal to those specifically looking for that thing, in the same way that the organic, vegetarian, kosher, halal etc labels are designed to appeal to only that specific group, rather than the public at large.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be like the Jewish community complaining that not all kosher food is labelled, and demanding a mandatory "trief" label on everything that isn't kosher. We don't do that because all lifestyle labels (GMO included) are voluntary and are designed to appeal only to those specific interested folks to look for.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's only a "non-label" because there's not a specific term for GMO-free food. If "Vegetarian" wasn't a word, they would have "verified non-meat" labels. Would that be unacceptable too?

Now the reasons these groups want the labels may be different from mine, but it isn't like they're putting "GMO" with a skull and crossbones or a surgeon general's warning.  If that were the case you might have an argument and I'd agree with you, unless of course it were proven with relative certainty that labels like that were accurate.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        And the non-GMO label is identical in that regard to every other lifestyle label. It is designed to appeal to those specifically looking for that thing, in the same way that the organic, vegetarian, kosher, halal etc labels are designed to appeal to only that specific group, rather than the public at large.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If it were the same thing, why are there no "non-organic", "non-kosher", "non-vegetarian", "non-halal" labels?  Do you not see the obvious difference there?  One is a lable, one is a non-label.  You're essentially saying that GMOs are labeled because
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       non-GMOs are labeled, which is just nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       If every single non-GMO food was labeled then you would maybe have a point, but that isn't the case.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We don't do that because all lifestyle labels (GMO included) are voluntary and are designed to appeal only to those specific interested folks to look for.

      <p>
       How is GMO voluntary when it
       <em>
        isn't labeled
       </em>
       ?  It's in nearly all of our food (in the US) and we don't even know it's there, it's being deliberately hidden from the labels.  Maybe your definition of "voluntary" is different from mine.  I don't remember asking for GMO to be put into the entire food supply or voting for it - do you?

       Because food without meat is called "vegetarian", food grown using non-synthetic pesticides/herbicides/fertilisers are called "organic". Food prepared according to Jewish rules is called "Kosher". There's currently not a word for food specifically made without GMO ingredients, but if there were the "Verified non-GMO label" would be called "Verified X" with X being the word for it. That's semantics and somewhat irrelevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that lifestyle labels (of which GMO is one) are designed to appeal only to those looking for that type of food and is printed on the food that those who follow that lifestyle can eat. Mandatory labels are reserved only for essential health or nutrition information that the public
       <em>
        needs
       </em>
       to know. While I get that you would
       <em>
        like
       </em>
       to know if food contains GMO ingredients, there isn't a pressing need for you to know so you can make essential health or nutrition decisions. To grant the GMO label the elevated status of being the same as an essential health or nutrition label will not only give the public the mistaken belief that this must therefore be something to be concerned about, but if the only reason you can give is "because you want to know", and that's good enough to warrant a mandatory label, then there's no conceivable end to the list of mandatory labels that could be created on the basis that some groups want to know.

       This isn't true.  The most obvious example being the amount of round up sprayed on Monsanto seed crops relative to that sprayed on natural crops.

       They don't "make food", they just create and sell the seeds that turn into the food, and create and sell the herbicide that the seeds/crops get doused in.  Tell me more about how the seed from which a plant springs doesn't qualify as "making" said plant.

       The FDA and the huge chemical conglomerates which dominate the GMO marketplace and spend millions of dollars funding studies which support their products, millions of dollars lobbying the FDA and other government officials to support their products, and millions of dollars in litigation/marketing to convince the public to support their products.

        So the "lifestyle label" for GMO takes the form of a non-GMO label?  You realize that that makes no sense at all right?  You're saying GMO is a "lifestyle label", so where is the GMO label?  A non-GMO label is not a GMO-label, as I'm sure you'll agree.

       You want to buy food that doesn't have GMO in. The "non-GMO" label tells you that you are OK to eat this food. This is literally how the lifestyle labelling system works for every other example. The vegetarian label tells vegetarians what they can eat. The Kosher label tells Jews what they can eat. The "non-GMO" label tells you what you can eat. What you want is a
       <em>
        new
       </em>
       label that tells you what you cannot eat, that will mislead the vast majority of the public both through misinterpreting this as a warning label and special interest groups pushing their propaganda. No, that's not gonna happen.

       And since you mentioned it; Bt and Golden rice are predominantly supported by current science. Of course, there should still be precautions (as with anything), but instant dismissal of GMO is wrong -  a careful scientific approach is best. We should support careful analysis, and further studies into current varieties of GM crops (and keep doing them). We should NEVER say "oh it works let's leave it" or say "This guy says it's bad - so we need to ban all of this shit!". Continued long term studies are essential. And yes, we should support increased regulation if a variety is shown to have significantly proven negative effects - but regulation only for that variety.
      </p>
      <p>
       C'mon, let's actually be reasonable on this issue and not jump to extremes (for all sides). Let's do the science and collect as much information as we can, then make an
       <em>
        informed
       </em>
       decision.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Possible contradiction present in my post. The flood resistant rice is still only around five years old.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT2:  Major mistake: Sub1 is not strictly a GMO. It was developed using Marker Assisted Selection, an advanced method of plant breeding.

       I'm not disagreeing with this - if a variety shows reason for concern then action is understandable. As I have said, I agree with criticisms of the business practices of Monsanto. However, I do disagree with the blanket generalization of "GMO is bad" for a multitude of reason already mentioned throughout this thread, but namely because of how unscientific such generalizations are.

       GMO is treated as a bad word because of the reputation it's garnered from the agri-giants and the shilling pop scientists they've bought off.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that there are people dying because of a pushback against GMO food is just propaganda.  There are plenty of contributors to world poverty and malnutrition and Biodiversity issues and Big Agriculture ARE key contributors, so clearly they want to spin this in favor of making themselves the victims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course genetic engineering techniques could end up being a boon and a benefit to civilization, but that's going to need to be proven- and the same arguments are used again and again to prop up a system that in reality has only proven detrimental thus far (not talking about GMOs- talking about Big Ag's influence on trade dynamics).  The last thing third world farmers need is a conglomerate locking down their crops with some form of bio-DRM.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have to start the conversation with GMO as an umbrella term, because otherwise it's too complicated to discuss at a 30k ft view.
      </p>
      <p>
       And my frustration with Golden Rice is that it's a very small benefit being used to promote a very big idea.  But any time you have this discussion, that's the go to argument, along with any other tangential example that generally tends not to fall into the parameters of GMO food at all.  Like when Neil Degrasse Tyson will cockily state that "humans have been genetically modifying food for thousands of years".  If you have to resort to that type of distortion to make your point- you're really upping my skepticism here.  You don't own the word "science".  People have the right to control their food, and science needs to be used to prove safety rather than pass new technologies off as beneficial simply because "it's science".

       Thank you, this makes sense - although as I've always mentioned but always have to repeat, bad business practices are bad!
      </p>
      <p>
       But thanks to this post, I totally understand the perspective you're explaining, and as a result I have a new found understanding and respect for the other "anti-GM" stance.
This makes perfect sense - although I think Golden Rice is used as a "proof of concept" in regards to utility and safety (but again, big difference between that and herbicide/pesticide, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       I still wish for the separation of the two (GMO and big busines) and know that I will still try to direct hate for GMO towards hate for corporations, but I see why it could be seen as otherwise.

       How would this altruistic corporation solve the food crisis? The amount of money put into solving the crisis by NGOs and foreign aid programs is more than most corporations would be able to muster.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't just give money to the government of the third world country, it's probably corrupt and dysfunctional, and very little of it will end up actually feeding the starving people. You can't just send them free food because you'll kill local production.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can go in there and set up a farm, but first you need infrastructure. That's very expensive, there's little local manufacturing so everything must be imported. Skilled workers are also hard to find, those must also be imported. Since conditions aren't great, it takes a lot of money to convince someone to move there, and they won't stay long.
      </p>
      <p>
       To a large extent you must employ locals, both to comply with the law and because there is no other option. The locals are for the most part uneducated. There's a language barrier. Potential employees require a huge amount of training and may disappear at any moment due to disease or violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The poverty also means theft is a huge problem. Anything that's not tied down is quickly stolen, and replacement equipment must again be imported, complete with taxes and bribes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you get the thing up and running, there's no telling how long it will last. The government probably didn't want to sell the land to a foreign company, so they leased it to you. As power shifts in the unstable government, control may be taken away from you and the farm stripped of its valuables and run into the ground. They may direct the output of the farm to a global market, and it is taken from the very people you were trying to feed. The ineffective court system provides little recourse.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR There are a lot of obstacles to solving the food crisis in third world countries; we can't assume a corporation could solve it if only they cared.

       You're asking the wrong question and reversing the burden of proof. GMO supporters use the argument that it helps the poor but in reality we see the opposite happening. That's why I'm telling you, if the purpose of GMO was to help feed the poor, we would've seen it by now. Not only are they not helped, their exploitation has increased by making them slaves of GMO products, in some cases to such an extent that they know no other exit than suicide. And in some cases, this happens by cross-pollination so the victim has actually never chosen to use GMO products.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are opening pandora's box here and it all happens because a few corporations are salivating at the thought of gaining complete control over our food. After all, they don't care about improving the food, they care about it being patented so they have a monopoly on everything we eat.

       Every claim must meet its own burden of proof. I don't think you can draw conclusions about a businesses's motivations based on the fact that they have not solved world hunger. It's a complicated problem and it's going to take more than a new strain of grain to solve.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not defending Monsanto. I'm just saying that, "If they wanted to fix it, it would be fixed," is a bad argument.

       It's not a bad argument, it's the reality. It's like a drug user coming up with new excuses, "
       <em>
        this will be the last time, I promise
       </em>
       ". So to, do companies swindle us, arguing that "
       <em>
        once we have GMO food, then *finally
       </em>
       we'll be able to feed the poor, just give us some more money and you'll see!*"
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't you see a pattern here? It always involves us giving something up while being promised something that always turns out to be false.

       Just give us a war and we'll solve the drug problem.

       So, here we have a large portion of society stuck in their lower caste who live in areas prone to regular flooding.
I totally agree that we should be helping that element of society and prevent that situation from even existing. I really wish that, and would greatly support this over anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       But until such a thing can be achieved... we should deny them the ability to obtain higher yields of their staple food, which is normally hindered by flooding? Using sound, reliable, and in this particular case safe science?

       I one hundred percent agree... we need to stop exploiting people. I can't stress enough how much I agree with that. But at the same time... they're gonna be facing this problem regardless until that happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, but GMOs modifying metabolism or altering stress response is generally safer than those that add new nutritional content, add pesticide, or herbicide resistance. I don't know how best to explain this, but for the most part you're not adding "potentially toxic" molecules used to kill insects or plants. That's a big factor, and you're only really using what already exists within the plant. But... I could just as easily be proven wrong regarding the safety aspect.

       Are you completely ignorant of the fact that if we do that human race would have to "fuck around with nature" much more? GMO means much less use of pesticides and other dangerous chemicals, and much less resources spent on growing crops. The problems with them are due to the greed of the corporations and laws supporting them, not with the technology itself.

       Well, what you're saying is straight from a pamphlet Monsanto would distribute, the reality is almost completely the opposite. Roundup ready crops for instance lead to more chemical use.

       Chemicals cost money. If GMO lead to an increase in chemicals usage (per kg of final product), it would be unable to compete with non-GMO crops and thus there would be no need for any of the "anti-GMO" debates.

       Before I left FB, I had a friend whose favorite troll was GMOs. He'd bait and switch anyone who would be inclined against Monsanto. It got really bad. So much so I had to nuke his FB friendship. I'm all for free speech, but he is the shining example in my mind, of people who have been absorbed into the mothercorp zeitgeist and now the fucking kool-aid's on a pump. It's funny, he was a man of the people when he was poor living amongst the aboriginal Taiwanese, but he made a few bucks a couple years back and now he's happier than ever and thinks nothing of shilling for free. I don't get it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing that makes me so worried about GMOs is the thing that worries me about the
       <em>
        idea
       </em>
       of forced vaccinations or mass-surveillance: vax proponents and GMO-proponents seem incapable of 1) distrusting anything as long as they're reassured by Big Anything and 2) they seem fundamentally incapable of wrapping their heads around what a fucking vector is. While everything may be hunky-dory today or yesterday, these things represent a simple vector for abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is that simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you've ever been abused, robbed, assaulted, manipulated, coerced, guilt-ed etc... if you've ever been these things, you likely have the neuron pathways developed to understand intrinsically what I'm describing. The problem is maybe this: the parents who were the social-model parents and provided their special snowflakes all the emotional latitude to blossom and discover, I think these kids grow up to be little national broadcaster adherents and avid spouters of the warm-fuzzy doctrines they've been successfully programmed with.
      </p>
      <p>
       This describes my friend. His university educated academic parents account for much of his ivory-tower-scented opinion on the subject. He absolutely will not cop to the odiousness of installing simple vector architectures into the world globally and the possibility of abuse or disaster. He will not cop to the very idea that someone always stands to profit from these ideas and that to consolidate such power over so many people is one of the worst ideas ever, especially without acknowledging the motivations for companies and the elite to manipulate and control something as utterly fundamental as a food supply as being purely profit.

       Hybrids can happen all the time in nature.  Fish DNA or crystallized bacteria proteins would never find their way into the genome of a plant (there is only one example of bacteria transferring DNA to plants and it results in a disease that kills the plant).  So the argument that some GMOs are unnatural still stands, this doesn't mean they are inherently wrong, though.

       There is a clique of people, mostly it appears upper working class or middle class who, without any real knowledge, like to unquestionably bandwagon themselves into what they believe is the more scientifically favorable opinion - they base it totally upon, again what they conceive to be, argument from authority i.e other mainstream scientists or mainstream scientific opinion. Counter opinions are then instantaneously treated as conspiratorial and or, by association, uninformed and ignorant. This is a system of thought
       <br/>
       self patrolled by people who like to believe society operates, at a fundamental level to some degree of transparency and competency. When you inform yourself and listen to political commentators, take Noam Chomsky for example and then ultimately realize that society doesn't work in any way that's transparent or competent, unless you're fortunate enough to be in the 1% - your opinion is met by the wall - the formidable oppressive voice of the collective uninspired and terrified norm - people who would rather die than actually think, as Bertrand Russel puts it.
       <br/>
       The ugly thing is that the wall is an apparatus used to divide and conquer. People on either side of it tend to hate one another as if they were both directly each others enemy. The only enemy is our fear and ignorance - if we could conquer those issues we could conquer our masters, who play this game for themselves and we could create a better existence for the many and not just the few.

       I can agree with this principle though. I see this currently in UK politics... dividing everyone so that those who want what is best for everyone are marginalized. So frustrating seeing those with money buying influence and the ability to manipulate via the media, and facing little opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see the GM issue as this - we all need to find a middle ground based on science, evidence and long term studies. Jerking to either side isn't going to provide many benefits - anti- forgo all the positives, and the pro- forgo any negatives.

       Yes times a million, every single comment I make about GMO's gets like three replys supporting it. There's already been two post supporting it on the front page today. All they can possibly say is that "their studies showed no harmful effect," I'm sure Monsanto's test were a lot less biased than every single developed country that decided to ban it.

       because of this. If you ever speak out against GMOs you will have a barrage of down-votes thrown against you, almost never with counter-points to the argument you made. So much for being skeptics.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are not bad on their own, at least there is no study that accurately shows the GMed food is harmful. But they allow for heavier doses of herbicides to be applied as well as promoting vast monoculture farms that are just all-around terrible for the environment. I think the little good that might come from GMOs stays in the shadow of the very bad it creates.

       They've put themselves in this unique position to be able to accuse sceptics of hating science, an argument that those sceptics are usually on the other side of. The amount of shill accounts in any Monsanto thread is overwhelming.

       A simple solution would be to study some evolutionary biology, genetics and learn how to read scientific literature.

       The lack of education in the majority of people who ascribe to GMO conspiracy theories is what makes them so comical to people who have actually studied science (evolutionary biology, genetics, chemistry etc). Go find some corn, beef, tomatoes, potatoes, pork - the majority of food products that you have ever seen in your life have been genetically modified. We have been modifying food for millennia.

       You do understand the difference between picking the bigger tomatoes for their seeds and taking a chunk of bacteria DNA and splicing into your crop right? Especially, if your then spray tons of defoliant onto to your field because it will kill everything but your crop. Ohh it was suppose to lessen the amount of chemical? Turned out that it's the contrary, they use far more chemical now than they ever did. Ohh scientist want to study the possible effect of those new strands of crops (cause by the implementation of new genes). Fuck em, that proprietary knowledge. 
The funny part is that I'm not even against GMO on principal. I'm against the secrecy and the lack of transparency in industrial farming.

       That's because you don't fully understand what's going on. This is about nutritional content as well. GMO produce might feed more people, I guess, but theyre more malnourished. You dont even have to take my word for it, taste an organic tomato next to a GMO tomato. They want us half sick all of the time. Most people don't even remember what default is.

       Glyphosate is an herbicide, that specifically targets the shikimic acid pathway of plants, interrupting synthesis of aromatic amino acids. Gut flora would be unaffected. I'm not supporting drinking roundup, just randomly pointing it out that the isolated compound itself can't hurt you.

       No, it is a plant specific pathway. I think you may be confusing herbicide with Bt, which is an insecticide.

       Take a drop of water over the course of a year and drip it into a water bottle. Pretty soon, you will have a noticeable amount. After a year, you will have a significant amount of water. Think about all the vegetables or processed foods that contain toxins and visualize the water bottle filling up. It makes a damn difference. And no one in their right mind would drink weed killer. No one in their right mind should want their food doused in poison.

       Is it your contention that the poop is sprayed on the foliage of edible plants? The USDA gives us a 120 day guideline from application of manure to harvest of the crop. With few exceptions, a food crop season is &lt;120 days. If fresh manure is applied, 60 days are to pass before seeds are planted. No sidedressing or slurry application of manure. Well aged and composted manure can be sidedressed.

       My contention... Is that if you're concerned over the use of weed killer, round up or other chemicals being used on your foods, you should similarly be concerned about the poop in your life (Not just food, but in water, pets mouths etc.)
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       To address your points, you mention the USDA recommendations in regards to manure.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are the USDA recommendations in regards to roundup / weed killer / whatever else may be of concern? If the USDA has found roundup to be relatively harmless, then what evidence do you have for the contrary?
      </p>
      <p>
       (Edit: If you're going to go with the USDA recommendations for manure, i'd expect you to go with their recommendations for other farming recommendations)

       Bro, do you know what foliar feeding is? Plants take nutrients in through their roots but much faster through their leaves/flowers. This roundup shit is seeping into the plant well past the surface. You cant just wash it off.

       Hmmm, so the natural fertilizer in soil, the purpose of which is to provide key nutrients to plant growth is somehow comparable to man made poison that's designed to kill things that come near the plant.

       Assuming I eats weeds, yeah that be a problem. Seeing that I don't, and it's a weed killer. Which, logically would mean it would have some sort of poison in it, that's fine. The ignorance is strong here.

       So it might be a carcinogen. Which as of right now, no studies have been conclusive. Think of it this way, cigs are cancerous, we know that. But people look at as risk versus reward. Get rid of your stress in exchange for less time alive. Even though you smoke cigs, that does not mean you will get cancer. I'd rather have insect resistant chemical sprayed on our food supply to ensure our crops do not go to waste in exchange for the chance it might give me cancer and shorten my life a few years. That being said, I do think GM foods should be labeled as I believe people should know what they are putting in their body and should make their own choice which way to go.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could say the same thing about cars, we know there are countless deaths every year caused by cars. Should we outlaw them? No, because that would make life way harder. Risk versus reward is what it comes down too.

       People aren't swallowing embalming fluid when they eat food they expect to be normal. To compare smoking a cigarette or to say everything in this world causes cancer is ridiculous, because everything didn't cause cancer at one point. Cancer is the method our government is using to pull us into hospitals for millions upon millions of dollars every day. Not only can they profit off of this, but they also eliminate a life, which is another one of their non-stated goals. 1/5 people will get cancer in their lifetime. It was not this way in the past, therefore, like autism, they're ushering in the effects in without us knowing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the whole cars thing, apples and oranges. You cannot compare someone wanting a label on someting or not wanting a carcinogen to be sprayed on their food to someone with a phobia of driving. Driving is almost unavoidable in this day and age. We don't want all of our food to be produced to contain chemicals that are carcinogenic, and we want to know the ones that are.

       It isn't that gm is inherently bad; we've been doing that for millenia in a lower tech way. It's what these corporations like Monsanto are doing with it that's the problem. They want to force you to buy their seeds every season that only grow if you also buy their fertilizer and their pesticides. And we let them because "seedless fruit that stays fresh for a month!"

       Trying to corner the market isn't subverting capitalism. Every business wants as much market share as possible. Saying these corporations are in it for the money is not a defense of what they're trying to do in any way. Yes, they're in it for the money. Yes, many people will buy their products because they don't look at the bigger picture.

       My problem is GMO is such a broad term it is meaningless.  When someone says GMOs are bad, I know they are just babbling talking points and not performing critical thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just changing a plants genes is not inherently bad.  It is the actually changes made that could be bad.  Or it could be that the roundup weed killer is bad and not the plant itself.

       Your conspiracy is predicated on the prejudice that everyone who is in favor of GMOs are idiots. That's awfully presumptuous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, if you think that such a large number of people can be convinced to wrongly be in favor of GMO crops, why can't a large number of people be wrong against GMO crops. It's not like there aren't relatively powerful groups in favor of stifling positive scientific developments for beliefs that don't have a relationship with reality. Vaccination, climate change deniers, so on...

       Most anti-GMO pushes are as scientific as the anti-vaccine movement. So I'm sure it will gain a lot of traction here with the standard argument of this subreddit "money therefore evil" and a few quickly googled lines from scientific papers that failed peer review and are taken out of context.

       Uhm well there are a few things you should understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Monsanto doesn't make ALL GMOs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main reason we tie the two together is from their damn corn that makes round up in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not all GMOs are bad. Modifying plants is normal. Even if humans didn't interfere there would be cases where cross breeding occurs and changes in plants from their original types.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apart from this I do agree that we the consumer should be informed on the produce its self or somewhere on the stand that contains the product.

       Here's the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Reddit was originally a site for computer programmers, scientists, and other well-educated people to congregate.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Even today many people on reddit hold advanced degrees in STEM and work in STEM fields.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) As STEM fields teach students the scientific method, how to do basic scientific research, advanced critical thinking and reasoning skills, and how to spot faulty science, many tend to be more educated on GMOs and are able to separate fact from fiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) People who disagree with GMOs insist on some broad shilling conspiracy because redditors approve of the technology, when the real problem is people on this site are just too educated to fall for common anti-GMO tricks, especially given the overlap between anti-GMO advocates and "natural health" advocates.

       Splicing foreign DNA into plant genes is relatively new, yet we are replacing an extremely large portion of human food with product made this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       To assume "all the science is in," is to assume "humans know everything about this." Yet we don't even fully understand why we sleep or why we cry.

       We can't accurately measure intelligence, so how can we know for sure that this way of creating food isn't harmful?

       This is such utter bullshit.  There is no way in hell you can say that all people who are pro-GMO are better educated and in STEM fields, you have absolutely no way of proving that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every single day pro-GMO people toss around far more idiocy and misinformation:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Norman Borlaug invented GMOs!" -WRONG
       <br/>
       "plants have been genetically engineered forever!" -BULLSHIT
       <br/>
       "Glyphosate is non-toxic!" IT'S TOXIC
       <br/>
       "We'd all starve if there was no GMOs" Because we were on the verge of extinction 20 years ago when there were essentially no GMOs?
       <br/>
       "We need golden rice so everyone in Indonesia doesn't go blind from vitamin A deficiency!"  The same Indonesia that is the world's 4th leading producer of sweet potatoes? which are far higher in vitamin A than golden rice? OK.
      </p>
      <p>
       People you consider anti-GMO generally aren't against genetic technology.  They are against Biotech's blatantly evil agenda.

       You are probably the worst poster on reddit and I hope you leave immediately.

       It's good to pay attention and question all sides in depth, but not without proof. There's no proof that they would be doing this, aka no agenda. If there were an agenda behind this specific phrase, then I would question it as well. The GMO agenda is backed by massive amounts of money on both sides, but please realize where the most money is and how it's being spent. Monsanto has spent billions to cover up their crimes against humanity, as well as flush out any legislation in any given state that is anti GMO.

       GMO are technically safe enough for human consumption what I don't like is how mosanto patent the seeds so the plant is theirs and as long as you have a mosanto designed GMO plant you have to pay tributes to mosanto yearly.

       Yes, but there are also a bunch of smart idiots on reddit that see nothing wrong with GMOs, myself included.  I'm not surprised that r/farming is generally in support...  After all, things like Roundup-ready seed make their lives a lot easier and drive up yields which allow them to make more money than they would otherwise.  No need for a conspiracy here...

       I promote GMOs for free because the facts are available to anyone - not because Monsanto pays me.  The research and information done by independent oganizations that shows GMOS are safe and beneficial is out there.  You gotta stop reading "Natural News" and read articles by the WHO.  Read articles by Steven Novella instead of Joseph Mercola or that scary psycopath Mike Adams.
      </p>

       Information and the truth want to be free.  I am sure in my lifetime that the anti-GMO anti-science lobby, along with anti-science believers like anti-vaxxers, and climate change deniers, will eventually be seen as the overly emotional science haters they are, and they will be ridiculed into silence like the flat-earthers and those who think the moon landing was faked.

       I am sure you would have ridiculed people who were skeptical of thalidomide. Or told soldiers wary of agent orange to stfu. Some of us distrust things because we believe all the data is not in yet. Monsanto has actively suppressed studies and research - similar to what the tobacco companies used to do. So forgive me if I am not going to assume that we have all the relevant data.

       This deserves a reply because it's true. Science is always changing - that's what keeps it relevant. Sometimes scientists get it wrong, or rather, sometimes the wrong scientists are louder or better funded than the right ones and the actual truth takes a while to filter out. Life goes on. Being anti-GMO is not anti-science, it's pro-science because it involves actual understanding of the precautionary principle and what it entails.

And also normal people who have seen the way Monsanto operates and would rather not support them as a company.  I understand completely why Monsanto is against labeling, there's no doubt their business would be damaged, but that's exactly as it should be.

       I'll be honest, nearly every complaint I've heard about them has either been distorted, exaggerated or simply made up entirely. Either way, regulated labelling rules shouldn't be bent or ignored because it suits the politics of a few individuals.

       I don't care what their "stated intention" is.  Because the end result is that I, the consumer (and the rest of the public), are being educated as to what's in the products we're buying, as is our right.  It's a very simple concept.

      <p>
       They're designed to label the foods.  Now the reasons these groups want the labels may be different from mine, but it isn't like they're putting "GMO" with a skull and crossbones or a surgeon general's warning.  If that were the case you might have an argument and I'd agree with you, unless of course it were proven with relative certainty that labels like that were accurate.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        And the non-GMO label is identical in that regard to every other lifestyle label. It is designed to appeal to those specifically looking for that thing, in the same way that the organic, vegetarian, kosher, halal etc labels are designed to appeal to only that specific group, rather than the public at large.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If it were the same thing, why are there no "non-organic", "non-kosher", "non-vegetarian", "non-halal" labels?  Do you not see the obvious difference there?  One is a lable, one is a non-label.  You're essentially saying that GMOs are labeled because
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       non-GMOs are labeled, which is just nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       If every single non-GMO food was labeled then you would maybe have a point, but that isn't the case.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We don't do that because all lifestyle labels (GMO included) are voluntary and are designed to appeal only to those specific interested folks to look for.

      <p>
       How is GMO voluntary when it
       <em>
        isn't labeled
       </em>
       ?  It's in nearly all of our food (in the US) and we don't even know it's there, it's being deliberately hidden from the labels.  Maybe your definition of "voluntary" is different from mine.  I don't remember asking for GMO to be put into the entire food supply or voting for it - do you?
