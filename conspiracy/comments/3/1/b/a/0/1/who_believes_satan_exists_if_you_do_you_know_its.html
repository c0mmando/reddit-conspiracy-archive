    <div class="md"><p>I do not believe in your God, nor do i believe in your Satan.</p>

<p>However, i tend to believe that this Satan and this God were, at some point, real flesh and blood sentient beings. </p>

<p>As the ancient Sumerians have much of the same accounts as was cannonized into the bible, i believe they were closer to a more accurate description of events. Meaning, Enlil was the ruler of Earth at the time. His brother, Enki, was second in command. When Enki was charged with creating the Adamu (humans), he ended up loving his creations so much, that he taught them certain skills (the tree of knowledge). However, under the decree of Enlil, whem creating the Adamu, Enki had to keep their lifespan short, (tree of life). This meant that humans procreated at a much faster rate, growing in numbers very quickly.</p>

<p>Enlil didnt like this, as he feared that with enough numbers, humans could rise up in a mutiny against his rule. Thus, he forbade Enki from teaching the humans anything aside from what they were created for. </p>

<p>But Enki did anyways, which enraged Enlil. A war ensued between the brothers, wherein Enlil was the victor.</p>

<p>&quot;History is written by the victor,&quot; as they say. Keeping this in mind, Enki&#39;s symbol was the serpent. Your Satan&#39;s symbol is also the serpent. However, as i said, &quot;history is written by the victor&quot;, i tend to believe that Enki, having lost the war, enured having his name slandered for enternity. Him and his followers were cast out and banished. </p>

<p>Enkis story almost perfectly parallels your Satans story. As i believe everything is about perspective, i camt help but to wonder whether Enki/Satan was actually the &quot;good guy&quot;, but lost, making Enlil/God Ruler of All, and allowing the latter to dictate what will be remembered in the future (now). But more probable, imo, is that they both meant the best, but differed in their visions, causing the war which left one looking like the bad guy, amd the other as the good guy.</p>

<p>I believe all wars are fought by good men. It all depends on perspective. One side&#39;s &quot;bad guys&quot; are the other side&#39;s &quot;good guys&quot;. Keeping the facade of good versus evil is a fantastic way of keeping a population divided in perpetuity. Bit alas, nothing is ever so black/white. Life is greyscale.</p>

<p>Thats fine and well if it works for you. But it doesnt work for me. We, as intelligent creatures, were endowed, either by design or through natural systems, with the ability to perceive what is good and what is not. To blindly follow decrees and regulations written by Man and interpreted by Man is to give all of oneself to anothers bidding. This is a dangerous habit, as if the other has malicious intententions, we would be none the wiser. Thus, i pledge allegience to no being, celestrial or otherwise. Therefore, i am free to use my own will, which includes harboring the ability to judge others as i deem fit. This is the essence of free will, and individuality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. But the directives are different. One tells a story. It does not dictate lifestyles. The other has commandments and rules and directions as to how one is to live. </p>

<p>The purpose of a story is to pass along information, whether true or false.</p>

<p>The purpose of the bible is to illustrate how its believers are expected to live. </p>

<p>The former offers a plot. The latter dictates. From my life experiences, most of the time, when something or someone attempts to control the minutia of everyday life, they have ill intentions. </p>

<p>Tryanny takes many forms. Unfortunately, my beliefs contend that your beliefs follow one of those forms. But as i said, if it works for you, then fine and well. </p>

<p>First and foremost, that you must believe in him in order to get into heaven. Then there is &quot;turning the cheek&quot;. And of course the Ten <em>Commandments</em>. Then there are the prohibition rules: no homosexuality, premarital sex, worshipping any other thing or being... Christianity is no exemption from tyrannical ideologies. All abrahamic religions, for that matter, fall into this category (in my opinion and according to my beliefs).</p>

<p>There is none. Anything that claims to be is merely an interpretation. There is no concrete evidence of God&#39;s existence. If you can offer any evidence that purely and explicitly proves there is a God, i would eat my words.</p>

<p>With that said, i also follow the philosophy of &quot;absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.&quot; Thus, God cannot be completely ruled out, either.</p>

<p>Its easiest to label myself as an atheist, but really im an agnostic atheist (i.e. i believe that we do not and can not know for sure, thus i <em>choose</em> to believe there is none).</p>

<p>If there is a God, however, it is not at all the same thing described in any holy book. This knee will remain rigid, and this head will remain upright.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now, as I said concerning faith—that it was not a perfect knowledge—even so it is with my words. Ye cannot know of their surety at first, unto perfection, any more than faith is a perfect knowledge.
But behold, if ye will awake and arouse your faculties, even to an experiment upon my words, and exercise a particle of faith, yea, even if ye can no more than desire to believe, let this desire work in you, even until ye believe in a manner that ye can give place for a
 portion of my words.
Now, we will compare the word unto a seed. Now, if ye give place, that a seed may be planted in your heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves—It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me.
Now behold, would not this increase your faith? I say unto you, Yea; nevertheless it hath not grown up to a perfect knowledge.
But behold, as the seed swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow, then you must needs say that the seed is good; for behold it swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow. And now, behold, will not this strengthen your faith? Yea, it will strengthen your faith: for ye will say I know that this is a good seed; for behold it sprouteth and beginneth to grow.
And now, behold, are ye sure that this is a good seed? I say unto you, Yea; for every seed bringeth forth unto its own likeness.
Therefore, if a seed groweth it is good, but if it groweth not, behold it is not good, therefore it is cast away. And now, behold, because ye have tried the experiment, and planted the seed, and it swelleth and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow, ye must needs know that the seed is good.
And now, behold, is your knowledge perfect? Yea, your knowledge is perfect in that thing, and your faith is dormant; and this because you know, for ye know that the word hath swelled your souls, and ye also know that it hath sprouted up, that your understanding doth begin to be enlightened, and your mind doth begin to expand.
O then, is not this real? I say unto you, Yea, because it is light; and whatsoever is light, is good, because it is discernible, therefore ye must know that it is good; and now behold, after ye have tasted this light is your knowledge perfect?
Behold I say unto you, Nay; neither must ye lay aside your faith, for ye have only exercised your faith to plant the seed that ye might try the experiment to know if the seed was good.
And behold, as the tree beginneth to grow, ye will say: Let us nourish it with great care, that it may get root, that it may grow up, and bring forth fruit unto us. And now behold, if ye nourish it with much care it will get root, and grow up, and bring forth fruit.
But if ye neglect the tree, and take no thought for its nourishment, behold it will not get any root; and when the heat of the sun cometh and scorcheth it, because it hath no root it withers away, and ye pluck it up and cast it out.
Now, this is not because the seed was not good, neither is it because the fruit thereof would not be desirable; but it is because your ground is barren, and ye will not nourish the tree, therefore ye cannot have the fruit thereof.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Agreed, however, i think both sides abuse the powerless, and both sides claim to be light-bearing. At least currently. Everything we see today, in terms of human tendencies in this modern world, is all due to interpretations of other mens words. Thus, any side to be chosen will inevitably carry the mark of human folly. It is in our nature. The only thing we tend to not fuck up is true love. But true love is rare, as most pursue lust instead (not strictly in the sexual meanings).</p>

<p>Which always brings us back to finding our purpose, coming up short with any real meaning. This leaves us vulnerable to those who claim they have an answer, and we come full circle back into religious ideologies. These ideologies typically have certain things in common, which always puts some entity above themselves. This harbors servitude masquerading as altruism, furthering the divide between us and true love. </p>

<p>Whichever side you choose, you will always end up within the same vortex. This is why i reject that which Man tries to instill within me. No other&#39;s interpretation can substitute for my own, when it comes to who i am, and to who i perceive others to be, and to what purpose we have that we may summon to volition. </p>

<p>But of course, i am me, and these words are mine, and their meaning is only indicative to what i currently believe; all of this is open and vulnerable to change. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know that Enki is or was so terrible, and as an Oilcan Harry fan, I&#39;m inclined to be empathetic, but those who do deeds in its name are pretty shitty. So much evil perpetrated on a daily; see also: secret societies. If you live in a town, talk to people. Epstein, Savile, Franklin, MO - these are just tertiary stories that percolate up to our surface, the bottom is bigger, more populated, darker -- that shit -- Sorry, I can&#39;t be on any &quot;side&quot; that abides/encourages/<em>is</em> that kind of evil.</p>

<p>Offhand, I read &quot;what purpose we have that we may summon to volition&quot; as &quot;what purpose we have that we may summon to Voltron&quot; - which, honestly, not to be a communist, kind of rocks. :)</p>

They are going after the atheists first just to make them more Godlike. God won&#39;t step in for them either of course. That&#39;s when things start taking shape.
