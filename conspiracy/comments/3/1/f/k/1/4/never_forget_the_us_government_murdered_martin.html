    <div class="md"><p>...and our current president quoted MLK on his way to getting elected, dedicated a statue to MLK once he was elected and, most recently, made a trip to Selma (in part) to celebrate the life of MLK--but forgets to call for the release of the FBI records.</p>

<p>Hollow, disingenuous words followed by disingenuous actions...</p>

<p>NEVER FORGET:  MLK would be abhorred by the 1,000+ drone strikes Obama has allowed and the continuation of the excessive military spending the U.S.A. is pumping into WAR, INC.</p>

<p>NEVER FORGET:  the speech that got MLK killed was his <a href="http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/documentsentry/doc_beyond_vietnam/">&quot;Beyond Vietnam&quot;</a> speech which he made exactly one year before he was assassinated by elements of our own government.</p>

<p>NEVER FORGET: that the reason we do NOT have a full video of MLK&#39;s speech is because the media left after they got some news footage and STOPPED recording--they LEFT the event in the middle of the speech.  Luckily, we do have the audio recording and MLK&#39;s full, written speech.</p>

<p>JFK, RFK, and MLK changed the world in the short time we had them.  What would the world look like now if they weren&#39;t stolen from us by those murdering POS who still havent been charged.</p>

<p><a href="http://s020.radikal.ru/i705/1304/f6/ea72703c8ebd.jpg">Martin Luther &amp; Coretta King and black Secret Serviceman Abraham Bolden,</a> were with shooters on the Grassy Knoll Dallas Texas, November 22, 1963, at the assassination of President Kennedy, whose beautiful wife had invited the LK&#39;s into her home at the White House just weeks before. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><a href="http://s017.radikal.ru/i443/1209/2a/7ef8a1a9c02b.jpg">At plus eighteen hrs</a> around 9:30 pm on the evening of November 23, 1963, Australian radio played a tape recording of the assassination..</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wherein Mrs Kennedy&#39;s voice was clearly heard calling &quot;hello Coretta&quot; followed by a volley of gunfire, the presenter explained Coretta was the wife of one Reverend Martin Luther King.</p>

<p>He played a slowed down version of the tape, and asked listeners how many shots they could hear, he said he counted about nineteen, his studio guest said she counted twenty two.</p>

<p>That was the only time the Luther Kings were associated with the crime, until whispers were heard at the time of the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.</p>

<p>Where after some short time later Luther King was shot dead by sniper fire, while standing talking on the telephone on a hotel balcony in Memphis.</p>

<p>Although he was feted and fabulized by the same Jew press refused the evidence located him with the shooters, that propounded the Lee Harvey Oswald / lone assassin scenario, there was no money, the black ---- was broke.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>He went to the source had roped him into the conspiracy in the first place, read George HW Bush, and asked for dough to be told there was none.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>So he attempted blackmail, presumably assuring GHWB if he was not paid everyone would get to hear about what went on in Dallas, he laughed him off.</p>

<p>So Luther King took time out at the 1968 DNC to drop the bombshell of his own involvement, and was shot down for it! <a href="http://www.dockersunion.net/vb/showthread.php?680-The-Assassination-of-John-F-Kennedy-Expanded&amp;amp;p=1826#post1826">The Assassination of John F Kennedy</a> Edit.</p>
