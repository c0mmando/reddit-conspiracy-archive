       What I am concerned with are the foot soldiers and pawns that are working for this system, and who are essentially the working hands of this beast; whether enforcing martial law, or deterring chaotic bedlam from "domestic terrorists."
      </p>
      <p>
       I come from a vastly rural region of the U.S. where a majority of the high school kids that graduate and join the military are your average slacker "muh 'murica" hicks whose only reason for joining the military is because it was pitched by the recruiter as a better alternative to working at the local foundry or their uncle's dairy farm. They plan to serve their 4 years and then go to technical or trade school, and that be it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the event of a revolution, or some form of large-scale uprising against TPTB, or an exercise of martial law, would there exist the mental infrastructure, capacity, and will to follow orders and attack American citizens, trumping values and morals to commit such acts? I am now not solely including the demographic I sampled, but other Americans serving as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wouldn't there come a juncture where one, despite the reprogramming of their brain or embrace of propaganda, stop and realize that what they were doing was in severely unaligned with their core humanity?
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not come from a military family, as it is probably obvious, so this may sound quixotically naive. I may be missing a critical point in my inquiry, but this is a thought that has come to me from time to time, and I am trying to gauge what would happen in such a situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for reading, and the discussion!

       Definitely. I had a friend who was in the military for many years (somewhat recently, past 10) and...man, I don't even fucking know. He was brainwashed. I knew him in highschool, before he joined, he got injured and discharged and we started being friends again, but he was different.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the room was quiet, he would talk about being in the military, how great what they are doing in the Middle East is, and other general pro-American military discussion. It got to a disgusting level, where he told me that Palestinian's deserved to be massacred because "they are hiding terrorists" and Israel shouldn't just protect itself, but actively wipe out anything that threatens it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shit like that makes me fucking scared.

       Saturate the media portraying them as terrorists who indiscriminately bomb civilians (government projection), women and children included, and the majority of the population will turn against them, some instantly with the majority of others along with them over time, given enough propaganda and conditioning. All it will take is one false flag, or better yet multiple false flags over time, and round the clock news coverage of the incident to sway public opinion one way or the other. It's just too damn easy for those in power to control the masses in such a manner, that is when they are willing to play dirty. Just look at Operation Gladio for historical precedent.

       Compartmentalization. Every one has a job to do, all of it works in tandem, and everyone does their part without knowing the greater extent which hinges on their active participation.

       I'm speaking purely as a former soldier who has asked himself the same question.
      </p>
      <p>
       What would I have done, if ordered to attack Americans? I would have resisted. Not saying that I would have shot my commander (who, likely would have also been against it) but that I would not have participated in attacking citizens. Maybe that gets me in trouble? I would have been alright with that, and I believe my fellow soldiers would have as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       It comes down to making the choice to attack my family, and I wouldn't.

       There will still be some who follow orders.  If enough soldiers desert, the few left will think they can gain more power and prestige if they stay (and win), and they will gladly play the game of power, and fire on people they've never met.

       There are certainly those who would be more than happy to do just that, after being bombarded with propaganda conditioning them to believe that these are not their fellow countrymen but rather domestic terrorists no better than those in the Middle East who are actively trying to kill them and their families, even moreso with law enforcement eager to open fire on civilians no questions asked.

       Then you have the option of introducing foreign troops, with no remorse for the local populace, and if all else fails you'll have MJTF hired thugs to do their dirty work.

       As OP, I also come from a very rural region of the US. Tons of family and close friends are current or former combat soldiers. I am not though, but based on what I can tell most infantry men are freedom loving, second amendment, keep the government out of my business types, but then so are most people in my neck of the woods, so maybe that's it. What say you?

       I saw a meme a while back that said something along the lines of "99% of the world doesn't care about the rest, and just want to live in peace. The other 1% tell us that others want to kill us". I wish I had the original, it was better said.

       But yeah, keeping the government out of my business is one of my favorite reasons for living in Washington State (I can be gay and smoke pot if I want).

       This is exactly why an overt declaration of war against the people by "TPTB" wouldn't work. People don't realize that the military (and government) is made up of people. Add to that the constant message of "Just one person can bring an end to the Evil Empire" from Hollywood, and reality comes more into focus.

       It will work once they have a robot army....which they're currently working towards.  Between foot soldier style drones and aerial drones they'd be able to pretty easily gain complete control.

       I love the theme of the Terminator style movies because they always portray humanity as having a fighting chance even though the reality would be quite different.

       Luckily, they're probably 15-20 years out from having the ability to use those types of tools on a regional/global basis.

       There is way too many militias and people with guns that would put a a really good fight in the event of martial law. At the very least 20-50-70-80-150 million people will fight against the military if they try to take guns or enforce martial law. Unless we are nuked. There's a good chance the population would go with it if the false flag was big enough.
