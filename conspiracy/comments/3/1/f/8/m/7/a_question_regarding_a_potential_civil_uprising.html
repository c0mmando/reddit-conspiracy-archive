        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>What I am concerned with are the foot soldiers and pawns that are working for this system, and who are essentially the working hands of this beast; whether enforcing martial law, or deterring chaotic bedlam from &quot;domestic terrorists.&quot;</p>

<p>I come from a vastly rural region of the U.S. where a majority of the high school kids that graduate and join the military are your average slacker &quot;muh &#39;murica&quot; hicks whose only reason for joining the military is because it was pitched by the recruiter as a better alternative to working at the local foundry or their uncle&#39;s dairy farm. They plan to serve their 4 years and then go to technical or trade school, and that be it.</p>

<p>In the event of a revolution, or some form of large-scale uprising against TPTB, or an exercise of martial law, would there exist the mental infrastructure, capacity, and will to follow orders and attack American citizens, trumping values and morals to commit such acts? I am now not solely including the demographic I sampled, but other Americans serving as well.</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t there come a juncture where one, despite the reprogramming of their brain or embrace of propaganda, stop and realize that what they were doing was in severely unaligned with their core humanity?</p>

<p>I do not come from a military family, as it is probably obvious, so this may sound quixotically naive. I may be missing a critical point in my inquiry, but this is a thought that has come to me from time to time, and I am trying to gauge what would happen in such a situation.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, and the discussion!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely. I had a friend who was in the military for many years (somewhat recently, past 10) and...man, I don&#39;t even fucking know. He was brainwashed. I knew him in highschool, before he joined, he got injured and discharged and we started being friends again, but he was different.</p>

<p>If the room was quiet, he would talk about being in the military, how great what they are doing in the Middle East is, and other general pro-American military discussion. It got to a disgusting level, where he told me that Palestinian&#39;s deserved to be massacred because &quot;they are hiding terrorists&quot; and Israel shouldn&#39;t just protect itself, but actively wipe out anything that threatens it.</p>

<p>Shit like that makes me fucking scared. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Saturate the media portraying them as terrorists who indiscriminately bomb civilians (government projection), women and children included, and the majority of the population will turn against them, some instantly with the majority of others along with them over time, given enough propaganda and conditioning. All it will take is one false flag, or better yet multiple false flags over time, and round the clock news coverage of the incident to sway public opinion one way or the other. It&#39;s just too damn easy for those in power to control the masses in such a manner, that is when they are willing to play dirty. Just look at Operation Gladio for historical precedent.</p>

<p>What would I have done, if ordered to attack Americans? I would have resisted.

I would have been alright with that, and I believe my fellow soldiers would have as well.</p>
