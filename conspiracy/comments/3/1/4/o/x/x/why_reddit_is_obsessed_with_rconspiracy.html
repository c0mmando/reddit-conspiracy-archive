       295K users. Plus subs like /conspiritard, /topmindsofreddit, devoted to obsessing over everything we do. Today
       <a href="http://np.www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/#newlink">
        some other subs
       </a>
       even did a nice imitation of us?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/30xt2a/lets_play_guess_the_top_mind_take_away_jewish/">
        Some users
       </a>
       have even become celebrities in their own right. The MO seems to be Cherry picking a few strawman posts about Joos or 9/11 then circle jerking over their own intellectual superiority in such matters. Meanwhile they neglect to mention or perhaps notice that within this sub there is a dearth of group think. Generally once someone starts talking about metaphysics or aliens or satanism they get shouted down.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no consensus here other than the basic premise of being a place to ask questions and share information. And the questions raised or information shared is by no means orthodoxy. It's open to speculation, deconstruction and even dismissal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get the idea of poking sticks into a cage full of anonymous users you think you're smarter than. I did it when I was younger, hell I still fuck with users here when they start talking about the flat earth society or hologram planes. But what gets me is this idea of devoting time and effort to it. Seeking it out, devising a sub for it subscribing, coming up with nicknames. It's bizarre. Why even bother if you find our beliefs so distasteful? But it all makes sense if you deconstruct where they are (here), what they're doing (spending all day reading about conspiracies) and thus what must be their underlying motivations for it...
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it. The meta is:
       <em>
        these people are as familiar with the conspiracy theories discussed here as we are.
       </em>
       The difference is that they front like their interest is out of contempt and not curiosity. They're really repressed.  We've all seen behavior like this before. At it's best it reminds me of people who say they have 'guilty pleasures' and enjoy bad pop music or tranformers movies 'ironically'. At worst they're like those republican homophobes who get caught with a mountain of gay porn.
      </p>
      <p>
       They front like they
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       they're shit but they can "appreciate them with a smug sense of superiority afforded by the veil of detached irony.' That's bollocks mate. You don't listen to Macklemore because it sucks. You listen to it
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       you
       <em>
        like it.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Really
       <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/how-to-live-without-irony/">
        this article
       </a>
       really nails it. The vibe I get off of these subs devoted to worshiping everything we say and do isn't that they actually feel superior to us. It's that somewhere inside of them they get it and want in on it. They're too repressed to accept it in a way that they feel comfortable expressing outside the realm of mocking indignation.
      </p>
      <p>
       When viewed from this angle their behavior makes sense. They refer to us as "Top Minds" for christs sake. They have rules based around not making fun of us. It's shockingly transparent. They have a crush!
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        EDIT
       </strong>
       TL;DR metaphor:
Imagine I joined a sub named
       <a href="/r/topdirectioners">
        /r/topdirectioners
       </a>
       devoted to obsessing over the minutia of posts made in
       <a href="/r/onedirection">
        /r/onedirection
       </a>
       . I spent all day watching One Direction vids, listening to their music and reading threads made about them. Only to report back to my friends in
       <a href="/r/topdirectioners">
        /r/topdirectioners
       </a>
       at the end of the day about how 'pathetic and obsessive' their users were.
      </p>
      <p>
       At some point wouldn't you be like "hey man... you sure spend a lot of time in a forum dedicated to One Direction, listening to their music and watching their videos for a guy who says he doesn't like one Direction. If you like One Direction you can just say you like One Direction, it's O.K. They're pretty cool.'

       It's bizarre how people react to 'conspiracy theorists.'
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all, they assume we OBSESS over this information. As if looking into alternative news sources and events that were excluded from history textbooks immediately turns you into a paranoid schizophrenic. I've actually found just the opposite: learning how the world really operates has made me
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       sane. It's improved my understanding of human nature and helped me get clear on what I truly value in life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second is the erroneous belief that conspiracy theorists see  conspiracies
       <em>
        everywhere
       </em>
       . This is another attempt to paint us as crazy. For example, if you talk to someone about the US funding ISIS, they'll often respond with things like, "Uh huh. And Obama's a reptilian shape-shifter, right?" No, not right. People act like once you start deviating from the official line you'll end up searching for Atlantis and living in a bunker. This is fear based nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also the idea that individuals could never be smart enough to unravel how the world works. You need to go to school for that, or defer to the experts. This is learned helplessness and unfortunately means you're missing the point of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to get mad at people who hate on conspiracy theorists, but now I kind of feel bad for them/am slightly amused. When you start to comprehend the amount of information these people are missing out on, all you can do is shake your head. I mean most of the stuff we discuss here is publicly admitted and is absolutely essential for understanding your place in the world and how to best go about achieving happiness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately a lot of people never rise to the challenge. They live in a state of arrested development, looking for the government, their parents, and everyone else to take care of them. It's not really their fault; they were never taught how to think and were so stressed and busy from day one that conversations like ours just sounded like useless chatter.

       Peers from my HS used to hassle friends and I about the NSA "conspiracy theory"  of wiretapping cellphones and Facebook in 2009-10 — they would literally hunt us down to mock or laugh at us while we were minding our own business, even stalking us online... A few days ago my buddy contacted 2 of them about citizenfour winning the Oscar for best doc and their response was
       <em>
        literally
       </em>
       "Chemtrails"
      </p>
      <p>
       Never felt so bad for them, how psychologically warped do you have to be act in such a manner? Really disturbing how troubled these kinds of people are. It's almost like a mental disorder. Cognitive Dissonance mixed with hypnosis or some shit...
      </p>

       There is also the smug shit eating validation that comes from capitulating to concensus reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've known (past tense) people who talked massive amounts of shit about conspiracy theorists publically on their facebooks. Made fun of all the easy targets: Chemtrails, vaccines, 9/11, Alex Jones - you name it. Only to have them talk about a belief in a corporate controlled government, false flags, the rise of the military industrial complex, banksters... pretty much everything else in messenger convos.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a weird obsession with hating these big targets and then almost secretly believing in the more realistic stuff. Oh and if you ever tried to point out that their own BS was identical to Jones they'd go thermonuclear.

       There are some "truths" I can't stand behind because of the approach and voices behind them.
      </p>
      <p>
       One being vaccines,
       <em>
        yes
       </em>
       some ingredients are poison, I'd like to be able to opt out and I would not be surprised if an engineered epidemic occurred in the future — but you got people saying ALL INJECTIONS ARE BAD, don't put ANYTHING IN YOU! And there doesn't seem to be a middle ground or organization for me to support. So i avoid it
      </p>
      <p>
       Another one being chemtrails — I live in a  California county where it is PUBLICLY announced that cloud seeding and other weather modification is going to occur. The whole fucking sky gets sprayed and it ruins our gorgeous central coast weather. I just want to be able to have a say whether or not I want to breathe this in. But you got crazy fucks who spew the wrong terminology and evidence making the obvious proof look like a joke.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex Jones is a limited hangout.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can see why people are turned off by "conspiracy" because I personally do when it comes to certain topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: let me be clear:

       Agent Hicks had to acknowledge the information about his true identity in order to try to minimize its damage and put it behind him.  That would be a perfectly legitimate reason for him putting out that joke video about him actually being some British aristocrat.  That video is an obvious diversion, intended to use the same tactics used by government entities that he rails against on his show against those who would be so crass as to reveal his true identity to the world.

       I posted pics of the area i used to live....very remote and part of a military operating area.  Tons of "chemtrails" used to get sprayed there.  Always done early in the morning on cloudless days and within a few hours, nothing but haze.  I personally think they're testing ways of reversing global warming

       but what really pisses me off is that the amazing weather where I live (which is why rent is 2,000$/mo for a 1br apartment) is absolutely ruined. Clear 70-80F days turned into cloudy and humid.

       One guy just says that he's going to send it over to r/conspiritard where it belongs and another guy said I was a Truther and that it was a waste of time reading anything I wrote. The TL;DR of my post would be that if the people who worked at Groom Lake can keep secrets for 60 years then the ones that offed JFK could easily do the same.

       Ironically enough, that doco was destined for my "maybe watch it next week if I remember, and can find the time, but probably won't" pile. I think I can find time to watch it this week and see just what's got these guys so riled up. I think I have a fair idea of what it's about.

       Most people don't even realize some of the things they believe contradict one another. It's kind of amazing. I remember reading about

       It's just so ignorant and dismissive. They're the kind of people who would have been supportive of racial segregation because they follow the crowd, refusing to think for themselves. No matter how much evidence there is to support a theory they will just call "conspiracy theorists" (aka people who think objectively) crazy only until some mainstream source confirms what they refused to even consider. It's sad that some people not only refuse to do research to see that there are nefarious activities that go on covertly, but they taunt and laugh and try to make "us" (because obviously we all hold exactly the same beliefs like all world rulers are lizard people /s) look like crazy idiots. Ignorance is bliss, they must be euphoric!

       100% correct.  What we discuss here, or at least the basis for it, is much more mundane than it seems.  It's just a different narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take Iran, for example.  To most, Iran is "an evil country."  They are bad Muslims who want a nuke.  They hate Israel, and Israel is a good country who wants democracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you study it though, you learn that Iran used to be chill, but then there were CIA sponsored coups to trick them into giving us oil.  There was a brutal dictatorship, then a revolution.  Not a "oh joy, Arab Spring" revolution but an "Oh shit we're losing our puppet" revolution.  Then we teamed up with Saddam fucking Hussein to go fuck them up.  Then we threatened them non stop and put horrible sanctions on them.  And in the end, they are still willing to go to the table to negotiate with us.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no, Bad evil Iran.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is that a "conspiracy?"  Kind of.  It's monied interests trying to intimidate the world into doing what is in the best interest of American corporate power.  But it's fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm afraid a lot of people prefer to shut their mind to this shit because it keeps their narrative simple "good and evil" and they like it that way.

       Exactly. Also great point about Iran. Even saying that the US consciously seeks to increase its power is a 'conspiracy' for some people, as if we're the most powerful nation just because we got lucky. Most people are fucking lost.

       That a country seeks to increase its own power on the world stage is the most basic concept in the field of international relations. Seriously, take an IR class. It's the first thing you learn. That people think this is a conspiracy means the vast majority of people are indeed lost due to being uninformed. The question is, how did the masses become like this? This question, of course, when asked, is typically met with a rejection of the critical mindset and written off as "human nature," as if such a thing were possible to pinpoint. To delve deeper into this concept, I wonder exactly what the relationship is between critical thinking skills and geography, and what role powerful individuals have played historically in suppressing it.

        if you talk to someone about the US funding ISIS, they'll often respond with things like, "Uh huh. I bet you think the moon landing was faked, too." People act like once you start deviating from the official line you'll end up searching for Atlantis and living in a bunker.

       I've noticed if you play dumb with people and ask them questions it's pretty enlightening. You'll often find that the average person has no concept of the official stories that they cling to. Yet they cling! They just have a faith that deep down the state is their friend, that the media is out to tell the truth and anyone who questions them must have some sort of mental illness.

They stay away from politics or anything in the MSM or wiki that backs up what we say and focus very tightly and very intently on 1 specific user talking about the Joos or some guy talking about aliens. Why? Why ignore users in this sub shouting that stuff down? Why is it so important to them and their sense of self to constantly dwell on niche theories by people on the fringe?
      </p>
      <p>
       They consciously re-enforce their existing world view by cherry picking data in an environment dedicated to circle jerking over already knowing everything. Then they espouse a very rigid and smug belief in something they can't explain or don't understand - which is ironically the accusation most often levied at conspiracy theorists.

       I don't feel bad for them but I do look at them with side eyes. If I meet someone who starts talking about how the US has to implement a domestic drone program in order to combat homegrown terror or someone who is pretty certain that the official 911 story must be true because "the government wouldn't lie". I view them as being brainwashed or lost in a fog. Do not trust, do not associate and leave them behind.

       I think people are just beginning to understand how psychopathy works and how they rise to the top of whatever social structure they inhabit. Your average person is not enough of a psychopath to rise to power, so they struggle to understand the motivations of someone who does qualify as a 'leader' in our highly corrupt system.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they go on assuming that these psychopaths must be operating from a place of intelligence and objective decision making on behalf of the whole, even at the cost of a few. And they are helped into that belief by a Media that strives at every given opportunity to normalize psychopathic behavior, to the benefit of it's shareholders and owners.

       Very astute comment.  I agree completely.  I think this is why it is important that people use their empathy to understand how these decisions are made.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no humanity, morality, or any limits on what this group of people making these decisions will do.  The only thing that matters is reaching their desired goals.  Your life is of no concern to them.

       I couldn't have said it better. I had friends like this that I had to break ties with. All they did was bash and ridicule any unconventional, but true, information I presented them with because it went against their fearful, ignorant and submissive view of the world. Now when I meet someone who acts similarly, I immediately give them a "Are you fucking kidding me?" look and then ignore everything they say.

       This is the same thing as why people repress belief in God. If you believe in God you must be a religious nut job that's homophobic, believes the apocalypse is imminent and that Obama's the antichrist.

       People also believe that you must believe that God is some old man in the sky, when the truth is God is light/life/love/energy/spirit/consciousness. God is everything and everything is God, in a way pantheism.

       it's because the ideas promoted whether accurate or not contradict their perspective. A person's reaction determines how attached they are to their world view. of course they don't see it as their world view, they see it as the truth. not their truth, the truth. this goes for everybody.

       is the high level of tolerance we have for each other's perspectives. This is constant on display. You can tell a "visitor" to the subs as soon as they show outright hostility for someone else's point of view.

       The reason they put so much effort into it is that it hurts them. They don't like the uncomfortable feeling of uncertainty and so they attack it.  Same as people who vehemently defend their ridiculous religious stories.

       How am I mocking them.......... Hahahaha what, you really are trying to shove words down my throat. I said their situation was sad. Never did I use sarcasm or even as such crack a joke about something along the lines they they do, heck I'm clueless as to what they do, other than monitoring us lol. You act like I'm taking direct quotes and links from their subreddit and making fun of or jeering at them. I made an observation how they use their time, and that its a shame. Not sure how that's the mocking or "making fun of someone or something in a cruel way." You're move dude.

      <p>
       I don't think it hurts them at all. I think there is a genuine interest that they mask by cherry picking the most outlandish theories and doggy piling on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're never mean and they don't ever comment on any of the stuff that turns out to be true or not crazy... Which means they're here parsing through all the threads.

       At some point you have to admit it's a pretty weird hobby to
       <strong>
        obsess over conspiracy theories
       </strong>
       only to pick and choose a few crazy ones to tell the same old tin foil hat jokes about every now and then.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're here because they like conspiracy, period.

      <p>
       They must love conspiracies or they wouldn't be here. My point is that they attack it because of some weird repressed insecurity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they think the state is under corporate control or that the US is settling into a police state like an old man into a warm bath. They won't admit that to themselves so they sort of just join a sub that is essentially as obsessed with conspiracies as we are and pretend they're only in it for the lols.

       Maybe they are formerly naive people who got tricked into believing something stupid on r/conspiracy, and embarrassed themselves.  So it's like a reinforcement not to like conspiracy theories. crusaders.

       I think some of them got into Alex Jones or Art Bell or something when they were younger and realized that was insane. But can't dismiss some of the lingering questions that even vapid shills like them raised. So they keep an eye on stuff like this sub all the while telling themselves it's out of smug superiority and not lingering curiosity.
      </p>
      <p>
       The meta is that they're still obsessed with conspiracy theories but in a way that they can tell themselves is 'smart'. A lot of people say that conspiracy theorists are know it alls who like to think they're superior to the masses and have some sort of 'special insight or information' that makes them smarter than your average sheeple.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I admit I have seen that attitude in this sub, I think I see that worldview far more plainly and more often in the MSM news subs and the /topminds, /conspiritard subs dedicated to worshiping us and our beliefs.

 Perhaps also they have gained a lot from the establishment and want to keep it that way, eg. Wall street bankers, police, scientists, politicians etc. They all have vested interest in maintaining the status quo.

       I lived in Cali for 2 years and met plenty of people who considered surfers to be lazy, shiftless stoners who lived off of family, girlfriends or minimum wage jobs. Sometimes they have bizarre pseudo spiritual tribal inspired beliefs about the earth and ocean. There was a general concesus amongst people with 9-5's that these people contribute nothing to society.
      </p>
      <p>
       For all the indignation I've seen leveled toward them and their lifestyle I don't see a lot of subs devoted to following
       <a href="/r/surfing">
        /r/surfing
       </a>
       and making fun of their beliefs or lifestyle. On the other hand there are movies and tv shows dedicated to surfers, beach babes and tanned hunks. But I guess media like that exists because we all hate these really fit, attractive athletes who spend all day chasing waves.

       You know what amuses me know? Its the idea that I'm some kind of conspiracy theorists for being a critical thinker. I rationalize information from multiple sources of data. I don't accept what is told me is truth. I doubt. I doubt because people lie. I know people lie because altruism is facetious. there is no I'm selfish act. neural networks do not allow for such things to exist. I live in a world people lie in order to succeed and in order to live. I always assume people are lying to me. that is why I search for an objective truth. and that requires me to research data from multiple sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have open discussions with scholars all the time.  I'm not a particularly peculiar or unusual fellow. I'm not an uneducated.  I don't want for knowledge. No what do many of us here. I don't classify myself as a member of an organization. I don't classify myself as a member of this group beyond the fact that I openly read and ask questions. I am merely and purely a critical thinker.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cynical individuals may ask: how dare I not trust a world that lies to me on a daily basis? My question is just the opposite. how do you justify accepting things that you know are likely to be lies? why? Do you think the truth is subjective? that's not how reality works. I'm not delusional for wanting objective truth.

       I feel somewhat strongly about defending the term conspiracy theorist to anyone willing to hear the argument. It's a neutral term, but has been made pejorative through the media and politicians. In essence, it means you believe in or suspect one or more conspiracies, which as our sidebar says are secret plans to do something unlawful or harmful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Michael Parenti in a number of his talks contrasts this with the "coincidence theorist," a person who thinks that powerful people act in ways to secure and further their power by sheer chance. Any seeming conspiracy is actually just  happenstance; there is no motive or coordination, just random actors. People who subconsciously subscribe to this consider it more parsimonious or believable for a number of reasons, but mostly due to not having examined their thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       When viewed in this light, it is obvious which position is more deserving of ridicule. Not that every conspiracy theory is true, not by a long shot, but that would be a less absurd position than none of them are true.

       That seems a severe mischaracterization. "Chance" doesn't come into it for me, but nor does it prove or imply a conspiracy. I think the rich and powerful will simply tend to act, so as to retain that wealth and power. That seems only natural. And, because those actions will tend to be similar from one to the next, this gives the
       <em>
        illusion
       </em>
       of collusion and conspiracy, even if they're all behaving independently, like a flock of birds seeming to swoop and dive as one, even though there's no preconceived plan necessarily present.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, the rich and powerful will prefer to hang out with the rich, powerful and like-minded. This explains groups like the Trilaterals, Bilderberg, etc. No conspiracy necessary. Of course, it doesn't rule out all possibility of a conspiracy, but their mere existence doesn't prove one, as seems to be frequently suggested.

       The term was coined as a form of slander and then marketed as such. It has historically been used as ad hominem to discredit a position. The social context continues to exist whether or not you and I can see the reasonable validity of it. That is why I prefer the term critical thinker to conspiracy theorist.

       It's the only reasonable explanation I can think of. All of the stuff I'm subscribed to are related to my interests, things I enjoy, hobbies and so on. I can't imagine why I'd subscribe to a sub devoted to something I hated... that doesn't make sense.

       Shills are the ones who worm their way and their politics into any conversation and when you go through their post history you'll find them copy pasting the same talking points about the same hot button issues over and over in as many discussions as possible.

       - didn't realise such a sad place existed until today - where some guy was saying he liked the mods at

        /r/TIL

       because they were friendly and thought they "had some allies there". I immediately thought: Allies in what? What exactly is it you're doing that requires allies, apart from trying desperately to be a part of a community that has no purpose?

       It's really sad. Pathetic, even. I'm sorry people don't have a hobby or interest that could occupy the time they're wasting softly caressing each other's egos over their unwarranted feelings of intellectual superiority. Poor little bellends.

       I'm still pretty new to Reddit. It's sort of a cool concept to have meta subs that exist to talk about other subs. I just wouldn't personally bother with a sub that was obsessed on re-posting cherry picked strawmen from a place I already don't like.

       I'm trying to stay away from calling things sad or pathetic or whatever. Like I said. If you pay attention to top minds they aren't really mean. Just kind of lost in a circle jerk. Go read some of the shit they're saying about me and this thread. None of their accusations or theories about this line up with anything I've said.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have this narrative of how we operate and what we think and they sort of cling to it even in spite of evidence to the contrary. Very similar to how they only focus on the far out posts here about lizard people and hologram planes.

       think it's sad. But then to me Reddit is just a website - to these people it seems to be some sort of safe haven community where they go for reassurance. It speaks of a lack of affection and friendship in real life... which

       It's easy to say that there are simply a bunch of shills out there, but that's not completely true.  Many of these morons are normal people who are scared of information that disrupts their beliefs.  I have two friends that are exactly this way.  Unsurprisingly, they're the same types of people who try and look as "cool" as possible on facebook, updating their life so "cyber friends" can keep up.

       They don't want to believe that the world can be as fucked up as it is, that the preconceived notions shoved down their throats throughout childhood are completely wrong.  It pisses me off, but once they find a group of similar (non)thinkers, these types of subreddits form.

        It's easy to say that there are simply a bunch of shills out there, but that's not completely true.

       I'm personally off the shill thing altogether. I've been called a shill on this sub several times. Always for disagreeing with people. Shills exist, they're out there. It's in the news for fucks sake. But I don't think they make up a very large percentage of users. Just cause someone disagrees doesn't mean they're a fucking shill.

        Many of these morons are normal people who are scared of information that disrupts their beliefs. I have two friends that are exactly this way. Unsurprisingly, they're the same types of people who try and look as "cool" as possible on facebook, updating their life so "cyber friends" can keep up.

      <p>
       This is exactly what I'm getting at... insecurity. I've also had a few Facebook friends who pat themselves on the back for espousing beliefs that consensus reality has pre approved an appropriate strong opinion on.
      </p>
      <p>
       It goes hand in hand with a cyber veil of absolute decadence and euphoria. Their timelines are filled with  vacation pictures, high angle selfies. I'm not sure I've ever seen someone with a vanity timeline ever mention something that wasn't already the popular opinion.

       I find that after University and people get out into the real world they either start asking questions and forming opinions or double down on the indoctrination they had in school and their consciousness just evaporates into the ether.

       Of course it doesn't.  It's impossible to know exactly how many legitimate "shills" there are out there, but I'm in the belief that a good portion of them are shills.  The benefit of swaying mass opinion far outweighs the costs of hiring "shills" and investing in related technologies.

       Regarding your other comments, I couldn't agree more.  As a younger person, I certainly haven't been exposed to as many people asking questions.

       Why is ridiculing conspiracy theories and being afraid necessarily the same? Couldn't you think 9/11 truthers are wrong, or ridiculous, while also believing that the world is a horrible place? Plus, your language doesn't seem particularly open to any alternative beliefs either. Anyone who doesn't agree with you seems to be a "(non)thinker" or a scared moron. That makes it sound like you're doing the exact same thing you're criticizing people who don't follow conspiracy theories for doing.

       Yeah that certainly didn't come off the right away.  I'm just frustrated in general with people who won't even entertain certain ideas...won't listen to a thing.  But I certainly think someone who chooses to ignore information is a non-thinker.

       Yeah, but everyone tends to ignore specific pieces of information that don't fit their world views, I'm sure there are cases where you, and everyone else on this sub, have done the same. I know I've done it.

       I think these people are the same as anyone else really. We all poke fun at, and are often dismissive of, things we think are stupid, whether it's as innocuous as a shitty movie, or something as big as a belief system shared by billions of people.

       Used to have a male roommate who talked shit about guys that we knew all the time.  Always behind their backs. Snarky little comments at first, but it ramped up over time.  He seemed to obsess over other guys comments, appearances, girls that they were seeing, etc...  I started to feel pretty uncomfortable around him.  One day I asked him if he was gay.  He got red faced and said no.  Moved out a couple of days later.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thing is, I wouldn't be weirded out by him being gay.  Was definitely weirded out by his angry, obsessive behavior towards people  just living their lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that focusing on other people must be like a drug.  It's just as bad as being too self absorbed.  Finding balance in this new world, so full of information, must be challenging for some people.

       Yeah, I started to feel bad for him until someone told me that I was the one he talked shit about the most.  Suddenly made sense why some people started acting weird toward me at different points in time.

       I didn't blame him for that though.  I considered those people as simple minded and easily led.

       Well, I'm a former 4chinner so I have developed such a disdain for the average ledditor over the years that I genuinely revel in their disgust. I don't go on any other subs and discuss 'conspiracies' so anyone outside of this sub can fuck off, as far am I'm concerned.

       I just call myself a "researcher".  Because that's really all it is.  Yes the term "conspiracy theorist" was created by the CIA to ridicule anyone who dared question the bullshit story of the JFK murder.  And GWB was quick to use it again immediately after 9/11.

       My approach is "who cares?" - reason being is regardless of their attempt to damage or whatever it is they hope to achieve with their behaviour - the only thing I've discovered about this subreddit so far (as someone who isn't overly fond of how the term conspiracy is used) is that there are a lot of people here looking to talk about things rationally. Sure, aliens and stuff pop up - whatever - the people who flock to those posts for whatever reason have their own ideas and let them have it. I'm here to meet the people with ideas who can hold and are capable of a conversation. Anything else, and really I dont have the attention span.

       I do, that's why  I dont care what others want to say about the information and details I'd like to discover. I dont care if people make fun of me, or the ideas I have, I'm going to pursue them until I need not. Does that clarify? :)

       this thread isn't about what the trolls are saying it's figuring out why they do it, completely different things. Yes who cares what the trolls say but people are interested in what motivates them to do it which is not a simple reason and thus created an interesting discussion.

       It does, but you have to consider that a lot of people - probably even the majority of people - don't think like you do about things like this.  They've been conditioned specifically
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       to look more deeply into things, to accept what they're told, and to ridicule anyone who doesn't.  End result of this is that things like that TIL stunt yesterday that shit on this sub and was totally unprovoked will just solidify the negative opinions people have about this sub and its members.

       Well I think it's pretty damn simple actually.  Some conspiracies are true, and people in power recognize this.  Hell, even 9/11, the official story is a "conspiracy".  The way to solve this dilemma is to:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Pacify the masses with games, sports and entertainment
       </li>
       <li>
        Change "education" from rational thinking into testing your ability to recall "Facts"
       </li>
       <li>
        Promote a fear at every turn, create a distrust of fellow man
       </li>
       <li>
        Target anyone seeking truth by labelling them "crazy" (a lemmings worst fear, isolation).
       </li>
       <li>
        Pollute the well of facts with easily debunkable disinformation
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       It's the only way to run an effective pyramid scam.

       I laughed seeing what til did. They couldn't have done anything more to acknowledge how much people actually do take this seriously. They most likely sent a lot of traffic here and made themselves look fools in the process.

       I believe your hypothesis is probably true for the useful-idiot subscribers to those subs, but one thing you'll notice about the posts there: they're Jew obsessed. The specific kinds of posts they like to lampoon there are anything that can be easily painted as "ridiculous" or racist, etc. and... anything to do with Israel or Judaism.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, that makes a case for the originators of those subs having the agenda of conflating anti-Zionism with ridiculousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       As much as there are government shills, I don't think they would consider hanging out on and contributing to that sub particularly worthwhile. However, unpaid legions of JIDF wannabes probably consider it a profound victory to initiate a circlejerk over how some "idiot" thinks Israel's a rotten country.

       Things they hear strike true to them, and it completely conflicts with what they are told on the outside world. This inner conflict results in confusion and frustration, which turns into anger. Most people don't like to get angry at themselves, so they project their anger onto the object they think is the source of it.

       'Conspiracy Theorist'

       The term itself implies that a person who matches that label is either part of or supportive of (a) conspiracy - ironically that does not apply to people that are generally labelled a conspiracy theorist.

       certainly makes a good point regarding those who use mockery to express legitimate interest in questioning media narratives, but from a comfortable emotional distance. However, it's somewhat disingenuous to completely absolve ourselves of responsibility for the negative stereotypes that have come to be associated with us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people have an automatic negative reaction when you tell them something that makes them feel uninformed, sure, and there's no way around that. Everyone is used to defending their ideas from scrutiny, but most can move past the initial unease into a more receptive and curious mindset, if the new information presented to them is compelling enough. We all like to feel as though we have a leg up on our leaders, or that we've solved a mystery being deliberately obscured, so there's no inherent reason why outsiders wouldn't want to hear our theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Except, as you've all doubtlessly observed, they don't. I believe this can be ascribed to both us and our detractors making the exact same mistake: The superstitious belief that we know everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jones is a blowhard, and Icke is delusional; one could even posit that they're acting out to deliberately make the rest of us look like lunatics by association. However, their gravest sin and source of (possibly justified) ridicule, is that they present their theories as complete explanations rather than probing questions. Asking if there's something about the elites that causes them to see us commoners as less than human is a far cry from saying you've determined that they're all literally cold-blooded shapeshifters. Similarly, we've found a metric shit-ton of issues with the official narrative on 9/11; we can see the physics conundrums, we know the individuals who capitalized on it the most, both in political warmongering terms, and in making actual bank through the insurance fraud. However, none of us know specifically who masterminded it, who they were working for, and how they pulled it off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Knowing information means that you have (or at least feel) power over those trying to keep it hidden, and those who haven't heard it. What those who mock us recognize is that, with one hand, we ascribe omnipotent power to the New World Order, while with the other, we put it beneath us by acting like we've worked out its every move. We hold the most important questions that need to be demanded of those in power, but we act like we have all the answers instead. Knowing everything feels good, man.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mockery brought down on us and the stereotypes we've inadvertently developed through our own righteous but misguided fury are unfortunate, though, because they ignore the facts that most people love conspiracy theorism when it's called by another name ("whistleblowing," "investigative journalism"), and that we're starting to win. Everyone who's ever said "watch what you say on the phone!" has been vindicated. The military-industrial complex is way behind their "seven countries in five years" schedule, and the latest terrorist group that they've concocted is a joke. The elites are feeling scrutiny and pushback, even from the lamestream, in increasing order at every turn.
      </p>
      <p>
       So as a nice, neat, concise [TL;DR] summary: Those who mock us feel like we're being superstitious know-it-all's, and we feel similar smug contempt for the "sheeple." Don't think you have the answers when it's our questions that make us powerful. We have no enemies beyond the elites- simply potential allies who have yet to be adequately pissed off by their lies. Fight through the night, and I'll see y'all in the morning.

       I've had that feeling lately. The reason that the elite isn't actually scared of us is because we make ourselves repulsive  via that exact, selfish, mocking, unearned air of, "We know what's on top of you, and we're on top of them, and that feels so good" illusion. Conspiracy theorists would be more likeable - more meaningful - if they were openly self-aware of their position in their culture. If they could take the piss out of themselves just a little more. If they could be less tastelessly stubborn. We have an underdog charm about us that is never really embraced or used, instead we want to be "powerful," or "God." We want to be righteous above all else. We want the mainstream to change, not us. We have our key figureheads who use these outdated cliches, like "Go out and educate yourself with the facts in my book, and in the correct articles online," in a society where the mainstream know well that facts are fragmented, fuzzy data. Facts are dead, and that applies to our facts as much as the official ones. That's why we have these mainstreamers reading conspiracies without it actually sinking in - facts don't sink in anymore, people are incapable of sinking in facts. The difference is; the elite wins in this society, not us, because inaction is all they need from the people, and inaction is all that occurs when facts are dead. And we aren't bringing them back from the dead. We need to deal with the post-modern culture issues like the destruction of what "fact" even means, and to not seem like idiots, we need include our own "facts" in this issue, sacrificing our dead facts for some new, baser, modern idea rather than an outdated one. Righteousness of our sort is outdated. Period. Knowing "facts" will not save the U.S. The U.S. has killed facts in order to prevent that from happening. The elite probably supports conspiracy-figures who inflate our ego's, keep us old-minded. We should be openly meek, vulnerable, doubtful, self-deprecating, self-aware; looking beyond simply being right and wrong, leaving behind the belief that righteous fury can be inspired, today,  within the people by facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, another way of putting it is: We (truthers, conspiracy theorists, etc) are those school teachers that scold a class boy for being unable to understand something that seems basic, we endlessly scold him and fail his reports, without realising that his failures are our own shortcomings as teachers. We never think for a minute that there is integrity to his stupidity. We never ask ourselves if our teaching methods are outdated. We never actually see the mind of the student with any degree of fairness or understanding, we only see him from some "above, looking down" perspective. We're not teachers at all - we're assholes. A good teacher is "above, looking down" and "below, looking up" at once, because a good teacher knows that any kind of progression in the way people think post-himself isn't going to happen without integral reasons. A good teacher rejects the stubbornness and the righteousness of his own knowledge. The teacher learns more than the student - that's the age-old adage. But we refuse to learn from the student. We refuse to sacrifice the "above, looking down" perspective in order to see the real perspective. Because we lack this, our righteous grilling of the boy is simply repulsive. We end up looking somehow stupider than the boy on a much more important level. And the irony always is that the boy is telling us this, all the time.

       With the conspiracy theorist it has to do with the herd seeing someone that is no longer buying into the herd bullshit (official story).  Nothing makes a herd animal feel safer than being in the herd, and therefore nothing is more threatening to it than the possibility of
       <em>
        not being in the herd.
       </em>
       And the conspiracy theorist, in their insistence on not automatically buying into what is generally accepted as true (i.e., not accepting something as true simply because most of the herd says it is) epitomizes the
       <em>
        possibility
       </em>
       that one doesn't
       <em>
        have to
       </em>
       live in the herd, which brings to my mind in the devoted herd animal the horror of contemplating not being in the herd, which, it must be remembered, is the thing which brings them the most comfort.
      </p>
      <p>
       What makes this state of affairs truly unfortunate is that their are wolves (sociopaths) among us.  They are not hobbled by the fear of the herd, and they also know exactly what makes the herd tick.  Fear.  They guide the herd using fear - just like sheep dogs.  Knowing that the more afraid the herd gets the more it will attempt to feel safer =
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       herd instinct.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is precisely this paradigm why the wolves know they can do whatever the fuck they want!  Because the more scared the herd gets the more it will tighten itself - this is exactly how fascism works.

       I'm not sure there is an easy answer for the question, at least not one that doesn't touch leave us with more questions. For all the individualistic ideology of the 20th and 21st century i when it comes to group dynamics we just can't reconcile the concept with what is the idealized state of conformity. What we're discussing is the duality of man, not in a sense of good or evil but in that of holding two ideologically contrary beliefs both of which we constitute as true. Cognitive dissonance is what drives people to go to all sorts of batshit crazy extremes to prove or disprove something as a means of self validation.

       I used to believe that several "conspiracy theories" were true "without a doubt," then my thinking changed to "plausible," then eventually "not likely." I like to see if any new facts or ideas come to light which would change my views back to "plausible" or "without a doubt." My way of evaluating theories changed from a binary view of "is" or "is not," to thinking about them with varying degrees of possibility. I'm curious to see if others are thinking this way.

       Nice try OP. But the term "conspiracy" itself is dated &amp; weird now - because it's (almost) all in the open. You want to drag us back to when it was indeed a "conspiracy theory", &amp; to when it was laughable. Yeah, keep laughing while drinking fracking water, or drawn to another war that was decided patriotic (on your behalf)....

       The reason they are obsessed with this subreddit is because its a breeding ground for neo-nazis. The people who hate it the most are non-nazi conspiracy fans who feel like they've been tricked after coming here.

       You want to know the real reason why? Your sub is run by stormfront. Deny it, remove the comment, ban me (You know all in the name of free speech you claim to love until you don't) but that is the hard truth. There will always be trolls. However clean your sub and I bet 90% of those you deem as trolls would disappear. And your sub would grow and prosper with quality content. You know with real actual conspiracies.. And not just Jews everywhere all the time.. That is the truth r/conspiracy but you never accept it..

       The holocaust happened. It happened exactly like history tells us it happened. Your theories are silly. My grandfather fought in WW2. He liberated those camps. He saw the bodies. I talked to him a lot. He cried often. He didn't like to talk about it. I get slightly angry when I read this stuff. It's insulting, and I'm not Jewish and politically, pretty anti israel. If someone said the holocaust didn't happen in front of me they'd be nursing their jaw for a while. My grandfather took 3 bullets. Thousands died. Don't fuck with me. Your bunk theories and feigned intellectual superiority will get you knocked out, honestly. And you'd deserve it.

       9/11 happened. 9/11 was not a false flag. People get offended when you say wrong shit about how their friends and family died.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like reading about the Kennedy assassination. False flag operations, backdoor politics, etc. I think these are plausible. That's why I sub here.
      </p>
      <p>
       People like to talk shit here because the sub is 25% interesting and 75% sophomoric idiots smoking dmt talking about chemtrails and invalidating the deaths of 6 million people and 3000 Americans with like, just their like, opinions man, and stop being such a sheep. That's kinda why.

       Yes, the 9/11 Truth movement was started by the family and friends of the victims of 9/11. The "anti-truthers" like Glenn Beck said "I hate the 9/11 families" precisely because they wouldn't go along with the false story about 9/11.

       I don't even touch holocaust stuff...I assume it was just like the movies...however the couple times I have read about it at all...the "conspiracy" guys argue things like" it was "about 1 million..not 7 million".

       Got it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because US soldiers died freeing people from German concentration camps does not mean that the US government is telling the truth about 9/11. You can allow yourself to question the honesty of government run Warren Commission and the media after JFK's murder...but everything they say about 9/11 is true? and if we aren't sure of that and question it you will punch us in the face.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just the similarities of Warren Comission and 9/11 commission...were unsettling to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       First they try to make Kissinger head of commission..someone with massive vested interest in not digging deeply into Saudi Arabia connection. When 9/11 family survivors ask about this conflict of interest Kissinger resigns.
      </p>
      <p>
       2nd Zelikow wrote PHD disertation on traumatic events effecting the pysche of the masses...specifically JFK etc. Then in interviews on NPR Zelikow said his goal in guiding the commission was to not have the public question the legitimacy of 9/11 commission as much as they did the Warren Commission(guided by Allen Dulles--&gt;CIA guy fired by JFK).
      </p>
      <p>
       so does this comment make you want to punch me in the face? not trying to be mean...I just find it interesting.

       9/11 was a conspiracy. Saudi nationals conspired to attack the United States, and they did. "Bush did 9/11" is a load of shit. The United States did not blow up WTC with thermite. That's a joke. There may be a conspiracy, the conspiracy might go all the way to the Saudi royal family, but the US didn't attack itself. I don't think half of the people here know what the term 'conspiracy' means.

       Ah yes. Use violence because someone said something you don't like. By the way, no one denies that people died in the camps. The Nazi's did not purposely kill them, thats the lie. And 9/11 was most definitely an inside job and anyone who has put a lot of thought into it would at least come to the conclusion that the official story does not add up.

       I don't think it hurts them at all. I think there is a genuine interest that they mask by cherry picking the most outlandish theories and doggy piling on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're never mean and they don't ever comment on any of the stuff that turns out to be true or not crazy... Which means they're here parsing through all the threads.

       At some point you have to admit it's a pretty weird hobby to
       <strong>
        obsess over conspiracy theories
       </strong>
       only to pick and choose a few crazy ones to tell the same old tin foil hat jokes about every now and then.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're here because they like conspiracy, period.
      </p>

      <p>
       They must love conspiracies or they wouldn't be here. My point is that they attack it because of some weird repressed insecurity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they think the state is under corporate control or that the US is settling into a police state like an old man into a warm bath. They won't admit that to themselves so they sort of just join a sub that is essentially as obsessed with conspiracies as we are and pretend they're only in it for the lols.

       Just think, they are spending time out of their lives, I repeat their one and only life, to imitate and mock us. It serves no person but proving they have no better use of their time and purpose on this earth. A little sad when you think about it.

       There is also the smug shit eating validation that comes from capitulating to concensus reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've known (past tense) people who talked massive amounts of shit about conspiracy theorists publically on their facebooks. Made fun of all the easy targets: Chemtrails, vaccines, 9/11, Alex Jones - you name it. Only to have them talk about a belief in a corporate controlled government, false flags, the rise of the military industrial complex, banksters... pretty much everything else in messenger convos.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a weird obsession with hating these big targets and then almost secretly believing in the more realistic stuff. Oh and if you ever tried to point out that their own BS was identical to Jones they'd go thermonuclear.

       I find a lot of them are ex-army men or involved in the army
 Perhaps also they have gained a lot from the establishment and want to keep it that way, eg. Wall street bankers, police, scientists, politicians etc. They all have vested interest in maintaining the status quo.

       It's just so ignorant and dismissive. They're the kind of people who would have been supportive of racial segregation because they follow the crowd, refusing to think for themselves. No matter how much evidence there is to support a theory they will just call "conspiracy theorists" (aka people who think objectively) crazy only until some mainstream source confirms what they refused to even consider. It's sad that some people not only refuse to do research to see that there are nefarious activities that go on covertly, but they taunt and laugh and try to make "us" (because obviously we all hold exactly the same beliefs like all world rulers are lizard people /s) look like crazy idiots. Ignorance is bliss, they must be euphoric!
