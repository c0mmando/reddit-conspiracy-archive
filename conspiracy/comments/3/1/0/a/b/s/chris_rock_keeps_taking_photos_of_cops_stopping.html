        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;The comedian is documenting his run-ins with police on social media, and there are a lot of them.</p>

<p>Some of Chris Rock&#39;s best comedic routines have been about how police officers interact with black men. Take this bit, addressed to black people, on &quot;how not to get your ass kicked by the police.&quot;</p>

<p>Like the best comedians, Rock speaks from personal experience. On Monday, he posted this photo for his followers on Facebook and Twitter with the caption &quot;Stopped by the cops again wish me luck.&quot; </p>

<p>It&#39;s not the first time Rock&#39;s been stopped by police and taken photos of the encounters. Photographing his police stops has sort of become a thing. He did the same thing here and here. Monday marked the third time in seven weeks that Rock posted a photo of himself being pulled over by a police officer. It&#39;s unclear why he was stopped or if he was arrested.</p>

<p>Rock&#39;s point is clear: Racial profiling is endemic in many of America&#39;s police departments. Take New York City. Black men make up more than 25 percent of the New York Police Department&#39;s stops but comprise a relatively small share of the city&#39;s population. As Emily Badger pointed out at The Washington Post late last year, it&#39;s a problem that both the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations have tried—and failed—to address.&quot; </p>

<p>It&#39;s unclear why he gets stopped but it&#39;s clearly racial profiling. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your sarcasm. I don&#39;t know what Chris Rock is like in his personal life, but with the federal government pushing a modern race war on the country- plus the clear evidence of a growing police state -I&#39;m saying it&#39;s propaganda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly - Rock has an agenda. I love the guy as a comedian, but he is trying to prove a point so while I don&#39;t doubt that he&#39;s getting pulled over a lot I would not be surprised if he is not instigating it to skew his stats. None of my black friends have ever complained about getting pulled over too much. I&#39;m not saying that profiling doesn&#39;t exists, but I don&#39;t think it exists anywhere near the level that Rock is trying to sell.</p>
