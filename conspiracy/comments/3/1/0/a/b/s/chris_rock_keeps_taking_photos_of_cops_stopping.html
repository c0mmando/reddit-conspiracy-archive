       "The comedian is documenting his run-ins with police on social media, and there are a lot of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of Chris Rock's best comedic routines have been about how police officers interact with black men. Take this bit, addressed to black people, on "how not to get your ass kicked by the police."
      </p>
      <p>
       Like the best comedians, Rock speaks from personal experience. On Monday, he posted this photo for his followers on Facebook and Twitter with the caption "Stopped by the cops again wish me luck."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not the first time Rock's been stopped by police and taken photos of the encounters. Photographing his police stops has sort of become a thing. He did the same thing here and here. Monday marked the third time in seven weeks that Rock posted a photo of himself being pulled over by a police officer. It's unclear why he was stopped or if he was arrested.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rock's point is clear: Racial profiling is endemic in many of America's police departments. Take New York City. Black men make up more than 25 percent of the New York Police Department's stops but comprise a relatively small share of the city's population. As Emily Badger pointed out at The Washington Post late last year, it's a problem that both the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations have tried—and failed—to address."

       3 times in 7 weeks??  THATS FUCKING NOTHING.  Ive been pulled over 3 times in 3 days, simply for driving home from work at the same time that the bars close.  Its always some bullshit reason 'license plate light flickered' 'went over the shoulder line' 'report of a speeding car matching my cars description' always bullshit cant prove it did, cant prove it didnt scenarios.  They see you're not drunk and send you on your way.  By the way, im white.

       I agree with your sarcasm. I don't know what Chris Rock is like in his personal life, but with the federal government pushing a modern race war on the country- plus the clear evidence of a growing police state -I'm saying it's propaganda.

       Exactly - Rock has an agenda. I love the guy as a comedian, but he is trying to prove a point so while I don't doubt that he's getting pulled over a lot I would not be surprised if he is not instigating it to skew his stats. None of my black friends have ever complained about getting pulled over too much. I'm not saying that profiling doesn't exists, but I don't think it exists anywhere near the level that Rock is trying to sell.

       Also, when he was on Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, they were pulled over in Jerry's car and he was talking about racial profiling as well. Check it out:
