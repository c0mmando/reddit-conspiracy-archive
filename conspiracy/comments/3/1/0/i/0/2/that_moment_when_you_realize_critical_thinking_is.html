        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was thinking about anti-intellectualism and the limiting of ideas in our national conversations. Our society is made more restrictive by limiting the number of things we can think about. If certain ideas are &quot;beyond the pale&quot; or &quot;not worth thinking about&quot; or &quot;offensive&quot; or whatever emotional label we can use to cordon them off, we can banish entire arenas of thought from our mental landscape if we accept these ideologies running through our culture. Ideologies increasingly promoted by corporate-owned media. </p>

<p>5 media companies own 95% of American media. In 1983, that number was 50. The diversity of the message is limited, and with this russian nesting-dolls game of corporate consolidation that has become all the rage over the last 30 years, people are now trapped in what is effectively a pro-corporate echo chamber, regardless of which channel you watch or popular website you go to. </p>

<p>The most irritating thing about all these ideologies is the strain of anti-intellectualism that has become so fashionable in the last decade or two. It&#39;s cool to be dumb, and it&#39;s annoying to ask too many questions. Our education system reinforces this, by training people that they&#39;re dumb unless they happen to be among the top 5% of students. These students then inevitably become attached to this system that rewards them, so it effectively makes all the most intelligent students very pro-authority, pro-&quot;the system&quot;, because the system has always worked well for them. Then they are comfortable joining the military, working for the government, or working for large companies. So they are &quot;captured&quot; by large bureaucracies as a mindset, and become dependent on them to function and maintain a sense of self-value. This serves the status quo.</p>

<p>And the kids who <em>didn&#39;t</em> succeed in the system, well, they now hate the system because it told them they were failures. So they want to rebel against the system, not learn about it and work within it, but they&#39;re often too poor to do anything but remain agitated wage-slaves. Especially if you trick them in to taking out a bunch of debt, then they&#39;re trapped forever. They don&#39;t see legitimate ways to act to improve their situation on a long-term basis, and so all this pent-up energy gets put in to trivial spectacles like sports. They get the rage out in a way that doesn&#39;t challenge the power structures, and everyone is satisfied. Except the people stuck in the wage-slave lifestyles, of course. </p>

<p>Anyway, all these causes bleed in to the same effect: Anti-intellectualism. America hates people who are smart. People who ask too many questions suck. People who have &quot;moral issues&quot; with things are losers. Etc, etc. These are the ideas of a person who was wrung through the ringer of the school system and the media and the society we live in. These all feed anti-intellectualism, which serves to maintain the status quo. If smart people are never listened to (in terms of social organizing and things like this), then difficult problems will take much longer to fix. This serves the interests of the people already in power. </p>

<p>Anyway, some food for thought on a Tuesday evening. Curious if anyone else has anything to add.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post mag, coming from someone who admittedly excelled in the American school system, and reached the pinnacle according to <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity?language=en">Ken Robinson</a>, academia.</p>

<p>There are those that toe the party line and act accordingly but can see the flaws in The System, but are too paranoid and deluded to seek each other out IRL and start organizing (guilty).</p>

<p>The problem is we are left to think we are the small, unvocal and silent minority, when the irony is far more people subscribe to the theory that things are broken and we need Change.</p>

<p>Only I fear Change will be fruitless, just like last time.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll close with something I think Tyler said best about <a href="http://imgur.com/4kP1FJP">middle children</a>, as I think it is appropriate here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; is a surprisingly toxic term when you consider the frequency of conspiracies that have occurred throughout history. You&#39;d think anyone with a right mind would be ok with theorizing about collusion between powerful people, it has been a serious problem plaguing humanity since the beginning and is worth thinking deeply about. Just shows how much influence the media has, that they can build such a negative connotation around such a reasonable and neutral phrase, in the minds of hundreds of millions of people, over several decades. Talk about playing the long game... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I agree, I was weary of this subreddit after seeing it, but after a bit of a lurk I was like &quot;what&#39;s this, humans who want to talk about things without the word butthurt appearing anywhere, proper grammar and sentences..where am I? Is this candy land?&quot;. Anything that suggest otherwise to someone opinion, which they&#39;ve defensively woven into their ego amour, will lead to negativity which sucks, because you cant talk to people now. They just get super defensive and then destroy any form of mental exploration by telling you off. The age old &quot;respect your elders&quot; and &quot;we&#39;re older than you we know better &quot; where such annoying statements when I was younger (now as someone older, I get palmed of as thinking too much and not focusing on what I need to be focusing on.. go figure)  I got slapped once as a 12 year old when I said &quot;then why does everything suck?&quot; (in question as to why everything was over systematized; sure I didn&#39;t express myself very well, but I was 12!). That slap represented her knowingly understanding what my point was about the systematic flaws people seemingly just accept but that it was better to ignore it and silence me than trying to do something different. Egodefenders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said, that slap is a great example. It becomes this cycle of abuse that people unintentionally perpetuate. It takes a very strong person to receive abuse but not give it out, and break the cycle of abuse. Those are people like Jesus and Ghandi and MLK, but even lots of ordinary people too. If enough people broke the cycle of abuse for long enough, we would come out of our collective fear-based mind-fog and see more clearly and build a better society and civilization that isn&#39;t based on fear. Maybe I have my head in the clouds, but someday that could be possible. The internet is definitely helping things along. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t call the slap abuse, it&#39;s suppression of loss. Mum didnt want to question and find herself in thought of not being able to feed us, so she protected that which made sure I survived. That&#39;s what makes me sad. She couldn&#39;t find another option to provide for us so she diluted her mind to fit into a world created to make us neoslaves...which is what we are. I&#39;m worth 0.40c a minute according to my company and I spend most of my day here... Why? why do I do it. I ask myself every day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see, that sounds difficult. To me, it sounds like a lesser abuse in a tapestry of larger abuses. That&#39;s how most of our lives are. It&#39;s the human condition, I suppose. Some definitely have it worse than others though, and it sounds like you have it pretty rough, I am sorry. </p>

<p>But luckily it can often be improved with social action. That&#39;s how it always happens in history. If life is unfairly bad due to bad work pay, and you can make everyone around you agree openly with this, then it is possible to group together and demand changes by the authorities who are causing the money inequality problem. This not only resolves the problem for you and your co-worker&#39;s income, but for your children&#39;s future income. It&#39;s organized labor&#39;s duty to demand conditions that provide a living, to counter the demands of the CEO or people who profit insanely by taking advantage of others. Not that unions solve everything of course, but they&#39;re a step in the right direction. Just my thoughts</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont have it hard, I just understand this world isn&#39;t fair - and I want to change that! I have great parents, they are conservative yes (also I was a typical kid, misbehaving and so forth like most... my poor parents haha!), but none the less they love the life out of me! I dont want you to think my parents beat me, or I had a crappy upbringing because of them. They did what they could in a world made to suppress survival for those that do not conform :( 
 My statement about my minute worth was for impact. WHy should my minutes, seconds, hours be valued by a dollar mark? How is that ok? It&#39;s not, whether you are a wealthy CEO or a janitor. We are not pay checks , nor should we be living our lives earning pay checks. Deregulate the monetary system!

    <div class="md"><p>Your parents sound like great people! I don&#39;t mean to imply they&#39;re abusive, just that they perpetuated what they received from the culture they grew up in, which is just normal human stuff. That&#39;s all I really meant. </p>

<p>I think we need a guaranteed universal unconditional basic income for everyone. There are less and less jobs every year due to automation and outsourcing/globalization. Therefore some people will not be able to find jobs. These people should still be able to live a productive and reasonably comfortable life. Humanity certainly produces enough goods to make that happen, it&#39;s just a matter of distribution. Distribution that isn&#39;t happening because it doesn&#39;t create profit for the powers that be. </p>

<p>You sound like a good person. Things will change soon in the political system, the internet will ensure that as long as people keep being vocal about the real problems that face each of us, as well as us collectively. I agree people deserve dignity, and basic income is the best way I&#39;ve seen to guarantee that happens. Everyone should check out <a href="/r/BasicIncome">/r/BasicIncome</a> if they haven&#39;t, it&#39;s a great resource about this groundbreaking concept that could deeply change human society and culture for the better. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Revolutions always get co-opted to some degree. The question is, can the public maintain pressure on the political structure in the right way to make us arrive at a stable situation? It&#39;s likely not going to be a one-and-done kind of deal, I think it&#39;ll be more like Egypt with lots of phases and different leaders and lasting several years, but I think in the long run we will settle in to a more stable and peaceful configuration because that&#39;s going to be the only one people will be happy with. But it&#39;s going to take a bit for things to settle, I feel. </p>

<p>My honest theory is that things will get really bad, like a world war (god forbid), and then the victors will form a world government that will say &quot;never again&quot; and it will be a very humanitarian peace-loving government that will equalize wealth a great deal and start giving out basic unconditional income. It will be legitimately awesome and improve humanity. For something like 40 years. Then it will slowly get taken over and corrupted and then some whole new conflicts will start between the world govt and the people who don&#39;t like it, but have no legitimate way to express opposition against the corrupt world government. Could also be 2 world governments too, so there is the appearance of variety and conflict, which is profitable. That&#39;s my theory about the future of the government. </p>

<li><p>We have our new brown enemy, whatever they are called these days in the Middle East who are a direct result of the US&#39;s interventionism from a traditional military invasion.

<li><p>We have been vilifying the Russian bear for years now, especially after their <em>reaction</em> to the Ukrainian coup last December and the split of Ukraine into West and East. </p></li>

<p>All that is left to merge the two, while simultaneously get the TPP and TTIP on fast-track status to get all the Atlantian (Euro + America) and Pacific alliances (America, Japan, Australia, etc) locked up before we engage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you! </p>

<p>I agree 100%. I wish I was more funny, I work on it. I agree humor is the best mechanism to deliver truth. If you can make a harsh truth funny, it&#39;s like when you have to give a dog a pill, but the pill is nasty so you wrap it in bacon. Humor is the bacon.  </p>

<p>I try to be funny, I think I have this ranting anger that I could turn in to something like a George Carlin or Bill Hicks sort of routine, but I don&#39;t really understand how to bridge the gap between where I am and where they are. </p>

<p>Plus if you try humor and it doesn&#39;t land, it undermines the entire rest of the post. So I try and play it safe since I suck at making this heavy stuff in to jokes. It&#39;s a surprisingly difficult thing to do, props to the Daily Show and Last Week Tonight. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, do what you can. Good on you for trying. I&#39;ve done the same thing lots of times, sometimes you get good feedback, sometimes you are left in the cold. Facebook is just not a good place for that stuff. But know that a lot more people agree with you than it appears, they&#39;re all just too afraid to have their name &quot;like&quot;ing a post that talks about something so controversial. People really are that vain, unfortunately. People silence themselves because they have a public image and they want to avoid looking like a conspiracy theorist to everyone they know, so they leave you hanging even though they agree with you. Been there, done that. Reddit is much more receptive, and a much better use of time if you really want to wake people up. It&#39;s good you gave Facebook a try but it&#39;s a very alienating place to post to. Post on reddit instead, there&#39;s plenty of people willing to listen around here. Anonymity does wonder for allowing people to consider controversial ideas. That&#39;s been my experience, anyway.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s cool to be dumb&quot; &lt;-- I could kiss you for the sentence surrounding this point. It&#39;s also cool to be smart...but, like, &quot;smart&quot; as in &quot;I have a limited knowledge on many things&quot;; that is to say the over developed opinion from the under utilization of proper research methods...that too is extremely annoying. I&#39;d rather people say &#39;I cant comment because  I dont know enough on that&quot; rather than being like &quot;I saw it on the news and they had infographics which is like compartmentalized research and it&#39;s by my favourite reporter so It has to be real and correct&quot; <em>headdesk</em>. I say it all the time, because I hate having an opinion on things I dont know anything about, I feel like this is part of the anti intellectualism movement, make people accept small figments of information as totalisitc and avoid them developing a further sense of understanding and methods of understanding. They want us to learn in the very narrow sense of the term so that hidden totalitarianism is easily imprinted into us. It&#39;s sad to think so many people consider themselves highly intellectual because they can regurgitate facts in a trivia contest. I&#39;d rather say I dont know something then go and take the time to learn it, unfortunately by that point the person you wish to discuss things with is over it and not interested any more because something new to distract their short attention span has appeared.  </p>

<p>&quot;These students then inevitably become attached to this system that rewards them, so it effectively makes all the most intelligent students very pro-authority, pro-&quot;the system&quot;, because the system has always worked well for them.&quot; Fantastic point - have you watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDZFcDGpL4U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDZFcDGpL4U</a>?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have watched that, thanks for the video link, I&#39;d recommend anyone else watch it too, it&#39;s very good.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That is <em>so true</em> and so critical to this whole thing, thank you for adding it. I was thinking the same thing about a month ago, I&#39;d completely forgotten it. It&#39;s so true that the information we get is so piece-meal and isolated from context that it&#39;s hard to place. It&#39;s like if someone cut a picture in to a thousand pieces and blew them around in a whirlwind and we were left to figure out what the picture was by the random few pieces we grabbed.</p>

<p>The media doesn&#39;t want us to place things in a larger context, because the people who run the media don&#39;t benefit from that. The people who do real bad things, the people who pay the owners of the media to promote or hide certain stories, they hide in the shadows of the gaps between those bits of information, and like you said if it&#39;s not acceptable in society to read between the lines, then people will be purposefully blind to those shadows, which lets the powers that be continue getting away with the garbage that they do. They hide their misdeeds in the public ignorance they create.</p>

<p>The compartmentalization of information. Like every piece of info is in its own little isolated lock-box, and nothing between the lock-boxes is valid, because it hasn&#39;t been said by someone in a position of authority. They&#39;re too afraid to infer what&#39;s between the lock-boxes, because they&#39;ve been convinced that they are dumb and that critical thinking is a fools errand for their particular brain and/or they do not trust that information even <em>can</em> be inferred even in principle, that only given information is correct because it can be directly referenced back to an authoritative source. </p>

<p>Really it boils down to fear, a fear of trusting that you are a smart person who actually knows what you&#39;re talking about. Some people are just too afraid to take ownership for their own thoughts, so they out-source them to authority or society. Then they are easily manipulated and controlled, like puppets. It&#39;s really quite creepy how common this is, and how blindly people walk in to it. Because that&#39;s the only way to do it, blindly. If you see what is going on, you won&#39;t fall in to those traps. Which is why humans communicating with each other via the internet and exposing the truth to each other is so vitally important, it literally takes away the ability of people to control other people. If everyone knows how to control everyone, no one will be able to pull it off because everyone will be wise to it. That would be an awesome world to live in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries, It can also be very simply put - we need to fit their business models. Not the other way around. This is why im waiting for the fiat system to crash and bitcoin becoming the main source of (or any other non regulated) currency. Not for any other reason than deregulation! </p>

<p>&quot;The compartmentalization of information. Like every piece of info is in its own little isolated lock-box, and nothing between the lock-boxes is valid, because it hasn&#39;t been said by someone in a position of authority&quot; &lt;- yep yep yep yep yep yep. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not fear - it&#39;s actually far from it - It&#39;s loss. &#39;if I don&#39;t follow this path then what do I have?&quot;. Fear comes after loss (well If I dont have anything then I wont be anyone and able to do anything) Fear.  As humans who have learned to fully accept their own internal dialogue as supreme it becomes difficult to pry us away from it. Hence stubbornness. This is a major problem, the over focus on ourselves in part with the various issues mentioned in the other comments and in your beautifully put paragraphs. The root of all damage is the human condition to assume that our consciousness is the only one we need to consider given all other information is secondary to our internal voice. I think that is a major part of it as well and at least! </p>

<p>also : I think this satire is definitely worth posting here too! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nSjPdT788">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nSjPdT788</a></p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I find this funny, because I thought I was saying basically the opposite. That the root of all damage is the human condition to assume that your internal voice is secondary to the external voice of authority. </p>

<p>This is because authority convinced you so, thus disempowering you and making you a puppet of sorts. </p>

<p>Then once you become addicted to it, you have the fear (of loss, like you said) that keeps you in check. You don&#39;t know how to function without the authority, it&#39;s a crutch, so you can&#39;t leave it. And if you do, you must immediately replace it with another crutch. </p>

<p>But I think your statement has a lot of truth to it too. I&#39;m going to have to give this some pondering to reconcile the two because you bring up some very interesting points. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I pondered it some more. I think we are both right too. I see exactly what you mean now. Perhaps adults come to think that way because they consider themselves a part of an authority system that believes itself to be supreme. Like Christianity or American nationalism for example.  </p>

<p>So they may think &quot;I am Christian, therefore I am basically infallible.&quot; and trust their inner voice too much, and then expect the world to adapt to their every whim, like you said. </p>

<p>We all do this, to some degree. I do it with science, &quot;I know the science, therefore I am correct in this argument.&quot; is another ego-based idea that comes out of an over-adherence to an ideology, as if it were infallible.</p>

<p>If we cease clinging to all the various ideologies, we take on a more logically and emotionally neutral position. </p>

<p>Perhaps the bridge between our ideas is that they are both ideologies that we suffer by clinging to. Your example was the ideology of &quot;I (my inner voice) knows best&quot; and my example was the ideology of &quot;Authority knows best&quot;. These are both beliefs that someone or something knows best, and should always be trusted 100% of the time, which implies a bias or an ideology. A clinging to an un-truth, which produces mental disharmony in the long run.</p>

<p>So perhaps the takeaway lesson is that the root of all damage to the human condition is the over-reliance on ideologies. That seems like the common thread between our initial ideas.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The morality of individualism as being fundamental to liberty is the primary issue.  When you pick at or challenge one&#39;s conception of liberty, it is futile.  Even those who identify with the left in this country hold the ethic of &quot;personal responsibility&quot; above all else, it is even more paramount than a belief in god.  Thus, we don&#39;t even discuss HOW to get people what they need.  That discussion doesn&#39;t even begin to formulate.  It stops at SHOULD we get people what they need.  </p>

<p>80% of the world today lives on $10/day or less.  Ask those around you if that is a moral problem and see what kind of answers you get.  Today, we hear even leftist scholars time and time again saying things like &quot;somehow&quot; those who are victimized by the system are compelled to comply with it and support it, as if they are disillusioned critical mass.... As if they are millions of morons.  No.  The critical mass, even those who identify with the left, still equate individualism with liberty.  It is a corrosive lens to see the world through.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly right. And they don&#39;t want to think because they might discover the uncomfortable truth that the people in authority they were supposed to trust, have in fact been screwing them over this whole time. Then you have to go shopping for a new identity and find a new authority to trust and it&#39;s this huge mess. Some people would rather not go through that and instead go through a lifetime of denial. I personally don&#39;t get how so many people seem to have the stomach for that. But I guess it&#39;s easier to fool someone than convince them they&#39;ve been fooled, as Mark Twain said. Too many egos in the way that are too easily bruised, that&#39;s a lot of the problem. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re welcome. I agree on all points, especially the bit about being seen as overly critical, I have heard that many times. And being taught to be simple, that is a very good way to put it. We are taught to be simple, because then we&#39;re easier to deal with. It makes us more modular and replaceable, which serves the interests of capitalism, which serves the interests of all the CEOs and board members. &quot;Human Resources&quot; indeed, as if people were tradeable commodities like heads of cattle or printing machines. </p>

<p>It and Hegel&#39;s dialectic go hand in hand since not only is the spectrum of opinion limited but we&#39;re in most cases given two and only two &quot;sides to choose from&quot;, and then the &quot;lively debate&quot; (i.e. divisiveness, hate, vitriol, etc.) is artificially promoted between these two.</p>

I probably could have joined MENSA if they didn&#39;t have a yearly fee.  </p>

<p>Now I live in a world where (generally speaking) a credit score or a servile nature are more important than intelligence.  I certainly have a counter-culture lean in my political and religious beliefs.  However, I dislike &quot;the system&quot; not because I didn&#39;t succeed economically, but because I value truth and morality in a system populated by liars, manipulators and exploiters.  Being poor just makes that aspect much more visible.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, my own children, without regard to economics, will be held to very high standards of language, science, and logic and learn to base their philosophy on the very best principles human culture has to offer.  To do otherwise, I feel, would be wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re wrong in your belief that there&#39;s an anti intellectual feeling I&#39;m the US. People have been saying it for years, but it&#39;s just not true. Intelligence is highly valued, look at the popularity of things like Mythbusters (engineers), the cult of Neil degrass Tyson, movies about Steven Hawking, Elon Musk, the renewed emphasis on STEM, the decade of the brain, etc. </p>

<p>Sure, you also have stuff like honey boo boo, duck dynasty, etc. But remember that in general, people watch those to be entertained, not educated.</p>

<p>There has never been a time when intellectual discussion was as open and available as today. One reason is that, from a communication and discourse viewpoint, there is more of everything, both good and bad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The people you represent as intellectual champions are damaging because of the system used to promote their understanding. Poeple just tweet neil for lols, rather than taking in what he says and researching it to critical assess his level of correctness, steven hawking is represented as a &quot;human battler&quot; story, came from struggles to be the best, no one cares how accurate his math is, they just want to see when he&#39;s going to die and if he can beat Einstein. This is the point - what we (they) are lead to believe and quote are all trivia topic questions and the face of &quot;false intelligence&quot; you know about the person, you dont know what thye know though, you haven&#39;t put those hours in to study (unless you have) specifically what they know, you knowing their actions does not mean you are intelligent, it just means you can recall information about an individual - when people consider the latter over the former as being smart, you need to start questioning people understanding of information and how it works. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that they are &quot;pop&quot; science, and that not everyone has the desire nor wherewithal to learn and deeply examine the topics they are talking about, but that doesn&#39;t invalidate my claim. That&#39;s analogous to saying that a person is &quot;anti-sport&quot; if they only watch football/basketball/hockey/soccer/baseball but don&#39;t play themselves. They&#39;re not anti-sport, and I wouldn&#39;t call them &quot;asportical&quot; (a word I just made up to kind of mean ambivalent towards sports); they are pro-sport, and they express their pro-sportness by watching and admiring the players and games. </p>

<p>In anti-intellectual societies, people are outright repressed (and even killed) for simply being thought of as smart. Look at Cambodia/Khmer Rouge, the Spanish Civil War, or Mao&#39;s China for examples.</p>

<p>I think what you&#39;re actually talking about isn&#39;t anti-intellectualism, but is a lack of individual critical thinking. I agree 100% with that idea, but that&#39;s a different thing than anti-intellectualism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After taking the time to have a think, I see how you view anti-intellectualism. You seem to take the position (correct me if I&#39;m wrong) that anyone who is not repressed  from learning would therefore be intelligent. I disagree with that idea - on the very fact that we have an open internet to choose from a variety of sources to learn from, so many choose not to, or create their own false information simply due to opinion, brainwashing or ego (insert other well known reasons). Knowing and having information and applying it are two very different things. For example; it&#39;s an attack on intelligence if you sit there arguing against vaccinations[ given our society has survived quite well with their implementation] because of the available information which counters claims of autism development there are still people fighting to remove &quot;government genocide needles because mercury&quot;. </p>

<p>To fit my point into your model of argument, the anti-vaxxers dont want vaccination, that doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re anti science, they just dont want their kids to get autism from doctors with needles. Do you see my point? This is a choice people have made against the plethora of available information and it is completely and utterly damaging on both a progressive and physical level; kids have died because their parents tried to pray away the disease rather than taking them to a doctor. That, in it&#39;s own right, fronts the point that anti intellectualism isn&#39;t just an outcome of totalitarianism, but rather it&#39;s the outcome of choice and an environment in which those choices where made against a &quot;system which is developed to teach us and educate us...&quot; much of which is supported by government. Although intelligence has many facets and so on it&#39;s very clear that there are a plethora of examples (beyond the one that I have used) which result with the same detail, people believe things because they don&#39;t know how to know better due to the environments and conditions of their current surrounding and their up bringing, that to me is a very very real and scary form of anti intellectualism. I wonder what <a href="/u/magnora7">/u/magnora7</a> thinks on this point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I talked about this with a friend and we think you are basically correct, doomslothx. There&#39;s 2 kinds of anti-intellectualism that are being confused in this conversation. </p>

<p>There is the top-down kind that is applied by authority in a forceful manner by dictators and book burnings, that&#39;s one type. This is the type od_9 seems to be exclusively referring to. </p>

<p>The second type is the anti-intellectualism that pervades society and the culture at large, when people take it in to their own hearts to be against learning and knowledge. When that becomes the fashionable ideology, no force required. This is the more prevalent variety in America. </p>

<p>However they&#39;re obviously both important and pieces of the puzzle, and they&#39;re inter-related and depend on each other. And my original post was trying to address both of them simultaneously, not just exclusively the first type as od_9 seems to think. </p>

<p>And I think od_9&#39;s sports analogy is bad because people who idolize athletes actually follow the mechanics of sports. People who idolize Steven Hawkings and Einstein don&#39;t read his papers, which would be the analogous equivalent to watching a professional athlete play their sport. They idolize these scientists in a very superficial way. It&#39;s nice that these scientists are lauded, which shows there are definitely currents of pro-intellectualism in this country (of course), but that doesn&#39;t erase the fact that anti-intellectualism is still a startlingly common attitude among regular Americans. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, I agree with the point you bring up totally - and that is what I mean by the superficial ideology of people like NDT, how many people actually do physics because of him in ratio to the amount of people tweeting him for a response to be internet famous. The ratios by no means correlate to represent anti intellectualism, but it is a point to be made in regards to the analogy not being a valid point to make about the non existence of anti intellectualism simply because totalitarianism isn&#39;t involved - that being said I could easily argue that America is slowly, if not already, becoming a totalitarian nation.</p>

<p>You know, where intelligence these days is considered as a &quot;gamer girl&quot; writing on a piece of paper &quot; I need feminism because <em>insert some idiot statement which demoralizes the actual institution of feminism</em> and positing to social media which is protected by a mass of people who feel like anyone who wishes to criticise that statement is against the foundations of feminism, there is a lot to be answered for in regards to what intelligence is compared to what it is considered and how that gap was created!
 It doesn&#39;t make sense to me in regards to the form point (to extrapolate the example) when the foundations of feminism is to question the function of feminism and how it can be improved to establish proper moral equality rather than the domination of men to predispose superiority! </p>

<p>Further to that I think those who are under totalitarian rule want to learn more than those who are not (which to me creates a gradient which leads to a more common ideal of truth) which is where my point of concern lies also. Those that do not have access to information will fight for it - rather than argue two sides of a mute point and ignore the remaining details which seem to &quot;bore&quot; them. Like food, those that do not have it want it so much more than those who can get it without even a thought.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I grew up in Oklahoma and I live in Texas. I was forced by my parents to go to church every sunday for 18 years. Anti-intellectualism is very real in this country. Many people don&#39;t like to learn, and they hate being shown wrong, even with the gentlest intent. And they&#39;re supported publicly in this pursuit, as if their ignorance was a baby that needed protecting. Hurt feelings are seen as far more important to avoid than poor reasoning. Short-term over long term. That sort of thing. This all leads to a natural hatred of people who know more than you, especially if you have a complex about being stupid, which is instilled in to many people by the terrible design of our school systems. Once you get beaten down enough, you just accept you are stupid and come to hate anything &quot;smart&quot;. Many people have had this experience going through the school system, and I think it&#39;s a large part of what fuels anti-intellectualism. </p>

<p>Also rural areas tend to be more anti-intellectual, as if it were a value. Probably because most of them are religious and it actually <em>is</em> a value to unquestionably believe what you&#39;re told by authority, which is an anti-intellectual proposition by its nature. </p>

<p>I grew up in the Northern Virginia suburbs and I&#39;ve remained close to academics and professionals most of my life, so my experience has been very different than yours. When I was in school, intelligence was highly valued, and students (nearly all of them) tried to be seen as intelligent, even if that demonstration was via slacking off (this was the late 80&#39;s/early 90&#39;s). I&#39;m not saying what you experienced isn&#39;t real (and neither is my experience), but it&#39;s not the whole of America. There&#39;s a huge difference between the coasts and the center of the country. I&#39;m not saying anti-intellectualism doesn&#39;t exist, but I think it&#39;s not as widespread as people believe. Ignorance and stupidity, though, are rampant, but that really is a different thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a side effect of multiculturalism. In order to include blacks in the education system, even though blacks are 15 IQ points below whites, the education system itself must be dumbed down. Hispanics are only 5 or 10 IQ points below whites, but they too degrade the system when they flood into it in large numbers.</p>

<p>Notice how multiculturalism is pushed into our faces every day -- all the mixed race couples in advertisements, in television shows, in movies. Notice how black culture is pushed in the media as somehow cool or desirable, even though it is pathetically vulgar and childish. </p>

<p>However, black culture suits the corps selling products very nicely because they don&#39;t want people to intellectually examine their purchases. Also, a dumbed down population suits the politicians because it can be more easily manipulated. The Democratic Party is determined to flood America with non-whites, because they know those non-whites will be dependent on government aid and will vote Democrat forever to keep getting that aid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mainstream black culture is interesting. I was having a conversation with my black friend a few days ago and we were agreeing that it&#39;s so stereotypically low-brow in terms of how childish and vulgar it is, especially over the last 20 years. It has morphed in to a commercialized commercialized thing, BET and black radio and so on. It&#39;s no longer underground, raw, and communicative of the black experience like it was in the 80s and early 90s. It&#39;s like the most simplistic and lowest-common-denomentator artists are featured nowadays, by extremely commercialized record labels run by white guys. </p>

<p>I think that&#39;s just because it&#39;s the easiest way to sell products; it keeps black people buying those sneakers or those cars or those clothes or that jewelry or whatever, and wearing it as a status symbol, instead of building wealth in a more lasting and meaningful way, like paying off debt. Prioritizing the short-term over the long-term.</p>

<p>This is a result of consumerism, not multiculturalism. To say it&#39;s a result of multiculturism makes the false assumption that blacks just <em>are</em> like MSM black culture, and that it accurately represents them. Yet if you talk to many black people, they often do not feel this way, they feel mischaracterized and that it showcases a false image of black people to white america, who then comes away with racist opinions about how terrible blacks are. But also they don&#39;t like it because it teaches <em>black america</em> bad values that actually become a part of the culture. Many elderly black men talk about this. </p>

<p>Divide and conquer, my friend. It keeps black people who buy in to this MSM culture in a consumerist, statist, pro-&quot;status quo&quot;, anti-intellectual mindset, and it keeps white people hating black people (or this cartoonish corporate mischaracterization of them that they are confusing with the actual black people who live in America). It&#39;s a win/win from a political/corporate viewpoint to push things like BET. It&#39;s like inception in to the mind of black America, planting ideas about their culture from the inside, and they think they thought of them, but they&#39;re really just corporate ideas. It&#39;s a false mask. Divide and conquer. </p>

<p>This is a subtle conversation that&#39;s hard to have because of immediate cries of &quot;racism&quot; from people who are offended because that&#39;s how they&#39;ve been programmed to feel, it&#39;s a way of cordoning off certain topics in the public conversation.  When I scanned your post the first time, my immediate reaction was to consider you a potential racist, and I&#39;m sure many here did the same (judging by your vote count) even though what you said wasn&#39;t particularly overtly racist or anything. It just &quot;sounds&quot; racist. It&#39;s just programmed in to us by our culture in this era to respond that way to anything even remotely regarding anything important related to race, so that people don&#39;t wake up to this whole divide and conquer thing they&#39;ve got going on in regards to black America. Another way to maintain the status quo. </p>

<p>On the next topic, I also agree with what you&#39;ve said with the democrats dragging people from other countries in to America. That ALSO serves corporate interests, because those people can get work visas, like the H1-B visa, and then they will take jobs below minimum wage, where they cannot quit because their visa depends on it! They are basically slaves. This obviously serves corporate interests because it lowers the price of labor, and it hurts everyone else who already lives in America and is looking for a decent-paying job. The democrat party post-Carter is owned by corporations, just like the republican party has been since Reagan (at least). So of course the democrats are going to serve corporate interests. And they can conveniently hide behind the shield of &quot;well that&#39;s racism!&quot; if anyone says that maybe bringing in a million immigrants all at once to do jobs for super cheap is a bad idea. So it works out well for the corporations, which works out well for the democrats. </p>

<p>So you see... this twisted multiculturalism you bemoan is actually a side effect of corporatism! A side effect of our corporatocracy, and our media being controlled by corporations. So do not bemoan the multitude of cultures blending in to one, instead bemoan the corporations who have ruined our culture, media, and government, and used the idea of the blending of cultures as an shield to hide behind as they commit bad deeds. </p>

<p>That ended up being extremely long, but it&#39;s a delicate point and I wanted to make it correctly. </p>

<p>tl;dr - Multicultralism isn&#39;t bad, corporations and corrupt governments running everything is bad, which gives multiculturalism the appearance of being bad because it gets used and abused by them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the long and thoughtful reply. We&#39;ll have to disagree. I have come to realize very clearly that multiculturalism is wholly destructive, and it is weapon that has been deliberately used by the ruling elite to destroy American culture and cultural values. It will soon rip America to pieces. It has never worked and can never work because it is contrary to human nature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mainstream black culture is interesting. I was having a conversation with my black friend a few days ago and we were agreeing that it&#39;s so stereotypically low-brow in terms of how childish and vulgar it is, especially over the last 20 years. It has morphed in to a commercialized commercialized thing, BET and black radio and so on. It&#39;s no longer underground, raw, and communicative of the black experience like it was in the 80s and early 90s. It&#39;s like the most simplistic and lowest-common-denomentator artists are featured nowadays, by extremely commercialized record labels run by white guys. </p>

<p>I think that&#39;s just because it&#39;s the easiest way to sell products; it keeps black people buying those sneakers or those cars or those clothes or that jewelry or whatever, and wearing it as a status symbol, instead of building wealth in a more lasting and meaningful way, like paying off debt. Prioritizing the short-term over the long-term.</p>

<p>This is a result of consumerism, not multiculturalism. To say it&#39;s a result of multiculturism makes the false assumption that blacks just <em>are</em> like MSM black culture, and that it accurately represents them. Yet if you talk to many black people, they often do not feel this way, they feel mischaracterized and that it showcases a false image of black people to white america, who then comes away with racist opinions about how terrible blacks are. But also they don&#39;t like it because it teaches <em>black america</em> bad values that actually become a part of the culture. Many elderly black men talk about this. </p>

<p>Divide and conquer, my friend. It keeps black people who buy in to this MSM culture in a consumerist, statist, pro-&quot;status quo&quot;, anti-intellectual mindset, and it keeps white people hating black people (or this cartoonish corporate mischaracterization of them that they are confusing with the actual black people who live in America). It&#39;s a win/win from a political/corporate viewpoint to push things like BET. It&#39;s like inception in to the mind of black America, planting ideas about their culture from the inside, and they think they thought of them, but they&#39;re really just corporate ideas. It&#39;s a false mask. Divide and conquer. </p>

<p>This is a subtle conversation that&#39;s hard to have because of immediate cries of &quot;racism&quot; from people who are offended because that&#39;s how they&#39;ve been programmed to feel, it&#39;s a way of cordoning off certain topics in the public conversation.  When I scanned your post the first time, my immediate reaction was to consider you a potential racist, and I&#39;m sure many here did the same (judging by your vote count) even though what you said wasn&#39;t particularly overtly racist or anything. It just &quot;sounds&quot; racist. It&#39;s just programmed in to us by our culture in this era to respond that way to anything even remotely regarding anything important related to race, so that people don&#39;t wake up to this whole divide and conquer thing they&#39;ve got going on in regards to black America. Another way to maintain the status quo. </p>

<p>On the next topic, I also agree with what you&#39;ve said with the democrats dragging people from other countries in to America. That ALSO serves corporate interests, because those people can get work visas, like the H1-B visa, and then they will take jobs below minimum wage, where they cannot quit because their visa depends on it! They are basically slaves. This obviously serves corporate interests because it lowers the price of labor, and it hurts everyone else who already lives in America and is looking for a decent-paying job. The democrat party post-Carter is owned by corporations, just like the republican party has been since Reagan (at least). So of course the democrats are going to serve corporate interests. And they can conveniently hide behind the shield of &quot;well that&#39;s racism!&quot; if anyone says that maybe bringing in a million immigrants all at once to do jobs for super cheap is a bad idea. So it works out well for the corporations, which works out well for the democrats. </p>

<p>So you see... this twisted multiculturalism you bemoan is actually a side effect of corporatism! A side effect of our corporatocracy, and our media being controlled by corporations. So do not bemoan the multitude of cultures blending in to one, instead bemoan the corporations who have ruined our culture, media, and government, and used the idea of the blending of cultures as an shield to hide behind as they commit bad deeds. </p>

<p>That ended up being extremely long, but it&#39;s a delicate point and I wanted to make it correctly. </p>

<p>tl;dr - Multicultralism isn&#39;t bad, corporations and corrupt governments running everything is bad, which gives multiculturalism the appearance of being bad because it gets used and abused by them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont have it hard, I just understand this world isn&#39;t fair - and I want to change that! I have great parents, they are conservative yes (also I was a typical kid, misbehaving and so forth like most... my poor parents haha!), but none the less they love the life out of me! I dont want you to think my parents beat me, or I had a crappy upbringing because of them. They did what they could in a world made to suppress survival for those that do not conform :( 
 My statement about my minute worth was for impact. WHy should my minutes, seconds, hours be valued by a dollar mark? How is that ok? It&#39;s not, whether you are a wealthy CEO or a janitor. We are not pay checks , nor should we be living our lives earning pay checks. Deregulate the monetary system! Thanks for your honest sympathy though, I think I&#39;d like you if we met in person! </p>

<p>The algae in a three-toed sloths fur supplements the diet of the sloth. This algae growth would not be possible without the help of a species of moth which lays eggs in the sloths fur! Woah!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, I agree with the point you bring up totally - and that is what I mean by the superficial ideology of people like NDT, how many people actually do physics because of him in ratio to the amount of people tweeting him for a response to be internet famous. The ratios by no means correlate to represent anti intellectualism, but it is a point to be made in regards to the analogy not being a valid point to make about the non existence of anti intellectualism simply because totalitarianism isn&#39;t involved - that being said I could easily argue that America is slowly, if not already, becoming a totalitarian nation.</p>

<p>You know, where intelligence these days is considered as a &quot;gamer girl&quot; writing on a piece of paper &quot; I need feminism because <em>insert some idiot statement which demoralizes the actual institution of feminism</em> and positing to social media which is protected by a mass of people who feel like anyone who wishes to criticise that statement is against the foundations of feminism, there is a lot to be answered for in regards to what intelligence is compared to what it is considered and how that gap was created!
 It doesn&#39;t make sense to me in regards to the form point (to extrapolate the example) when the foundations of feminism is to question the function of feminism and how it can be improved to establish proper moral equality rather than the domination of men to predispose superiority! </p>

<p>Further to that I think those who are under totalitarian rule want to learn more than those who are not (which to me creates a gradient which leads to a more common ideal of truth) which is where my point of concern lies also. Those that do not have access to information will fight for it - rather than argue two sides of a mute point and ignore the remaining details which seem to &quot;bore&quot; them. Like food, those that do not have it want it so much more than those who can get it without even a thought.  </p>
