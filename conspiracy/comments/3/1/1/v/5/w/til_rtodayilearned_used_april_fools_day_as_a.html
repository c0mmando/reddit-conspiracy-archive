       Okay I'm not against the sub here, but what it sounds like you're doing is railing against a platform of speech from within a subdividion of the same platform. Are you suggesting this sub is somehow immune to the otherwise pervasive censorship here?

       Admins have full control obviously. Mods everywhere can be compromised. The difference between this sub and the rest of reddit is that users come here because the degree of nonsense in all other large subreddits has forced us to deal with the slightly smaller amount of nonsense here.

       Isn't that what TIL, Worldnews and world politics are doing though? Claiming a questionable high ground of truthiness meanwhile censoring and editing anything that doesn't confirm their world view?

       Not certain what you mean here. I see a lot of posts here complaining "My post was deleted from subreddit X". However, I have yet to see a case where this wasn't because the post breached that subreddit's rules. For instance,
       <a href="/r/TIL">
        /r/TIL
       </a>
       very clearly states, "No news" and "No recent politics."
       <a href="/r/worldness">
        /r/worldness
       </a>
       prohibits US news, editorialized titles and blogspam. Enforcing these certainly doesn't count as "censoring anything that doesn't confirm their world view."
      </p>
      <p>
       If you mean something else, however, I apologize and would need more specifics.

       It is, evidently.  This is no stretch of logic.  Do you think that one person implemented it?  An authority figure of the subreddit making such an action does so representing all of the others.

       It is a continuation of the  known CIA op to have people associate conspiracy as a pejorative.  It worked and now people have an irrational emotional reaction to just hearing the word "conspiracy".  They want to see themselves as part of the "normal group", so they attempt to convince others to go along with them and you end up with groupthink.
      </p>
      <p>
       The funny thing is that CIA op that I mentioned?  It is well-known to the public, yet people still continue the behavior in spite of being told they have been psychologically manipulated by their own government.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the government manipulates you, tells you it has done so, and and your response is to double-down on the behavior that they manipulated you to do?...  keep telling us all how smart you are.

       I'm not being a hater, simply asking you to prove that something you think is true. So, at the last time of asking, you got anything? Otherwise its pretty safe to assume that this is simply a fantasy of yours.

       But that's the thing, there are so many rules that mods can remove just about anything because it's "against the rules". That's how they censor, and people just accept it because it's in the rules.

       I fully expect that I will be downvoted, because I come from TIL, but the larger a subreddit gets, the more nonsense it gets.  And the more it needs 'rules' to keep it on the track it is intended to be on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether it's mods' nonsense, an individual user's nonsense, community nonsense - anything that's grown big enough in an online environment will ultimately need to have some things done that piss off some group, in order for it to not devolve into a complete clusterfuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering how much shit we get from people who 'come from' this subreddit, I am only apologetic to a point that you're unhappy about what we chose to do for this year's theme.

       Yes, I don't like the idea that it could serve to marginalize conspiracies, but please don't act as if people from the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       camp didn't bring it to their own house with the way our community and mods are treated in TIL.

       I agree that some posters here are ridiculous...but don't you find it somewhat childish to have a hobby of mocking people online that think differently than you? And no...I don't see how ironic it is, because calling somebody with a big ego out that belittles people here is not the same as claiming I am in ANY way superior to anybody. Not sure why you would take it that way. I just want a place thats not heavily censored, doesn't tow the company line, and has a collection of people with different perspectives having an open forum of discussion. I don't come here thinking I'm some enlightened person mocking the "sheeple"...so when I see people come in here (multiple times a day, multiple people a day) that make fun of this sub and some of its users...its just annoying. Probably because of the nature of this sub...I guess that's what comes with the territory when you let everyone speak their mind. On subs like SRS, you poke fun at someone? BANNED immediately...or most subs for that matter. It's just that people like you detract from the better parts of this sub, and bring it down...all because you have a tendency to make fun of other people instead of just carrying on and realizing there's people out there that see things differently from you.

       Your comment added nothing to the discussion and essentially shit on close to 300,000 people, describing them all as nuts incapable of reason.  Think whatever you want but if you want to post here it's possible to do it without being a douchebag and without just blanket insulting thousands of people.

      <p>
       If that's too tough for you to manage then perhaps another sub would be a better fit for you.  Hell, why would you want to visit a place where the people are "completely nuts"?

       I'm sure you can see that there is a difference between "disagreement" (i.e. "I don't agree with you and here's why") and "this sub sucks and everyone on it are morons and crazy people", without any sort of point beyond that.
      </p>
      <p>
       You in all likelihood aren't aware of the number of attacks this sub is subject to.  If we allowed everyone to come in here and shit on the sub and its users (while not even bothering to address the OP or attempt to make a coherent point), then every single thread here would be full of comments like that (they already are to some extent, even with the rules in place).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry that you're being denied the right to blanket insult hundreds of thousands of people while dismissing all of their opinions as quackery with a condescending wave of your hand (I don't mean
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       specifically here of course).
      </p>

       If members of this sub wanted to be insulted, they could just go to any of the defaults and post their opinions and let the downvotes and insults come flooding in.

       only the shit that get's censored and blacked out there is quickly removed from here too by the moderators, who then go back to their work of banning people and stickying nazi apologist interviews and holocaust denial videos, and what not.

       yes, I could, but it might get me shadowbanned or harassed - remember that thing a couple months back about that creepy place that people talked about and got harassed for and threatened for even mentioning or
       <em>
        having their uname in the thread
       </em>
       ?

      <p>
       That one, where the admins blacked it all out, cut it all off the website, and then the mods here followed their lead and did the same thing. There are a lot of things you can't talk about here, but by talking about them, I'd bring that down on me(and I have in the past).

       It did, for as long as it was allowed. The admins eventually instructed the mods to remove it, a result of hyperbolic complaints from users with a known vendetta against the sub and its suers. If the mods did not give in to the demands of the admins with this or any other issue, they would risk having the sub banned entirely, or at minimum being removed as moderators and replaced by other mods who are likely hostile to the community. The admins rarely do this, however when they do it's probably better to go along with it and inform the community immediately afterward, rather than to risk losing the community as a whole.

       You can talk about it all you want, you just can't post details about the place unfortunately, even if it is publicly available information. Certain others, in other subs, complained that those 'investigating' the matter were overstepping their bounds and 'harassing' others, which is nonsense when looked at objectively. However, as the mods were told to remove the content, they had no choice but to do so, or they would risk losing the sub entirely and having the admins remove it themselves anyway.

       At times, there can be a fine line between moderating and censorship, unfortunately. As much as I dislike much of the material you referenced, I would hesitate to remove it myself out of concerns of censorship, though agree it should have never been added to the sidebar nor endorsed in any capacity.

       The last thing I'd expect to be called is a "shill". I've been posting here for years, was trolled relentlessly in the past for that very reason to extent of being stalked and receiving death threats, have done nothing defend his sub in the past only to be ridiculed repeatedly, was a mod here at one point, and continue to post content and discuss topics regularly most people on reddit wouldn't even touch, let alone anything an actual shill would post.
      </p>
      <p>
       If serious, you seem to suggest anyone who happens to disagree with your opinion on certain content is a "shill" and thus opposed to the sub by default, which you and I know is complete and utter bullshit. I'm beginning to suspect your accusation, if literal, may in fact be a form of projection, a tactic used to draw attention away from
       <a href="https://prod01-cdn00.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2014/02/deception_p48.png">

       and no one called you a shill, you are over-personalizing everything and misrepresenting reality to suit yourself on a personal level or to detract from the logic in everything that I say, maybe that's why you were called a shill before, I don't know but I don't want to get into the "whys" of your life story with you. You certainly do try to detract from the actual issues being discussed and try to drag the conversation to a personal level all the time - every time you post - which is what shills do.

       Says the guy who is acting like this is all some innocent joke as if this event happened in an isolated vacuum and not as a part of a MUCH larger narrative. A narrative that has shown this website doing everything in its power to condition the masses through manufactured consensus while simultaneously making an organized effort to marginalize anyone who thinks outside of this or dares to challenge it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, you're right, lets just look at this event from the most shallow angle possible. While in a conspiracy subreddit.

       I think the point is that I'm sure the propaganda in WW2 was considered  just "gags" as well to the general population. To think that it is absurd to question the reasoning behind it just means it's working. :)

       It looks to me as more of an attempt to mock conspiracy theorists and paint all conspiracies as bullshit and those that believe them as nuts. Considering how many conspiracy theories have actually turned out to be true it doesn't seem like it should be a joking manner. Just think if this happened a decade ago the sub would be full of comments about mass surveillance and implying how stupid anyone is for thinking that exists; or if this happened even longer ago we'd all be nuts for thinking the government secretly doses prisoners and college students with LSD to attempt mind control or pays major journalists to spin the news... All of which turned out to be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, sure it's just a joke but it is marginalizing and downplaying a very significant and not at all understood topic. And I think there is reason behind it, not just to be
       <em>
        funny
       </em>
       .

       A lot of new accounts posting nonsense as well.  It's presented as a joke,  but there are a lot of people new to reddit who may not be exposed to some of the more plausible conspiracies yet, and buy right into the "conspiracy theorists are nuts,  they believe in lizards lol".

       Every single day TIL has a post about the holocaust or Nazis or Hitler. It's one of their most popular topics on that sub. It's an effective method to keep people supporting Israel by reinforcing the idea that the holocaust was purely an attack on Jewish people and that Israel has to defend itself from haters.

       damn i thought the discussion here was about r/todayilearned not about r/worldnews its not an us vs them mentality its a question everything that someone tells or shows you hell even question me because I might be a clever shill to move you away from the important information please dont get stuck on trying to be right because at the end of the day its up to individual to decide on whats right or wrong because we got to concieve the inconcievealble and the only way to do that is to concieve that there are inconcievable things and again question this no matter how certain it might be because i might be wrong

       Well if you did something like copypaste what you think are stupid statements - like social justice warrior statements - where their pasting would be roughly appropriate then people would associate these statements with the stereotypical conspiracy statement that follows it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this also works in the reverse direction.  People will be staying away from TIL because they will not want their usual opportunistic karma whoring posts being made equivalent to the stereotypical conspiracy theory statement that follows it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example:   "I oh so agree you guys!   This [douchebag fact] is awesome! ...[insert stereotypical conspiracy quote]

       You would see how this would make some users paranoid? Especially since we deal with shadowbans all the time. Especially when most of the time this sub takes itself seriously and actually ttries to get useful information out there. By the sound of it and the looks of it its just tactics to discredit this sub and its ideas. Text book.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah I get its jokes but why \conspiracy? The main spirit of the sub is to question everything. Y'all playing a useless game and making reddit insufferable

       I'm not going to go deep digging...but there was several threads about male victims of abuse, and how it was more prevalent than female abuse...several of them, thousands of upvotes over several days. The SJW mods deleted them, making up some bullshit excuse that had nothing to do with the rules there. It was big on

       I care about the broader effects this can have on people who may be interested or would like to 'wake up' but will turn the other way because of the ridicule. After all if the majority is having a laugh at the tinfoil hats, you wouldn't want to belong to the latter.

       Just because people believe in some things out of the typical mass media narrative, that makes them a group worth lumping together and making judgements about?
      </p>
      <p>
       You also mentioned how we chose to be a part of this community- this sub or the "conspiracy community"? Either way, is having beliefs really a choice? Wouldn't choosing your beliefs make them insincere? Can we make sweeping judgements about Christians, Muslims and Jews because they all, daily, reaffirm their conscious choice of religion?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your logic is incredibly shaky. I would also agree with you on a certain level, there is no conspiracy community in the real world being marginalized. There are groups that use the term "conspiracy theorist" to discredit people trying to expose information harmful to their interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       And using that type of logic to come into this sub and shout at the users about how they are overly paranoid just like the classic caricature of a theorist goes and it's "just April Fools!"? Ridiculous. People try to derail discussions in this sub daily. The CIA literally launched a psyop based on using that term to discredit people.

       People lump groups together all the time. You don't have a problem lumping together "Democrats", "Republicans", "politicians", or "Jews" (a favorite around here), so why shouldn't anybody else lump you guys together?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone making fun of a group as a whole is going to make the undecided less likely to go to that group. If an undecided voter hears somebody say something bad about Republicans, then that voter is slightly less likely to vote Republican. You guys have no problem lumping non-conspiracy theorists together and making fun of them, making an undecided person less likely to want to be in the in the insulted group. It should work the other way around. Get a sense of humor.

       Jews are a relatively small and close-knit community with very strong beliefs on the Holocaust and Israel (the context in which they're discussed in this sub). I do not condone generalizations, but they make more sense in situations like this.

       Have you ever heard of the self-hating Jew? American Jews are liberal and are arguably less supportive of Israel than conservative Christians. Calling them a small and close-knit community is an amazingly wrong generalization that shows that you know very little about them while you also probably dislike them.

       I do not. I specifically said I do not condone generalizations. If you spent more time on this sub, you'd realize people are actually referring to neo-conservative hardline Jews/Israelis. A very generalizable population based on their political views, correct?

       Your comments aren't actually being edited. Look at them in your (or anyones) user profile and they all appear untampered with. My guess is they're using JS/CSS to
       <strong>
        append
       </strong>
       the anti-conspiracy stuff. Try disabling subreddit specific styles or using noscript and see what happens.

       Me and nix0n have the final say, I suppose after the admins in reality, and we both grew it from a little seed to what it is today.  If either of us thought there was anything off about how it was modded we would handle it.
