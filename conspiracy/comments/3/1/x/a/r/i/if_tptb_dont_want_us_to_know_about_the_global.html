    <div class="md"><p>why would they want people to know? Wouldn&#39;t they prefer to keep the whole program a secret, keeping tabs on people in secret while catching dissenters?  I just don&#39;t buy the theory that the government would want people to know.  I mean it&#39;s not like there have been major protests over it in the US, but in places like Germany, there is certainly a huge distrust that has formulated against the US government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it&#39;s really too bad.  Looking into how much power the government really has, it does make you feel helpless.  Want to start a protest?  The govt can organize a black-bloc like false flag giving them pretense to use lethal force.  Want to write an article or book exposing these types of actions? The govt. has all your information and has the upper-hand with the existential threat of blackmail.  Not affected by the blackmail?  The govt. can employ (GCHQ) agents (shills) to discredit and completely undermine your work and ruin your brand.  Still not dissuaded by the govt&#39;s efforts?  You might end up like Michael Hastings. Want to vote in someone like Rand Paul?  Susceptibility of electric ballot hacking is a very prominent issue... It&#39;s disgusting, the US is truly a shell of what they once were, 40 or 50 years ago.</p>

<p>And for those that are scared at those things - continue to be scared and remain in a state of stasis. That&#39;s what <strong>they want</strong>. There are other ways to try and become independent of the system and gain traction and begin a Movement. You just gotta think outside the box.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Snowden really was a fugitive and a threat to actual Homeland Security, there would be very little chance we had ever known about him let alone his (selected) leaks be plastered all over the MSM broadcasts and popular Internet media. Let alone allow him to give television interviews, film (an Oscar winning) documentary, and appear at various public teleconferences. Many whistle-blowers are met with smear campaigns (Manning, Webb, Edmonds off top of my head) but Snowden seems to be a hero. </p>

<p>Greenwald, Poitras, and the Intercept crew would all be held/extradited for conspiracy with a felon and cyberterrorist (by recent definitions). Snowden shouldn&#39;t have been able to camp out in Sheremetyevo international airport for days without being touched by anyone. </p>

<p>Pure speculation on my part but the whole thing is fishy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What ever happened to that realistic dystopian movie being made about what the U.S. might look like in the event of a total crack down?</p>

<p>Point: I&#39;m guessing that Citizen Four is not a big deal because not enough people are aware of surveillance or think &quot;I&#39;m not doing anything wrong, I don&#39;t have to worry.&quot;.  On the other hand, a dystopian movie that instills real fear of what the government COULD do is actually a real concern for the power system.  If its a real threat, you&#39;ll know because it will be physically attacked or taken out of commission.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To say that Snowden was a calculated move on part of TPTB is a fairly bold suggestion. But it isn&#39;t completely unfounded either.
False flag cases have been sited throughout history. While I&#39;m inclined to think that the Snowden episode was genuine, it would also stand to reason that it was a false flag. And this, following a series of alleged false flags, would only connect dots for a much larger picture. However the real concern here isn&#39;t with placing blame. It is to look at this as a whole. Is there anyone who truly believes the world gov&#39;s are not capable of what they have been accused of? I&#39;m sure they are. In fact, I&#39;m in a unique enough position to be fairly certain that they are.
With that being said, we need to look at this from a different angle. Wether we realize it or not, CEO has become a political party. Companies are buying political power. Does it not benefit Google, Apple, and Yahoo to collect data for the gov&#39;t? Of course it does. Why would you not want to gather information about your target market? And to do so knowing you have protection from the highest authority?
Private companies, with virtually unlimited resources, are funding our current gov&#39;t. And that&#39;s the bottom line. I, personally, don&#39;t think that the issues are unrelated. The gov&#39;t is collecting all sorts of data by means of the private sector because they have the legal authority, and the private sector has the means.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are these rhetorical questions?  For the first one, no, it didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Second one, more awareness, skepticism and cynicism in the general public towards our government.  More of a distrust in countries that are potential allies... (Brazil, Germany).  </p>

<p>Three: Most of his leaks weren&#39;t unknown to some.  But the leaks confirmed the beliefs on paper, so there is no plausible deniability.
Also, IMO, the JTRIG, GCHQ revelations were the biggest ones.  Taxpayer dollars literally going to pay government agents who&#39;s job it is to literally shill, for multinational corporations and the government.  I now read comments, articles with much more skepticism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO because they don&#39;t give a shit. How many security holes have been patched on account of Snowden&#39;s revelations? Who even remembers the details? It&#39;s impossible, anyway. All the chips are corrupted. There&#39;s plenty of legacy/undocumented circuitry just sitting there, &quot;redundant&quot;. It&#39;s extraordinarily difficult to reverse-engineer microchips based on physical examination.</p>

<p>If the NSA or the Chinese or whoever wants to log into your computer to see what you&#39;re doing, they can.</p>

<p>The only protection, really, is that this can&#39;t be revealed, so unless you&#39;re doing something that actually threatens them, you won&#39;t hear or know about it. It&#39;s not something that is shared with the ordinary police.</p>
