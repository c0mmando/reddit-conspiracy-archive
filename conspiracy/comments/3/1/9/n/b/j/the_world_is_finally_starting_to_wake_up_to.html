       Finally, after more than a century, people are waking up to the filthy propaganda that Zionism protrays.

       I think the negotiations with Iran are the biggest step towards countering the influence of Zionism the world has yet seen.

       Israel is one of the first things that lead me to learning about media manipulation and propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember hearing a story on the news (NPR) about a bomb being dropped on a house in gaza to take out a Fatah leader.  Apparently the bomb had also leveled mutliple other houses and killed several women and children.  I remember realizing how unjust that was- to target one person to assassination in a manner that hurt so many others.  I thought about it for a few minutes and realized that perhaps hurting the women and children WAS calculated (rather than the mistake they were claiming) to increase tensions and act as punishment of the community that was protecting the guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       With these thoughts dancing in my head, I later that day heard the same story on another news channel (CBS radio, I believe), only this time, the deaths of the women and children weren't even mentioned, and the perpetrators seemed to be being lauded as heroic in their action- which I'd basically already concluded was unjust.  In this story, the focus was on the supposed crimes of the arab target.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was shocked that the "news" could seek to manipulate perspective in such a way, through blatant omission of facts and spin.  I started to pay attention to how the palestinian israeli conflict was treated by the media.  I picked up some Chomsky and read Edward Said's Question of Palestine.
      </p>
      <p>
       It suddenly became very clear. And I am someone who has grown up in jewish communities with many jewish family and friends.  This weekend, I'll be celebrating both passover and easter.  I think there is value to the religion and the culture, but there IS an embedded tendency in it to claim persecution as justification for unjust actions, and the proclivity for obfuscating the injustice of the actions.  The mantra of persecution and subconscious understanding of the inherent dishonesty and injustice is what leads to the anxiety and neurosis so pervasive in the culture.

       As an American, I am
       <strong>
        NOT
       </strong>
       "okay" with that - nor am I okay our invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan under false pretenses, or with the fucked up policy of drone strikes that kill so many innocents, or our NASTY habit of meddling in the affairs of other countries, plotting coups, fomenting discord and so-called "civil wars" for the sake of corporate interests or to please some other "shitty little country".
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many, MANY people who hate the USA, and who hate ME because I am an American. We like to call these people "Terrorists
       <sup>
        <sup>
         TM
        </sup>
       </sup>
       ", but he cold truth is that, in the vast majority of cases, there is a REASON the US is hated - and it stems from the shit we do and the way we treat others. It has little to do with religion or "Jihad" or such bullshit - these are just banners under those which we have abused join together in united opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same goes for Israel. They are not hated
       <em>
        because they are Jews
       </em>
       , rather, like the US, they are hated because of the abuses they perpetrate against others.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an American, I condemn the policies and activities that CREATE enemies for the US and, by extension, for me. If I were Jewish or Israeli, I would equally condemn the policies and behaviors of my leaders, and for the same reason.

       You do realize that we absolutely did NOT have to drop those bombs, right? The war had already been won and we were in close negotiations with Japan on signing a peace treaty. All of the scientists on the Manhattan Project, including Einstein, along with top officials in the government and military warned Truman not to drop them, but his trusty Zionist assistants and advisors persuaded him to end the lives of countless innocent civilians. With your logic, wouldn't it be fair for our innocent civilians to be nuked at the expense of our government's evil doings? No. Just as they did NOT deserve to die. And if you want to throw the "6 million" Jews who were killed in the holocaust as a reasoning, it's actually below 2 million now and that's including the other minorities who were killed during WWII. What about the 100 million Native Americans that we slaughtered by establishing our "wonderful" nation. Stop looking at one side of the picture.

       Its not that the war was won. Its was a statement to the soviets, who we knew was our ally at the time, then immediate adversary after the war ended.  The Soviets were invading japan in the north, they had crushed all resistance in china and were about to take the pacific as their version of satellite states if they won.  The US had fire-bombed/killed all living people in 45 major cities prior to the nuking using the island hopping strategy to get ever closer strategic bombing airfields on mainland japan...the japanese leadership really didn't care all that much during the nukings.  At first it wasn't even clear to them military leadership that it was a nuke, since they weren't aware/pursing that line of research, secondly they had already lost 45 cities and adding another to the list wasn't really that exceptional...after the second bombing they knew it was different, but from their perspective...you can't stop either so whats the difference between a single bomb incinerating a city and 200 bombers destroying a city ..plus we actually didnt have anymore after (but nobody knew that at the time)..its was really a strategic decision for post WW2. the inference your drawing is completely inaccurate.  We simply didn't care about civilian casualties compared to strategic means of ending the war during the war in the pacific. We did our best not kill them but the weapons and technology did not allow for precision, and of course american army/naval aviators lives were more important to us than missing a target..so if the crew was in danger or under attack they dropped the bombs..knowing any damage was better than none..it was a different time, a different war with different technology..the grave mistake is equating one situation with another and then using it to justify your argument.

       Here we go with the zionist socialist mantra again. The  Bolsheviks used this mantra. It is almost a direct quote from Lenin
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Freedom in capitalist society always remains about the same as it was in ancient Greek republics: Freedom for slave owners.--Vladimir Lenin
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And we know the USSR was soooo great compared to capitalism /s

       This is one of the places where hasbara organize to brigade and troll, and try to make it look like they're organizing only because they're morally righteous "anti-racists". Anything related to Israel, Jewish power, and real history (etc) is subject to this accusation, no matter how tenuous or unfounded. Don't let it bother you.

       Psychology is a joke I've had two psychologists one when I was young one when I was old. The fact that if you Google morality both Wikipedia and psychology websites have dead wrong definitions and ideas on what it is. Morality does NOT care about the masses idea of right and wrong. Morals deal with what is right and what is wrong regardless of the people. This shit I dealt with today with a guy who teaches this subject and I had to correct him. He stated it was in his textbook which is also infiltrated by this massive duping of the people.

       Yeah I agree psychology is a joke. Do you have any sources on this "massive duping of the people". I've heard this before and kind of noticed in it in AP classes in high school. Wondering if there's any legitimate sources behind it.

       The evidence is all around us. You cannot watch TV, read magazines or do anything mainstream without seeing falseness. Sports for example is what? Competition, which is to see who is the best at a child's game. Who the fuck cares who is the best? Idiots who live vicariously that's who. I have a whole family of morons that waste 2-4 hours of their life watching egoistic assholes prance around making more money than my whole sports watching family combined.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is one tiny example it is weaved into education with common core. It's in almost all blockbusters. TV is filled with authority worshipping cop shows. Corporate with their policies that do nothing but stagnate shit getting done and hierarchy worship.

       Zionism is one of many large criminal enterprises in the world. Not the largest or the most powerful , but one of the most durable. (most of the power of the zionists is based on their influence in the U.S. media)

       No, from their website reclaim-australia.com

      <p>
       What we're about:.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        To stop any enforcing of Sharia law throughout the whole of Australia. To make Sharia Law illegal in every State and Territory.
       </li>
       <li>
        Keep our traditional values ie. Christmas, Easter, Australia Day, Anzac Day and other beliefs a large number of Australians have grown up with.
       </li>
       <li>
        Keep our rights and freedom of speech.
       </li>
       <li>
        Halal certification should be banned and made illegal. (if not banned, then control should be handed over to the government so it isn't a moneymaking scheme for islam).
       </li>
       <li>
        Introduce pride in the Australian flag and Anthem at all levels of schooling.
       </li>
       <li>
        Ban the teaching of Islam in government schools.
       </li>
       <li>
        Ban the Burqa or any variant thereof.
8.Ban FGM and introduce mandatory 10 year jail terms for perpetrators and organisers. This includes those who send girls overseas to have FGM carried out outside Australia. Once their jail term has been completed, their citizenship should be cancelled and they be immediately deported back to the country they originated from.
       </li>
       <li>
        Stop Centrelink recognising polygamy and only recognise the first marriage for benefits.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       There is also reclaimaustralia.net which has got me stumped.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reclaim Australia has one main purpose, and that is to assist and educate the people of Australia as to whom they really are, to help guide them to follow the higher laws of Yhwh, our Heavenly Father, to live the way our heavenly father wanted his children to live, to reclaim their country from the parasites and predators of the Abdicated  Corporate Government of Babylon and Caesar's world of Satan.

       Reclaim Australia seems a bit hypocritical in some respects. 
1. Sharia law was never affecting anyone in Australia. If they want to ban it, fine, but it won't change much.
2. Many of these traditions are based on christianity which aren't national values. You can't shun people that don't want to participate in these religious activities.
3. The only rights that are being threatened are those of non-Christians (mainly Muslims)
4. This I simply don't get. How is that hurting anyone
5. This is weird. You can't force someone to sing a national anthem, that is agains the aforementioned rights
6. If by this they mean teaching of the religion itself then it makes sense, but if they mean it in a historical and informational sense, then that is just forcing ignorance onto students.
7. Just why? This is obviously not a secular thing because they are all for Christian holidays and traditions, so why single out a religious symbol that doesn't affect anyone. They literally want to strip freedom of religion.
8. Makes sense to some extent

       That was garbled.  I just meant that  races are finite groups with finite ambitions.  If you are anti-racist then every society on earth is potentiality your enemy.  Including your own.  Much better profitwise if the MIC is your societies funder obviously.

       Of course racism will always exist. That's just how humans have been brought up. Genocide for the cause of racism is what's bad. A few foul opinions never hurt anybody, but when you go to the extreme, that's when it get's bad. There is no transition either. Just a bunch of bad eggs and power hungry freaks.

       It's nitpicking   but I personally just prefer 'racial abuse' as what you should avoid.   Slavery and nazism and communism and cultural marxists all sought to specifically seek out and destroy (always one at a time) 'races'.
