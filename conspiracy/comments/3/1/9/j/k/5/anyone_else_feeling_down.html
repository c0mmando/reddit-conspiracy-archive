       Do any of you get bummed out/depressed or lose hope for all humanity to an unhealthy level more and more often as we continue to learn what is quite possibly the reality of our lives and the people running it? For several years I've kept an open mind, fascinated by conspiracy pertaining to Roswell, JFK, 9/11, Sandy Hook, Boston bombing, GMOs, Illuminati, etc.  and it was very liberating, at first to discover new information and understanding about what was really happening or had happened.  I think most of you would agree that the feeling is addicting.  The overwhelming desire to find out what actually happened with concrete evidence and go from conspiracy to fact.  This morning on my drive into work, I was feeling particularly blue.  As I'm follow along with the fast and aggressive pace of the moving traffic I see so many of my fellow humans going about their monotonous day in day out grind and I think to myself about how I'm likely going to do the same for several years to come while still being a tiny percentage of the population that truly believes our entire lives are fixed; what we eat, how much we pay in gas prices, goods/services, how much we earn, what we watch/read for news and entertainment, our political leaning and who becomes the next president. If everything is orchestrated on a national or even global scale and the powers that are believed to be operating it really are as evil as we suspect...isn't that our greatest fear of all?  Worst case scenario, this is it then, right?  I appreciate this community and the few other likeminded circles I consider myself to be apart of.  It reminds me that I'm not the only one questioning "controversial" topics.  I'm curious if any of you feel similarly at least from time to time.  Perhaps ignorance really is bliss?

       Actually no, I'm feeling great. There's something about an opponent that motivates me, galvanizes my resolve. It's empowering to know how high the stakes are. Nothing is more important than the Great Work; there is no ambiguity. It's Go time. Look for your opportunity and dive right in.

       I hear you and I definitely feel that drive as well.  I believe the spread of information is the key to building bases for any kind of real change but it's rare that I talk opening about these issues in public for fear of losing credibility to those close to me as it has happened in the past. 
Do you have an example of an opportunity you've found?

       Get more active -- in real life, but especially online where you can reach more eyeballs. Get
       <strong>
        well-educated
       </strong>
       in your chosen area(s) of expertise so that you can help steer conversations towards truth on social media and Internet forums; lend support to others who are doing the same. Write music or make art that expresses key ideas. Design and sell/distribute subversive t-shirts and stickers. Help plan ahead for your family and friends who may still be sleepwalking. Be a damn good person so that people will respect and admire you, and will associate these unfamiliar ideas with goodness and love. And always, strive to act out of love, intelligence, and courage -- in so doing, you align your actions with millions of others who are doing the same, in effect adding to the Christ Consciousness, if you will.

       yes I definately feel similarly. it's frustrating. that the poor get poorer and the rich get richer, people don't seem to give a damn about anything except making money by various means of exploitation and it makes me really sad to the point of losing hope.

       Most of the corporations that control me have recently gone berserk, doing things like  Bank of America charging $1.50 interest (their term)  on a zero balance on a credit card and like Charter  arbitrarily  changing my account number and then  demanding that I must now do the work of changing the account number that is auto paid by a credit card.They issued an ultimatum that I do this free work (which I must first learn how to do)  on their behalf within 60 days or lose the 'service'.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are several more things like having my home owners insurance through Foremost, which was paid in full for a year in advance,  suddenly demand another 155 bucks as the '4th payment on my" loan". Again it was prepaid in full but for the 15th continuous year  but  the account was closed   after 8 months. The only previous contact I had ever had with them was paying  them, no claims or controversy of any kind.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are more strange corporate dealings from the recent past but you will not be more convinced about their validity so I'll stop here.

       I see the entire system as becoming insane with greed  and the only hope I have is that they actually do lose the ability to hold any coherent thought at all soon.  I almost  expect to find the CEO's in their closets drooling into their shoes most any day now.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is very clear insanity in all forms of leadership now.

       I take pleasure in knowing that the natural laws of the universe always apply. Meaning, no matter how much things go in one direction, there will always be an opposite reaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some day the pendulum will swing back. The harder TPTB cling to keep it on their side, the harder and faster it will swing back. Trust me, it always does. It may not happen in my lifetime, or I may live to see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also take a great deal of pleasure in knowing that, no matter how powerful they may think they are, there is at least one nobody they've never had any sway over... me. The fact that, for everything they do, someone with as little as me will die free no matter what, they'll keep throwing more weight on. Cursing and muttering insert their breaths.

       It happens occasionally but I've learned to fight back those feelings. It's almost like a wave of shit hits me (It's the shit-icane). When it does I get up and do something creative, go for a walk or have some social interaction. That generally works for me.

       I know exactly what you're talking about, but what i've come to realize is that most of your thoughts are part of a phase. I'm sure you remember being really happy sometime in the near past. It's just important to try and stay positive as these times are a real test and can lead you to think of things that can really fuck with your head.

       Nope, infact, I feel blessed. Also, I use to think ignorance would be bliss as well, but it's not. It's just a gilded cage, and I'd rather see the world as it is, not as it wishes to present itself, all the while, working my best to use my talents to make the world as I would like to see it, which ofcourse, from my perspective, is a better place.

       only if i dwell on it, i make every effort not to let the lies to humanity get the best of me, i admit i used to get down at times, i changed my attitude when i realized that: FINALLY, we are going to get to (some) truth! it made me have a different perspective, knowing that other people
       <em>
        in the world
       </em>
       are feeling the same (that's really something),
      </p>
      <p>
       just think about how long it's taken to get to this point, don't feel bad about it, the masses never had a chance to get a clue, sure, it won't be easy, it's part of the process, like detox, only this is for world consciousness (for the human species on this planet, give yourself a hug),
      </p>
      <p>
       it's very important not to be afraid or get depressed, read/do positive things, appreciate what you have, stay in the present, be good to yourself when you feel low. take care of your health, "fear is the mind killer".

       Just to be devil's advocate for a moment..
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider that the world isn't controlled..
      </p>
      <p>
       and perhaps that notion is very scary to some people. Naturally it may be difficult for them to accept, so they can't help but seek comfortable theories that always point to an all-powerful entity to reassure them that the world is controlled..
      </p>
      <p>
       and perhaps they seek validation of that belief here or on forums with other like minded people
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, maybe some people come to a conspiracy forum rather than going to an avionics, or meteorology, or engineering forums for that very reason
      </p>

       I love gaining new information about controversial "conspiracy theory" topics. But, I agree, after a while it starts to just make you feel, "if everything is controlled and everyone in power is out to control and crush 99% of humanity, then what's the point"? Yeah, I feel you. When I think for a long while on any given topic related to the haves controlling the have-nots it just makes me depressed. I love this subreddit and I am so thankful for everyone that posts and keeps the faith-even if it is all a giant hamster wheel.

       Its the cross we all must bear. But we dont have to succumb to it. Things may get worse before they get better, but thats still not enough reason to forsake all that is good.

      <p>
       Find joy in your life. Learn more than what is negative. I find martial arts is wonderful, as is lesrning primitive survival skills, when confronted with the "conspiracy blues". They also have the added benefit thst should shtf, you are better prepared than someone with a shotgun holed up in a bunker.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get control over your life. Abandon bad habits (drinking, smoking, sugars, etc) and exercise regularily. These are all fronts of this war, but they receive the least amount of effort in terms of resistence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first point of conflict is control over your life. Take that back, and TPTB seem to be that much more further away.

       I'm glad I'm awake.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a father I find great comfort in knowing I am doing everything I can in order to prepare for whatever these psychos bomb us with next time. Food, finance, water,  backup plans, ammo, homesteading, heat, etc etc. I don't go about this in some feverish, panicked manner believing every doomsite that proclaims each week that
       <em>
        next week
       </em>
       , oh yeah for sure, next week is the nuclear obamapocalypse 666 WWIII. Rather I feel a calm, confident fuck-you toward them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quite simply, I'm making myself and my family harder to kill for when they
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       finally kick off the next global war between superpowers or crash the grid or whatever. I do believe they are intentionally steering toward WWIII, and while a few years ago I wouldn't have thought so, I do now believe some of them are in fact clinically, genuinely insane enough to create or force nuclear events.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not really scared of the bombs themselves. It's the post-event human violence that would take the biggest toll. And that's what I try to pre-fortify against.

       I pray I don't accidently run into you guys. Talk about expecting the worst. If the powers that shouldn't be were dumb enough to nuke the globe, I think the common person would unite more to build something that wasn't so radioactive and deathy the second time around. Personally, I'm not killing surviviors, I'm gonna see if we can work together to make a better world. And concidering it's now literally rock bottom, we can't fail, only succeed.

       They don't have to 'nuke the globe' you dork. They'd have to have one limited exchange and people would lose their fucking shit en masse in a heartbeat. I don't want to kill anyone at all. I'd like it if people were helpful, courteous and knowledgeable. But the reality is people will become desperate, dangerous panicky savages. Sorry. I've seen it first hand and its naive to think otherwise. Yes, there would be plenty of good people out there looking to help others. They will be preyed upon by predators who feel their leash has been taken off. The good people that survive multiple attacks will become hardened on the inside and while not necessarily becoming predators themselves, become cold enough to eliminate perceived threats pre-emptively. I like the motto
       <em>
        Don't be scared, be prepared.
       </em>
       If you wish to interpret that as omfgCrAzy, go for it. But a few months after things spiral apart, think twice about answering your door
       <em>
        without
       </em>
       a piece in your hand. You wanna get shot in the face for some canned goods that's up to you.

       Well, I'mma be a naive dork and trust in the Lord to protect me from myself and others. His track record in that dept. in my life is pristine and one of the major reasons I have faith. Because it's not blind, it's enlightened. But anyways, no one is shooting me in the face for can goods. I got real community around me, and we're not killing eachother. We're gonna help eachother, because that's what humanity does. I have no desire to win the human race, as it's rigged and the prize is losing your soul. Seems like a crappy deal.

       Compartmentalization can be helpful, to some. Moreso, to maintain a sense of equilibrium in life, a balance of acknowledging the ills of world so that we can change then for the better (when possible) while not neglecting to focus on the positive aspects of human nature and existence, on your hobbies and personal relationships.

       We need distrubuted organization. We know that the powers that be will target any individual that stands up like MLK or even JFK. But, they cannot target all of us easily. If we all take small actions in our own lives and move toward some sort of alternative struture to what we have now socially, things might get interesting.

       Or maybe being preoccupied with fantasies of dystopia is itself a cause of stress. Someone will always invent a new conspiracy to believe in, and as a result you'll be frightened by how your beliefs in the world have to change in order to conform to the conspiratorial mindset.

       I feel a little compelled to reply to this.   I used to spend hours on this subreddit, probably to the point where it was unhealthy.  All I ever wanted to talk about was how the government was coming to get all of us like the boogeyman. I viewed every national tragedy as some story that they were not "telling us the whole story about".   I spent days mulling over these articles trying to turn everything into a conspiracy.  I could no longer take anything for face value, ajd always assumed there was some sinister plot behind everything. It was having a severe impact on my happiness. I was miserable, and it was showing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then one day I decided that I was not going to go on here anymore.  It was almost like a drug habbit recovery. This (meaning today) was actually my first time back in about 6 months.  I looked at the articles posted a lot differently.  The comments started seeming more idiotic. I see shit hasnt changed.  People are posting crackpot theories about the same things.  People are still obsessed with this idea that the government is doing whatever it can to control you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more I looked, the more it seemed like people living in this weird fantasy world...one that was dark, and destructive.  I get it, the world may be a lot different than it appears.  There is a lot of messed up shit going on, but realistically, what the hell are you going to do about?  You can't change anything.  The world will forever be how it is, and no matter how far the rabbit hole you go, there is not a fucking thing you can do about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       When your world revolves around "conspiracy" or dwelling about shit you have no control over, you suffer.  Live your life.  Be happy...and stop worrying about things that are out of your hands.

       What makes you believe your conspiracy over his? It has hardly any proof to back it up. Its like believing in a fairy tale dream that someone else had. I'm not saying your completely wrong, but stop having such a presumptuous attitude.

       Umm, evidence and history. I'm an ex-catholic. I looked up the Flavians and it's history, you should too. Jesus was a lie, I believe in a creator, but he was not embodied in Christ. Believe what you want.

       I did. History is not all facts. It is an interpretation or someone's version of the past. It is not necessarily the "truth". Don't be so quick to believe just about anything just because it is "history". Cheers.

       I am really occupied, atm. Should be studying for a big exam in a few months, but reddit is all so consuming of my time.

      <p>
       But can I ask, what is the purpose of disproving Jesus? Are you disproving the historical facts? Then I'm with you in that we really don't know or can confirm much from that time period. But his supposed teachings are still timeless and ahead of their time. How could somebody conjure up such classics like the sermon on the mount?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm all for questioning the past etc., but sometimes I wonder the motive. That's all! Happy hoppiting.

       To be honest, I don't give a fuck about humanity. I care about the future of my own people -- men and woman of white, European, Christian descent. A genocide is being committed against the white race right now. It has been going on for decades, and it is gathering momentum. That worries me, because my race represents the apex of humanity. The only way to go, when you move away from us, is downhill.
