       My idea was a system like the [serious] tag for r/askreddit. And for self-posts in this sub, we could implement it and define what it means. But my idea (which I have proposed many times from many different accounts) continues to be ignored. Not that I don't understand: there are a lot of mods to deal with and not to mention a sub of almost 300 thousand.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I have developed a subreddit as a testing ground to prove that people can benefit from this system.

       Feel free to up or downvote, but when you enter a thread to comment, you either entertain the premise of the post, or you do
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       comment. That way people can actually build off of their theories with other like-minded people.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are plenty of disagreements and a million different branches of thought that people can discuss after accepting the premise of an idea.

       Where is the line drawn between "entertaining the premise" and being the theory withstanding critical scrutiny? Be careful not to just let it become an echo-chamber - disagreement is contribution in its own right, so long as it's productive.

       I don't think so.  Teach her three things - A) that you love her, B) that this world is
       <em>
        fucked UP
       </em>
       , and C) that you
       <em>

       her - and I think there's not a bad chance that she won't hold it against you.
       <em>
        You're
       </em>
       not the one that made the world
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       fucked up, afterall (make sure and don't forget to teach her that too).  You're just explaining to her that it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       this fucked up and aren't sugarcoating it for her.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're giving her
       <em>
        truth
       </em>
       .  That's a good thing.

       <em>

       <em>
        best
       </em>
       ones if you ask me.
      </p>
      <p>
       She may grow up realizing that many others in the world will think her mad, but let her know that that's only because they have ear muffs up and nobody ever helped them hear the music.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a tricky proposition, to be sure, because you also don't want her growing up to be a megalomaniac thinking that she's the only one who's right and "sees things" and everyone else is wrong, but...well, that's where teaching her to be a critical thinker also comes in.
      </p>
      <p>
       And so with all of this wonderful child-rearing advice, I'm going to 100% STFU now, since I myself don't actually have any kids...

       Great advice, anyways my friend.

       And the dance moves comment was purely from a paternalistic perspective, because the worse she can dance the less dudes I'll have to deal with if I can make her as goofy as possible on the dance floor.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I doubt that'll work, anyway. It's fun to literally
       <em>
        make people
       </em>
       . My favorite so far on this pale blue dot.

       Surely that is the creation of a belief echo chamber .. rather than a critical examination of the theories themselves
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing wrong with it, but it's like saying we want to discuss the Loch Ness monster with only those that believe it exists without the bother of having to deal with any skepticism on the matter

       "Question everything" should not be discarded as soon as someone proposes a theory. That's not how theories, or research or basic science works.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, that's how religion works

       So in other words, you just want people who agree with your ideas to comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       And 'accepting the premise of an idea" is very vague.  Is this like saying " yeah, 7WTC
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       have been demo'd"?  Then we'd get to disagree?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because that just sound like some extra, frivolous step.
      </p>
      <p>
       But hey, if it weeds the circle-jerkers out of here and over to there...so be it.
