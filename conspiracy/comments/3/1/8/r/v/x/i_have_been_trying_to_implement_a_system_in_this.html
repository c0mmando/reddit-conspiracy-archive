        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My idea was a system like the [serious] tag for r/askreddit. And for self-posts in this sub, we could implement it and define what it means. But my idea (which I have proposed many times from many different accounts) continues to be ignored. Not that I don&#39;t understand: there are a lot of mods to deal with and not to mention a sub of almost 300 thousand. </p>

<p>So I have developed a subreddit as a testing ground to prove that people can benefit from this system.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/c_s_t">Critical Shower Thoughts</a></p>

<p>Feel free to up or downvote, but when you enter a thread to comment, you either entertain the premise of the post, or you do <strong>not</strong> comment. That way people can actually build off of their theories with other like-minded people.</p>

<p>There are plenty of disagreements and a million different branches of thought that people can discuss after accepting the premise of an idea.</p>

<p>Come and join the experiment.</p>

<p>I will try and balance the quick ban hammer as I am usually amti-censorship and am going to try and be a counterbalance, but invite all of the NewQueâ„¢ to sub and join in with some great discussions.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think so.  Teach her three things - A) that you love her, B) that this world is <em>fucked UP</em>, and C) that you <em>love</em> her - and I think there&#39;s not a bad chance that she won&#39;t hold it against you.  <em>You&#39;re</em> not the one that made the world <em>this</em> fucked up, afterall (make sure and don&#39;t forget to teach her that too).  You&#39;re just explaining to her that it <em>is</em> this fucked up and aren&#39;t sugarcoating it for her.</p>

<p>You&#39;re giving her <em>truth</em>.  That&#39;s a good thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And full disclosure - I teach her the worst dance moves, for purely selfish reasons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it&#39;s <del>conspiracy theories</del> <em>real</em> truth that you&#39;re starting her off with, then those are most definitely NOT the worst dance moves.  They&#39;re the <em>best</em> ones if you ask me.</p>

<p>She may grow up realizing that many others in the world will think her mad, but let her know that that&#39;s only because they have ear muffs up and nobody ever helped them hear the music.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a tricky proposition, to be sure, because you also don&#39;t want her growing up to be a megalomaniac thinking that she&#39;s the only one who&#39;s right and &quot;sees things&quot; and everyone else is wrong, but...well, that&#39;s where teaching her to be a critical thinker also comes in.</p>

<p>And so with all of this wonderful child-rearing advice, I&#39;m going to 100% STFU now, since I myself don&#39;t actually have any kids...</p>

<p>All the best, brother.</p>

<p>Namaste,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great advice, anyways my friend.</p>

<p>And the dance moves comment was purely from a paternalistic perspective, because the worse she can dance the less dudes I&#39;ll have to deal with if I can make her as goofy as possible on the dance floor.</p>

<p>But I doubt that&#39;ll work, anyway. It&#39;s fun to literally <em>make people</em>. My favorite so far on this pale blue dot.</p>

<p>Because that just sound like some extra, frivolous step.</p>
