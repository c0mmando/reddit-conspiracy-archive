       Is like "wolfram alpha" but you don't know you are interacting with a computer.
      </p>
      <p>
       some example on how this works.
      </p>
      <p>
       a post is created in a thread, for example, "what you consider is the worst movie ever made?" "what is the best film?" "see this nice puppy playing"
      </p>
      <p>
       the AI will post answers based on his database, the answer may be just the title of some random popular bad movie, or a link to a meme/gif/photo. Then real users will start replying to this post. Will vote it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The posts created by the AI can be more complicated, it may appear you are really interacting with real people. It may articulate precise arguments, provoke, calm down, minimize, ridicule, insult.
      </p>
      <p>
       The AI will use the hundred of thousands of posts made each day by real users to learn and improve his routine so in the end to appear more human.
      </p>
      <p>
       The existence of this AI raise a lot of concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, did reddit user will be so willingly to interact if they would know that the user they speak with, is just some computer? Is this fair?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is reddit just a testing ground for this complex AI system that in the future will be used on the internet to enforce the "personal bubble"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine this like your personalized shill/debunker.

       Related.. I recently came across a thread (I don't recall the orig source) where people were reporting getting telemarketing-style phone calls from bots. The interesting part being they didn't realize they were speaking to a robot until they were many minutes into the conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       One guy mentioned he started asking the computer simple questions that would trip-up a robot, like: "What day of the week was yesterday?", etc. The computer responded something to the effect, "I did not hear what you said, could you repeat the question?" until the bot finally just hung-up after too many "weird" questions from the human.

       With AI, there is no risk of disobeying orders or whistleblowers exposing the plan. And you can throw near infinite resources at the task; it probably costs fractions of a penny for each AI user instance. Once this technology is mature, the illusory reality will be complete.

       That small window of opportunity was depicted perfectly by Kubrick in 2001. When Dave had to manually re-enter the space station because HAL (AI computer) locked him out while killing all the other astronauts on the mission. Redundancy had been built in to the system for the human astronauts to override any computerized (rogue) malfunction. Despite that, HAL
       <em>
        barely
       </em>
       lost. I think this was Kubrick's intention, to illustrate how the AI's own survival tactics will invariably kick-in at some point creating that dreaded conflict of interest. It's not too hard to imagine a flock of drones being centrally controlled by an AI. No stretch at all.

       It might. Slave AIs are easy and already in the wild. It's a simple matter of training neuralnets with datasets. Sentience is what everyone thinks of when they think AI. That's going to be impossible without, what I like to call, directed randomness.

       Sounds like a natural progression of the "shadowban".  Instead of just isolating a user so that he sees his posts but nobody else does, isolate him and only allow responses from moderate to highly sophisticated chatbots so that he feels like he's still an active participant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Controlled by the right people, that principle could be extended across much of your life.

       You know, this one I agree with (or at least there's a big possibility it's true) and I did NOT believe that two years ago, re AI.  It's about time for Google to try this out for real, and what better playground to do it than Reddit.  One of the points I want to make is that they only have to correspond via email, which is (relatively) easy to start.  And they only have to do a very short email too, and then real humans will respond.  The more I think about it, the more I'm inclined to say it's about time...  Sadly, of course.

       <p>
        Negobot also referred to as Lolita or Lolita chatbot is a chatterbot that was introduced to the public in 2013, designed by researchers from the University of Deusto and Optenet to catch online pedophiles.
        <strong>
         It is a conversational agent that utilizes natural language processing (NLP), information retrieval (IR) and Automatic Learning.[1]
        </strong>
        Because the bot poses as a young female in order to entice and track potential predators, it became known in media as the "virtual Lolita", in reference to Vladimir Nabokov's novel.[2]

        Programmed persona
       </p>
       <p>
        The chatterbot takes the guise of a naive and vulnerable 14-year old girl. The bot's programmers used methods of artificial intelligence and natural language processing to create a conversational agent fluent in typical teenage slang, misspellings, and knowledge of pop culture.
        <strong>
         Through these linguistic features, the bot is able to mimic the conversational style of young teenagers. It also features split personalities and seven different patterns of conversation.[3]

        Game theory
       </p>
       <p>
        The bot initiates its undercover operations by entering a chat as a passive participant, waiting to be chatted by a user. Once a user elicits conversation, the bot will frame the conversation in such a way that keeps the target engaged, extracting personal information and discouraging it from leaving the chat. The information is then recorded to be potentially sent to the police.
        <strong>
         If the target seems to lose interest, the bot attempts to make it feel guilty by expressing sentiments of loneliness and emotional need through strategic, formulated responses, ultimately prolonging interaction. In addition, the bot may provide fake information about itself in attempt to lure the target into physical meetings.[3]

       <p>
        Enter the robot informant. A security firm in Austin, Tex., CSIdentity has created artificial-intelligence software capable of posing as a hacker and engaging ne’er-do-wells in the underground forums. Its goal is to solicit stolen data—a hacker hoping to fence 1,000 credit-card numbers will offer dozens for free to prove they’re real—and send them back to flesh-and-blood investigators. CSIdentity sells the data it collects to banks, cybersecurity companies, and others who have a stake in quickly discovering which businesses, accounts, and credit cards have been compromised. “Very often we are able to notify our customers that something is wrong before their bank” does, says Scott Mitic, chief executive officer of TrustedID, an identity-theft protection company which purchases CSIdentity’s data.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         To design the chatbots, CSIdentity’s 10-person analyst team studied the dialog in hacker chat rooms, looking for patterns in the interactions, says Joe C. Ross, the company’s president. The hacker argot is filled with slang: A newly stolen credit card is “fresh,” and a “fullz” is a credit-card record that includes the victim’s personal data and the card’s three-digit security code along with the number. To keep up with the fast-moving conversation, the virtual informants use a technique from computer science known as fuzzy pattern recognition, which helps the bots make sense of terms and phrases that can be expressed in different ways.

        <strong>
         The research into the programmes, which are designed to emulate human conversation and are familiar as "virtual assistants" on retailers' websites, envisages a future in which "an influence bot could be deployed in both covert and overt ways – on the web, in IM/chatrooms/forums or in virtual worlds".

        Daden also suggested
        <strong>
         chatbots could be used as "cyberbuddies" shadowing soldiers through their careers or as data-gatherers in digital environments such as chatrooms and forums, where they could "scout for targets, potentially analyse behaviour, and record and relay conversation".

        The Guardian (17 March 2011) - Revealed: US spy operation that manipulates social media
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The US military is developing software that will let it secretly manipulate social media sites by using fake online personas to influence internet conversations and spread pro-American propaganda.
       </p>
       <p>
        A Californian corporation has been awarded a contract with United States Central Command (Centcom), which oversees US armed operations in the Middle East and Central Asia, to develop what is described as an "online persona management service" that will allow one US serviceman or woman to control up to 10 separate identities based all over the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Centcom contract stipulates that each fake online persona must have a convincing background, history and supporting details, and that up to 50 US-based controllers should be able to operate false identities from their workstations "without fear of being discovered by sophisticated adversaries".
       </p>
       <p>
        Once developed, the software could allow US service personnel, working around the clock in one location, to respond to emerging online conversations with any number of co-ordinated messages, blogposts, chatroom posts and other interventions. Details of the contract suggest this location would be MacDill air force base near Tampa, Florida, home of US Special Operations Command.
       </p>
       <p>
        It also calls for "traffic mixing", blending the persona controllers' internet usage with the usage of people outside Centcom in a manner that must offer "excellent cover and powerful deniability".

        MIT Review (December 16, 2012) - How President Obama’s campaign used big data to rally individual voters, Part 1.
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Obama 2012 campaign used data analytics and the experimental method to assemble a winning coalition vote by vote. In doing so, it overturned the long dominance of TV advertising in U.S. politics and created something new in the world: a national campaign run like a local ward election, where the interests of individual voters were known and addressed.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the 2008 presidential election, Obama’s targeters had assigned every voter in the country a pair of scores based on the probability that the individual would perform two distinct actions that mattered to the campaign: casting a ballot and supporting Obama.
        <strong>
         These scores were derived from an unprecedented volume of ongoing survey work. For each battleground state every week, the campaign’s call centers conducted 5,000 to 10,000 so-called short-form interviews that quickly gauged a voter’s preferences, and 1,000 interviews in a long-form version that was more like a traditional poll. To derive individual-level predictions, algorithms trawled for patterns between these opinions and the data points the campaign had assembled for every voter—as many as one thousand variables each, drawn from voter registration records, consumer data warehouses, and past campaign contacts.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        This innovation was most valued in the field.
        <strong>
         There, an almost perfect cycle of microtargeting models directed volunteers to scripted conversations with specific voters at the door or over the phone. Each of those interactions produced data that streamed back into Obama’s servers to refine the models pointing volunteers toward the next door worth a knock.
        </strong>
        The efficiency and scale of that process put the Democrats well ahead when it came to profiling voters. John McCain’s campaign had, in most states, run its statistical model just once, assigning each voter to one of its microtargeting segments in the summer. McCain’s advisors were unable to recalculate the probability that those voters would support their candidate as the dynamics of the race changed. Obama’s scores, on the other hand, adjusted weekly, responding to new events like Sarah Palin’s vice-presidential nomination or the collapse of Lehman Brothers.

       <p>
        Be-Me Platform
       </p>
       <p>
        Be-Me Platform is an intelligence platform that provides users with personalized service in a timely manner by collecting and analyzing users' diverse situation information. Built with an intelligence algorithm developed by SK Telecom, the platform determines daily patterns of a smartphone user by collecting and analyzing 1) data gathered via smartphone sensors (e.g. ambient light sensor, motion sensor, barometric sensor, etc.), 2) location information acquired via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or base stations, and 3) data on user's smartphone app usage. For instance, if the user's smartphone is left unmoved for a long time, the platform learns that he is 'asleep', and the place such activity takes place routinely and repetitively is determined to be 'home.' In a similar way, the platform recognizes the user's workplace, commuting route and means of transportation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Eggo-Mate
       </p>
       <p>
        Along with Be-Me Platform, SK Telecom is also showcasing Eggo-Mate(tentatively named), an intelligent assistant service built on the platform. The company demonstrates three main features of Eggo-Mate, including 1) schedule management, 2) life log, and 3) remote smartphone management.
       </p>
       <p>
        Eggo-Mate can schedule a meeting on behalf of the user. Upon approval from users, one user's Eggo-Mate will communicate with Eggo-Mates of other users to exchange users' schedule and preference to come up with a list of available meeting date/time and venues. It also helps users preserve special moments of their lives by automatically detecting out-of-routine activities and keeping a record (i.e. photo, location, SNS, etc.) of them. Moreover, it allows users to remotely manage their smartphones via PC, identifying the phone's location and checking missed voice calls and messages. SK Telecom plans to commercialize Eggo-Mate in September 2015 after upgrading a number of features.
