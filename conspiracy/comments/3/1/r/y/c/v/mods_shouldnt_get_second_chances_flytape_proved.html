    <div class="md"><p>It isnt the crime, but the cover up.</p>

<p>The video was unwatchabe for its appearence alone. I couldn&#39;t get past the first 2 minutes to get to the message. When dealing in controversy, like this sub often does, people look for any reason to discredit the messenger, and the message at that point. Why help them do that?</p>

<p>How you could think looking like that would let anyone take the message you were trying to convey seriously, is piss poor judgement imo.</p>

<p>It was worse judgement to not review the video and post it.</p>

<p>Even worse than that would be to have reviewed it, and still think it came off as something that would represent the 300k people here.</p>

<p>With that being said, i dont think he should have been removed as a mod for that.</p>

<p>The retalation in banning users here on his part was the exact reason he should have been banned. There should be no place for that type of behavior here.</p>

<p>That action in itself should have told the mods that flytape does not posses the maturity to be a mod, nor the responsibility to have banning priveldges for any sub.</p>

<p>He should not be anywhere near a position of authority. That is the exact thing that has been giving this site a black eye, and has done so again.</p>

<p>I thought the initial reaction from the mods here was correct and gave me hope that maybe they are finally getting it here. Almost restored a little faith in this site.</p>

<p>Turns out, instead of fighting the fire that has been going on here for a while, there was gas in the bucket instead of water.</p>

<p>How can any mod vote to reinstate his mod priviledges, when he clearly showed he does not have the maturity to be trusted as a hall moniter in an elementary school, let alone the ability to be able to censor or delete the posts of 300k free thinking adults that are supposed to be his piers or to kiss his ass like some mods expect.</p>

<p>Mods have to be respected. How can you expect anyone to have respect for flytape at this point?</p>

<p>What is he going to do when someone throws it in his face that he acted like a punk ass kid that didn&#39;t get his way and took the ball and went home?</p>

<p>He changed overnight? Please. He has done things like that before and will do it again.</p>

<p>In effect by reinstatiing him you are telling adults that are twice his age and maturity to respect someone who showed to the 300k people here that he doesn&#39;t have the respect for them. Or himself by the video he put out.</p>

<p>Again, its not the video, (even though that was bad) but the reaction to opinions on it where he banned the user.</p>

<p>Even Tricky Dick Richard Nixon had the decency to resign. If flytape doesn&#39;t, he should be removed.</p>

<p>If this isn&#39;t nipped in the butt right now, you can expect people to show him the respect he showed the users he banned because he was butt hurt. In turn, he will pull the same shit and start banning them.</p>

<p>For anyone to think other wise, mod or subscriber are fools. How can anyone respect him? Or the mods who voted to reinstate him? How can anyone expect him to not react like a 4 year old?</p>

<p>With all due respect to the OP, how you think that it is a benifit to the people in this sub rewarding him for doing what cuased the majority of people to split time between this site and another.</p>

<p>Im not saying ban him from posting, but it is in nobodys benifit that he has mod prividleges.</p>

<p>Finally, shouldnt all posts be considered a free for all outside of Reddits sitewide rules? Espically in this sub, and the &quot;culture of free speech&quot; reddit advertises it self to have on its wiki page.</p>

<p>The fact you had to put that disclaimer in says alot about the way things are here, and are a far cry from the &quot;culture of free speech&quot; that reddit has prided and built itself on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He also unnecessarily banned two users who had repeatedly and technically broke the rules while interacting with him, one I believe had already been banned prior, however he did not consult two other a mods while doing so (a stupid rule not typical of other subs) and thus was removed by another mod (without consulting the rest, ironically) as a result. He had since been reinstated and because of the controversy is now largely distrusted by the community. </p>

<p>sound about right.  live and learn, i&#39;d say:</p>

<p><a href="/u/flytape">/u/flytape</a> , don&#39;t use mod powers to promote your own media events.  (create a new username, and do what you gotta do personally - but never as an official representative of the subreddit.  i love your initiative... truly!  but with all due respect, i don&#39;t know you... you don&#39;t represent me, and every user on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> would say the same thing.)  </p>

<p>in terms of banning, i have long felt that user bans should require two mods -- would totally avoid this kinda &quot;he said / she said&quot; bs.</p>
