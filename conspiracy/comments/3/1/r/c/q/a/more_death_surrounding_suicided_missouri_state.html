<blockquote>
<p>If you&#39;ve been following the story of the mysterious bankster deaths, you&#39;ll recall that I recently blogged about the death of Missouri state auditor Tom Schweich, who, according to the official story, committed suicide over his distress that his Jewish ancestry might be &quot;outed&quot; by political opponents.</p>

<p>My own take on Mr. Schweich&#39;s untimely death was that he was &quot;suicided,&quot; and not for his Jewish ancestry. </p>

<p>Recall that Mr. Schweich had scheduled a formal press interview mere minutes before his suicide. </p>

<p>This in my opinion, plus his position as a state auditor, means to my mind that Mr. Schweich may have had, and in all likelihood did have, access to anomalous financial data which he may have intended to expose. </p>

<p>An individual in his position would have access to financial numbers both from the private sector and from the government sector - at both state and federal levels - that few would have.</p>

<p>Now, as if to fuel the fire of such speculations, there is another death, directed related to Mr. Schweich&#39;s:</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/police-missouri-auditor-spokesman-dead-apparent-suicide-140855879.html?soc_src=mail&amp;soc_trk=ma">Police: Auditor spokesman left note before apparent suicide</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is so much here that screams for attention one barely knows where to begin. </p>

<p>But consider this statement, which would be humorous for its bald assertion counter to what rational inference would indicate, were it not for the sad circumstances surrounding it:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;On Monday, police confirmed that Jackson had shot himself in an apparent suicide â€” marking a second, stunning jolt to Missouri politics, <em>though police declined to say whether the deaths were directly related.&quot;</em> (Emphasis added)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The article, of course, continues to press the idea that this is all because of Schweich&#39;s Jewish ancestry, with the unstated implication that Missouri is home to a kind of neo-Nazi underground, an assertion that seems a bit over-the-top, until one remembers that the concept of an extra-territorial &quot;Nazi International&quot; is very very real:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Schweich fatally shot himself at his home on Feb. 26, shortly after telling an Associated Press reporter he wanted to go public with allegations that the Missouri Republican Party chairman told people he was Jewish. </p>

<p>&quot;Schweich, a Christian with Jewish ancestry, said he perceived the remarks to be part of an anti-Semitic whispering campaign against him ahead of his run for governor.</p>

<p>&quot;Jackson, who was Schweich&#39;s spokesman, was among the first to suggest that the GOP chairman, John Hancock, should resign. Hancock has denied making anti-Semitic remarks, but said he may have mistakenly told people last year that Schweich was Jewish.</p>

<p>&quot;He remains chairman of the party, now roiled ahead of a 2016 election featuring races for U.S. Senate, governor and most of Missouri&#39;s other statewide executive offices.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While investigation may eventually confirm this angle, I continue to suspect strongly that there is more going on here than this. </p>

<p>We now have two &quot;suicides&quot; of two men who might conceivably been in the position to know things concerning the state of Missouri&#39;s finances, if not in a position to know things about federal finances, perhaps mortgage fraud, who knows? </p>

<p>In a world where traditional US allies like the United Kingdom, Israel, and Germany, are seeking to participate in China&#39;s Asia development bank, and Germany seems ready, once again, to repatriate its gold from the NY Federal Reserve - and not just some of it but all of it, then all my instincts cry out that it is the financial angle that is in play here. The rest may or may not be smokescreen.</p>

<p>And if you&#39;re in doubt that there may be other motivations for the suiciding of Mr. Schweich or Mr. Jackson, then consider only this:</p>
