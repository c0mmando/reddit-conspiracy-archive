       You feel like things need a shakeup around here?  Fine.  Your account better have at least two solid months of participation here, because otherwise, you are just another empty name coming from God knows where.

      <p>
       This is why even though some of these guys are fuck ups, everyone is reactionary about attempts to take them out because they are fuck ups who allow us to post whatever news we want.  There are legitimate alternative news sites that are banned SITE WIDE on Reddit, but because of the people you have running this sub, you are allowed to see this information.  Never forget that and never forget that it could all be taken away from you by pernicious people with ulterior motives.

       They still down vote religiously. I tried to make a discussion 'bout Ted Cruz last night which was trending when I went to bed and is now stuck at 0 as far as I can tell. I don't think this sub is designed for any conspiracies besides after-the-fact ones people can't do much about. Oh, and more recently memes.

       It's the same argument you hear about corruption in non-US friendly states.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, there is sometimes some corruption- but the leaders are trying to keep the resources for the people, and protect them from colonization.  And so there is always an all out propaganda war on them, and an effort of outside forces to infiltrate and take them down.  Places like chavez' venezuela, or Castro's Cuba or ghaddafi's Libya were not bastions of free speech for those trying to incite coupe.  Because they were actually under perpetual threat.

       Can you guys explain the details behind your "conspiracy woukd be nothing" without Flytape supposition? I mean, this is typically a great place to have an open discussion about anything until we hit like an every two month mark where that guy does something stupid, freaks out on the userbase, then it's this big hormonal drama. It keeps happening, and it's stupid and embarrassing.

       If it makes you feel better to call me an outsider and a concern troll, have at it, I don't care, but I just want to come here and have good conversations in peace without all the fucking drama.

       Not only that, but a lot of them were from places that directly work to discredit this sub. I saw accounts from conspiratard, isrconspiracyracist, subreddit drama, etc... One of the morons told me they cared about the state of this sub, and that they wanted to see "my kind" gone... Sooo...they wanted a conspiracy subreddit, without conspiracy theorists.

       Me being new shouldn't discredit my opinion. I've followed and not actively posted for a while now. 
For the flytape issue. 
Why is everyone in this sub okay with someone breaking the rules, saying he's better than you all and has a "life", and then acting like nothing happened? He broke the rules. Fire him and hire someone who will do the job correctly [Metaphor]

       This thread is a little strange to me. I've been posting on the subject a bit, this is my alt account, don't use it too much but it's neither new nor against the sub in any way. Long time lurker, sometimes poster.
      </p>
      <p>
       The scapegoating to boogeyman outsiders has reached absurd levels at this point. There very well may be outside accounts from the usual subs coming in here, but that doesn't negate any of the completely reasonable questions about this issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'barbarians at the gate' is the oldest trick in the book to stifle dissent. We are literally being told that it's only the big bad scary shills that even care about this issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       After all this, there still has been no explanation for why he is reinstated as a mod. Why, after making the sub look
       <strong>
        awful
       </strong>
       with the podcast, then abusing mod privileges, is he back? A secret vote by the mods while wholesale dismissing legitimate questions from the community?
      </p>
      <p>
       His apparently magical ability to spot shills and a standard form apology are not enough, in my opinion, to feel comfortable again with the reinstatement.
       <em>
        Especially
       </em>
       when it's been done in this manner sketchy on its face. 
Said it before and I'll say it again. This whole thing might be perfectly fine and on the level. But it sure isn't being handled that way. Dissent on the issue has been dismissed as shills and trolls. I don't doubt that some are.
      </p>
      <p>
       But using that to dismiss a viewpoint is classic manipulation, and really has tainted this sub with a feeling of being compromised.
      </p>
      <p>
       For what purpose? No clue. But given the progression of decisions starting with the podcast itself, I can't be the only one feeling like something is off here.

       I agree with the sentiment that this sub is compromised.
      </p>
      <p>
       In amongst all the bullshit that gets posted here, I think a number of people are getting close to the truth. The best way to keep people away from that truth is to make the community seem like a bunch of nutcases (as has always been the case).
      </p>
      <p>
       The dickheads in all the vote brigading subs are having a field day with this saga. That totes messenger bot sends people to those subs from threads all over reddit all the time. This reinforces the meme that conspiracy theorists are nutbags.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take for example a thread in
       <a href="/r/boston">
        /r/boston
       </a>
       on the bombing verdict. A dude then posted some shitty titled post in here with a link to the
       <a href="/r/boston">
        /r/boston
       </a>
       post. Then the totes messenger bot lets people know that it's been posted in this sub but with such a title that it makes anyone in there immediately dismiss the post and further tarnishes the subs name.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't be surprised if some of the mods in here were doing similar things to generate more drama for making us look like knobs.

       This is good analysis imo - anyone who has spent time here can spot the shills and detractors, and the Mod team has been acting more and more like them.  No reasons, just shadow votes and announcements, just like has happened all over reddit.  I'd say "head on over to voat but obviously the mod team there has a lot of crossover, and since the votes are hidden from us we have no idea if they are the same team thats participating in this, but they probably are.  I've heard a lot of good things about Corbett's forums and there are others out there, but you have to dig.  If you're not willing to dig you probably don't belong here anyway.

       This post wasn't about defending flytape, personally idgaf whether he stays or goes, if the community (IE: regular verifiable users of the sub) decides he goes I'm okay with this.
      </p>
      <p>
       This post was about a bunch of accounts with no history here trying to decide what goes on here.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't see the inherent problem with that I don't know what the fuck to tell you.  If you have an account with a history here, post on that, it gives you more clout to make changes you want to make.

      <p>
       There is a long and sordid history of outside subs trying to control this sub is every fashion possible.  Downvote brigades, social engineering of planted stories, mod coup de eta's etc.  Again if you need this explained to you, I don't know what the fuck to tell you

       I don't want clout and I'm not looking to make changes. I brought up a prevailing attitude that suppresses any real discussion of this issue, one that your response to me encapsulates perfectly.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that outside, 'smarter-than-thou' trolls are attempting to influence the sub, does
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       mean that any discussion about the issues surrounding the podcast, bans, and actual secret election are automatically invalid.

      <p>
       That is my point and it has been frustrating to see.

       Want to see real outside interference? Look at the recent threads about the Monsanto employee admitting to the 'debunking' department. You'd think we were on a Monsanto-run message board.

      <p>
       It is that kind of sketchy narrative-driving that I keep seeing around this issue. Not that it's the same purpose, but the debate is just as disingenuous.

      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it so ever-lovin' important that Flytape is a mod? He's on the record as saying he's not even that into conspiracies and believes in hardly any. He has his period every two months and goes on a banning drama spree, much to the delight of subs that live to mock us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, why the drama? It would completely die down if people didn't post "oh, don't hurt me's flytapes, don't hurts me bebes" by sockpuppets and mods and friends of mods every 8 hours.

       It's not, this post isn't about flytape, in fact if you bothered to read the post fully you'd see I said if the community wants to get rid of Flytape go for it, there just needs to be a prerequisite that they are demonstrably members of this community before their opinion is worth anything for the obvious reasons of there being a history of these other subs doing shit very similar to this to try and get control of the sub.

       Why is getting him off the mod list changing "control of the sub." Half the rest of the mods are his buds. Fewer mods are always better unless there's some demonstrable value to the guy being a mod besides banning criticism. You have to understand that to a lot of us here, it appears that there's a very solid faction here pretty intent on continuing to sow drama. "Trolls" didn't make AATA &amp; FT do that wretched podcast. "Trolls" didn't make FT act like a baby and ban people who criticised him. "Trolls" didn't post all this hand-wringing "it's all Ess Arr Dee, man. Ess Arr Dee! Fuck the subscribers, you are all sockpuppets!" crud. I still don't understand why y'all are on his jock so hard. And even so - he could just get another sockpuppet and everyone could vote his sockpuppet back in yet again. No need for the drama, right?

       See, you keep making this about flytape when I personally don't give a fuck if he stays or goes.  This is about who is demanding his removal.  There are definitely voices within the actual

       The slippery slope is the reverse, they are circling the wagons to obvious and overt outside attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once they (outside subs) can unseat 1 person under specious circumstances (I'm not even saying the accusations against FT are specious I'm saying the circumstance they are using as the pretext [the podcast] is specious at best).  When he arbitrarily banned Tenet and WideAWAKE was when I joined the other conspiracy regs who felt he needed to go or at least not be able to ban anymore - but the more forcefully this is pushed by these outside influences the more I become reactionary to the removal as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want to get rid of FT, tell these meddling fucks to mind their own business and let this community handle it's own without their proverbial ballot stuffing via comments and votes.

       I have a pretty firm grasp of what conspiracy means, champ. Your problem is you(disingenuously?) misinterpreted my post.

       Being banned for disagreeing with a mod is nuts. Having to WORRY about something like that is even more nuts. This is demonstrable proof of why mods abusing their powers need to go. It breeds distrust and degradation within the community. There are no loopholes around this, once you cross the threshold you either replace the mods who are causing problems or you watch the sub whither away as the users turn upon themselves in an attempt to find out what's really going on.

       <a href="/u/flytape">
        /u/flytape

       as a mod.  Having said that, the entire mod team here is lackluster and allows entirely too much shillery and fuckery.  I think half or better of them get paychecks from the letter agencies and/or are working hand in hand with the people they should be banning.  This is supposed to be a sub of free thought and expression, but every time I post here I feel anxiety because I may be the next tardget.  In 1984 people gathered and screamed hate at the enemy on the screen.  I think participating in conversation here is essentially volunteering to be on that screen.  Mods could help if they did their jobs.

       In a subreddit that is constantly attacked by trolls, and subverted by shills, it is inevitable there will suspicion of (often brand new) accounts, which have come from nowhere just to criticize the subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course comment content is the most important thing, but a verifiable history serves to assuage other user's suspicions about any agenda you might have, meaning your comment can be interpreted at face value.

       I get that at least  you understand post content is the most important thing, however, in the arena of actual discussion, and trying to find actual truths. There is simply zero intellectually honest reasoning for going straight to 'post history'.

       I understand why people

       The more you can justify 'bad ideas' the more other bad ideas you'll be able to justify in the future.

       Are you purposefully conflating a 'posts' content with an 'accounts' content?

      <p>
       Judging a post by content is legitimate and intellectually honest.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you are conflating, is judging a posts content, by the account content. That is exactly ad hominem. It's the quintessential example actually of ad hominem.
      </p>
      <p>
       You cannot judge a post by the content of an account. I can post 10000 times about how NWO guy thinks the moon is made of cheese.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I can post once about how I've researched and found NWO guy is commonly in r/conspiracy more than any other sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you tried to judge my post, using my account history then. You'd end up arguing about something that you shouldn't argue about, because they have nothing to do with each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Btw no offense on the cheese thing, it's just an example of something silly. I've seen you around enough I realize you are not a lunatic who thinks that the mods made of cheese)

       I'm not arguing something that is opinion or just an idea.

       You can only judge content A, by metric A. I'm having a very hard time seeing how you can't understand that, even your explanation is just useless as well.

      <p>
       Even if there are dozens of accounts shitposting, you judge them by their content. Even if the mods are having sockpuppets run around and trying to make sure to ease the opinions of people... those should be judged on content.

       Your argument is certainly valid in the majority of cases but in this case I agree with NWO. The flytape discussions have an unusual amount of users with no r/conspiracy history advising that the entire mod team be redone. These users also have unusually larger numbers of upvotes than the users that I see in this sub on a daily basis. It looks like a mission to subvert the moderators of this sub, which just isn't okay. I've been here nearly everyday for almost two years and have had 0 issues with our moderators, and I value the amount of freedom that still exists here.

       The thing is... no matter what it 'looks like'. The ad hominem still discredits whoever uses it. It still negates what they say.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's literally no justification for it. At all.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the same as walking up to a guy who believes in lizard people. He says it's raining outside, and you call him full of shit because of the utterly unrelated lizard people belief.
      </p>
      <p>
       It absolutely blows my mind people justify it when it's absolutely not justifiable.

       I disagree. There are no absolutes in this world. You're trying to argue in absolutes without using context and to me that makes your argument bullshit. The world just doesn't work that way. I won't be replying after this as I have no desire to argue in circles.

       Yea same. The problem of outsiders coming to manipulate this sub will always exist. Let's keep posting our links, speaking our mind and ignore and down vote anyone with an ulterior agenda. If we get hung up over them, they win. Let's ignore them and show them that we simply persevere and not give into their crap. We know better than that. :)
