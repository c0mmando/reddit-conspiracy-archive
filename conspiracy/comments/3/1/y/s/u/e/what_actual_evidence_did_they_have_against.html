    <div class="md"><p>Okay, yes and no. I&#39;m a trial junkie in general, but this is obviously a huge case so I&#39;ve been particularly invested in it. I&#39;ll try to break down the basics of what has and hasn&#39;t been presented/proven. </p>

<p>Proven:</p>

<ul>
<li>Defendant was at the marathon, outside of Forum.</li>
<li>Defendant took his backpack off.</li>
<li>Defendant&#39;s fingerprints were found on Dun Meng&#39;s (Danny) Mercedes.</li>
<li>Defendant&#39;s prints found on BB gun, side of a box of ammo and on a rubbermaid bomb. </li>
<li>Tamerlan Tsarnaev&#39;s prints on both pressure cooker bombs.</li>
<li>Tamerlan Tsarnaev&#39;s prints on P95 Ruger 9mm.</li>
<li>Tamerlan Tsarnaev&#39;s prints on ammo/bombs at Watertown shootout. </li>
<li>Officer Collier&#39;s DNA matched to blood on Honda car keys. </li>
</ul>

<p>Missing evidence:</p>

<ul>
<li>Defendant&#39;s fingerprints on either pressure cooker bomb.</li>
<li>Defendant&#39;s prints on P95 Ruger 9mm that was used to kill Officer Collier. </li>
<li>DNA of Officer Collier (shot at close range) in the blood on defendant&#39;s shirt. </li>
<li>Knowledge of where any of the bombs were built. </li>
<li>Anything related to the Tamerlan/FBI connection. </li>
</ul>

<p>This is what I don&#39;t understand. In court, the prosecution always has the burden of proof. They have to prove that the defendant in that courtroom is guilty and why. The jury has to base their decision ONLY on what evidence is submitted. There was certainly evidence Dzhokhar was there and involved at the various locations--pros. proved that. But they didn&#39;t prove he DID it which they had to do in order for the jury to check off &quot;guilty&quot; on most of those counts. Thing is, as we know, Judy Clarke made the statement &quot;he did it&quot;. So then what the hell is the jury supposed to do? Actually follow the rule of law and base their decisions on evidence or become reviled by the public for saying &quot;not guilty&quot; to many counts because they weren&#39;t proven even though his attorney admitted guilt? If I&#39;m off base here I&#39;d love some feedback, I just can&#39;t get over how weird this whole BMB wild ride has been. </p>

<p>Edit for horrible formatting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not off base. My understanding all along was that the authorities didn&#39;t have any &quot;conclusive&quot; forensic evidence linking Dzhokar to the bombs. The trial seems to have proved this, and yet his state-appointed counsel says &quot;he did it!&quot; Nothing about this case makes any sense. If the defence don&#39;t fight on the facts, they should at least put the defendant on the stand to make an emotional show of contrition and plead for his own life.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like the James Holmes trial - apparently intelligent people facing a death sentence just sitting throughout a entire trial in a catatonic state. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, exactly! I&#39;ve been in high school debates more lively than this trial. Despite one good cross-ex by Miriam Conrad (in which the judge shut her up) and another objection also by Conrad where the judge told her to sit down, defense was half-assed at best. </p>

<p>And good comparison. Curious to me is how lively Tsarnaev is when he talks with his lawyers. As soon as proceedings start is when he goes all James Holmes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPXOLWVC9rE">link</a> to the footage played in the trial. It does not exactly show them setting bags down, but it does show them both running after the blasts with no backpacks. Pay close attention to Dzhokhar though. I find it interesting how, in court, the prosecution narrated the video a bit and said &quot;you can see he has no reaction to the first explosion as he calmly walks away.&quot; Upon watching the video myself, that&#39;s not the case at all. He&#39;s still standing outside of Forum when the first bomb goes off. His head whips to the left just like everybody else around <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPXOLWVC9rE&amp;amp;t=7m40s">7:40</a>. He starts slowly backing off and then turns and looks back a couple of times before taking off running like everyone else. Keep in mind the explosions between Marathon Sports &amp; Forum was a mere 10ish seconds apart. He was cutting it awfully close time-wise for knowing what was about to happen. Don&#39;t get me wrong, his body language is different than the other spectators, but there did seem to be some element of surprise in his reaction.</p>

<p>EDIT: Looks like he slips the backpack off around <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPXOLWVC9rE&amp;amp;t=3m44s">3:44</a>. Forgot to add that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When he first walks up he has the bag on his right shoulder and when he gets to his spot he sets it down (3:44). It&#39;s pretty clear to me. Before the first explosion he paces to the right in anticipation just after getting off the phone (7:25). If he controls the detonation of his bag, he could have known he was a safe distance before pressing the button. He even looks back just before it goes off. It&#39;s possible he didn&#39;t know and abandoned his bag in fear, but it&#39;s impossible to know for sure. This video seems like solid evidence to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Said lawyer made a statement to the media regarding the guilt of said lawyer&#39;s client. Think about that a moment. Did said lawyer get disbarred for violating attorney-client privilege? I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve ever met a practicing attorney that was willing to go on record with the media regarding his client&#39;s guilt as a trial was ongoing, or even after a trial was concluded, because attorney-client privilege. This implies (to me at least) that whoever was quoted as saying this isnt really his attorney, or maybe America needed a new Goldstein for the ol&#39; 2 minutes hate. </p>
