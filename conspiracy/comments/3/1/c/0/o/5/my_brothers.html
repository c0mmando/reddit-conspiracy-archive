       Boy this thing is getting dved to shit and back. Why? Open discussions not welcome around here? Geez, i swear, Apirl fools and following week is just a disjointed cluster fuck around here. But the good clean fight metaphor might've thrown ppl off. Lord knows metaphors must be literal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's my opinons on somethings:
      </p>
      <p>
       Satan is real
      </p>
      <p>
       Nazis inflitrated the US through thier connections and close friends in the US to prevert the nation into the current state.
      </p>
      <p>
       LBJ ordered JFKs death. JFK Jr. was murdered as well. Bush wasn't the one to pull the trigger, his daddy was a hitman, Jr. was never up to his father's expectations, and i doubt he trusted Jr. to the job. So, the "instructor" was cia, and hilled jfk jr. He then parachutted to safety, as why the hell it required the assassian to die in that theory makes 0 sense to anyone that knows shit about planes.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 was planned by the dod and the intelligence networks as a shadow coup that was warned about by JFK and Ford, amongst others. When Ford thinks things are getting too industerial, well, i mean, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       The earth isn't what we think it is. Idk if it's flat, i don't buy that, though the flat earth theory stuff is facinating. But i have yet to see anything to covience me space is just simply space. And I studied alot of space. Always found it facinating.
      </p>
      <p>
       To answer the
       <a href="/u/leagueofshadowbanned">
        /u/leagueofshadowbanned
       </a>
       on who are the fart sounds, they are the mic (military industerial complex) and the true masters of that pyramid are not known to the public. If knowledge is power, then to be unknown is to be invincable.
      </p>
      <p>
       The antichrist is alive and well on earth. Idk who he is.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're already in the tribulation. But since most of us are first worlders, we don't feel it or see it like it really is. Everything is in rose colored glasses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus is the messiah. I know that's not popular on the net or these parts for sure, but you asked my opinion, and that's what I think.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US MIC had the Ironman movies made and made sure they were allstar line up and production so when the miltary introduces them talos suits, ppl will think "cool" instead of "omfg"
      </p>
      <p>
       depnding on how well this is received, I will either continue, or bitch about how ppl don't know how to reddit. It's really up to you, the fans, to decide.

       I know this is a really stupid reason to believe that LBJ ordered JFK's death, but James Lee Burke wrote about it in some book (fictional, of course) and so much of what was offhand backstory spook anecdotes by someone shooting the shit in his books turned out to be true years later.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, that recording of LBJ &amp; Jackie a week after JFK's death was just...unsettling. Made me dig a little and discover one of my favorite pet conspiracy theories of all time -

       Well here is my opinion.
I feel like this place is just flooded with links and videos, we've lost our roots as a thinking ground, now its just copy and paste a video/article and then some comments on how the post is wrong or how its kinda right, no one shares ideas or thoughts, We need to get the gears moving again, we need to separate the real from the disinformation, we need find the information that tells us nothing and get it out of this place. if someone argues with you about a thread just be polite, you will see how far that gets you! Its up to us. Everything seems so predictable now, no one wants to help or encourage anything here, well a very small amount of people do, its like we have almost 300,000 people who are subscribed to this sub yet i only see a few hundred on here at a time. We need to have a revolution in this sub. We are FREE THINKERS not nut jobs, or tinfoil's.

       I do enjoy the nicknames, its what makes us well us. But at the end of the day we are Free thinkers.
But not here, not anymore. I don't want to give up on this place, you guys made me see my life through a whole new perspective, i went down the rabbit hole..it sucked pretty bad, i made my way out and i plan to tell everyone i meet about the truth. But the first thing i want to do is get this sub back.

       Way pass them, look into the old families of history. Mainly the ones who have had ties to the Vatican.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldobrandini_family">
        This should get you started.

       Do you think that the Vatican and other religions are a front for something, perhaps something sinister?
What i don't understand is why the Vatican wont allow access to there library, only if they let you? If they are really here to help us be good people in the eyes of the creator than why wont they share knowledge with us open and freely?

       I'm not sure what sinister you are talking about. If you are implying super natural, idk. But if you are implying these families and the Vatican manipulated humanity for their interest and not the people, than yes, sinister in deed.

       Knowledge is true power, money just helps and these people have plenty of knowledge and money. The Vatican is the oldest corporation and the Pope is the CEO. That family I mentioned got rich because a member later got into the Vatican as Pope. He then got other members in and you can imagine what they stole or looted which is now in their vaults. It's families like these that have the true power, not Bill Gates and other insanely rich people. They know nothing.

       Yes i see what you mean about not putting all your cards on the table, but i want people to not be afraid of thinking out loud, so to speak.
But yes, that's more plausible, but you cant rule anything out.
I'm just looking for the truth.

       I'm not personally a believer.  I just wanted to make that clear so that I don't offend anyone here.  This is just what I think.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also for the record, I respect that Pope Francis does not live in the luxury that is available, but prefers to live as he always has with humility only requiring basic needs.  In addition, he .. encouraged others in the church to follow suit, to give up their lavish cars, mansions, etc..
      </p>
      <p>
       Which only seems fitting to me, since the church is supposed to be serving the people and the needy, yet as time went on through the centuries high position and greater access to wealth (coming from all classes, but primarily the poor), imo, turned the Catholic church into just another 'corporation' with greed, envy and lust.  With exception to Pope Francis and his appearance of being genuine, I just see the wealthiest tax-exempt entity / sovereignty on the planet.  At this point I don't see how the Pope could possibly end centuries old corruption in the making throughout the massive infrastructure.  Granted I'm very jaded, I'm fairly well read in the history of religion because I find faith itself to be fascinating (I do not claim to be an expert in any way).  And I'm not even going to talk about the child molestation / trauma because that just makes me angry.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to why a massive amount of material isn't available to everyone, I can only speculate that the information found would either debunk Christianity, or reveal what its' structure was intended to be so told by prominent figures in their history that people would respond to.. Which wouldn't be sitting on mountains of obscene wealth while 'good Christians' are in poverty.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not singling them out in that regard.  It's much like large corporations and the governments they puppet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe that
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       of them are corrupt - just like any other giant entity.  Just most.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are they a front for something sinister?  I have no knowledge or speculation in that area.  I think that would be interesting to dig into though.  I hope someone does.

       Anything you have to say about the current pope is moot. He is a Jesuit (first in papal history!) and there for a reason. Look into it, I have. As Roosevelt said, nothing in politics happens without a reason, paraphrasing. The oldest conspiracy is the Vatican.

       Hmm.. The metaphor breaks down at some point. ;)
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess what I'm saying is that it's probably counterproductive to tell too much truth all at once, because it can just sound crazy pants. It's like layers of an onion.

       Look into the papacy and the CHURCH. Jesus of Nazareth is a lie, fabricated by the Flavian's. As soon as people know this, they will know they've been played. Christ was real, but in a different era. Jesus of Nazareth was not Christ, just a fictitious story. Happy falling.

       omg, this is awesome. you're in for a real treat. If you've ever played star ocean, it follows that premise. But it's not scifi stuff. There's actual facts to back it up. I'mma do a quick search now and line up what i think are some of the best presentation.

       And my own persepctive as a finallie, cause if all i did was link, that wouldn't be thinking for myself much. But what it suggests is that all of our existance, is a simulation, and nothing more than data feed to our brains. Our brains are infact part of this simulation, and everything around us is basically the sims. We have a matter of free will, but the player can effect the simulation. In a simulation you have absolutes. You can only go so high, so hot, so low, so cold, and all those things have been proven to exist. There are boundies and rules to existance, and we call them the laws of physics. Not theories which are now proposed to be fact in the modern religion of science. I'm talkin old school, we only call it fact when it's law, and theories are fine, but never presented as docturine. Anyways, the constants in the universe are the strongest evidence that the world we live in, was designed. So as a believer, sim theory makes perfect sense to me. Ppl in the day referred to works of God through stone, because that's what they worked with. Now we do it through works of digital because that's what we work with.

       if this is true.
What are your thoughts on the fart noise and this matter, do you think they could be manipulating this, or perhaps even more? This is just a little speculation, for my curiosity.

       I can see it from a few diffrent angles.
      </p>
      <p>
       if life is a simulation, then ...
      </p>
      <p>
       a) Every good story needs a good villian. And as the matrix showed us, the system itself being the villian makes a great story. So, if reality is just a computer sim program, there's no reason there wouldn't be a story, an artistic touch, to the program.
      </p>
      <p>
       b) Tptb are brains in glass, and they actually are in computers that monitor all this stuff. Like the Riddler said...
      </p>
      <p>
       c) The real powers that be arn't the fart noise we think they are. They would be defined as our "programmers", those that made this thing. And if we're really just a game, then also our player(s) become paramount in this as well. And if ya think about it, what if the programmer programmed a creation that was suppose to be all peaceful and nice, but the player wrecked it. Is that player now Satan? Things to think about o.o;
      </p>
      <p>
       d) we made the sim, so we are tptb. We don't know it because we programmed it to where we wouldn't recall such information until the simuation was over (aka death)

       I believe. Shit. Down the rabbit hole we go -
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that we were genetically engineered as humans (hence the missing link in evolution) by an advanced race or species or group of species in an attempt to use us as workmen on this planet. (See Michael Tellinger for in depth analysis of Southern Africa (where evolution is supposedly traced back to).  From here we evolved at an unforeseen level and became what we know today. However before what we know there were advanced civilisations mixing on earth. Egypt and Sumeria are commonly referred to as the start of modern civilisation but are classed differently in scientific circles as stair step evolution. These cultures depicted a number of strange looking 'humans' as pharaohs, Kings and priests (most notable -Arkhenaten) and supposedly built structures still physically and mechanically impossible today. However before these cultures existed greater cultures of Atlantis and Lumeria. The location of these great cultures could exist in either of two places throughout the pacific or Antarctica.
      </p>
      <p>
       Version 1. The islands / land mass between Hawaii to New Zealand was once above land and the largest most advanced civilisation on earth. Due to rising ocean levels or falling land they escaped their home and spread out through the world. Two observations lead me towards this theory - the flora and fauna along the entire pacific line is similar, the people are similar as well.. Very similar. It also seems logical that a essentially half asian half black race (my description of Pacific Islanders) could evolve into three distinct races throughout the world - based on location. Black , Asian and White.
      </p>
      <p>
       Version 2. Check Piri Res Map 1501. Accurately depicts Antarctic land before the ice shelf - according to US Airforce seismic data. The author of the map claims to have used current and ancient sources at the time to construct the map. This indicates advanced civilisation and transport and mapping technology before 4000BC - an unheard of theory according to 'ancient history'. The people of Antarctica (Atlantis) had to leave the area during the past ice age as global warming heated the planet raised ocean levels and brought about a ice age due to lack of sunlight back and fourth through the now dust filled black atmosphere. Aka this is why Atlantis 'sank' into the ocean. It was frozen below.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way. The power of the world remains in the same hands throughout thousands of years. The Egyptian royalty were mixing with Greek Roman and Persian royalty as well as incestuously with one another  in an attempt to keep these blood lines 'clean'. Hence why a number of traditions and gods and stories which form our ancient and modern day culture religion and esoteric ideas are repeated from past culture and religion (see egyptian gods to Greek gods, see Sumeria to Christianity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Post Egypt in the height of Roman rule, the royalty moved towards Britain and Spain and they say 'the rest is history'. This is why China is currently seen as a major threat to western world culture (although by now the Chinese have likely been infiltrated) - although they shared and were influenced by these cultures they remain separate. (Again if you use version 1 - it makes sense why there are pyramids all throughout China)
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's what I believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fucking 'bankers' are just Egyptian, Sumerian and Atlantean royalty
