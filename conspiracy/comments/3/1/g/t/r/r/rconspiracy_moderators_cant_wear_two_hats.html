Lately there has some discussion about the mods be able to moderate the sub and being able to advocate their personal beliefs. There should be some guidelines on limiting this.</p>

<p>Im cool with moderators having their own opinions, but in the regular  queue.</p>

<p>They should not be able to sticky there own stuff and make any effort to promote their own opinions or beliefs. Also I dont think they should be making contributions themselves when it comes to AMA&#39;s and Best conspiracy videos simply because they are in a position of power and it can be abused. </p>

<p>Im ok with these things but the mods should be taking content from the community not submitting their own even though other members of the community.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/31dy9y/the_first_official_rconspiracy_podcast_is_now/">r/conspiracy podcast</a> is a clear example of this. There should be no possibility of them submitting something like this themselves and stickying it or collecting comments to gather support for or against it because it can be clearly manipulated by vote bridaging or just having regular users wanted to look good to the mods. its a clear abuse of power and it really does not to stop.</p>

<p>To be honest, this two hat point is probably mostly due to how moderators are selected for this forum - afaik, they&#39;re generally content posters who are active, and are voted for by the community to become moderators.</p>

<p>So, you&#39;ve got a long time poster who generally does well, receives up votes, gets discussions started. Then the community votes this person into a position of moderation because they&#39;re well known. Then you expect the them be impartial, magically, from that point on? Even though their impartial behaviour that has rewarded them to this point, is the very behaviour that made them a moderator?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they should just submit this sort of thing normally, at least for now. I think it&#39;s fine for mods to have opinions, but they should take the mod hats off when they want to get their hands dirty, and post like any other user, and let the community take it from there. The only time time names should be highlighted or posts stickied are when someone is performing official moderator duties.</p>

<p>No thats incorrect. People are voted in because the are trying to make the world a better place by the content that they post. If they really are wanting to make things better then they will see this for what it really is and agree that they should not be in a position to promote their own views. If they dont, then they dont deserve to be a moderator.</p>

<p>No Im asking them to not use the position to promote their views, they are still free to post, but not be able to, Sticky their own posts, bring in AMA&#39;s and post videos of their own personal views. Thats not much to ask. Post, but dont use moderator tools to promote your own views.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there are too many babies in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. For some reason people think they own reddit - especially this sub. The moderators can do whatever the hell they want with this sub, so long as they don&#39;t break the rules of reddit. And Reddit is well within their rights to ban users, delete comments, post native ads, and censor the ideas they want. This is their website. </p>

<p>Certainly users are free to express their concerns, but its kind of annoying when a simple podcast gets so much criticism for no reason at all.  </p>

<p>I visit this sub because I know the moderators aren&#39;t ban happy and are generally opposed to censorship. Here lately there has been quite a bit of posts whining about this or that, and I just felt the need to express my opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im sorry you see it that way.
My goal is to make sure that we are not being represented in a negative way. and I feel like we should have say on those things.
The mods are doing things I dont agree with and cannot support. Especially if they dont even have a dialog about it. as of right now they dont even respond to these issues.</p>

<p>Leaders are suppose to help the direction of the group by listening to the people they are leading and make sure there decisions benefit the not just themselves, but the group as well. Some of their decisions dont represent us, and I feel i have to hold them to account.</p>

<p>I think that generally the mods here do a good job. Flytape is somewhat of an instigator and he was the one who stickied the podcast post, although I think to sticky a post it has to be confirmed by two or more mods (don&#39;t quote me though)</p>

I agree they do do a good job.
Their needs to be discussion on what is and isnt acceptable for mods to be doing though when it comes to promoting their own views above others.</p>

<p>Thats all I am asking for. And if there isnt a change in this, then I will be the first one to leave this sub.</p>

<p>There has to be some ground rules on this I dont want people in a position of power having the perception of speaking for the community if they can&#39;t hold them selves to certain standards. Thats all im asking.</p>

<p>Mods need to be using moderator tools for posts in the community, not for their own adgendas. Thats it. real simple.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then we are definitely in agreement. </p>

<p>I hadn&#39;t actually clicked the YouTube link of the podcast until right now and it was seriously cringe worthy. The problem though is that they referred to it as the &quot;official&quot; <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> podcast and then makes the thumbnail for the a Nazi reddit alien. Definitely sends up immediate red flags.</p>

<p>I think what&#39;s important is to have a vocal and active userbase loudly chastising and ostracizing these mods. If these mods do not represent the community at large here (I really hope they don&#39;t) then we need to make it crystal clear that they do <em>not</em> represent the community and criticize them and make it clear to others that this is not what the community is about.</p>

<p>Once again, this is the hundredth post about the mods here. The fact that there are so many threads over the coarse of the last few years is enough to likely see that some abuse of power has quite clearly occurred.</p>

<p>The fact remains, there&#39;s not a single thing you can do about it. </p>

<p>The mods here will mock you, ignore any points, and then later find a good enough reason to ban you if you give them a glimmer of a reason to do so.</p>

<p>Just find a new place to go. Cause no matter what you do here....the mods have untouchable control over this sub, and you have a literal none.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>just r/conspiracy. Its not the way the moderate, its the way they use moderator tools to promote their own stuff, I.E sticking, AMA&#39;s and Documentaries</p>

<p>IMHO I think those tools should be used for community bring what the community thinks should come to light, not use it for their own stuff without getting some kind of consensus. </p>

<p>I remember I created a post I thought everybody should know about, I didnt get to have it stickied, which is fine, but mods can just do it with out much trouble for stuff they think is important. </p>

<p>No thats incorrect. People are voted in because the are trying to make the world a better place by the content that they post. If they really are wanting to make things better then they will see this for what it really is and agree that they should not be in a position to promote their own views. If they dont, then they dont deserve to be a moderator.</p>

<p>After all of this, we then ask them to be impartial as if in a vacuum - that their previous reinforced behaviours that have made them successful, some of which have been over a significantly long time, be ignored for an ideal of impartiality?</p>

<p>No Im asking them to not use the position to promote their views, they are still free to post, but not be able to, Sticky their own posts, bring in AMA&#39;s and post videos of their own personal views. Thats not much to ask. Post, but dont use moderator tools to promote your own views.</p>
