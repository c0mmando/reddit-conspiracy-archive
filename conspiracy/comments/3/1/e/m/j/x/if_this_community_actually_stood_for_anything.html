       The argument is the rules are becoming either far too specific (no police videos in
       <a href="/r/videos">
        /r/videos
       </a>
       , really?) Or too vague (
       <em>
        recent politics
       </em>
       in TIL, etc) in order for mods to prune their front pages to suit particular interests.

       This guy comes from "top minds" of reddit, a subreddit dedicated to mocking people. Because in that subreddit they actually feel like they are the smartest people (since they believe in the cookie-cutter theories that the mainstream media convinces the peasants they came up with themselves).
      </p>
      <p>
       They are all very insecure and the only way they can handle outside-of-the-box thinking is to circlejerk with each other about how "stupid" all of us are that live outside of that mainstream box.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to show how "smart" they are, they troll r/conspiracy and demand evidence that they don't even care about because they have already come here with the thought in their mind that we are idiots and everything we say is crazy. So no matter what you show them, they will simply find an excuse to ignore it or dismiss it. Which is super easy for them because they can just bring it to their troll-cave and say "hey guise, look what conspiracy said" and everyone will mock it without even bothering to read it.

       This is incredible.. Okay, so I haven't been paying close enough attention to it. So show me how they are corporate puppets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's somewhere to start if you think they aren't just enforcing their subreddit rules..
      </p>
      <p>
       Part one: Show me a removed post that doesn't break the rules, or is on the very fringe of doing so. One that has a clear agenda as to why it has been removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part two: Show me a post
       <em>
        that has been reported to the mods.
       </em>
       That clearly breaks the rules, and is not removed due to showing a clear agenda as to why.

       I am not going to fall into this game. And I know you will attack me and say "you are unobjective and you won't even show me proof of what you are saying". Go ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you don't realize is that I have played this game before and the reality is that after a while, one gets tired of spending hours of their life digging around and then coming up with the evidence (that most certainly exists because I have seen it hundreds of times, not a few times) and then the person on the other end just raises the bar or dismisses it.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter how many times I prove it, someone else will always come out and demand that they personally see it too.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you actually believe that "mods are just innocently enforcing the rules", then you actually believe that we are too stupid the notice the END RESULT which looks a hell-of-a-lot like the same narrative that all of the mainstream media channels push. WOW, what a coincidence!
      </p>
      <p>
       We aren't retarded. We can look at the end result alone and correctly make assumptions even if there were not truck-loads of evidence pointing to mods SELECTIVELY ENFORCING the rules and rules that have been PURPOSELY WORDED so as to be left open to interpretation.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all part of a much bigger system that paints an extremely clear picture. So while you look at one small aspect and harp on the simplest and most thought-reducing explanation for it, the rest of us are far past it. We literally have no time to bring you up to speed if you are still stuck way back there.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are talking trigonometry and you are over here still arguing about division and trying to convince us we are doing it wrong. And since our trig equations are coming out correct, we know we are doing the division correctly. The proof is in the pudding.

       My god you are pompous. I genuinely didn't think that I was going to get
       <strong>
        that
       </strong>
       response. But fair enough, I'm just a sheep, I can't possibly comprehend the inner workings of a top mind such as yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'm going to ask again, because that's what this sub is about ("I'm just asking questions
       <sup>
        TM").
       </sup>
       What proof do you have that the mods are serving as corperate puppets? The two points I supplied should be fairly easy to address if there is some giant censorship of an idealogy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either that, or you can go on another ad-homeniem rant about how you are so much further ahead of me in your thinking, providing no proof to base it on.

       So again nothing to back up what you said? What a fucking suprise you created a sub where the premises aren't allowed to be questioned. That way you can just ban people when they speak up, not have to do this big dance around the fact that you've got fuck all.

       <a href="/r/undelete">
        /r/undelete

       , I haven't got a satsifying response what so ever. All I've seen is, "Duhh! Its just

       the mods are bought and paid for you dumb fuck."

       1.A post that should have been removed, that wasn't (and reported). And shows a corperate agenda.
