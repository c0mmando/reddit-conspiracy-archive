<p>The mods can and will do whatever they want. They have no obligation to us. People will keep posting here, even if all the open minded people leave. Especially if they leave.</p>

<p>The mods want to drive away the intelligent users, because we see a corrupt mod who has abused his power in the past being <strong>defended</strong> by other mods for <em>doing it again</em>! </p>

<p>There are posters coming out of the woodwork to belittle the discussion trying to take place, and why? Who benefits? Flytape is the only person who benefits here. And I guess whoever is trying to shape our community&#39;s &quot;beliefs.&quot;</p>

<p>Ever wonder what would happen if someone went on a podcast, saying they were speaking for this community, and made statements that could be interpreted as terroristic threats against the U.S. government? </p>

<p>Still have yet to hear a single answer why. The question is completely fair, especially in this sub. </p>

<p>The podcast was a really, really sketchy move. The wanton banning as well. </p>

<p>I am open to a completely reasonable explanation for how this all turned out. But the aggressive scapegoating, rhetorical manipulation, and condescending dismissiveness towards anyone asking the questions has me more suspicious than the original issue itself. </p>

<p>So 2 users getting banned warrants the use of the word &quot;wanton&quot;?</p>

<p>That was a mistake which was reversed by the others mods the moment it came to our attention.</p>

<p>Flytape, as a result, has lost his banning privileges. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the banning wasn&#39;t as big a deal as I thought, that&#39;s fair.</p>

<p>However, that still doesn&#39;t address the ludicrous podcast and the reaction to it. As far as &quot;exactly how this &#39;outrage&#39; is being expressed&quot; - that&#39;s nonsense.</p>

<p>My comment is that people with legitimate concerns are being dismissed and scapegoated and your response is literally to dismiss it and scapegoat it. Come on now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The podcast issue was dealt with. I never once expressed an ounce of support for that. That&#39;s not even why Flytape was removed as moderator. Flytape&#39;s moderating privileges have been neutered as a result.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sub certainly has bigger fish to fry, which is why it&#39;s so frustrating that there&#39;s no transparency here. People who attempt to bring out the actual issues are dismissed as intruders looking to stir up trouble or told that their opinion doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>You now are saying it&#39;s just dealt with. Clearly it has not been dealt with to the satisfaction of the community. If the mods&#39; official view is that the community&#39;s wishes are irrelevant, they should be clear about that.</p>

<p>In my view, completely ignoring the issue by claiming it&#39;s just over, or delegitimizing it through scapegoating is <strong>exactly</strong> the kind of thing that makes this sub feel...compromised in some form. I&#39;m not saying that to you specifically, but something about this whole situation just stinks.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen it posted a few times around this discussion that flytape has a unique ability to sniff out trolls and shills. Isn&#39;t the podcast the exact kind of action that makes this sub seem like an unhinged group of lunatics? It reeks of an attempt to make the sub look bad.</p>

<p>But maybe it&#39;s not, that&#39;s fair. Maybe it was just an awful attempt at making a podcast. Even if that&#39;s true, the podcast plus the banning that happened afterwards says to a lot of the users that flytape should not be trusted with a moderator position.</p>

<p>The other mods insistence that he be reinstated is a blatant example of ACTUAL top-down conspiring against the wishes of a huge chunk users of the subreddit. Who have then all been casually dismissed.</p>

<p>This is a small group of power users protecting each other while hiding the <em>why</em> from the regular users. </p>

<p>So I ask again, why was he reinstated and how are the users supposed to trust this community at all?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what your saying is that this sub is completely compromised? Enough so to quiet a majority of people here who actually approve of FlyTape being reinstated?  Is that really what you believe?  This sub has double the number of subscribers then SRD, So The Math On Them Being Able To Hijack A Post Here over genuine <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users Is Very Dubious. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a very dangerous mindset as a mod to think that anytime a post which you support isn&#39;t supported by this sub to simply blame it on vote brigades and SRD, when the truth is likely that the sub just doesn&#39;t agree with you.</p>

<p>Let me guess, this post demanding transparency by the mods which is doing well is also being brigaded by SRD too, right?  Lol you are really something else.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>who actually approve of FlyTape being reinstated</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The thing is, it&#39;s the names I <em>recognize</em> who are dismissing this debacle as drama and nonsense.</p>

<p>There&#39;s been a massive influx of &quot;new&quot; users that have hopped on the flytape hate train, and <em>that&#39;s</em> what&#39;s made me suspicious.</p>

<p>Also, your reading into my statement is somewhat disingenuous.</p>

<p>SRD may have fewer subscribers, but the fact is they have <em>170,000</em>. I&#39;m willing to wager that many of those subscribers are more active (and pathetic) compared to the 300k here, many of whom no longer participate in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>anytime a post which you support isn&#39;t supported by this sub</p>

<p>Again, the legitimate and long-standing users seem to overwhelmingly support us.</p>

<p>And as for the picture, it&#39;s supposed to show why Flytape should be further investigated before his mod status is reinstated. There have been other instances with pictures (I&#39;ll look when I get home, I&#39;m at work on mobile) where Flytape had been involved in some shady stuff years ago and I really am getting nervous that this move may seriously splinter this community. Do the mods want that? I like to think not, but some people in here think they do. That&#39;s why I think the transparency is important and showing who voted for Fly would be a gesture of good will. That&#39;s just my two cents though.</p>

<p>Seriously dude.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure the mod mail appeal was equally swift.  We have to do something to maintain order around here and as I said in the link above.</p>

<p>This is exactly how we are treated by reddit at large and we won&#39;t do the same to others.  You guys are the first ones coming to us in mod mail when some anti-conspiracy redditor is in here talking down to people and generally treating people like shit.   Obviously you were forgiven for your actions that day but apparently you still hold a grudge against me for something that happened a month ago...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the modmail was equally swift and the situation was resolved very well, but not with you. It was assuredly I believe who lifted the ban, you were particularity curt with me which is fine but I was a little annoyed because I am here all the time and I felt like I was considered &quot;a shill&quot; because I had watched Karen for over a year before the AMA was announced and realized how much she had changed her message and had a hard time coming up with any evidence on the few times I had personal exchanges with her.</p>

<p>That being said, I&#39;m sure you guys do get mod mail from people complaining about shills all the time, but you guys signed up for this. If it was that bad, why would anyone stay? The reason is because of the power mods have over regular users and the ability to ban people for whatever reason they like.</p>

<p>Showing once again that they&#39;re obsessive psychopaths who have nothing better to do than stalk users of this subreddit. </p>

<p>The thing is, it&#39;s the names I recognize who are dismissing this debacle as drama and nonsense.
There&#39;s been a massive influx of &quot;new&quot; users that have hopped on the flytape hate train, and that&#39;s what&#39;s made me suspicious.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with you that there are quite a few newerish users who are actively voicing their displeasure with it.  I have seen familiar ones as well voicing their sentiments for and against as well.  </p>

<p>To me, it just seems that there&#39;s a clear and convincing pattern of  FlyTape making bad decisions which have made this sub look bad on several different occasions.  How many more bad decisions do the other mods really need to see in order for you guys to realize that he&#39;s probably not an ideal person to represent the sub?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m willing to wager that many of those subscribers are more active (and pathetic) compared to the 300k here, many of whom no longer participate in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how you could possibly know that unless you yourself are active in both subs.  If I&#39;m wrong, and there&#39;s some way to quantify the number of active users vs. the number of inactive users in a particular sub, I&#39;d be very interested to see that data.  What percentage of subscribers here would you say were inactive?  More then 30%? </p>

<p>I just think because of FlyTape&#39;s history of poor decision making here, that there&#39;s a better chance that it was indeed this sub organically making their unhappiness with him then vote brigades from SRD.  The number of subscribers here outnumbers the number of subscribers there 2:1, meaning 2 subscribers from that sub would need to vote for every vote here.  Despite your claim of this sub having less active subscribers, the numbers still don&#39;t add up unless you&#39;re saying that more then 50% of the subscribers here are inactive.   If 10 or 20 percent of the users here were inactive, it&#39;s still not enough statistically for SRD to hijack this sub very easily.  </p>

<p>I also still haven&#39;t heard a good reason as to why they are even out for blood?  What did FlyTape do to them that would deserve such an effort as your claiming?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is the type of being is that despite the other contingents weighing in, there are still enough people from this sub to have countered it out.  Mods can make mistakes.   But when its not the first time, and the mistake involves banning someone for personel reasons, than you have no business being a mod, or having the ability to ban someone.  Its that type of behavior that has lead to the splitting of time between here and other sites.  If that is the goal, I would say stay the course its working.  If the goal is to heal the black eye this site has, I would suggest a different approach.  Respectfully.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sub certainly has bigger fish to fry, which is why it&#39;s so frustrating that there&#39;s no transparency here. People who attempt to bring out the actual issues are dismissed as intruders looking to stir up trouble or told that their opinion doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>You now are saying it&#39;s just dealt with. Clearly it has not been dealt with to the satisfaction of the community. If the mods&#39; official view is that the community&#39;s wishes are irrelevant, they should be clear about that.</p>

<p>In my view, completely ignoring the issue by claiming it&#39;s just over, or delegitimizing it through scapegoating is <strong>exactly</strong> the kind of thing that makes this sub feel...compromised in some form. I&#39;m not saying that to you specifically, but something about this whole situation just stinks.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen it posted a few times around this discussion that flytape has a unique ability to sniff out trolls and shills. Isn&#39;t the podcast the exact kind of action that makes this sub seem like an unhinged group of lunatics? It reeks of an attempt to make the sub look bad.</p>

<p>But maybe it&#39;s not, that&#39;s fair. Maybe it was just an awful attempt at making a podcast. Even if that&#39;s true, the podcast plus the banning that happened afterwards says to a lot of the users that flytape should not be trusted with a moderator position.</p>

<p>The other mods insistence that he be reinstated is a blatant example of ACTUAL top-down conspiring against the wishes of a huge chunk users of the subreddit. Who have then all been casually dismissed.</p>

<p>This is a small group of power users protecting each other while hiding the <em>why</em> from the regular users. </p>

<p>So I ask again, why was he reinstated and how are the users supposed to trust this community at all?</p>
