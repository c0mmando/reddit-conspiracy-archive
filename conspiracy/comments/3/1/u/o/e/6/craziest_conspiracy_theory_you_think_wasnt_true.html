<li><p>The illuminati does exist, and it comes in many names. One of the oldest institutions that still operate today, the Papacy, is the illuminati, and they are in firm control of this planet. From what I gather they have more power than ever. All of the governments of the world serve their Papal Masters. </p></li>
<li><p>Moon landings were faked. I now wholeheartedly believe that no country has ever set foot on the moon.</p></li>
<li><p>Here is where I will lose most of you. Spacewalks are faked. They are actually filmed underwater. All of the Space Agencies of the world are in on this. Many astronauts are actually Freemasons. It is not possible for humans to go into space. </p></li>

<p>STS 118: EVA officer states that they are &#39;water particles&#39; coming out of the airlock. Except these &#39;particles&#39; or should I say air bubbles, are being released all over the place. The kicker is at 2:00 you will actually see a SCUBA tank from within the airlock. Do a side by side with this <a href="http://www.padi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/NASA_Diver.jpg">image taken from NASA&#39;s buoyancy lab.</a> The SCUBA tank partially revealed in space looks very similar to the SCUBA tanks taken from the buoyancy lab.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It is just artifacts from cosmic rays hitting the camera&#39;s CCD</p></li>
<li><p>Video showing scuba footage on Russian Mission Control feed is standard practice to repeat issues on the ground. </p></li>

<p>Signing off with a quote from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhZk8ronces">John F. Kennedy&#39;s Secret Society Speech:</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence--on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations. Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>All major religions have a set or beliefs, rituals and rights for an elite priest class.</strong> </p>

<p>For example, take christianity. There is what they hand down in church for the peasant class. Then for the priest class there is a whole other world of arcane beliefs and practices. These rituals involve both human sacrifice and sex with children. In reading about the various tribal religions that existed before christianity, the only thing the christians didn&#39;t steal were the bizarre sex and sacrifice rights. That&#39;s it. If you&#39;re willing to consider that the pedophiles in the church are not only sanctioned but encouraged: then their behavior, volume and the fact that the church protects them makes sense. To relate this to Scientology - we know that the real teachings about Thetans and xenu are obscured from new recruits. You have to be in the church for years, have invested a considerable amount of money and be an auditor to learn about them. There is also &#39;Black Dianetics&#39; which is Hubbards inversing of the self help and self control techniques of Scietol. In Black Dianetics you practice dominating others. All the major religions, indeed any religion of note hides this one same terrible secret. </p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>1984 wasn&#39;t about the future</strong> </p>

<p>It was about the time it was written. It used a heavy hand and sci fi tropes to try and communicate not what the ruling class <em>would</em> do but rather what they <em>were</em> doing. Winstons job is the give away. Which leads me to my next point...</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>History changes over time.</strong> </p>

<p>The populist narrative of the 20th century is bullshit by design. Most of what we know before then is bullshit by decree. &quot;History is written by the victor&quot; is a concept that people in the west just assume only applies to those <em>other</em> countries, not us. Not here. But this isn&#39;t even necessarily about concealing the truth so much as not 100% knowing it. We don&#39;t have as firm a grasp on the events of history leading up till about 200 years ago as we like to imagine and &#39;what we know&#39; about the current era is the equivalent of educated guessing. Historians are brilliant people and their job is hard as fuck. It&#39;s a lot of research, investigation, cross referencing and guessing. I don&#39;t think that historians are the problem so much as the fact that academia in general is controlled. We all sort of accept that the stuff taught in grade school is a watered down white washed version of history but never really consider that this trend extends into higher education. I think unless you&#39;re actively invested in historical research the chances that what you know about the past being accurate are very close to 0%.  I think there is pressure to encapsulate the past into a digestible, convenient narrative for the current ruling party. I don&#39;t think Historians are &quot;in on it&quot; so much as they&#39;re just a cog in a corrupt system. The reason we keep digging up proof that changes our view of history is because <strong>history changes over time</strong> as new information and theories are introduced. With this in mind its wrong to treat history as a solid, believable narrative in general. It really is more like an evolving theory. But it isn&#39;t taught like that and I believe there is pressure to condense and simplify what we do know into an exploitable narrative.  But besides all that... let us not overlook that most of what people &#39;know&#39; about history comes from entertainment, not education. </p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Illuminati is an adjective not a noun.</strong> </p>

<p>This is the simplest truth you&#39;ll ever learn and it&#39;ll set you free. Illuminati means a light bulb going on, a sudden spark of inspiration, enlightenment and so on. Whether or not a bunch of old white men in bathrobes get together to drink blood and call themselves the illuminati doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s a word that describes figuring out how to elevate yourself above the common man. This is why and how Jay Z is Illuminati, the Rothchilds were illuminati, Clinton is illuminati and now so are you. The illuminati can recognize each other and they stick together to consolidate power. Any specific sub cult like Masonry, judaism, Christianity, the OTO, Satanism, Bilderburg or whatever is but an aggregate of enlightened not the root of them.  I pointed out in my first theory that I believe there are cults within cults with their own power structure and rules. I don&#39;t necessarily think this means that these rituals have actual magic powers or mean anything or that there is one underlying sub cult that controls the world. So whether or not the people who get into these positions of power utilize black magick is pretty much just window dressing. Once you accept that illuminati is not an organized group of people but rather a description (like calling someone an artist, a businessman and so on) then the specifics of how they do what they do are all just window dressing. </p>

<p><strong>5</strong>. <strong>We don&#39;t know what happened to Hitler.</strong> </p>

<p>Do you believe in the official story of Hitlers end days? What do you think it is? Why don&#39;t you look it up. I bet its not actually what you thought. In the early 1970s the UN admitted they had no clue what became of Hitler. WW2 in general is a pack of lies. I think in its simplest form Carlin was right when he said the Nazi&#39;s lost but the fascists won. If you look at operation gladio, paperclip and what the US did with former Nazi&#39;s in SA its pretty blatant. I don&#39;t thik this means that Nazi ideology specifically won. I don&#39;t really take political parties or specific religions very seriously in that regard. I think they generall exist as aggregators of like minded people and if they fall apart those people will move on to other niche groups. </p>

<p><strong>6.</strong> <strong>There is no democracy, capitalism, socialism, communism, corpocracy or oligarchy anymore</strong> </p>

<p>The actual system of governance and control being used by the current ruling class doesn&#39;t have a name, or at least not one that we know. We&#39;re chasing our tails throwing these empty isms at each other meanwhile those who took control of the media, the economy and all resources slowly developed a new mechanism for control and containment of a population that we literally don&#39;t have words for yet. Put simply: <strong>Mind control is real.</strong> Not in some tinfoil hat type way or microwave mind control beams. But rather the work of Edward Bernays. The career of Bernays is far more terrifying than the MK Ultra experiments, if you ask me. Also you don&#39;t need to <em>believe</em> in any fringe theory to know what he did and why. The information is all public domain. Between economic slavery (class sytem, the debt system), resource restrictions  and life long indoctrination through school and the media we&#39;re bred to be mindless automatons who consume, procreate and die. This isn&#39;t the machinations of a singular party, religion or cabal. It is the ultimate end goal of all ruling classes which brings me too...</p>

<p><strong>7. The Water Buffalo have always and will always run the world</strong></p>

<p>Like I pointed out with the Nazi&#39;s - people like this are interested in domination, power and control by any means necessary. If it means goose stepping, hailing satan, worshipping osiris or embracing the singularity - the endgame is always the same. Satanists don&#39;t run the world, lizards don&#39;t run the world, jews don&#39;t run the world, scientologists don&#39;t run the world, the Bush family doesn&#39;t run the world: Terrible people with bad ideas about what it means to be a human rule the world.</p>

<p>These terrible people self organize and have any number of little <a href="http://www.millennialfreemason.com/2008/07/pop-culture-and-freemasonry-flintstones.html">&quot;Water Buffalo&quot;</a> clubs of their own that they use to further their agenda. But the clubs themselves are meaningless. They&#39;re fashion statements.  This is the real Lesson of  &quot;The Stone Cutters&quot; episode of Simpsons: when the existing frame work, beliefs and tenents of an established frat are no longer desirable or the cult has been comprimised, the members  either start over or are surpassed by a competing cult. The symbols, characters, rituals and flavor of each individual club are of no real value to the members. The value is the power that you weild personally and how it grows exponentially through connecting with other high ranking members. That&#39;s it. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe in a massive over arching all powerful monolithic blood line conspiracy. I Believe the reality is dozens of cells of concentrated and combined powers toggling behind the scenes for their own piece of the pie. From the outside it appears to run like clockwork, like a simple linear plan dreamed up by a few people. This is because the motivations and methods of all these disparate groups are essentially the same and because they can pick up where others have left off. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The crazy one for me I assumed was bollocks until I looked more into it was more or less anthropological history. After looking deep enough into it, it&#39;s fairly obvious that most of the stories we&#39;re being fed, whether from science, religions, or otherwise are pretty much bullshit. There is soooooooo much more going on in early human history that we either just don&#39;t know or is being hid from us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the theory of evolution is probably a decently solid observation (I do not believe it a farce. Mind you, this is referring to the idea of evolution itself, not the origin of man as told by evolution). The evolution of man from ape I feel is... likely incorrect, at least for our species. Perhaps the great apes did evolve from lesser apes, which evolved from mammals, etc... I think people are all too willing to ignore the giant gaping holes in this theory as it applies to human evolution though.</p>

<p>I do not however believe this planet is young. As a matter of fact, I think civilization on this planet is much, much, much older than we are led to believe from both secular and religious history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m usually more of a govt.s are bastards rather than the more esoteric fringey theories, plus I think all religion is retarded as fuck so I naturally hate anything occultist or like supernatural or new age.</p>

<p>that said, I sort of dig the inspired ape ideology like the jump to linguistic thought and language and reason beyond instinct. Its a gap in my knowledge I dont get.</p>

<p>Thats just me though, and I am malleable, I&#39;ve met enough fucking shadow people and gnome elves to understand what is here might not be anything.</p>

<p>In the rational plane though, my arguments are more founded in justice than infinite truth. not everyone will look into the light, and we shouldnt be callous to those who don&#39;t/</p>

<p>thats where im at.</p>

<p>feel free to take the piss etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>occultism has nothing to do with those that follow their particular religion. they&#39;re just intertwined because the high ups of each respective religion have their arcane beliefs (Luciferianism). </p>

<p>i agree, organized religion is shitty, and having any sort of hierarchical system setup within a religious belief of being good to one another doesn&#39;t make any sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, space is usually considered to start at the Karman line, or ~100km up. This is the point where aerodynamic drag is small enough that orbital speeds are required to create enough lift to fly. Sure, there is atmosphere there, but it is extremely thin. ISS is at what, ~350km? It&#39;s definitely out in what I would consider space, even though it can also be considered inside of a layer of earth&#39;s atmosphere as well.</p>
