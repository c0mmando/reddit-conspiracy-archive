       Iran, Cold war V2, Syria chem attacks, Justin Bieber, the Interview/N Korea, missing planes, school shootings, Boston bombing, and whatever daily entertainment people subscribe to in order to escape reality, etc. They all distract from the current state of domestic surveillance, the entrenched shadow government,  FBI sponsored terror attacks, the further erosion of our rights, runaway income gap, free reign of corporations, unaccountable banks and wall street while the proof of fraud is overwhelming, impending climate change, pedo rings ran by the elite, aka all of our real problems, etc.

       Chomsky has said that the real importance of the original Cold War for both sides was that it kept the population under control and united against a common threat. No matter how bad things got or how corrupt the government it was all OK because we had to worry about the boogy man on the other side of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the Ukraine crisis, I think both sides are jumping to exploit the crisis to that end.

       They're preparing for an offensive in Ukraine. Mass conscription, military assets covertly and now openly being dumped into Ukraine, foreign troops from multiple countries. The demonization of Russia is for this reason. Right now they're helping Greece potentially leave the EU, they're making deals with Egypt and many other countries. The BRICS NDB is a direct threat to the central bankers. They
       <strong>
        have
       </strong>
       to make a move and while they're at it they can blame the upcoming collapse they've caused on Russia and the war. It's all about money, it always is.

In that time there have certainly been new revelations that have galvanized some people (Snowden) but they seem like a pretty small minority...

       The US has pushed NATO to the borders of Russia - partly because they could, it benefited them and eastern Europe was eager not to get bear-fucked by Russia in the future.
-Russia has a problem with that
      </p>
      <p>
       The EU has Ukraine in it's interest for a multitude of reasons, as does getting one more piece of Europe into the US-EU hegemony which would be Ukraine, which has a conflicted history with Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you are seeing now is an escalation of tensions between One Superpower and a regional power. This has fuck - all to do with controlling people. America's economy is growing so people will not pay attention in America. Western EU is always skeptical of Russia. The eastern bloc countries have a direct incentive to see Russia pushed into a corner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia is loosing it's grip on the CIS states and wants to maintain power. It's understandable. There is no magic. Naturally speaking though projecting an external enemy will embolden putin to do what he wants. A  war? Doubtfully. We already have a massive regional proxy war in the ME now

       I can watch the mainstream media and understand that within a minute, they spout what you just spouted out 24/7, however this is just like the cold war, and the cold war was used entirely for population control, there was never a threat of actual war.

       Bullshit there was not a threat of actual war. Sure, the government trumped up the horns and whistles to keep everyone onboard with the idea that communism was evil in order to support policies, but the reality was the same.

       The US had a containment policy ala George Kennan and the Soviets had the Brezhnev doctrine. Both countries had some pretty nefarious undertakings internally, but their foreign policy missions were not the response to the possibility of internal strife. Both countries were competing for a global hegemony and the US won.

       Honestly, I think this unfairly downplays the very real ideological conflict between the Soviets and the US. The USSR may not have been an ideal socialist state but there were many in the government who were "true believers" and thought that the imperialism they engaged in (in Eastern Europe) and subversive activities they funded around the world were fully justified to protect the people against Capitalist exploitation. Similarly we all know that the US was engaged in identical activities to protect the interests of  Capital owners (but also, in many peoples minds, to protect, freedom/liberty/etc). To state that it was all a ruse to control the respective domestic populations seems to ignore the proxy fights that happened all over the world - where ideologically driven factions were pitted against one another to further each sides world view.
