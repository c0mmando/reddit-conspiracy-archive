        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I found a term &#39;cryptohistory&#39;, thought it was interesting.  Googled &#39;cryptohistory wikipedia&#39;, found this.  &quot;Cryptohistory redirects to Pseudohistory&quot;.  Huh.  Bias much, wikipedia?</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudohistory#Goodrick-Clarke.27s_description_of_cryptohistory">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudohistory#Goodrick-Clarke.27s_description_of_cryptohistory</a></p></li>

</ul>

<p>Pseudointellectual encyclopedia entries innoculating would-be critical thinkers into believing that consensus reality is the correct reality, because those falling prey to &#39;cryptohistory&#39; are falling prey to &#39;distortion of history&#39; by the process of chaining equally loaded <em>words</em>.  See, &#39;pseudohistory&#39; is essentially the result of  <em>&quot;negationism&quot;</em>, which is a distortion of history.  So crypto (hidden / secret / altrenative) becomes pseudo (false / fraudulent) becomes negationism (the opposite of history).</p>

<p>By simply framing an alternative history as <em>pseudohistory</em>, a counterfactual distortion of the historical record before-the-fact, one can preempt any scholarly investigation of hard facts such as videographic evidence, witness testimony, declassified documents typically unread, unvailable to the public due to limited interest or access, by exploiting the implicit fear of ostracism and alienation by ones peers and the entire field of their research one would face by displaying any interest in associated exploratory endeavors.  </p>

<p><strong><em>It boils down to authoritarianism. And the poo-stick.</em></strong>  When we were little kids, we said things like &quot;gonna tell mommy&quot; and we put <em>poo</em> on a <em>stick</em> and threatened others to smear poo on you.  Because if you got <em>pooed</em>, then <em>no one would want to be near you.</em>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Calling things pseudohistory without evaluating them; similarly calling things &#39;conspiracy theories&#39; without evaluating them is academically and intellectually dishonest.  <em>It&#39;s the adult version of threatening with poo sticks...</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>...and appealing to authority of commonly held beliefs, of &#39;mob rule&#39;, the crowd--- only this mob is a bunch of a eggheads who invent all kinds of clever ad hominems, discreditings of authors of &#39;pseudohistory&#39;, just like a bunch of eggberts jabbing metaphorical word poo sticks at anyone who would dare challenge consensus realtiy.</p>

<p>In other words, <em>pseudohistory</em> is a nice little easter egg of a scholarly term that adds yet another layer of saran wrap around the stinking, vile, word-<em>turd</em> that is &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;, and the box that the wrapped turd goes in is &quot;negationaism&quot;, placed into the shipping container of &quot;distortion of history&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice.  I have a degree in Philosophy, so I guess <em>all</em> my college textbooks could have been called &quot;thinking critically&quot;.  :)  Perhaps in this sense, I received help in &quot;thinking critically&quot;, but I guess I was thinking more about it in the sense that I hadn&#39;t woken up to the government and ptb chicanery that exists on this planet until long after I graduated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay.  So &quot;crypto&quot; means &quot;hidden&quot; - not &quot;old&quot;.  Okay.  Good to know.  Good to be corrected on the incorrect thinking that I had on that word.  Will try to remember that.</p>

<p>I still prefer &quot;critical thinker&quot; to &quot;crypto-historian&quot; (I&#39;m not studying the &quot;history&quot; of crypto-thinking, after all.  I&#39;m studying the current aspects of it just as much if not more so), but it&#39;s at least better than the CIA cointelpro term &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;.</p>
