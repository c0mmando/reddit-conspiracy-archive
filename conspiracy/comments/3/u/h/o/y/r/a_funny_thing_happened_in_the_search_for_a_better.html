       I found a term 'cryptohistory', thought it was interesting.  Googled 'cryptohistory wikipedia', found this.  "Cryptohistory redirects to Pseudohistory".  Huh.  Bias much, wikipedia?

      </ul>
      <p>
       Pseudointellectual encyclopedia entries innoculating would-be critical thinkers into believing that consensus reality is the correct reality, because those falling prey to 'cryptohistory' are falling prey to 'distortion of history' by the process of chaining equally loaded
       <em>
        words
       </em>
       .  See, 'pseudohistory' is essentially the result of
       <em>
        "negationism"
       </em>
       , which is a distortion of history.  So crypto (hidden / secret / altrenative) becomes pseudo (false / fraudulent) becomes negationism (the opposite of history).
      </p>
      <p>
       By simply framing an alternative history as
       <em>
        pseudohistory
       </em>
       , a counterfactual distortion of the historical record before-the-fact, one can preempt any scholarly investigation of hard facts such as videographic evidence, witness testimony, declassified documents typically unread, unvailable to the public due to limited interest or access, by exploiting the implicit fear of ostracism and alienation by ones peers and the entire field of their research one would face by displaying any interest in associated exploratory endeavors.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <em>
         It boils down to authoritarianism. And the poo-stick.
        </em>
       </strong>
       When we were little kids, we said things like "gonna tell mommy" and we put
       <em>
        poo
       </em>
       on a
       <em>
        stick
       </em>
       and threatened others to smear poo on you.  Because if you got
       <em>
        pooed
       </em>
       , then
       <em>
        no one would want to be near you.
       </em>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Calling things pseudohistory without evaluating them; similarly calling things 'conspiracy theories' without evaluating them is academically and intellectually dishonest.
        <em>
         It's the adult version of threatening with poo sticks...
        </em>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       ...and appealing to authority of commonly held beliefs, of 'mob rule', the crowd--- only this mob is a bunch of a eggheads who invent all kinds of clever ad hominems, discreditings of authors of 'pseudohistory', just like a bunch of eggberts jabbing metaphorical word poo sticks at anyone who would dare challenge consensus realtiy.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words,
       <em>
        pseudohistory
       </em>
       is a nice little easter egg of a scholarly term that adds yet another layer of saran wrap around the stinking, vile, word-
       <em>
        turd
       </em>
       that is "conspiracy theory", and the box that the wrapped turd goes in is "negationaism", placed into the shipping container of "distortion of history".

       Nice.  I have a degree in Philosophy, so I guess
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       my college textbooks could have been called "thinking critically".  :)  Perhaps in this sense, I received help in "thinking critically", but I guess I was thinking more about it in the sense that I hadn't woken up to the government and ptb chicanery that exists on this planet until long after I graduated.

       "Crypto" implies/means "old" or related to history.  With "critical thinker", it doesn't matter where the information comes from or when it occurred.  It's all about treating
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       type of information as intelligently as possible regardless of whether it's historical or current.  That's why I prefer that term, since "critical thinker" is more broad in its scope and applies to how one regards really any type of information - past, present, or future.

       Okay.  So "crypto" means "hidden" - not "old".  Okay.  Good to know.  Good to be corrected on the incorrect thinking that I had on that word.  Will try to remember that.

      <p>
       I still prefer "critical thinker" to "crypto-historian" (I'm not studying the "history" of crypto-thinking, after all.  I'm studying the current aspects of it just as much if not more so), but it's at least better than the CIA cointelpro term "conspiracy theorist".

       It sucks there isn't an encyclopedia where you get to upvote revisional entries.  So cumblaster69's defintion might not be as good as vietnamEraResearcher46's

       Cryptohistory/Pseudohistory are actually historical accounts from alternate universes.  When the universe split circa the Bearenstein-Bearenstain Bears incident, some people were left stranded in the universe that was not their own.  You should be more respectful to the authors as they're merely trying to explain the timeline they came from and are under constant attack by the Lizard People.

       "Crypto" implies/means "old" or related to history.  With "critical thinker", it doesn't matter where the information comes from or when it occurred.  It's all about treating
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       type of information as intelligently as possible regardless of whether it's historical or current.  That's why I prefer that term, since "critical thinker" is more broad in its scope and applies to how one regards really any type of information - past, present, or future.
