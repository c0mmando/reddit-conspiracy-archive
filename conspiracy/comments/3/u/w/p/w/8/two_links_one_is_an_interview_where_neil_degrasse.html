       Apollo astronauts saying they couldn't see stars on the daylight side of the moon. Another "can't remember seeing any".

       Shit, I lived in Maine for a summer and the thing I remember the most is the stars. If I was on the moon, that would absolutely be one of the first thing's I would struck with. It would be an
       <em>
        unimaginably breathtaking
       </em>
       view of the stars.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to make this even more sketchy,
       <a href="https://youtu.be/5YjZ6zPs0ac?t=6m34s">
        here is an interview where Neil DeGrasse Tyson explains that you absolutely
        <em>
         would
        </em>
        be able to see stars from the moon, even in moon "daytime".
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And NDG was ironically trying to debunk a conspiracy theory, but ended up supporting an even bigger one. He was debunking the idea that no stars in the pictures is proof of a conspiracy. And he explains that YES, the stars ARE there, but not to
       <em>
        the camera
       </em>
       , because of the camera settings.

       I was thinking along these same lines.  You always see that typical photo of a reflective goldish coating on the front of a space suit helmet. That of course is to protect from the suns intensity.  It seems logical to me that coating would completely or almost completely block the very weak light from distant stars. Similar to a set of welding goggles that protect from the intense light of a welding arc, but they completely block out almost all ambient light before beginning the weld.  I see what you are trying to say.

       Well yes. It seems they used some very intense filters on the cameras, so it would stand to reason they would also need to protect the astronauts eyes from direct sunlight. They still could probably see the stars, if only faintly, and depending on which direction they were looking in relation to the sun or earth. You have to consider all these variables when thinking about this.

       I agree you would "faintly see them". But the claim is that they couldn't see them and the implication appears to be "because it was the daylight side".
      </p>
      <p>
       But NDG contradicts that while trying to debunk a different aspect of moon-deniers. Interesting slip-up. If that is what it was.

       I can imagine the filter on their visors would have to be very opaque to block out the DIRECT(no atmosphere) sun. In this picture you can see his face.

       This picture made me think of a movie I saw about mt Everest and they talked about people get to the top and take off their sunglasses and look around and fuck their vision up because it's so bright. The atmosphere is thinner and the sun reflects off of the snow and this is all a recipe for dying on the mountain because they're pretty much blind after a short time. Wouldn't the conditions on the moon be way worse for unprotected eyes?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now with this info in mind look at the picture and tell me why Armstrong isn't blind?

       I agree with you, but beyond that the whole point is moot.  Here is a picture of Armstrong with his visor up, standing in the shadow of the rover.

       To think that he wouldn't have seen the stars in those conditions is absolutely fucking ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, Tyson isn't the only person that has made the same assertion while debunking the moon hoax.  In fact, one of the primary moon landing defenders is Phil Plait and he said the exact same thing on his page dedicated to debunking:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/tv/foxapollo.html#stars">
        http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/tv/foxapollo.html#stars
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "On the Moon, the lack of air means that the sky is dark. Even when the Sun is high off the horizon during full day, the sky near it will be black. If you were standing on the Moon, you would indeed see stars, even during the day."
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, think of this - whenever the issue of stars comes up it usually has to do with the lack of stars in the photos - how does this get debunked?  No one ever says - oh you can't see the stars on the moon.  Nope, they always say they don't show up on film having to do with exposure, the implication being that the stars are in fact visible.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bottom line is that you would be able to see stars, and the fact that the claimed they couldn't is preposterous.

       I've never gotten a straight answer about this, i've read quotes from astronauts, listened to physicists talk about this and even asked professional astronomers. Never once have i gotten an answer that was consistent with what other "experts" said. It greatly disturbs me and really re-opens some parts of the space conspiracy ethos in my mind.

       NGD: "If you are there in the daytime of the moon
       <strong>
        you would see
       </strong>
       a full night sky of stars."
      </p>
      <p>
       He is talking about a person's eyes seeing a full night sky of stars and I don't think it is stretch to assume that a professional leading astronomer knows what he is talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       He didn't say "You
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       see a full night sky of stars but
       <em>
        won't
       </em>
       because of surface glare" and I believe he is an expert on the subject. So he wouldn't just "forget" that aspect if it was that large of a factor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the people in that thread are literally pulling reasons out of their butts. Once again, do we believe Joe Armchair on reddit, or one of the world's leading astronomers?

       Yes, he is a world famous astrophysicist, but he is not an Apollo astronaut... and that could very well be the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know cameras quite a bit and glare can lead to a lot of loss of detail around you. Sort of like when I have tried star shots from a city, the stars simply dont appear with my equipment. Its due to the glare from the city lights... The moon is much more reflective, so for me it works.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me, and its just my opinion of course, after the photos came back from either the Indian or Japanese probe to the Moon, the case for going there has been settled.
      </p>
      <p>
       But listen, I am not in any way trying to take away from your investigation and possible conclusions. In all honesty I wish you good luck and more connections that could be true!

       I also want to point out that we are not talking about the camera shots, and I think you are correct on that because my knowledge is very limited on that particular subject.

      <p>
       In the links I provided, the subject is simply the human eye. NDG is logically debunking the moon-denier claims of the star-less photos, but on the way mentions that the human eye would see stars. Directly conflicting with the stories of the astronauts.

       Because the Earth spins at about 1000kmh, it bulges in the middle. The circumference around the Equator is about 70km greater than the circumference around the poles. So it is an oblate spheroid, rather than perfectly spherical.

       Its hilarious because he was trying to mock a different aspect of moon-denial. And on his way through the logic, gave definitive proof that either the Apollo astronauts were lying, or what he learned in astronomy class is completely wrong. And that is BASIC astronomy.

       Moon gravity is much less than the earths.  Picking yourself up would be nearly effortless there.  I can see the footage looks weird but I wouldn't consider it to be proof of using strings or faking the landing.

       They're both right. Stars would be clearly visible during the lunar day, but whether you see them depends heavily on where you look. Facing away from the sun, straight up? Yeah, you'd see them. Can you see the Earth? Maybe you'll see them, maybe you won't. Does the lunar surface take up a good portion of your field of view? You probably won't see them. It all comes down to how much of the Sun's light is reaching your eyes, direct (BAD idea if you're in space) or reflected.

       Should you see stars in space?  When it comes to space we have very little ability to test it for ourselves.  We are left with what we are fed from official sources.  If they say it is one way and we cannot test, then we are left with a choice to accept or not.  But if they contradict themselves, then that is different.  On this particular topic we are presented with contradictions repeatedly.

       It is 2 hours long, but very detailed and worth watching.  The conclusion: you should not be able to see stars because you cannot see light itself, you need a medium in order to view light.

       Okay, deleted my first impulse comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the answer is that there are many contradictions. Some would call those contradictions evidence of sketchiness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shouldn't we change all the textbooks to reflect what the people who allegedly went to the moon say they saw or didn't see?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe NDG learned the wrong thing? Or just believes one side of the argument as opposed to the other astronomers who believe the exact opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sounds very questionable honestly. Very, very questionable. How could we not have an answer? Apparently people went there.

       My current opinion based on the evidence I have seen is that almost none of the material that NASA and other space agencies produce for the public is legitimate.  The available selections of pictures of the earth or satellites from space do not make sense given the technology we are told exists.  We have never sent a craft to the moon, we do not have any unmanned spaceships doing flybys of comets and planets.
      </p>
      <p>
       So then the question is why?  I am fairly certain that the nature of the universe is very different from what we have been told, our entire official cosmology is incorrect.  Likely Cyrus Teed was right:

       I went down the rabbit hole with Cellular Cosmogony and I can't get it out of my head.  For anyone reading this, it's much more difficult to disprove than you'd initially think.  I'm not a proponent or consider it to be true, but the theorists who work out and discuss Concave Earth have viable explanations for many (I can't say all yet, since it's a tremendous topic with a lot of things that need to be accounted for) phenomenon including the vanishing horizon, stars, planets, sun, red shift.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are one to doubt some (or all) astronomical pictures that are spread through modern space agency public relations (specifically NASA) then you should definitely give this a chance and see if you could disprove some of the gigantically bold claims behind Concave Earth.  At the worst, it's a real brain teaser in exploring a viable alternate universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd love to bounce some of the explanations and understandings I've come to, if anyone is willing to partake in a friendly, but engaging conversation on it.

       Some of the major points for me:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Physical experiments: Rectilineator, Tamarack mine plumb.  Both are well described and indicate a concave earth.  I would like to see both of them repeated with as much exposure and verification as possible.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Visual experiments:  Any long distance visual observation must be interpreted with knowledge of how light bends through the atmosphere since our eyes or any other light measuring device can only examine photons as they are when they arrive, there is no information on their paths.  If light travels in straight lines then the earth cannot be a globe of circumference ~25,000 miles, we can see too far over water.  Light needs to always bend downwards so we can see around the curve for the heliocentric globe model.  But if we do an experiment such as the one described here with theodolites:
         <a href="http://www.wildheretic.com/bendy-light-the-evidence/">
          http://www.wildheretic.com/bendy-light-the-evidence/
         </a>
         we see that in fact light bends upwards in the atmosphere.  When we interpret visual observations with this in mind we arrive at concave.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Various pieces of evidence for glass in the sky (celestial sphere).  Libyan desert glass.  This video is interesting:
         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TEEWxqzx3M">
          https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TEEWxqzx3M
         </a>
         I think Wernher Von Braun made statements about a firmament.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Proofs against the official model.  Flat earth theory provides many proofs against the official spinning globe model.  The trick is that it offers a false choice between those two models.  When confronted with the problems with flat earth theory the logical mistake that too many make is accepting this false dichotomy and seeing these as proofs for the heliocentric model.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       It is a huge topic of course, but those are some brief points that stand out for me.

       You did a really great job summarizing.  I agree completely with your point number 1, and it seems this is most likely the way forward given the assumption that if the concave model is correct, most space travel and pictures (etc) are fake (or composites not indicative of true form.)
      </p>
      <p>
       As for number 4, I'd also like to add that it appears flat earth is disinfo to discredit (and dissuade one from investigating) all the alternative astronomical and geological theories, like you say (Interestingly, I remember even seeing a video of Obama dismissing it.)  I started researching flat earth and eventually came across the much more compelling and harder (or impossible) to falsify/dismiss concave model as outlined by you (ChangeThroughTruth)

       The videos I could find all are filmed with a highly wide angled lens, which either distorts the horizon's curvature to be either convex or concave depending on the relative location of the horizon in the camera's frame.

       And your preconceived judgment also forgoes any possibility of bending light under earths gravity, magnetic, and atmospheric field.

       I appreciate your civil reply and appreciate the link to the Lynch paper. The video can not be used to discern curvature, as correctly stated in the paper: to even have a chance, the horizon needs to be in the complete vertical center (and rotated 0 degrees) else any lens will incur substantial distortions.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I've a serious with regards to the Lynch paper though.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I assumed that the distance to the horizon was the same at every azimuth - pg 4 (top right paragraph)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Due to perspective foreshortening, wouldn't this be a wrong assumption, becoming more increasingly off when viewing the horizon from a high vantage point?  Meaning, the further away from the center of the frame (an wider the angle of the view,) the closer the horizon really is.  Thus his calculation of the sagitta is invalid.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for SpaceX, NASA etc, these entities are the reason I even bothered to investigate alternate models (not necessarily of Earth's curvature, but astronomical models as well for there are too many instances of fraudulent imagery and video for my comfort (some are to be expected.)  I'm not doubting rocket launches, but where do they go?  Images from satellites in orbit and astronauts in the space station have a few too many hiccups for me.  Others may be more forgiving.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, if you really dig into the conspiracy theories, they aren't as crazy as I assume you think.   In my preferred model, NASA serves as one of many funnels into the black budget of the industrial/military complex.   Adjusted for inflation NASA has received close to a trillion dollars since it's inception (~800 billion) I'm kind of dumbfounded that there are hungry children in poor continents and we (correction:
       <em>
        "they"
       </em>
       ) decide to
       <em>
        supposedly
       </em>
       land someone on the moon. (6 times in ~1970 era and the largest percentage of the total funding was during then)
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S Do you work at/for NASA?  I interned at the computational aeroscience branch at Langley/LARC ! Haha.

       I've little doubt that there are more military satellites up there than we think there are, but that doesn't lead me immediately to the conclusion that the Earth is flat and that most NASA imagery is faked. (It isn't. What specific imagery are you even claiming is faked?)
      </p>
      <p>
       We can also visually track most satellites, even if we don't know what exactly they are doing. In the military's case, mostly surveillance and comms.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: L2 on Nasaspaceflight.com has tons of insider info and photos. There's nothing fishy going on. It's mostly bland comms sat launches. Really cool SpaceX and manned space flight info though.

       Hm.  Did you intentionally dodge my critique of Lynch paper?  What's your opinion on what I brought up? Let's focus on that for a second, please!
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, I'll make it clear that my sole interest is not about the curvature of earth (although I'll investigate the other two models; flat earth is clearly disinformation, concave is harder to disprove in my researched opinion) it's about astronomical and atmospheric phenomenon in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S: there is a lot of fake imagery if you keep a keen eye for it (I don't think
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       of it is fake.)  A lot just goes unnoticed.  Here's just one example (
       <a href="http://imgur.com/thnQ4aj">
        http://imgur.com/thnQ4aj
       </a>
       ) where I point out fake clouds over oceans, and more importantly, over land mass, which I was extremely surprised by.  I can bring you towards more, if you'd like.  But don't want to dump too many pictures and videos on you.

       Well yes. It seems they used some very intense filters on the cameras, so it would stand to reason they would also need to protect the astronauts eyes from direct sunlight. They still could probably see the stars, if only faintly, and depending on which direction they were looking in relation to the sun or earth. You have to consider all these variables when thinking about this.

       I was thinking along these same lines.  You always see that typical photo of a reflective goldish coating on the front of a space suit helmet. That of course is to protect from the suns intensity.  It seems logical to me that coating would completely or almost completely block the very weak light from distant stars. Similar to a set of welding goggles that protect from the intense light of a welding arc, but they completely block out almost all ambient light before beginning the weld.  I see what you are trying to say.

       I agree with you, but beyond that the whole point is moot.  Here is a picture of Armstrong with his visor up, standing in the shadow of the rover.

       To think that he wouldn't have seen the stars in those conditions is absolutely fucking ridiculous.

       By the way, Tyson isn't the only person that has made the same assertion while debunking the moon hoax.  In fact, one of the primary moon landing defenders is Phil Plait and he said the exact same thing on his page dedicated to debunking:

       "On the Moon, the lack of air means that the sky is dark. Even when the Sun is high off the horizon during full day, the sky near it will be black. If you were standing on the Moon, you would indeed see stars, even during the day."
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, think of this - whenever the issue of stars comes up it usually has to do with the lack of stars in the photos - how does this get debunked?  No one ever says - oh you can't see the stars on the moon.  Nope, they always say they don't show up on film having to do with exposure, the implication being that the stars are in fact visible.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bottom line is that you would be able to see stars, and the fact that the claimed they couldn't is preposterous.
