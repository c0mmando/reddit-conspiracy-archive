First let me start out by saying I&#39;m an African American male, who has experienced the type of racism that we have seen in the news for years.

<p>Now the crazy:  What if these are staged false flag attacks to pass some gun legislation?  Further more what if they are using these attacks to demonize the right wing conservatives? The rate, and the level of these attacks seem, too much of a coincidence. </p>

<p>The progressives are the ones that can&#39;t work with any other group. </p>

<p>While the right wing and conservatives work by recruiting allies, the left works by expelling dissenters.</p>

<p>As a simple example, on the right wing you have people who are for gay marriage, and against gay marriage.</p>

<p>On the left, you are not allowed to be against gay marriage, that makes you a heretic and you will be expelled (see the executive from Mozilla.org)</p>

<p>On the right, you have people who are pro-life and people who are pro-choice.</p>

<p>On the left wing, you cannot be pro-life, you will be expelled.</p>

<p>The progressives are the problem when it comes to working with anyone that doesn&#39;t follow their party line in lockstep.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the banning of the Confederate flag was designed to agitate Southerners (and to bait them into resisting--and waving it as a sign of defiance to Political Correctness). I saw it in my region. People who never placed one of their car were suddenly doing it as a form of resistance. This played exactly into the hands of the race-baiters [as it was designed to do], whereby they could now point to blacks and say, &quot;See? Evil whitey is everywhere! He&#39;s out to get you!&quot;</p>

<p>I think they knew <em>exactly</em> what they were doing with that psy-op.</p>

<p>The whites weren&#39;t waving the flag as a &quot;symbol of oppression,&quot; but quite the opposite: They busted them out to thumb their noses at the TV, which was nakedly demonizing them. They started putting them on their car [ironically] as a defiant gesture against oppression, and the media&#39;s naked attempt at character assassination.</p>

<p>But [as I said] this played right into the race-baiters&#39; hands, because they could then mischaracterize it, and say, &quot;See? They&#39;re not waving it to resist oppression; they&#39;re waving it because they WANT to oppress.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly! It&#39;s the clearest sign that there&#39;s a baffling divide between the host-population in the United States and the globalist institutions and individuals running the media. </p>

<p>No culture in history has demonized itself.</p>

<p>So this desperate attempt to frame &quot;straight, conservative white males&quot; as evil incarnate [when the statistics say that this is about the lowest crime-group in the nation] is bizarre. I remember when Pat Buchanan caught flak in the media for breaking down US crime statistics. If you remove African-Americans and Mexican drug cartels and street gangs, the US has a crime rate on par with Belgium or Luxenbourg. </p>

<p>So there&#39;s this bizarre disparity between the statistics and the media narrative of the &quot;evil white males who society is supposed to be afraid of&quot;. </p>

<p>See a presentation on the statistics here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGTUcS-yQtQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGTUcS-yQtQ</a></p>

<p>And that&#39;s why it&#39;s utterly perplexing: the media trying to demonize what is essentially the nation&#39;s host population. </p>

<p>Outside the West, this bizarre demonization of the majority doesn&#39;t take place. I mean, Chinese state media doesn&#39;t flood their airwaves with the evil of &quot;Asian males&quot;. Brazil doesn&#39;t indoctrinate its youth with how bad Brazilians are.</p>

<p>This crap only happens when the media and the power-structure are no longer run by the host-population. </p>

<p>And we know this is true from a study recently done by Princeton, that says that the US is not a democracy, but an oligarchy. Its conclusion? Average Americans have almost no say in their government. See here: <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/apr/21/americas-oligarchy-not-democracy-or-republic-unive/">http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/apr/21/americas-oligarchy-not-democracy-or-republic-unive/</a></p>

<p>So when your country is no longer being run by its own citizens (when the host population no longer has any real say or control over the system) you get what we have now: A weaponized media, fanning racial hate--and bent on demonizing the host population.</p>

<p>&quot;These evil white conservative males are a blight on our society! We can&#39;t have them with their Belgian-level crime rates! Be afraid. Be <em>very</em> afraid!&quot;</p>

<p>Because the fact is: Whites aren&#39;t the real target of this. Minorities are. They&#39;re being baited into divisiveness and fear (along racial lines). This is a classic method of collapsing a society from within. Divide-and-Conquer. Billionaire George Soros has gone around the world, fomenting revolutions and social collapses by playing minority groups against the host population. He did it in Russia, with the Chechyns. He did it in the Ukraine, with ethnic Ukranians against Russians. He did it in Egypt, Libya, and now the United States. Mr. Soros&#39; methodology in all these countries is to create NGO&#39;s [non-governmental organizations] and to stoke race-hate and division among different factions--as a preliminary step before collapsing the society. In Eastern Europe, his NGO is the so-called National Endowment for Democracy. In the United States, he started and funds &quot;Black Lives Matter&quot;. </p>

<p>And Mr. Soros is just one of a larger number of globalists, purposely creating stress-cracks in societies to distract the public and weaken the respective nations. It&#39;s an old technique. Russia did it to the Ottoman Empire in the 19th Century, creating the pan-Slavic movement in the Balkans to encourage Slavs within Ottoman territory to rebel. The Brits followed suit by creating &quot;Arab pan-nationalism&quot; in the Near East, to de-stabilize the Ottoman&#39;s southern territory in a bid to split apart the empire [and get at its oil-producing regions].</p>

<p>The calculated take-down of the Ottoman Empire is where we get the term a &quot;Balkanized society,&quot; i.e., a nation so fractured by internal ethnic divisions that it collapses (usually with help and encouragement from outside sources).</p>

<p>The United States is clearly being &quot;Balkanized&quot;. It&#39;s being set up to implode from within.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They buy it because it activates the primordial brain.</p>

<p>On a small scale ( individuals, tribes ) races are a hell of a problem. Because their identities are different and so is their culture ( usually ).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t advocate for violence where not needed, i just think everybody would be happier if they could stay into their own tribe and just exchange some courtesies, much like neighbours. However, the intercrossing of the 2 families ( if you follow the metaphor ) is indeed problematic on a biological level, for both.</p>

<p>But today that&#39;s a really little problem compared to what it could be in tribal days. Today we can both see it&#39;s a deception, a work of art by some master scammer.</p>

<p>But if you fail to see why it&#39;s problematic at first, you will fail to address why the elite wishes us so much of that.</p>

<p>Anyway for OP, yes you are unlucky to be black those days and yes, most attacks you will ever see on TV is our dear overlords staging stuff to create social pressure and bring us to act like chaotic race-supremist fags.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say go back to your tribe and live proudly with your identity, but that&#39;s not an option today ( besides our old tribes are deleted and melted ). So you can only just understand reality and adapt for the best. Learn not to anger our common masters, try to make yourself as valuable as possible and signal high social status ( so the cops may think twice, atleast ).</p>

<p>You may call my framework racist but i actually wish the best to all human races as i respect men from everywhere. Still, race is not something the elite made up to control us. It&#39;s something they use for it since it naturally weaken natural groups identity ( included yours, ofcourse ).</p>

<p>But if you don&#39;t want to think about this kind of issue now, just know most of what goes on TV is staged and not for your good. Try to plan ahead..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the thing. There have been plenty of times that our own people have taken to the streets for peace in our own communities. That&#39;s never shown in the media. Hell a week ago a fraternity in Chicago walked down the street in the craziest area in suits and ties to promote education and peace.</p>

<p>Here is the problem, the creation of a ghetto is a symptom of white supremacy (not allowing blacks in white housing areas, denying home loans, etc). When you add something like drugs in the mix that were injected into the community you get something like Chicago&#39;s problem. Add a corrupt police force and you have a recipe for disaster.</p>

<p>Now here&#39;s the problem where BLM has with the police. Police brutality is an oxymoron. Because you have officers who are so quick to shoot someone (I watched a video where a kid gets shot for going to the gas station...that officer is fired now) vs trained officers that capture alive even when a suspect has army guns. They didn&#39;t capture Eric Dorner alive, they burned him alive vs Jared Loughner they captured him. That&#39;s what they are upset about. The double standards. An officer can kick, punch, kill someone, and if there are no cameras they can make up some charge to justify their means. That&#39;s the problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, so it&#39;s like unarmed whites being killed by police. The media just doesn&#39;t give those events any air time.</p>

<p>Ghettos are not the result of white supremacy, by the way. It&#39;s the government providing free (or mostly free) housing for people who can&#39;t afford other options. It goes from subsidized housing to ghetto when thugs make up the majority of the population in those areas. If you have a whole neighborhood full of people with entitlement issues expecting they should get reparations for not having personally experienced slavery, they&#39;d rather just get that free apartment and sell drugs for fun money than actually work. Impoverished black people cause their own problems. Never once have whites come into a &#39;ghetto&#39; and ruined the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Happened to me and I&#39;m white.</p>

<p>getting called a nigger</p>

<p>Not only have I been called &quot;white boy&quot; and &quot;cracker&quot; I&#39;ve also been called a &quot;nigga&quot; which is kind of funny to me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>having to deal with the usual societal racism of staying quiet when people make black jokes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hmm, I&#39;ve had to stay quiet while I hear people (mostly other white people) tell me I&#39;m the &quot;cancer of human history&quot; or that I&#39;m a &quot;racist&quot; and have &quot;white privilege&quot; etc.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t doubt what you&#39;re saying, since &quot;racism&quot; means prejudice plus privilege, and only white people have white privilege, only white people can be racist. </p>

<p>So it&#39;s just plain old anti-European bigotry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, <a href="/u/jacks1000">/u/jacks1000</a>  completely understand man. You are wrong.  White supremacy affects white people too.  To be fair, those people may have been not necessarily hurt by you directly, but have been hurt by the same color of people.  Now you understand what its like to be a person of color in this country every single day.  We are thugs, uneducated, and whatever else the media believes that we are to be.  To be told that you are human scum or cancer isn&#39;t right, nor is it justified, but you have first hand experience of the bullshit.  You can use your experience to spread hate, or you can use your experience to promote peace.</p>

<p>I love this other guy though, lets spread more hate and the blame game around.  There is an obvious problem with society and this guy is apart of the problem not the solution.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If a white person even whispers that they&#39;re proud of their heritage, they&#39;re immediately shamed into the ground, if not physically attacked. The only time you see white supremacy is in small isolated compounds in places like utah, and those people don&#39;t actually effect anyone. The types of oppression you described would be immediately dismissed if you were white. &quot;Awww poor baby heard a white joke, grow up because muh slavery hundreds of years ago.&quot; Spend more time on reddit. You&#39;ll see it.</p>
