      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Ironically, in order to achieve this fascist leap forward, Hollande has equated “conspiracy theories” to Nazism, and is calling for government regulations to prevent any sharing or publishing of any views deemed as ‘dangerous thought’ by the state. Specifically, Hollande is citing “Anti-Semitism” and also anything which could inspire ‘acts terrorism’ – as the chief vehicles for what the state will be designating as ‘dangerous thoughts’. With the thumb of Hebdo still pressing down, this may just sound like politics writ large by the French leader, but in reality it’s full-blown fascism.

       So who decides what is a conspiracy theory and what is just a rational thought? This is the fascist totalitarian idea, George Orwell wrote about in 1984. With out irony, France will call it Ministry of Truth. Wow, the war on our freedom is coming. It all makes sense now.

       Yes, humans especially herds of humans have inherent flaws. Step 1 is recognising these flaws, perhaps an intellectual discourse about it. Then only can we move forward.what a beautiful world that would be. I would go so far as to call it heaven.

       Any version of their TV lies uncovering the truth about that lie. Anything that is not coming from state media will be a conspiracy. Read the book of George Orwell or watch the movie 1984. Is like actual govs are following page by page that book...

       I suspect the definition will remain intentionally ambiguous, much like the term "terrorism", which is whatever they say it is (subject to change without notice), and applies only to those they wish to demonize (also subject to change without notice).

       Will be something like: "an ’alternative’ narrative that claims to significantly upset the knowledge we have of an event and therefore competes with the "version" which is commonly accepted, stigmatized as "official"" ... This is how the the Jean-Jaurès Foundation (Socialist Party think tank of which Mr. Holland was the first secretary) defines it. Scary.

       Yes. No alternative narrative - only the 'official truth'. It is terrifying that this appears to be acceptable. That 'think tank' isn't socialist it's fucking fascist.

       The downvoting of this topic is strange. If this were indeed true, I'd hope that this blatant disregard for freedom of speech would have a little more traction. I guess we'll see what's what and wait for further evidence if there's any weight to these claims.

       For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction; the further the pendulum swings in one direction, the further still will it swing in the other direction.

      <p>
       So let them become ultranationalistic.  ultrauthoritarian.  draconian.  They did this crap before and then a revolution happened just after we started our country here in the US and what did it get them?  20 yrs or so of widespread war and chaos through europe, destroying monarchies and instilling republics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they are trying to dismantle republics and install dictatorships or worse yet, socialist democracies!  (I say that jokingly, i'm a socialist market libertarian).  Bring it ya'll.  You can't do any worse.  If we end up with 1984 we'll just burn down the world and no one will get anything.

       I had a conversation with another dad in the park yesterday. We had talked before and learned that we both had the same understanding of history and current events. He said, "Is it me, or is it getting much more blatantly obvious that they [TPTB] can't hide behind their bullshit anymore." We were talking about Syria/Russia at the time.

       The tyrants always try to "legalize" the treachery that they're already doing and throw anyone who questions into the oubliette. When they have to try and make laws that undo common law and sense going back to the Magna Carta, they're banking on the hope that they've poisoned and distracted the masses enough that something like this could be passed and codified. As pathetic as we've become, I think they're wrong and have underestimated the evolution that's been going on despite and without them. I submit a random conversation with another dad in the park as evidence.

       After the attack on that newspapers (charlie hebdo), they were all calling for freedom of speech. All MSM were repeating daily that in the name of freedom of speech, they should have the right to make silly drawings making fun of the muslims.

       Hum, I'm french, in France, and this is the first I've heard of this since the charlie hebdo attacks. Yes there was some completely retarded rhetoric at the beginning of the year, but I haven't seen anything concrete going that way.

       Also Hollande got this completely retarded idea from the jean jaures foundation which is a supposedly leftist think tank that manages to publish mostly right or far right views on current events.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just saying this seems overblown from my point of view. I wouldn't put it past him though, he's stupid enough to be influenced by god knows how much shitty ideology as long as it's presented as leftist to him.

       I'm against this, though I guess we'll have to wait and see what "this" is, considering the source material is extremely vague.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, we are seeing a rising challenge with how to handle people who band together and agree on things that aren't real. The rise of people who are against vaccines are a good example of this. It's a group of people, who have no concept of how science works, and as a result have made a version of reality where they fully believe there is enough evidence to even warrant a debate on the issue of vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       This works in societies where individual freedom is king, like in the USA. It doesn't, however, work in places like Europe where the burden of healthcare is shared. Nobody in the established society is going to want to have to deal with epidemics or dead children because a small group of people were being ignorant and didn't have their children vaccinated. I mean, as a society Europe just doesn't want to deal with nonsense like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       This can be transferred to things like not believing in the holocaust. As a society we just don't want to have to deal with the nonsense and idiocy surrounding it. If someone can come up with peer review-able evidence on why the holocaust didn't happen, sure, they can have a say, but the town idiot who googled random shit on the internet should really just fuck off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course this poses a real issue. Because how do you tackle the fact that the people has lost it's faith in the establishment, to the point where people are willing to accept ignorant and dangerous concepts, in a world where news media has largely become privately owned entertainment, without turning your state into a dictatorship?

       There's no "irony" because it's not a "fascist leap forward" - it's a Communist leap forward. ALL of the establishment in France is ANTI-FASCIST. The Communist party is legitimate in France, "fascism" is illegal.

       No, here we have communists calling everyone else "fascists" - that is generally speaking what communists do.

       Communism is a Social and Economic system. fascism is a political and social system. This isn't economic in any way its a political and social action. If you want to criticize it as such then call it socialism, which would of course include National Socialism. Otherwise it just sounds like typical zright Wing hysteria. You know what's commie as fuck? Carbon taxes and limits on the number of children you have, forced vaccines and evolution being taught as fact (that's commie behavior). Fascism is militarizing the police, linking the Elite with the middle class by way of economic and social policies, xenophobia (islamophobia), blocking free speech, secret prisons, terror campaigns against the public, abusing minorities, abusing the mentally handicapped or ill. Those are all things that the Nazis, Franco Spaniards, Greeks and Fascist Italians all did. There's a long illustrious history of this behavior in America, Argentina, Britain, India, Nicaragua, Greece, Spain, France (Napoleon), Tsarist Russia and Germany. Maybe if you opened a history textbook and stopped worshipping Mien Kampf for 5 minutes you'd realize that the Right Wing isn't a good thing anymore than the left-wing is......

       That's just wrong. Communism is political, and fascism did have an economic component - partial socialism, in fact.

       Communists are responsible for far more bloodshed that fascists, but for some reason you can't stop worshipping the Communist Manifesto long enough to figure that out.

       Recent reddit thread.  Top page atm.  In which they claim high thc cannabis strains damage nerve endings in the brain.  Any comment claiming correlation instead of causation or almost any good point refuting the article has been removed.  It creates a very narrow narrative to viewers that don't question why 20/32 top posts and any stemming comments from them HAVE BEEN DELETED.  This website is done and over with.  Get your news elsewhere.  --Pretty irrelevant I know, but I just want to get some maximum exposure for this before it's swept under the rug.

       These people come here and post these types of super-inflammatory remarks and then link it to r/all if the post becomes popualr enough to hit the front page to prove how conspiracy theorists are a bunch of neo-nazi racist scumbags, it's just what they do. That's my theory anyway.
