       This is an old article now, but one I think a lot of people need to read.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Late on the night of August 23, 2001, at about 3 a.m. security cameras in the parking garage of the World Trade Center captured the arrival of two or three truck vans.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Visual examination determined the vans were separate and unique from trucks used by janitorial services, including different colors and devoid of markings. More curious, all the janitorial trucks had pulled out of the Towers by about 2:30 a.m—about half an hour before the second set of vans arrived.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        According to my high-level State Department source with a top security clearance, who disclosed the unusual nightly activity, no vans matching that description had entered the World Trade Center at such an hour in any of the weeks or months prior to that date.  It was a unique event.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Security cameras caught the vans leaving the Towers at approximately 5 a.m—before the first wave of AAA personality types on Wall Street, driving Mercedes and BMWs, arrived to track the markets.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        For the next 10 to 12 nights, the same mysterious truck vans arrived at the World Trade Center at the same mysterious hour— after the janitorial crews had left the building and before the most fanatic robber barons on Wall Street showed up for work.  The vans appeared at the World Trade Center from approximately August 23, 2001 until September 3 or 4, 2001.  After that last night, they never appeared at the Towers again.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The vans were never heard of again, either. The 9/11 Commission was never informed of their surprising presence in the Towers three weeks before the 9/11 attack. Most of the 9/11 Truth Community has no knowledge of this extraordinary nightly activity, either.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        For all the public’s ignorance, video from the security cameras could be the most significant missing part of the 9/11 puzzle. This State Department source was convinced the mysterious trucks were used to transport explosives into the building, and that an unidentified orphan team wired the World Trade Center for a controlled demolition in those late night hours. He has stayed quiet to protect his job, his retirement pension and his reputation—knowing that others who spoke up have gotten fired or thrown in prison (myself included).
       </strong>

       If I remember rightly it was initially posted on The Intel Hub, but like so many stories which concern the events of 9/11 it went missing. Later it reappeared on other sites.

       Lindaugh is a confirmed ex-congressional staffer and author, but she also claims she was a paid CIA asset in the late 1990s. The US government convicted her of a treason-related offence and sentenced her to a year in prison. Since then she's been pretty vocal about a lot of stuff, particularly 9/11.

       This is tricky...I imagine the tapes were destroyed by the attack, so how would people know these were "missing"?
      </p>

       I mean I don't doubt the article after every possible video of the Pentagon attack was "lost".

       Not the tapes from the day of 9/11, brother. She's talking about tapes from a week or two before.

       And further, think about a lot of the footage we get today with incidents. There was a huge collection of security tapes and recording following the attack. The collection went under the guise of 'be patriotic' and tell us that you have footage. Clever trick and now a lot of footage has been destroyed.
