        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>I have never been so upset by a poll in my life. Only 22% of Americans now believe &quot;the movie and television industries are pretty much run by Jews,&quot; down from nearly 50% in 1964. The Anti-Defamation League, which released the poll results last month, sees in these numbers a victory against stereotyping. Actually, it just shows how dumb America has gotten. Jews totally run Hollywood.</strong></p>

<p><strong>How deeply Jewish is Hollywood? When the studio chiefs took out a full-page ad in the Los Angeles Times a few weeks ago to demand that the Screen Actors Guild settle its contract, the open letter was signed by: News Corp. President Peter Chernin (Jewish), Paramount Pictures Chairman Brad Grey (Jewish), Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Robert Iger (Jewish), Sony Pictures Chairman Michael Lynton (surprise, Dutch Jew), Warner Bros. Chairman Barry Meyer (Jewish), CBS Corp. Chief Executive Leslie Moonves (so Jewish his great uncle was the first prime minister of Israel), MGM Chairman Harry Sloan (Jewish) and NBC Universal Chief Executive Jeff Zucker (mega-Jewish). If either of the Weinstein brothers had signed, this group would have not only the power to shut down all film production but to form a minyan with enough Fiji water on hand to fill a mikvah.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The person they were yelling at in that ad was SAG President Alan Rosenberg (take a guess). The scathing rebuttal to the ad was written by entertainment super-agent Ari Emanuel (Jew with Israeli parents) on the Huffington Post, which is owned by Arianna Huffington (not Jewish and has never worked in Hollywood.)</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Jews are so dominant, I had to scour the trades to come up with six Gentiles in high positions at entertainment companies. When I called them to talk about their incredible advancement, five of them refused to talk to me, apparently out of fear of insulting Jews. The sixth, AMC President Charlie Collier, turned out to be Jewish.</strong></p>

<p><strong>As a proud Jew, I want America to know about our accomplishment. Yes, we control Hollywood. Without us, you&#39;d be flipping between &quot;The 700 Club&quot; and &quot;Davey and Goliath&quot; on TV all day.</strong></p>

<p><strong>So I&#39;ve taken it upon myself to re-convince America that Jews run Hollywood by launching a public relations campaign, because that&#39;s what we do best. I&#39;m weighing several slogans, including: &quot;Hollywood: More Jewish than ever!&quot;; &quot;Hollywood: From the people who brought you the Bible&quot;; and &quot;Hollywood: If you enjoy TV and movies, then you probably like Jews after all.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>I called ADL Chairman Abe Foxman, who was in Santiago, Chile, where, he told me to my dismay, he was not hunting Nazis. He dismissed my whole proposition, saying that the number of people who think Jews run Hollywood is still too high. The ADL poll, he pointed out, showed that 59% of Americans think Hollywood execs &quot;do not share the religious and moral values of most Americans,&quot; and 43% think the entertainment industry is waging an organized campaign to &quot;weaken the influence of religious values in this country.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>That&#39;s a sinister canard, Foxman said. &quot;It means they think Jews meet at Canter&#39;s Deli on Friday mornings to decide what&#39;s best for the Jews.&quot; Foxman&#39;s argument made me rethink: I have to eat at Canter&#39;s more often.</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;That&#39;s a very dangerous phrase, &#39;Jews control Hollywood.&#39; What is true is that there are a lot of Jews in Hollywood,&quot; he said. Instead of &quot;control,&quot; Foxman would prefer people say that many executives in the industry &quot;happen to be Jewish,&quot; as in &quot;all eight major film studios are run by men who happen to be Jewish.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>But Foxman said he is proud of the accomplishments of American Jews. &quot;I think Jews are disproportionately represented in the creative industry. They&#39;re disproportionate as lawyers and probably medicine here as well,&quot; he said. He argues that this does not mean that Jews make pro-Jewish movies any more than they do pro-Jewish surgery. Though other countries, I&#39;ve noticed, aren&#39;t so big on circumcision.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I appreciate Foxman&#39;s concerns. And maybe my life spent in a New Jersey-New York/Bay Area-L.A. pro-Semitic cocoon has left me naive. But I don&#39;t care if Americans think we&#39;re running the news media, Hollywood, Wall Street or the government. I just care that we get to keep running them.</strong></p>

<p>Yup, but let&#39;s not forget that usually when people point it out the Jews come down in force. Check out this grovelling apology they put Gary Oldman through for stating the obvious:-</p>

<p><strong>&#39;They surely are the chosen people&#39;: Gary Oldman makes grovelling apology after saying Hollywood is a &#39;town run by Jews&#39;</strong></p>

<p>Remember when they ended Megan Fox? I heard the real reason was the director was interested and she wasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>I know, Mel Gibson was huge Hollywood star but after the The Passion movie showing Jews as Christ killers and saying that Jews are responsible for all wars (both true statements) he got banned from Hollywood, even Robert Downey Jr can&#39;t help Mel Gibson.</p>

<p>This is the problem. You can&#39;t tell the truth because it makes Jews look bad, and Jews say that&#39;s racist.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Gibson got along VERY WELL in Hollywood UNTIL he decided to launch &quot;The Passion&quot; project - it was then that Jews began attacking HIM.</p>

<p>For those too young to remember (or who weren&#39;t paying attention), there was a MASSIVE media blitz launched in protest prior to the release of The Passion, countless leading Jewish figures and other so-called &quot;experts&quot; gave DIRE warnings that the movie would incite racial hatred against <strong><em>&quot;TEH J000SE&quot;</em></strong> by sleepy Christians in the US and around the world.</p>

<p>If the movie was released, there would be <strong>ANOTHER HOLOCAUST!!!!</strong> the frowning, faces and wagging fingers predicted.</p>

<p>Gibson himself came under massive personal attack - his &quot;motives&quot; for making the film were questioned <strong><em>(ANTI-SEMITE!!!)</em></strong>, and he and his cast and production crew were under enormous pressure to cancel the project.</p>

<p>In spite of the attacks, Gibson pressed on, completing and releasing the film, which, thanks largely to the publicity generated in the freakish media circus created by panicked Jews - went on to become a the ALL TIME highest grossing R Rated movie ever released in the United States. Eleven years later, the record stands.</p>

<p>Of course NONE of the anti-Semitism predicted by the Paranoid Prognosticators materialized - none... But that did NOT quench the thirst for vengeance against Gibson for having the CHUTZPAH to disrespect the demands of the Gods of Hollywood. They would give him no rest, but continued to hound, and harass him.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know whether Gibson had any &quot;anti-Semitic attitudes&quot; prior to the campaign they launched against him, but they certainly left him with a BAD taste in his mouth - and it was AFTER all this happened that he cut loose with his now infamous drunken &quot;anti-Semitic&quot; tirades.</p>

<p>In any case, he hardly needs to worry about &quot;working&quot; in Hollywood these days. &quot;The Passion&quot; left him a VERY wealthy man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>American white Christians don&#39;t seem to understand how important it is that Jews -- who are 2% of the population -- have been telling them what to think and what to say for more than half a century. Jews control all of the mass media -- ALL OF IT. Let that sink in. Sure, there are alternative publications here and there, occasional alternative voices on the Internet, but when it comes to mainstream movies, television, radio, newspapers, magazines, and book publishing, Jews control it. This has allowed Jews to shape the minds of Christians. It has allowed Jews to tell everyone else what they should think, and what they must never think about. They have been brainwashing us all for longer than most of us have been alive.</p>

<p>I suspect it is probably a lot longer than that, brother. If I&#39;m not mistaken, the Bible is a book written by Jews which claims the son of God is a Jew and that Jews are his chosen people. Some of the shit in there is just plain nasty. For example:-</p>

<p><strong>Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the people went to meet them outside the camp.  But Moses was furious with all the military commanders who had returned from the battle.  &quot;Why have you let all the women live?&quot; he demanded.  &quot;These are the very ones who followed Balaam&#39;s advice and caused the people of Israel to rebel against the LORD at Mount Peor.  They are the ones who caused the plague to strike the LORD&#39;s people.  Now kill all the boys and all the women who have slept with a man.  Only the young girls who are virgins may live; you may keep them for yourselves.</strong>  (Numbers 31:7-18 NLT)</p>
