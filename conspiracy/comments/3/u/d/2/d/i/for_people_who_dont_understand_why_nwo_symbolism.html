       basically, this is the observation that our brains tend to ignore meaningless background information.
      </p>
      <p>
       by showing a brain some stimuli in meaningless settings over and over again, you can convince it that the stimuli in question is meaningless, and should be factored out with the other background information.  Then, when the stimuli is shown in a meaningful setting, the subjects that were convinced it was part of the meaningless background information have a much harder time finding and assigning the correct meaning to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       many of you are aware of the amount of times NWO symbolism is randomly hidden throughout media, in completely meaningless settings.  the second layer to this puzzle is that these instances started happening in the mid 1960s... a short time after latent inhibition was discovered (1959).

       The interjection "fnord" is given hypnotic power over the unenlightened. Under the Illuminati program, children in grade school are taught to be unable to consciously see the word "fnord". For the rest of their lives, every appearance of the word subconsciously generates a feeling of uneasiness and confusion, and prevents rational consideration of the subject. This results in a perpetual low-grade state of fear in the populace. The government acts on the premise that a fearful populace keeps them in power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fnords are scattered liberally in the text of newspapers and magazines, causing fear and anxiety in those following current events. However, there are no fnords in the advertisements, encouraging a consumerist society. It is implied in the books that fnord is not the actual word used for this task, but merely a substitute, since most readers would be unable to see the actual word.

       good question, i asked the same thing. only info i found:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        fnord
       </p>
       <p>
        A fnord is a propaganda word conditioned in the masses from a very young age to respond to, usually with fear, anxiety, or uneasiness, but unable to be seen by the general populace. (This definition originates in the Illuminatus trilogy of books by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson.) Sometimes it's used in a sentence to denote a general conspiracy (often jokingly), or sometimes it's used for no reason, especially by Discordians fnord.

        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        In the mid-70's, Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson restarted popular speculation with their fictional "Illuminatus!" trilogy. This mixes actual history with conspiracy theory and pure invention, and very deliberately produces doubts in the reader's mind as to the nature of reality - a technique which the authors refer to as "guerilla ontology", in pursuit of "Operation Mindf*ck." They were apparently turned on to Illuminism by some of the corrospondance they received while working as letters column editors at Playboy magazine.

       wouldn't it be difficult to prove this is true? i'm asking because of info about Robert Anton Wilson's "Illuminatus" trilogy, that i've only recently become aware of. how can it be proven?

       Yeah it was just a quote from the book.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to play devil's advocate:
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was a legit thing, any photograph of text would contain those 'invisible' words as well, our subconscious would simply block it out from our own personal vision.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you then manipulated that photograph in photoshop with random filters or whatever, the pixels of those 'invisible' words would be maniuplated by the filters just the same. Once the words are distorted enough that they are no longer 'fnords', they wouldn't play on our subconscious anymore, and show up in the image, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       (let's say you did a blur, or a distort)
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be ridiculously easy to prove this kind of thing was going on.

       Is there an imgur album or maybe even a subreddit that has examples of NWO symbolism? All I can think of is the

       Sure. 
It's IMHO a pretty interesting website that deals with symbols found (hidden) in mass culture products, like music videos, movies, TV shows, comics, etc., but also in architecture and public buildings, and finally in the press (with a predilection for fashion magazines like Vogue, Cosmo, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Some articles are very interesting, like the section on Kubricks' "Eyes wide shut" for example. I also recall a more recent one on the January cover of "The Economist" (where the symbolism of each item on the cover was very well explained.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't necessarily agree all the time with the conclusions presented, but it definitely helps to spot symbols (and therefore connections), most of which would be hidden to the otherwise "untrained" eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, the interpretation of this kind of data is left to each and every one of us - although the website's author very often provides his own explanations of the motives behind such actions.

       So everyone who disagrees with you is a shill? What the hell, I thought the fear of many on this subreddit is that their freedom of speech is being violated. You are doing the exact thing to those with opposing views.

       If he disagreed with it he could have gone down the road of constructive criticism. Instead he chose to ridicule it by using sarcasm.

       Not denying that you have a point there. That is why I made sure to say that the guy is
       <em>
        using

       shill tactics. Not that he is necessarily a shill.
