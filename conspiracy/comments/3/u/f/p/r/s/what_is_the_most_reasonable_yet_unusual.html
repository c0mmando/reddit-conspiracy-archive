Specific questions are pretty awesome because it allows us to shape our goal of the discussion. My personal goal and sole motivation for posing this question is to understand in earnest well thought out rationalizations. I would urge anyone involved to also have earnestness and find something to gain as well as share. For this one I want to ask you all just what conspiracy do you hold to be true that is both incredibly reasonable and unusual?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a probing question if you don&#39;t mind answering. Do you think they avoid the allegations or do you think they ignore the allegations?

    <div class="md"><p>NASA itself ignores the allegations. </p>

<p>Their fanboys avoid them. For example, putting a man on the moon is a claim. Fanboys act like the claiming NASA has no evidence of this is the claim. In other words, they don&#39;t provide positive evidence to support the claim. Instead, they cherry pick weak or planted arguments and show them to be untrue and then act as if by default, NASA&#39;s claim must be true.</p>

<p>The same with many things. That 19 Arabs took out 4 airplanes and attacked 4 buildings with 100% success is an extraordinary claim. There is extremely little supporting evidence for this, but the government ignores it, and the fanboys try to act like the claim is instead &quot;it was an inside job&quot;. While that may be the implications of the government lying about 9/11, it is not the claim. The claim is that the government has supplied no convincing evidence to back up their theory.</p>

<p>A negative cannot be proven. By even attempting too, you&#39;re putting yourself up against people trained to obfuscate online. Please stop doing this. Request positive supporting evidence from people who make extraordinary claims: such as NASA sent people to the moon or 19 cave dwellers learned to outwit the most expensive air defense system in the world again and again and again and again while breaking the laws of physics. </p>

<p>The person making the claim needs to defend it. Remember, the claim is theirs, make them defend it.</p>

<p>Most have not even looked into it. When they try to seek evidence to support their claim, they start to realize how weak their claim is. They will just go to a debunking site, but debunking sites don&#39;t put forth positive claims for their theory and the evidence for their claim isn&#39;t available.</p>

<p>They will get mad at you, but at least they will realize how shaky the foundation of their belief is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve literally argued for more than 60 posts against an entire group of people that believing in the government&#39;s version of 9/11 is to believe in a conspiracy theory. </p>

<p>After finally convincing them that theirs was a conspiracy theory, they refused to provide evidence to support it.</p>

<p>Name calling becomes more frequent the more they realize that they are required to supply proof to back up a, frankly insane, theory. Maintain, don&#39;t let the names get to you.</p>

<p>We as a people need to be able to think critically. It&#39;s not just about any one argument, it&#39;s about requiring proof in general. If people understand you are questioning an invalid theory that they are tacitly supporting with little evidence, it shows that you are concerned with how the government is acquiring massive funding on tenuous, unquestioned theories.</p>

<p>They won&#39;t agree with you, but hopefully they will ask who gains and how much support is there for the theory promulgated by the person/group that gains in the future. </p>

<p>To cast doubt on a theory is easy. I don&#39;t suggest doing it for the fuck of it. But if you look at the NASA sending people to the moon:</p>

<p>evidence: (according to proponents) reflectors</p>

<p>truth: Russia sent reflectors to the moon in unmanned vehicles, therefore reflectors are not evidence.</p>

<p>evidence: Russia would have brought it up.</p>

<p>truth: they have. They have casted doubt on many things and it is dismissed as propaganda. Even when Americans show evidence, it is dismissed, why would Russia&#39;s questions be treated any more seriously?</p>

<p>evidence: pictures, footage.</p>

<p>truth: show a single example of the video not corresponding to the pictures, show crosshairs in the background of things they capture, light from two sources.</p>

<p>By requiring them to provide evidence, you are able to use a single example to destroy their &quot;evidence&quot;. When you put forth a theory, they have the same opportunity.</p>

<p>Make it clear their theory is unreasonable and lacks supporting evidence. </p>

<p>Make it clear that you question it because you are concerned that the fraud has been exceptionally costly.</p>

<p>When asked what your counter theory is, you don&#39;t need to supply one. But, in many cases, the counter theory is much more probable than their theory, if you have demonstrated the improbability of their theory well enough, then provide what is a much more probable theory.</p>

<p>People try to use the term conspiracy theory against us. If you can get them to the point of understanding their theory is a conspiracy theory, then the same programming becomes a tool against their improbable ideas.</p>

<p>TL:DR: require them to support their theory.</p>

<p>Edit: spelling (decent presentation prevents spurious attacks).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you seen the onboard computer on Apollo? It may help to know it is no more powerful than the most basic phones we have in our pocketsl, today. With the exponential development in technology, we would be making roundtrips to the moon and back, many, many times. But are we? We are not.</p>

<p>And yes not only do they ignore the allegations, they poke fun at the people making the allegation. This is not a way any self respecting, serious, scientific organisation deals with questions. They also arm their fan boys to do the same.</p>

<p>That and many other things is very telling that they are straight out lying and they know it. That was their intention from the very start.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A few extra photons displayed on a screen is grounds for the &quot;but there are retrorrflectors that reflect light back&quot; argument. It is really, really weak argument that needs a heavy investment to perform and check independently. But how would they verify the existence? Can they not go back again to moon? This time with better video recording technology. They can record the whole ordeal and settle the debate. That would definitely convince me and the fast growing mass of people that need convincing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s unusual because I think that most people believe that the newcomers already know about what&#39;s behind the curtain, that say -- Barack Obama was already vetted and decided upon before 2008 to be the victor of the presidential campaign. However, what Metabolix is suggesting, I believe, is that upon winning the campaign and swearing his oath, someone sat him down in a dark room and showed him a real version of the JFK assassination unknown to the public, and proceeds to tell him that if he fall out of line, this will happen to him just as surely. Then they leave the room, scarcely heard from again. I think that was part of Bill Burr&#39;s standup routine.</p>

Almost typed past away but we all know how he feels about euphemisms ;]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is unusual because many people still think in terms of country labels and that America and Russia are against each other. And India and China are too. They frame this discussion as country against country. They don&#39;t think of what mutual benefits it brings wealthy industrialists and bankers of both Russia and America to cooperate to maintain their position of power. I have thought it out, but may not have articulated it fully. Working on that!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The conspiracy that matters the most is white genocide. It&#39;s easy for people to dismiss because it&#39;s not happening right in front of them right now -- it&#39;s extended over generations and decades. But it is definitely happening.</p>

<p>The numbers of the white race are in decline. Why? It&#39;s not hard to find the reasons. Here are a few of them:</p>

<ul>
<li>Anti-white propaganda in the media.</li>
<li>Anti-white propaganda in the schools.</li>
<li>Promotion of abortion, birth control, small families, having babies later in life.</li>
<li>Heavy promotion of mixed breeding between whites and other races.</li>
<li>Heavy promotion of multiculturalism, which is directed against white nations <em>and only white nations</em>.</li>
<li>Laws designed to discriminate against whites in favor of blacks and other non-white ethnic groups.</li>
<li>War on Christianity.</li>
<li>War on Christmas (and all other white Christian customs).</li>
<li>Feminism promoting careers for women over raising families.</li>
<li>Mockery of marriage by promoting gay marriage, multiple marriages, transgender marriage, marriage with animals, marriage with cars.</li>
<li>Promotion of divorce.</li>
<li>Heavy propaganda against white history and heritage.</li>
<li>Heavy propaganda against white males, who are protrayed in the media as stupid and evil.</li>
<li>Concealment of the truth about black IQ, black crime statistics, the black &quot;knockout&quot; game (which is directed against whites), and black anti-white racism.</li>
<li>Concealment of the role of Muslims in terrorism.</li>
<li>Encouragement of Muslim immigration into white nations.</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>The children in the Hampstead satanic cult videos were actually brought up by actors, with the mother involved in a clandestine PR company. It seems as though the whole thing could have been a false victim operation designed to discredit people investigating pedophile cults in the UK. The idea may have been to set up a series of shocking  revelations and then have them all debunked later on. The police and anyone else investigating the case would have been made a laughing stock.</p>

<p>Instead, it seems as though the police figured out that the story was a lie and avoided falling into the trap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Head banger&quot; rock and roll fan behavior mimics autistic symptoms (everything from the head movements to the unusual contorted poses of arms, stance, and fingers), and arose after vaccination program got into full swing.  And that&#39;s why it doesn&#39;t &quot;speak&quot; to older generations, and is difficult for them to conceive of as music at all-- thus the weird gap in musical tastes around 1950-1960, when no such huge generation gap seems to exist at all elsewhere in history.</p>
