        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A 13-point summary of the findings from the Shea Memorandum on the dancing Israelis. This memo didn&#39;t make the 9/11 Commission final report deadline.</p>

<hr/>

<ol>
<li><p>The Israeli DEA Groups were spying on the Drug Enforcement Agency and thus upon the United States. The DEA itself has concluded that they were probably engaged in organized intelligence gathering on our soil.</p></li>
<li><p>A highly regarded American journal knowledgeable about Israeli affairs, has concluded (a) based on its own sources, that the Israeli DEA Groups were spying on radical Islamic networks suspected of links to Middle East terrorism, and (b) based on the representations of a former American intelligence official regularly briefed on these matters by law enforcement officials, that (i) at least two members of the Israeli New Jersey Group were Mossad operatives, (ii) Urban Moving, the company used by the Israeli New Jersey Group, was a front for Mossad and its operatives, and (iii) the Israeli New Jersey Group was spying on local Arabs.</p></li>
<li><p>The intelligence sources of a substantial American television network report that the Israeli DEA Groups may have gathered information about the September 11 attacks in advance, and not shared it with the United States. One investigator said that evidence linking the Israeli DEA Groups to such intelligence gathering was classified and could not be disclosed.</p></li>
<li><p>The Israeli DEA Groups were comprised of 125 or more Israelis operating on our soil. Their leaders and apparent associates included military commanders and experts with military backgrounds in intelligence, electronic intercepts and telecommunications.</p></li>
<li><p>The wiretapping and intelligence expertise of members of both Israeli Groups, and the use of vans in local neighborhoods where the future hijackers were planning the attacks, and the extensive use by the hijackers of cell phones and land lines, made the Israeli Groups ideally suited to gather information regarding the hijackers’ plans.</p></li>
<li><p>The principal operation of the Israeli DEA Groups was located in and around Hollywood, Florida, the central training and staging ground for the hijacking of North and South Tower Planes and the Pennsylvania Plane. The addresses and places of residence of the members of the Israeli DEA Groups in Hollywood itself were within hundreds of yards those of the future hijackers.</p></li>
<li><p>The operations of both the Israeli New Jersey Group and the hijackers of the Pentagon Plane were centered in Hudson and Bergen Counties in New Jersey, within a common radius of about six miles.</p></li>
<li><p>All five celebrating members of the Israeli New Jersey Group arrested on September 11 were aware, when the North Tower Plane struck the World Trade Center, based on their immediate reaction to the attack and the information said to be contained in their van, that the attack had been planned and carried out by Arab terrorists.</p></li>
<li><p>After being questioned by the FBI on September 11, the leader of the Israeli New Jersey Group immediately fled the United States to Israel. His name and aliases appear, along with those of the hijackers and other FBI suspects, on the May 2002 FBI Suspect list.</p></li>
<li><p>Israeli intelligence officials have reported that two senior officials of Mossad warned the United States in August 2001 that as many as 200 terrorists on American soil were planning an imminent large-scale attack on high visibility targets on the American mainland. One press report states that in August Mossad provided the CIA with the names of future hijackers Khaled al Mihdhar and Nawaf al Hazmi.</p></li>
<li><p>The CIA’s explanation of how Mihdhar’s and Hazmi’s names were placed on the Watchlist through the spontaneous efforts of CIA and FBI agents is not only difficult to follow but, as the sole reason for the Watchlisting, hardly credible.</p></li>
<li><p>Mossad’s own information appears to have come from its sources inside the United States. All of the facts and circumstances set forth in this memorandum appear to show that Mossad’s two likely sources of information were: (a) the Israeli DEA Groups, comparable in number to that of the Arab suspects and who appear to have tracked the future hijackers in their central places of operation and in other states, and (b) the Israeli New Jersey Group, operating through their Mossad front in another principal locus of operations of the future hijackers, two of whom were Mossad agents, and five of whom appeared immediately aware of the origin of the attacks on September 11.</p></li>
<li><p>While little direct evidence supports the contention that the CIA was aware of or condoned the Israeli Groups’ tracking of Arab terrorist groups in the United States prior to September 11, the CIA’s pressing for the expulsion of members of the Israeli DEA Groups when they were detained before September 11, their failure to cooperate with the FBI, their circuitous explanation of how the above two hijackers were placed on the Watchlist, and other relevant considerations require that the issue be taken up as a part of the public inquiry into these painful events.  </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>13 piles of bullshit. I love how this tries to create a false sense that they were all just looking out for the good ol&#39; USA</p>

<p>The 5 dancing Israelis were ecstatic, happy and pretty much plain old delighted when the planes plowed into the towers. They weren&#39;t horrified like Americans who have a conscience, who knew hundreds of people were dying. The 5 said they were there to document the event. And they loved it.</p>

<p>It also assumes Arabs actually flew the planes. They did not. They never even boarded any of them. The 13 lies just ties into the official story...it&#39;s all crap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>correct, just another part of the disinfo backstory that pretend planes flew and crashed.</p>

<p>the reality is very large bombs coupled with controlled demolition of the three towers.</p>

<p>and of course burning office paperwork to weaken and collapse steel framed buildings...</p>

<p>who would have thought A4/8x11 could be so dangerous in an office environment, </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t subscribe to No Planes theory. Even though it does appear that it could have happened from evidence I have seen, at this point in time, I am convinced the planes were flown in by the Remote Fight Takeover systems that were most likely provided by Dov Zakheim.</p>

<p>These &quot;13 Points&quot; are disinformation. They are nothing but lame excuses to try and explain away the obvious. Mossad wanted video of their crown jewel of all of their false flags attacks and the 5 Israelis couldn&#39;t contain their joy to the point of being obviously involved in the operation itself.</p>

<p>The witness says she saw three young men kneeling on the roof of a white van in the parking lot of her apartment building.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;They seemed to be taking a movie...<strong>they were like happy, you know… They didn&#39;t look shocked to me.</strong> I thought it was very strange.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The men were taking video or photos of themselves with the World Trade Center burning in the background,</strong> she said. She found the behavior so suspicious that she wrote down the license plate number of the van and called the police. Before long, the FBI was also on the scene, and a statewide bulletin was issued on the van.</p>

<p>A police officer pulled the van over, <strong>finding five men, between 22 and 27 years old, in the vehicle.</strong> The men were taken out of the van at gunpoint and handcuffed by police.</p>

<p>The arresting officers said they saw a lot that aroused their suspicion about the men. <strong>One of the passengers had $4,700 in cash hidden in his sock.</strong> Another was carrying <strong>two foreign passports.</strong> A box cutter was found in the van. But perhaps the biggest surprise for the officers came when the <strong>five men identified themselves as Israeli citizens.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The driver of the van, Sivan Kurzberg, told the officers, &quot;We are Israeli. We are not your problem. Your problems are our problems. The Palestinians are the problem.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>When the men were transferred to jail, the case was <strong>transferred out of the FBI&#39;s Criminal Division, and into the bureau&#39;s Foreign Counterintelligence Section,</strong> which is responsible for <strong>espionage cases,</strong> ABCNEWS has learned.</p>

<p><strong>One reason for the shift, sources told ABCNEWS, was that the FBI believed Urban Moving may have been providing cover for an Israeli intelligence operation.</strong> A judge ordered them to be deported. But sources told ABCNEWS that FBI and CIA officials in Washington put a hold on the case.</p>

<p>The five men were held in detention for more than <strong>two months.</strong> Some of them were placed in <strong>solitary confinement for 40 days,</strong> and some of them were given as many as <strong>seven lie-detector tests.</strong>
Eventually, The Forward, a respected Jewish newspaper in New York, reported the <strong>FBI concluded that two of the men were Israeli intelligence operatives.</strong></p>

<p>Vince Cannistraro, a <strong>former chief of operations for counterterrorism with the CIA</strong> who is now a consultant for ABCNEWS, said <strong>federal authorities&#39; interest in the case was heightened</strong> when some of the <strong>men&#39;s names were found</strong> in a search of a <strong>national intelligence database.</strong></p>

<p>No, it outright confirms it. If they were aware &quot;immediately&quot; (i.e. before any investigation) that the attack was carried out by Arab terrorists, then that means they knew the attack was going to happen and who was going to do it. </p>

<p>Now, you can either choose to believe that they had the prior details of an imminent attack and decided to let the attack happen anyway (pretty bad), or you can choose to believe they orchestrated the attack and were there to document it actually taking place (worse). </p>

<p>However you want to use language to cover up their culpability, this report, and your quotes from it, make it very clear that the Israelis could have stopped this attack from happening, and yet they chose instead to let 3,000 Americans die.</p>

<p>Not at all. As soon as it was clear this was an attack, not an accident (pretty much when the second plane hit), it was perfectly reasonable to suspect Muslim terrorists, given they had bombed the USS Cole less than a year before, previously blown up American embassies, and even tried to take down the very same building. Hell, it was pretty much my own belief on the day. And at the risk of stating the obvious, I did not &quot;orchestrate&quot; or even have prior knowledge of the attack. </p>

<p>You also missed the part where they DID allegedly report their findings to the US government. There is no indication they had enough to finger specific targets or dates, or allow them to take action (and to be clear: you <strong>endorse</strong> Mossad taking out terrorist cells on foreign territory? Doesn&#39;t seem like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, who complain endlessly every time Mossad does anything!). But as soon as it&#39;s carried out, that would become kinda obvious. </p>

<p>This is a complete rewriting of the facts. The report says this:-</p>

<p><strong>All five celebrating members of the Israeli New Jersey Group arrested on September 11 were aware, when the North Tower Plane struck the World Trade Center, based on their immediate reaction to the attack and the information said to be contained in their van, that the attack had been planned and carried out by Arab terrorists.</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Were aware&quot; does not mean the same thing as &quot;suspected&quot;, so I would kindly appreciate it if you would stop rewriting the facts.</p>

<p>EDIT: <em>The North Tower was hit first, not second, making what I originally called a &quot;rewriting of the facts&quot; a deliberate lie.</em> Why are you deliberately lying? Why are you saying they only became aware after the second plane hit, when the report clearly says they were aware when the first plane struck?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You are just making lies up. They were hunted down and arrested, then transferred to the FBI for questioning. The owner of the company they supposedly worked for fled the country, they tested positive for explosives residue, the FBI found false passports, a large amount of cash rolled up into a sock, and a box cutter. The entire FBI file (minus redactions) can be found here, for anybody who didn&#39;t log on just to spread lies on behalf of the Israeli state:-</p>

<p>Nothing else found is in any way inconsistent with the far more credible explanation of an intelligence cell, e.g. false passports, cash. And, OMG, employees of a moving company had a box cutter! Woo-hoo! Case closed! Terrorism proved! /s</p>

<p>There is nothing at all to show them being in any way responsible for the events of 9/11. That certain people keep trying to force such a connection says a great deal more about their agenda than reality. </p>

<p>The facts are there for everybody to see. You claimed they only &quot;suspected&quot; Arab terrorists after the second impact.

<p>It suits you immensely to immediately reverse the allegation, since you are the one who has been caught with his pants down in a lie.</p>

<p>Again, you rewrite the facts. They tested positive for explosives residue, using precisely the same methodology which is used to sniff out bombs on board aircraft luggage and in Middle Eastern warzones.

<p>LOL indeed. Now, certainly better to err in that direction - better to alert and trigger a search that finds no bomb, than not alert and miss an actual device, I guess. But as <em>prima facie</em> evidence? It&#39;s utterly useless. There was no positive test and no explosives found.

<p>My guess is that this is your source:-</p>

<p>Lol. You quoted criminal lawyers whose job it is to get their drug-smuggling, whore-banging, Mafioso clients off the hook and you wonder why you are not taken seriously. </p>

<p>However, if I were also a lawyer, I would point you to this case, brought before the appeals court for the precise same reason you stipulated:-</p>

<p><strong>Before WOOD, Chief Judge, and FLAUM and MANION, Cir-cuit Judges.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Nevertheless, in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in Florida v. Harris, 133 S.

<p>And that should have also been the case here. You are trying to isolate the evidence from itself, as all lawyers do, when it is the very fact that there is so much of it which makes this case so overwhelmingly condemning for the men involved.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t miss anything. When you post a quote then it is your responsibility to include your source, not mine to search for it. </p>

<p>The critical problem with this particular lie of yours is that you&#39;ve tried to misdirect people about what the study actually tested. This site explains further:-</p>

<p><strong>&quot;A 2011 study published in the journal,  Animal Cognition , may, however, lead to a more general attack on the use of police detection dogs. The study, written by three faculty members of the University of California at Davis, found that under a specific testing scenario where no drugs or explosives were in the testing environment, most canine teams participating in the study nevertheless alerted to the presence of drugs or explosives <em>when the handlers had reason to believe that a target item had been placed in the environment.</em> While this study has significant consequences for training and deployment of detection teams, we believe that the findings of the study should not be used to support blanket arguments that alerts by trained scent detection dogs do not support probable cause for a subsequent search.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.animallaw.info/article/cueing-and-probable-cause-research-may-increase-defense-attacks-and-judicial-skepticism">https://www.animallaw.info/article/cueing-and-probable-cause-research-may-increase-defense-attacks-and-judicial-skepticism</a></p>

<p>So, it is clear that this problem arose when the handler himself was deceived, and this deception was then somehow transferred to the canine. Hence, all this study demonstrates is the depth and power of the relationship between handler and dog. It is in no way, shape or form pertinent to the case of the dancing Israelis, since the FBI were not expecting the men to have been handling explosives.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The results were actually from a study by researchers at UC Davis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now that I&#39;ve pointed out how you are misdirecting people regarding this study, let&#39;s go back to your very first lie. Why, when the report stated that these men &quot;were aware&quot; of who perpetrated the attacks from the moment the first plane struck, did you arbitrarily change that to them being merely &quot;suspicious of Arab terrorists&quot;, and then only after the second plane struck?</p>

<p>Why are you continuously lying?</p>

<p>LOL. Middle Eastern men are spotted &quot;celebrating&quot; on the occasion of the biggest terrorist attack in US history, the police are convinced enough of a situation to investigate -  and you somehow think authorities will be &quot;not expecting the men to have been handling explosives.&quot; You could drive a large truck, with a mural of the Twin Towers on the side, through the gaping holes in that logic. </p>

<p>The way you are switching from one lie to another the moment your previous argument is disproven supplies us with consummate proof that you are deliberately posting misinformation in the quite desperate hope that people will believe it.  </p>

<p>I was actually being generous when I tore apart your lies in the last post. The truth is that, if the correlation lies between the psychology of owner and dog, then the fact that the FBI were <em>not</em> expecting to find explosives residue means that we should have expected the explosive tests to give a negative result, regardless of whether the men had been handling explosives. Yet in fact they tested positive.</p>

<p><strong>9/11 Revisited: Declassified FBI Files Reveal New Details About &quot;The Five Israelis&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Explosive Evidence</strong></p>

<p><strong>Inside the van authorities found “a positive result for the presence of explosive traces.” According to the declassified FBI files, “A search of the van and individuals was conducted at the time of the vehicle stop. The vehicle was also searched by a trained bomb-sniffing dog which yielded a positive result for the presence of explosive traces.&quot;</strong> </p>

<p><strong>The FBI found at least four “items” related to explosive material inside the van:</strong></p>

<p><strong>◾Item # 15 is listed as a “Fabric Sample (Explosive Residue)”</strong></p>

<p><strong>◾Item #16 is listed as “Control Swabs – SA [ – ] Gloves”</strong></p>

<p><strong>◾Item #17 is listed as “Control Swabs – (Bomb Suits)”</strong></p>

<p><strong>◾Item #34 is listed as “Blanket Samples For Explosive Residue”</strong></p>

<p>You seem to be confused. The test was positive on at least four separate items and the FBI found bomb suits in the back of their van. You have been given information proving this.</p>

<p>If you believe that the same dog made four different mistakes and that there is another explanation for why these men had bomb suits in the back of their van then that&#39;s fine.
