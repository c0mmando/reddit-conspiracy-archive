       "The warning that President Dwight David Eisenhower gave us about the influence of the Military-Industrial Complex in 1961 is truer today than it was then."

        https://berniesanders.com/issues/war-and-peace/
       </a>
       sub-heading: Combating Terrorism
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the main criticisms levied at Sanders is his reticence to speak directly on foreign policy issues such as war profiteering, neo-imperialism, etc. While this is mostly true of his spoken interviews, the stances listed on his campaign website are a far cry from Hillary's neoliberal battle cries. To me they seem about as anti-military as a potential Commander in Chief can afford to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all know endless war is the fulcrum upon which TPTB convert civilian labor and taxation into their own liquid capital. Thus it falls within reason that this system is the most dangerous to speak of changing. Hillary, of course, is the war machine's lapdog, fear mongering and promoting military solutions with gusto:

        http://www.cfr.org/radicalization-and-extremism/hillary-clinton-national-security-islamic-state/p37266
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here we can draw a fairly distinct boundary between the two Democrats then. Bernie's avoidance of articulating his views on the M-I complex may simply be cautionary at this early stage. Or, his inability to confront Hillary on these matters (even buddying up to her about Benghazi at the Democratic debate) shows, implicitly, his true views on the matter:

       Not justifying it, but the way he explains it is better than the rest of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       He voted against the war. He stated multiple times that it was a bad idea. However, he says that he votes to fund the military industrial complex now because if we are going to be in a war he won't screw our soldiers and will make sure they have the best and most modern equipment to do the job.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, before you flame me, I know that it's a bad argument and doesn't make sense. I know that we don't need to spend as much as we do to have the strongest military on the planet. I'm just relaying what he said.

       He's not a hypocrite, you are falling to black and white thinking.  He was one of the few against the iraq war and many other conflicts.  There was a conflict or two he supported in Africa because he said it was a genocide.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if you are anti-genocide and fund the military, we can maybe agree that's not hypocritical, that's humanitarian.

       While Bernie seems like a politician with more integrity than the trash heap known as the U.S. congress, electing him as president would change nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       At an Iowa rally Bernie himself said that "the corporate media have so much power that no president can do what has to be done unless millions of Americans come together and say loudly and clearly enough is enough."
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately his plan for a grassroots revolution is for people to 'say loudly and clearly enough is enough' - i.e. to vote for him and blindly trust a political system riddled with corruption like rigged voting machines, gerrymandered districts, and discrete wire transfers to Cayman Islands bank accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I like his optimism and agree with many of his views, continuing our political system without first repairing its serious flaws is like jumping into a rusted barge patched with duct tape and hoping that it would float.
