    <div class="md"><p>911Blogger and AE911 had financial ties through a third company. Orangutan posted a comment that included a link to an item on the AE911 store page. That was perceived by some to be improper. Whether or not it actually was improper, the mod team felt that it would be in the best interests of the sub if Orangutan didn&#39;t remained a mod.</p>

<p>Orangutan was a good mod and the situation was unfortunate. He&#39;s still a good member of this sub and a valued mod at <a href="/r/911Truth">/r/911Truth</a>.</p>

<p>Edit: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The mods in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>[1] (specifically flytape) looked him up IRL</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s been common knowledge for a long time in both this sub and <a href="/r/911Truth">/r/911Truth</a> that Orangutan was involved with 911Blogger. Much longer than he had been a mod. Nobody here had to &quot;look him up&quot;. He&#39;s been up front about it pretty much ever since he became a partner there. It amazes me how there is so much disinformation that gets propagated around here. Or does this disinfo come from other, anti-<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> subs?</p>

<p>There was a time in this sub when pretty much everyone had civil discussions, even the trolls. Then we were overrun by people that resorted to personal attacks rather than discussing the topics at hand. Thus came about Rule 10. It hasn&#39;t eliminated them but it definitely helps.</p>

<p>Do you think people come here to waste their time reading personal attacks that have no bearing on the topics at hand? Wasting time like that <em>does</em> affect their lives. If that&#39;s what you want there are other subreddits that would probably appeal more to you. We&#39;d prefer that people here stay on topic, or at least close.</p>

<p>Edit: &quot; By definition, therefore, cultic mind control is a process of either unconscious or intentional change of an individual&#39;s behavior, thought, and emotional patterns through subtle, deceptive, and damaging  means by unethical spiritual leaders who hold positions of trust and authority over them. It involves a process whereby an individual&#39;s means of independent thought is effectively controlled and even overcome by degrees, and an entirely different mode of thinking is adopted by them which is supplied by these leaders. It is this kind of power that leads men and women in cultic groups to accept as normal various kinds of abuse, outrages and privation that those outside the groups would recognize immediately for what it is.&quot;,</p>

<p>The thing is you&#39;re never going to completely stop personal attacks on this subreddit. What someone might deem an attack, you might not. Whether it&#39;s an insult depends on the individual. </p>

<p>What you&#39;re doing is opening a huge bag of worms in the future. You&#39;ve now accepted full responsibility for all comments to not be personal attacks. </p>

<p>You&#39;re going to receive thousands of messages from users who will say, &#39;That&#39;s an attack. Delete it&#39;. or &#39;Restore my deleted message because that wasn&#39;t an attack&#39;.</p>

<p>Eventually the work load will grow too much and you&#39;ll wind up introducing a bot which scans and deletes offending comments by keywords. Then users will flag it to be reviewed and restored. After which users will revolt yelling &quot;censorship&quot; but it&#39;s a rule to not offend the subreddit or its mods. </p>

<p>Before you know it, this subreddit is dead and we find out that this was the plan all along. This subreddit had been infiltrated by the illuminati who managed to hack the original sovereignmans account. </p>

<p>We have absolutely no way to prevent that without jeopardizing having posts on the front page of Reddit.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean we shouldn&#39;t try.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what the &#39;report&#39; link is for, as I explained in my OP, and that&#39;s what we want. It goes into our mod queue, a mod sees it and makes a decision as to whether it crosses the line or not. We&#39;ve had Rule 10 for a long time now and it&#39;s been very successful. It seems like the only people that complain about it are the ones that love to personally attack others.</p>

<p>That is a bit of a problem. Most of it is caused by the growth we&#39;ve seen over the past few years and, along with that, more rule violations. We&#39;re considering adding some mods in the near future.</p>

<p>We already have one but it sends us a modmail and then a real mod decides. </p>

<p>As I said, the current rules have been in affect for a long time now and our growth continues at about 300 new subscribers every day. </p>

<p>We do, but that&#39;s not the point. The point is we want people to actually discuss the topics at hand and not call other people names.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve yet to personally experience any Rule 10 enforcement here that has benefited anyone other than the shills here.  Has anyone?</p>

<p>The rule, frankly, is not one ever of sevice to the sub or its members.  Do you know there is only one type of user who fears being called out and accused of being a shill?  I know I certainly don&#39;t fear it.  A simple review of my posting history will paint a crystal clear picture.  Interestingly enough, it will also do exactly the same for a known shill.  Yes, it&#39;s dismissive.  But if you can bring a valid argument to the table, your debates are always welcome.  The shills here refuse evidence based debate.  Their disinfo and lies will never stand scrutiny.  Truth however, will stand freely on its own.  Every single time.</p>

<p>Our moderation team refuses to address the key problems facing our sub.  The ones that destroy us just a little further every single day.  Topics are still shill mass downvoted, when simple solutions could be filled out to prevent this.  Scumbag shills, the exact same usual suspects anyone even marginally paying attention can spot from a mile away, are allowed to operate here without a single care in the world.  Accuse them of being a shill, and back it with evidence, and your post is immediately censored.  They can pack hunt with their alts or &quot;friends&quot; and nothing is done.  <strong>The selective rule enforcement here should be for the benefit and protection of the contributing members of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  NOT the shills who constantly attack us.</strong></p>

<p>Does this look fair to anyone here?  <a href="https://modlog.github.io/#/r/conspiracy">https://modlog.github.io/#/r/conspiracy</a>. Where 80% of the moderation (see: censorship) is done by one single moderator?</p>

<p>What I continue to find most intriguing are the people who actually support this heavy handed moderation of our sub.  It&#39;s almost exclusively people who most of us here have already identified as being external influences.  Not the actual contributors here themselves.  They despise this selective censorship.  They do not agree that Rule 10 helps anyone here BUT the shills.  It&#39;s so blatantly obvious sometimes, that its drifted well beyond the ridiculous to absurd.  Are the biggest threats to our sub on the inside?  Destroying us from the inside out?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you should limit free speech, but if you&#39;re going to have a debate then there should be certain rules to ensure it stays a debate and doesn&#39;t descend into a slanging match or a battle of the bullshitters. Most of the attacks come from the shills and the trolls anyway. We&#39;ve just got to try not to get sucked into their game, which can be difficult when they&#39;re being as ruthlessly nasty as possible, I grant you.</p>

<p>I think online debate needs a better set of rules than deciding who wins based on a vote though. The voting system has been proven far too easy to abuse by the brigaders. I&#39;ve been hit for about 50-60 karma tonight, which is no big deal, but I think a system where you can disqualify someone from a particular thread for making up bullshit is needed. If someone is openly distorting the facts, then I think that&#39;s an even bigger problem than being called names. If there is no (rule-based) discrimination between truth and falsehood then we&#39;re pretty much inviting shills to post propaganda and upvote it.</p>

<p>I honestly wish it worked that way, this community and what it stands for is so reviled on reddit that we can&#39;t count on being able to police ourselves given that there are so many super smart people on reddit that insist on policing us from outside the community.  </p>

I honestly don&#39;t see how that is possible, after what has been happening the past few weeks. I&#39;ve given up making excuses for Islam. They need to be rooted out of Western countries and banished, period. Islam is a disease as we can only stay healthy by purging it from Christian nations.</p>

<p>Islam doesn&#39;t need to be defended, bro. It&#39;s just a belief system. It doesn&#39;t turn you into a rapist or a paedophile.</p>

<p>I defend what I perceive to be the truth. That applies to Islam and everything else.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What has been happening the past few weeks is that Mossad have again been killing civilians, again been trying to frame Muslim extremists for what they have done, and again been stoking up Islamaphobia in the media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Censorship most certainly is not the way. It&#39;s as clear as day that our &quot;rules&quot; are used just like the default subs to censor what the mods don&#39;t agree with.  We&#39;ve seen that our leadership team here refuses to take any action to remove (or even inconvenience) the pack hunting shills who manipulate votes, attack <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> members, refuse any form of debate, advocate the same bullshit lies people are inundated 24/7 with via their televisions/radios/newspapers/magazines/corrupted social media sites - and act contrarian at every step.  The shills run rampant and unabated, while any non-direct mention of shills gets immediately censored and removed.</p>

<p>I recently requested that someone/anyone address how simple, common sense changes to how we operate can be used to slow the steady destruction of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3tz2fz/mods_please_reinstate_the_uautomoderatorenforced/cxap7sj">here</a>.  As many have remarked, a significant number of our most beneficial contributors have simply left (or were unfairly banned, for that matter).  It&#39;s becoming more and more clear that certain elements in our leadership are part of why <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is sinking just as fast as the whole of Reddit is.  Instead of focusing on what would benefit us all as a sub, they are actively working their own personal agendas as the top priority, while apparently turning a blind eye to the influx of attack shills.</p>

<p><strong>Again, I feel I have to once again state that this is NOT an attack on the sub, any specific moderator, or any specific member of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  This is simply a request for open and honest dialogue, so we can all work together to make <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> as great as we all know it can be.  A wonderful pocket of free speech and open and honest debate, in an otherwise locked down prison of a failing social website.</strong></p>

<p><em>Suggestion: Write up a set of rules that you feel would work and submit them for discussion in a self post.</em> </p>

<p>We&#39;d also need to know how you would define &quot;shill&quot; or &quot;troll&quot;. We have people who support various conspiracy theories that are constantly called trolls/shills. Which ones are really trolls/shills and which ones aren&#39;t? Who should get to decide? Should everyone that gets called a troll/shill automatically be banned? </p>

<p>The fact is that we do ban a lot of trolls/shills. I think one of our main problems is that many of the trolls/shills have learned to follow our rules and some of the biggest complainers about trolls/shills are the ones that can&#39;t/won&#39;t follow the rules.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This in itself is very suspicious. It <strong><em>almost</em></strong> sounds like you&#39;re a troll/shill trying to lead people to believe they might get banned for legitimate discussion. (See? How would that fit into your new rules?)</p>

<p>For the record, I personally would like to see a couple of the rules changed just a little bit... but not Rule 10. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s actually based solely on the fear that YOU will interpret it as an attack, and delete/censor and/or ban.  The only submissions I&#39;ve ever had censored here were 1) By you, and 2) In my eyes, entirely unjust.  It&#39;s sad that I have to use such attempted protections when simply just desiring to openly and publicly debate what is catastrophically failing our sub.</p>

<p>As to the rules being changed, I think that&#39;s a great idea.  A <em>Constitutional Convention</em> of sorts, in an attempt to right what is wrong.  What is failing our sub and her members.</p>

<p>To answer your other one-off questions, personally I don&#39;t agree with ANY censorship here.  I do not agree with or support any deletion of anything other than PI, doxx attempts, <strong>ACTUAL</strong> racism, child porn, and other illegal material.  Outside or this, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING should be forcefully censored.  The members should be free to decide what is or isn&#39;t for them, themselves alone.  This is exactly how real life works.  NOT with all corners softened and threats removed and sanitised.  We&#39;re all adults here.  </p>

<p>The labeling of anyone as a shill should NEVER be a problem.  As I said in an earlier posting, labeling someone as a shill is very dismissive OF THE PERSON.  That&#39;s why we&#39;re not debating or attacking people here (that&#39;s the shills forum disruption technique, not ours - attack the user).  We&#39;re discussing/debating concepts and ideas.  <strong>The ideas, regardless or how anyone labels you or how you label them, are all that really matter here.</strong>  The <em>shill</em> label by others shouldn&#39;t ever adversely affect the evidence based discussion/debate itself.  I&#39;ve called out quite a few blatantly obvious shills in my days.  They&#39;ve attempted to turn the tables and parrot back the exact same accusation on me.  The key difference being, it doesn&#39;t ever affect me in the slightest.  My points will stand regardless.  Their disinfo and cointelpro attempts however are instantly neutralized by such a label.  Their &quot;truths&quot; will not stand on their own, as mine do.</p>

<p>As mentioned previously, there is only one group who fears being identified as a shill.  I certainly don&#39;t, because anyone can easily view my posting history and see exactly what I promote and/or dismiss.  As you&#39;ve implied, I have absolutely no problems with this.  I don&#39;t fear it.  I don&#39;t run from it.  It&#39;s 100% irrelevant to the discussion we&#39;re having.  It doesn&#39;t soften my position.  It doesn&#39;t weaken any of the points I&#39;ve made.  <strong>Rule 10 does not serve <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> or her contributors in any fashion.  It&#39;s long overdue that we reevaluate its standing here.</strong></p>

<p>Great discussion, <a href="/u/SovereignMan">/u/SovereignMan</a>.  Thank you for finally responding, sir.</p>

<p>That may be your opinion but from what I&#39;ve seen there are very few that would agree with you. The few that do exist will jump on this post though. Personally, I think this sub has increased massively in quality <em>and</em> quantity over the past 7 years. I also think that it&#39;s largely because of our well-defined set of rules.</p>

<p>It can&#39;t be up to mods to decide who is a shill and who isn&#39;t. Trolls are a different story though. We do ban lots of them.</p>

<p>Rule 10 - ...Accusing another user of being a troll or shill can be viewed as an attack, <em>depending on context</em>.</p>

<p>When you can provide evidence of a person (or their relatives/friends) benefiting financially from their posts or comments and call them a shill then it would not be a problem. However, when you can&#39;t provide such evidence you also can&#39;t call them a shill. </p>

<p>Again, &quot;troll&quot; is different. Rule 5 forbids trolling and the word is defined differently. But Rule 2 doesn&#39;t allow users to accuse others of breaking Rule 5 (or any rule) in a comment. Considering that, having &quot;troll&quot; in Rule 10 is probably redundant.</p>

<p>Like I suggested earlier, write up a set of rules you think would improve this sub and submit it in a self post for discussion.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2012/11/the-15-rules-of-web-disruption-2/">http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2012/11/the-15-rules-of-web-disruption-2/</a> - See item #3</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, but this is an absolutely unreasonable requirement.  We are not privy to users tax documents (hitting close to home?  That ae911truth financing we&#39;ve all heard about).  Nor is this the only means of solidly indicating whether or not someone is a shill.  Is anything of the sort required for <a href="/r/hailcorporate">/r/hailcorporate</a> IDs and call outs?  I thought as much.  Based on consistent behavior, one can easily identify the likely shills and their let topics.</p>

<p>It is our responsibility and duty to each other and the community to call out shills.  We are inundated constantly with attack shills.  With pack hunting, mass downvoting, contrarian &quot;conspiracies don&#39;t exist&quot; assholes who refuse to debate us, and who serve absolutely no beneficial purpose to our sub.  <strong>There are no other subs that so readily tolerate such adversarial antagonism and harassment against their users.</strong>  We&#39;re here to openly discuss <strong>CONSPIRACIES</strong>.  Not to have lowlifes come in and work their way down the disruption techniques listed out above - (<strong><a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2012/11/the-15-rules-of-web-disruption-2/">this</a> and <a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2012/11/the-gentlemans-guide-to-forum-disruption/">this</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Your personal interpretation of the rule has shifted its enforcement entirely.  What was once in place as a rule to prevent member abuse...the regular personal attacking of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> memebers through repeatedly calling them shills, while refusing to debate their points has been changed, primarily and almost exclusively BY YOU to now mean that even just a simple mention of a shill accusation is now an automatic infringement of Rule 10, somehow worthy of complete censorship.  No &quot;attack&quot; Or evaluation of the context is ever required.  Say they&#39;re a shill, and it&#39;s an attack by default.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know where you&#39;re getting that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is somehow <strong>BETTER</strong> now, or as you put it, has &quot;<em>increased massively in quality and quantity</em>&quot; due to the enforcement of our rules.   Perhaps when used in response to the number of contrarian &quot;conspiracies don&#39;t exist&quot; shills and their alts, and the attacks they bring against our members.  Though in regards to the ability to have shill-free, open discussions about certain controversial topics (eg. the many frequent staged shootings/bombings/demolitions, false flag events), <strong>I physically couldn&#39;t disagree with you more.</strong></p>

<p>In the many years I&#39;ve called <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> my home on Reddit (originally joined a few years prior to, but really started fully becoming involved just a few short months prior to the absolute implosion then massive exodus from Digg [thanks heavily to the xio shill corruption that ran rampant there, much like what we&#39;re experiencing here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> yet again now]), I&#39;ve never seen more top contributors simply leave or be banned for highly debatable reasons.  The most valuable and beneficial members of our sub.  The very people we would want to hang on to.  Gone, I speculate is largely thanks to lax enforcement of common sense rules that would prevent those who wish to silence our public discussions, and attacks on those who have the gall to speak up.  </p>

<p>The heavy handed and highly subjective enforcement of our rules has not built a stronger community here.  It has fractured us, and has negatively impacted the quality of discussion and personal interaction here.  People are afraid to speak up.  They&#39;re afraid to contribute, because of the fear or being attacked by so many outsiders to our community.  Who are frely permitted to harass.  I cannot physically fathom how you would believe anything to the contrary.</p>

<p><strong>So let me break this down, so we can all get this straight.  What you&#39;re telling us here with this apologist nonsense is that mass vote manipulation, the pack hunting attack shills, and the constant barrages by the &quot;conspiracies don&#39;t exist&quot; fools means absolutely nothing (remember: what you permit, you promote!).  And that the ONLY ISSUE OF IMPORTANCE to our community as a whole is the complete removal of any and all shill accusations (unless, of course, you possess the entirely unreasonable requirement of financial documents that PROVE that someone is recognizing financial gain for the lies they are spreading here).  Literally above all else.  That the major concerns for our sub are meaningless, and as long as people (see: actual shills) aren&#39;t being labeled as shills, otherwise everything here is moving along swimmingly...</strong>  </p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t know how to respond to this.  Other than to tell you that what you view as the critical concerns that are destroying our community more and more each and every day is so far off base that I don&#39;t know if I can even believe that you believe it yourself.  Such a skewed perception, that very few in this thread would/will ever agree this is the case.  But mark my words.  We can revisit exactly this in a few days after others have weighed in on their take.</p>

<p>On a mostly unrelated note, I can&#39;t help but feel my spidey senses tingling...almost jumping out of my skin here.  I recently had an encounter with someone who was clearly shilling a certain heavily shipped topic on our sub.  Ceaselessly, for hour after hour after hour.  It was absolutely clear what his motives and intentions were (no need for tax documents showing who was paying for this effort).  And wouldn&#39;t you know, the only &quot;evidence&quot; valid in his eyes was EXACTLY WHAT YOU&#39;RE ATTEMPTING TO REQUIRE HERE.  What are the chances that both you and he would demand the exact same unreasonable (and largely, impossible to ever provide) evidence.   Hmmmm...</p>

<p>It amazes me how immediately silencing basically anyone that says shill has seem to become their #1 priority.</p>

<p>You&#39;re implying that I&#39;m a shill too? Because I use the actual definition of the word? Hmmmm indeed!</p>

<p>Oxford English Dictionary definition that applies to this situation: </p>

<p>You can&#39;t just choose to ignore the actual definition of the word in order to accomplish your goal. And we&#39;re certainly not going to create a new definition just to satisfy the few here that agree with you.</p>

<p>You keep arguing about our rules but you still haven&#39;t submitted a new post with your own version of what the rules should be. Unless and until you have some positive input, this argument is useless.</p>

<p>We really have no way of knowing for sure if that&#39;s true or not. We do get lots of comments accusing other users of being shills for them. We mods can&#39;t possibly know for sure if someone that is accused of being a shill really is a shill. Far, far too many people call others shills simply for disagreeing. I know that&#39;s exactly what a shill might say but, in this particular case, it is true. Seems like everybody here who doesn&#39;t believe UFOs exist, doesn&#39;t believe the Earth is flat or doesn&#39;t believe in Pyramid Power has been called a shill at one time or another. Just like everyone that is pro-GMO or pro-vaccine gets called a shill. </p>

<p>I could have put it better. This is more correct: <em>shouldn&#39;t people</em> <strong><em>accused</em></strong> <em>of being &quot;shills&quot; have the right to voice their opinions freely too?</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>when the users can spot shills and the mods can&#39;t we have a problem, which is exactly the point. a good place to start might be a real definition of &quot;shill&quot;, as it is used here, not as oxford english defined it 200years ago. if shill is the wrong word lets decide on what the right one is, and apply it.</p>

<p>i hope you mods are reading this topic heading, abiding by and applying the rules is your job. if the rules dont work we need new ones. look how many upvotes this thread has, 13 currently, that tell you anything?</p>

<p>people are free to voice whatever they want - right upto the point it becomes obvious they are pushing an antagonistic agenda or willfully undermining this community, then they get shown the door</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with that. Which is why I have never reported a single one of them. After all, the discussion helps to develop more awareness and knowledge.</p>

<p>I feel that they should legally have to put down disclaimers, but until then, we have to stay in defensive mode and share our impressions when we get them, so that we can try to protect others from possibly being deceived. It&#39;s simply additional information for others to be aware of, since many haven&#39;t had the time to really browse through their histories or analyze their behavior, and there are just too many of them to keep track of. We have to work together. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The mods should determine that from the &quot;shill reports&quot;.</p>

<p>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY-F5JoHoho">&quot;Conspiracy of Silence&quot;</a> and google it to research the controvercy behind it and tell me how the pedophille clubs are nonsense.  </p>

<p>Satanism cabals are real.  Google Aleister Crowley.</p>

<p>Believing those are nonsense is your choice.  But those who have spent a lot of time researching them and know otherwise should not be have to educate someone that has not or does not want to be educated.   </p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t been to Top Minds, check them out.  You will probably like it there.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t mind intelligent debate, but when a person by choice does not want to accept facts or reality for what ever reason should not waste the time of people who have accepted those ugly facts and are trying to deal with them.</p>

<p>If you want to argue or debate conspiracy&#39;s, or strongly believe against them, there is a debate conspiracy sub and Top Minds.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my opinion any way, and don&#39;t expect it to have any influence on you, the same way yours has no influence on me.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Crowley was also part of a satanic cabal the used drugs and had orgies and worse.  Nothing against it if that is your cup of tea.  But they do exist.  Even if you think they are nonsense.</p>

<p>Crowley had influence over a lot  of the music and occult culture long after his death.  I don&#39;t like him, agree with his beliefs, but he is hardly a clown.  Not to mention possibly the father of Barbara Bush.  That is a clown family, so maybe I shouldn&#39;t use that reference to rebut you.</p>

<p>Conspiracy of Silence was paid not to air by the Republican Party.  That is a fact.  No debate about it. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvEBmEo4IA0">Cathy O&#39;Brien</a> is another person that brings a piece to what apparently is a picture of a pedophile puzzle.</p>

<p>Say what you will about her, she comes off as honest and sincere, even though her story is hard to believe.  </p>

<p>Putting the pieces together any one with brain one would come to that conclusion.  </p>

<p>If some one has reviewed the evidence about the pedo rings and don&#39;t believe they exist either -</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A. Don&#39;t want to accept it because their brains cant deal with it.</p>

<p>B. Too stupid to put it together or see it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
<p>C. Have been paid speak against it by the sick fucks that promise them them a ticket to Valhalla, then laugh when you believe them. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is plenty of other evidence out there.  Again if you don&#39;t want to see or believe it, that is up to you.  But just don&#39;t pretend to have expertise on things you haven&#39;t took the time to research both sides of the argument.  </p>

<p>Seriously, check out Top Minds.  Leave the conspiracy talk for the ones who can accept ugly truths and try and deal with them.  I swear that will be right up your alley.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s a bunch of former Mensa members and people from other think tanks.....  </p>

<p>Ok maybe not, but you will still enjoy it and fit right in.</p>

<p>It is Nazi warfare law to not pillage or harm civilians and provide aid to those in need such as Erwin Rommel. General Erwin Rommel found himself several times behind Allied lines. On one occasion, he stumbled across an allied field hospital. They were low on supplies and he promised to bring medical supplies, after which he drove off unhindered.

The fact that you sympathize with white supremacists is unfortunate, the fact that you think these particular white supremacists meant well is lamentable. There&#39;s absolutely no basis for biological race and nationalism is a cancerous disease, which engenders the most vicious kind of social policies. There was nothing positive about the Nazi party and most of the information you&#39;ve seen is Neo-Nazi, CIA propaganda. You wanna know why the CIA behaves like a right wing, renegade entity? Its run by former Nazis, Paperclip wasn&#39;t just scientists they took dozens if not hundreds of intelligence officers. Many of them were the torture experts and mind control researchers the Third Reich had been amassing for the purposes of controlling their new Empire. They were Imperialists, no different from the Napoleonic French or Elizabethan Brits. </p>

<p>Cole admitted that between 300,000-1.5 million Jews died in the camps. I find it fascinating that the Neo-Nazis never bother to talk about the 6 million Slavs, Masons, Homosexuals, Disabled, Elderly, Political prisoners and Russians that were murdered. Or the tens of thousands of political enemies that were murdered under the third reich by the Gestapo and Brown Shirts...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So source me some evidence to this Final Solution.  You obiously know of the Holohoax so why do you still believe the Final Solution? </p>

<p>Gestapo is a French term for German Police btw.</p>

<p>Here is an excerpt you should read about the Nuremberg trials: Of course, the Soviets actually committed the Katyn Forest Massacre (mass murder of around 22,000 Poles in April and May 1940), although they did not admit it until 1990.</p>

<p>At Nuremberg, the Soviets also attempted to convict the Germans of mass extermination of Jews (and others) at the internment camps inside of Germany. Years later, even historians and Holohoax propagandists had to admit that no homicidal gassings or mass exterminations took place in the German camps located on German soil, and the story shifted to the German camps in Poland (which the Soviets controlled after the war, and where little to no investigation into the claims was allowed).</p>

<p>The following is an excerpt from &quot;An Introduction to Holocaust Revisionism&quot; by Tom Moran, an excellent article/primer, even for those not new to Holocaust™ revisionism.</p>

<p>Evil beyond contempt </p>

<p>The Katyn Forest is an area in Poland were the Soviets had massacred thousands of Polish cadre. When the Germans wrested control from the Soviets they were informed of thousands being driven out to the forest never to be seen again. The Germans located the mass graves and did a forensic archeological investigation.
At the Nuremberg trials where the Soviets sat as prosecutors and judges themselves they introduced the massacre as a German crime and the Allied members allowed it even though they knew who really did it, which tells us something ugly about the nature of the trials. Super exemplifying the basic mode of Holocaust evidence, the Soviets submitted a report hundreds of pages long totally founded on &quot;eyewitness&quot; accounts. The reality eventually surfaced in the form of an extant German report, complete with photographs of the excavation as it was happening along with foreign forensic experts and journalists invited and Allied POW officers brought in to witness the scene, all photographed at the scene. 
With the advent of Glasnost the Soviets eventually came to admit to the crime.</p>

<p>The German report stands ironically and poetically as the only real documented forensic investigation ever performed on any mass grave stemming from the WW II era.</p>

<p>Nuremberg Tribunal</p>

<p>The incident of the Katyn Forest being introduced to the Nuremberg Tribunal stands as monolithic evidence that the trials were a farce. In addition to that one grand indictment the determinations of the Tribunal also included finding the defendants guilty of mass extermination at camps in Germany, since erased from the story, and the 4,000,000 number for Auschwitz currently 1,000,000. Inquiring minds have gone over the records of the trials and the case for a kangaroo court is outstanding.</p>

<p>Now read this about the Wannsee Conference.</p>

<p>Gilad Atzmon – gilad.co.uk January 31, 2012</p>

<p>Last week, as Jewish Lobbies continue to invest enormous efforts in dictating and imposing a rigid and unquestionable Holocaust narrative, Israeli Haaretz published a short, succinct and courageous report challenging the validity of the Wannsee Conference as proof of the Nazi ‘final solution’.</p>

<p>Just ahead of Holocaust Memorial Day, the Israeli paper reported that Dr. Norbert Kampe (63), director of the “Wannsee Conference” Memorial  Centre in Berlin, has challenged some of the most widely-accepted historical ‘facts’ associated with the conference and its meaning.</p>

<p>Jewish Holocaust scholars have always insisted that the master plan for the Nazi Judeocide was conceived at the Wannsee Conference but Dr. Kampe is quoted as saying that the conference dealt only with “operational matters” instead of being a platform of any form of “decision making”. To prove his point, Kampe pointed to the fact that Hitler and his ministers were not present at the conference. Furthermore, he says, “At the time, January 1942, there was no organized plan for extermination camps.”</p>

<p>And yet, Haaretz admits:</p>

<p>“Make no mistake. Kampe is not anti-Semitic. Certainly not a Holocaust denier. On the contrary. As expected of a professional historian, he studied countless relevant texts, documents and testimonies on the particular event…His conclusion is the direct outcome of an educated analysis of written material in his possession.”</p>

<p>So courageously, a Hebrew paper praises Kampe and his “fascinating historical lesson” and also acknowledges that the Israeli Ministry of Education lacks the capacity to engage in any form of informed Holocaust debate. Haaretz clearly admits that</p>

<p>“to this day no one knows with complete certainty and confidence what exactly happened on 20 January 1942, in this pretty villa in the wealthy suburb of Berlin.”</p>

<p>Only one copy of the Wansee Conference protocol, found in 1947, survived the war, others having been deliberately destroyed by the Nazis in an effort to conceal evidence. This protocol is the only authentic documentation as to what happened in Wannsee and one of the few that made explicit use of the term “final solution”. However, Haaretz concedes that, like any historical document, the Wannsee document should be read carefully. The words “death” or “murder” do not appear in the conference protocol. Instead, it refers to “natural diminution”, “appropriate treatment”, “other solution options” and “different forms of solutions.” In fact, the only explicit references in the document deal with deportation rather than extermination. Even the famous table attached to the protocol that counts the Jews in each occupied country, does not state that those Jews are destined to be destroyed.</p>

<p>Just a few days ahead of Holocaust Memorial Day, a Hebrew paper found the courage to admit that “decades of Holocaust research could not find a clear and explicit command made by high-level Nazi officials to engage in systematic mass extermination of Jews.”</p>

<p>According to the Israeli paper, the Nazis disguised their true intentions in some “ambiguous orders and “secret codes”, which were supposed to lead officers to interpret and to react upon what they believed to be Hitler’s will.</p>

<p>The moral here is simple. Once again we learn that some Israelis are far ahead of the Western press and academia in their criticism of Jewish ideology in general and the Zionist Holocaust narrative in particular.</p>

<p>When all the credibility of the only 2 sources of evidence for a Final Solution is basically dead end claims, why do you believe in it? Too much Jewish media?  Too much Hollywood WW2 movies?  Too much History Channel?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not reading history from a Neo-Nazi blog. The Germans invaded Poland, they invaded multiple nations and took over the entirety of France. Not to liberate German citizens, not to fight the evil central bankers, which they did absolutely nothing about in Germany. It was to expand German territory. They were wars of conquest, they may have been agitated into their wars. But they took over the land, took immense financial and natural resources from every nation they invaded and then set up puppet regimes. That&#39;s not what a fucking hero does, that&#39;s what an Empire does. An empire that&#39;s expanding, i don&#39;t need to provide a single shred of evidence in this discussion. Your the one making ridiculous, illogic and unreasonable claims. Even if their was no holocaust, which there was, it would not excuse the brutal social policies, military expansion or massacring of civilians in Russia. You cannot excuse bombing London, bombing Spain to help Franco murder revolutionaries and civilians. Supporting Japans psychopathic Empire building in Asia and openly stoking racist resentment towards anyone that wasn&#39;t White or East Asian. The actions of the people responsible as well as the people who employed them, the British-American elite, are the actions of gangsters not liberators. They didn&#39;t fight a war against the bankers, the bankers funded the Nazi war machine and Fascism is predicated on the Upper and Middle classes uniting to attack minorities, foreigners, communists and the strongest Empire nearby. Its a war cult, a military religion and you basically fell head over heels for it. What differentiates the Nazis from the Allies? Very little, if anything so your bullshit Us vs them that they programmed into your subconscious won&#39;t work here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;ve never heard of the Danzig Massacres which led to the invasion of Poland? You&#39;ve never realized that there was never going to be a WW2 until the Allies formed and wanted a piece of the action and war profits?  You do remember the US embargoed the Axis and allowed Pearl Harbor to happen right? You do realize that Germany stopped Russia from invading the rest of western Europe in Operation Barbarossa right? Oh and by the way. Do you know the number 1 reason the Allies were allies? Because they all had Rothschilds central banks.</p>

<p>Before 911, the countries that did not have Rothschild Central Banks were, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Sudan, North Korea,  and Russia. Funny coincidence huh?</p>

<p>Russia and Germany always have had border disputes with Poland and this was one of those things. </p>

<p>How about you read from the top WW2 historian in the world,  David Irving. <a href="https://youtu.be/UcBVkzpYznM">https://youtu.be/UcBVkzpYznM</a></p>

<p>He was the only historian to gain the trust of Hitler’s Generals to write Hitler’s biography because he wrote an objective piece about the London bombings. He himself is British. </p>

<p>I think you should read more non propagated books to determine which reality of history is more factual. Your hollywood-esque Hitler Nazi boogeymen trying to take over the world version or the Revisionist version. You know Cole so you should definitely know Irving.</p>

<p>Also I asked 2 questions on the top and bottom of my previous comments. How convenient for you to dodge them.</p>

Nobody can call me a shill because they will look up my post history and know that I support the people against the tyrannical governments.

    <div class="md"><p>This to me looks like controlled opposition: &quot;Facebook is basically Satan. Links including &quot;facebook&quot; are automatically removed.&quot;</p>

<p>Why? Because Alex Jones said that Facebook is a CIA operation. <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> seems like controlled opposition and is probably also controlled by the U.S. government. So <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> being against Facebook is then controlled opposition. B.t.w. Alex Jones is also controlled opposition, but he does have interesting information sometimes so even <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> can be useful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Use the Report button</strong> people!</p>

<p>Also, calling people shills, zionists, etc doesn&#39;t fix things. It makes the accuser look stupid and doesn&#39;t really phase anyone anymore. It&#39;s becoming easier to tune out the more people point fingers. The trolling is obnoxious as well, and often involves calling someone the above mixed with derailing.</p>

<p>Report, downvote, whatever. Just quit with the finger pointing. This is a community about conspiracy. We need to remember who the real enemy here is, the political and corporate entities involved in usurping our rights and freedom.</p>

<p>Do you know there is only one type of user who fears being called out and accused of being a shill?  I know I certainly don&#39;t fear it.  A simple review of my posting history will paint a crystal clear picture.  Interestingly enough, it will also do exactly the same for a known shill.  Yes, it&#39;s dismissive.  But if you can bring a valid argument to the table, your debates are always welcome.  The shills here refuse evidence based debate.  Their disinfo and lies will never stand scrutiny.  Truth however, will stand freely on its own.  Every single time.</p>

<p>Well said.  This is exactly I feel, I wish I could have verbalized it as well as you just did.</p>
