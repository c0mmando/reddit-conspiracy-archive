    <div class="md"><p>The prison system is just slavery 2.0</p>

<p>The &quot;police&quot; have their origins in slaver hunters. It actually astonishes me how few Americans are aware of the origins of their so called protectors. <del>domestic terrorists</del> police departments were originally funded and created by the wealthy slave owners to 1. be slave hunters, and following the industrial revolution 2. squelch any and all protest against the rich. The vast majority of the reason Occupy Wallstreet failed was due to infiltration by the NYPD, who were trained by..... Israel... who has many Jewish bankers.... whos &quot;families&quot; (genetically defective cancer that&#39;s going to kill us all) originally obtained their wealth through slave labour... HMMMMM HMMM HMM HOW ABOUT THAT HUH.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shit, 1 year prison sentences do that much.  Further time in prison for relatively minor crimes like possession take amateurish, often harmless criminals and put them in among hardened criminals where they often develop contacts and skills to be much more serious and successful criminals later in life.  Add to that the emergence of what is essentially rent on cells and you have people who come out in massive debt with no real hope of getting a job that will support them and allow them to pay off their debt so they go back to crime.  Great for the for profit prison companies (run mostly by former law enforcement, military and intelligence figures) and the politicians they bankroll; horrible for everyone else.</p>

<p>Yup, anyone can do it, all you need is a license. Otherwise, it&#39;s illegal, and you could become the very thing you wanted to profit from. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and most people know it and can&#39;t change it unfortunately.  The prisons are privatized, which means they don&#39;t have to follow government rules.</p>

<p>Whenever you have a politician that wants to &#39;deregulate&#39;, keep in mind, that&#39;s what it means--to go private and enjoy the benefits of being uncompliant to government regulations, many of which are there to protect, not hurt people.</p>

<p>(except in the case of growing plants, using drugs, etc)</p>

<p>I hate private prisons as much as y&#39;all but if you don&#39;t think they have rules to follow you&#39;re very mistaken. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Prisons just shouldn&#39;t exist. I mean, I&#39;m not saying there aren&#39;t people who need to be locked up, but when you have to create huge, multiplex arenas to institutionalise and accommodate the production line of fresh convicts being pushed through the system, something is seriously wrong. The war on drugs has been a big contributor, I think. But just poverty alone is increasing the prison population.</p>
