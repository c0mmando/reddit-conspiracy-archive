<p>Literally the exact same comment. </p>

<p>And just about every other top comment is the same answer just reworded, except for those which pertain to current events. </p>

<p>But I&#39;m sure that nobody talking about <em>actual</em> conspiracies will get a top voted comment... God help you if you point out that 9/11 was an inside job. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Considering it&#39;s a default subreddit you&#39;re unlikely to see much get upvoted that is actually controversial like 9/11. It&#39;s not too surprising that the comment sections for a conspiracy related topic is being gamed in that subreddit. This is unfortunate, but this is how reddit functions and I doubt it&#39;ll move on from this. If you expect to speak of legitimate conspiracies or not have a bunch of joking around going on you&#39;re currently in one of the few such places on reddit to do so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s partly herd mentality and partly first come first serve.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say there is a comment towards the top that you don&#39;t want there, a quick burst of down votes on it with a quick up burst of up votes on the approved comment will bring the approved comment to the top. </p>

<p>Most readers will view the top comments and it becomes their &quot;first impression&quot;. It sets the tone of how they perceive the issue. </p>

<p>The further down a comment is the less likely it is to be seen and t&#39;s seen only after the user has become affected by their initial impression.</p>

<p>If a comment is against the agenda setting of the thread, then mods can delay it if they have no valid reason to shadowban it. </p>

<p>For example, when NASA did their AMA, I linked to NASA&#39;s own site and quoted NASA directly and asked them to clarify. To see that it has been shadowbanned, usually I expect no movement on the comment in a thread with few comments that is attracting many users. </p>

<p>You then have to go out to confirm the shadowban. Then request a mod to clarify. For the comment in question, the mod took an hour to reply. The comment was approved since really there should be no difficulty with NASA expanding on their own quote. But by this time it goes straight to the bottom of hundreds of comments.</p>

<p>By the time NASA gets around to answering questions, they skip right over mine as it had only 6 or 7 up votes. They answered questions with fewer, but had my comment had 50 or whatever, skipping it would be more glaringly obvious.</p>

<p>So why did my comment automatically trip the autofilter (as was their reason for it becoming shadowbanned)?</p>

<p>NASA has two articles discussing the cooling effects of CO2 in the atmosphere. I linked to one. Had I linked to the other, I would expect the same thing. Had I linked to any of NASA&#39;s comments that were pro-narrative, I wouldn&#39;t expect to trigger the auto filter.</p>

<p>There are the other more direct means of censorship, but these two are for when the other subjective means would be difficult to justify.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen it on this sub as well. Suddenly, top comment is very new with an extreme number of votes that sends the on point comment far down the line and puts the top comment with one mocking this sub.</p>

<p>Last weekend this was stark. </p>
