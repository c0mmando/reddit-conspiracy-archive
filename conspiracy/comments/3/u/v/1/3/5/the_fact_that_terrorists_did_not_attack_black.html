    <div class="md"><p>i wholeheartedly agree with this. what shocked me was that with all the fearmongering, all the 24-hour news coverage, all the &#39;WORLDWIDE TERROR ALERTS&quot;, not ONE word, NOT ONE WORD was said about black friday. </p>

<p>because, can you imagine how angry all the advertisers would have been? every commercial was black friday ads.</p>

<p>this world truly is fucked. absolutely zero mention of the largest conglomeration of humans at retail shopping outlets with very little police presence (if any, at a lot of them). potential for HUGE combined body counts. </p>

<p>not one word from CNN/FOX/MSNBC/MSM at large.</p>

<p>think about that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing that bothers me the most about this is that this whole idea is not even a conspiracy. It is right out in the open. Journalism is suppose to exist (at least in my view) to inform the public and act as a check to the elite and powerful. The consolidation of the media has openly resulted in 6 major corporations owning the the overwhelming majority of the media in the United States, and is spreading across the globe. These organizations exist for the sole purpose of making profit, through advertising and private funding. OF COURSE they&#39;re not going to bite the hand that feeds them. </p>

<p>At the top, yes, its a matter of corruption and greed, but also a matter of bad incentives. For the &#39;journalists&#39;, its not as much a matter of spreading propaganda and pursuing the plan of world domination, as much as it is selective coverage of events based on the control institutions in the mainstream media as a whole. </p>

<p>Any example in the capitalist model really holds fairly true to that. Off the top of my head, a mid-level manager of an auto-parts manufacturer. Constantly bringing attention to low wages of workers, racial biases in hiring, over-paid CEO&#39;s in board meetings or just in the office is career suicide. It most likely will not be dealt with directly (ie/ you&#39;re fired for bringing this to light!) but it will obviously have a significant negative impact on your career.</p>

<p>So the guy that keeps his mouth shut about these things isn&#39;t an evil master-mind, but just another pawn in the system we&#39;ve created. The same goes for many people at the top of the chain. While we easily see patterns in this perverse system, its mostly a result of the system we&#39;ve created, which is right out in the open, where society hierarchy is based on our worst traits as humans, greed and selfishness.</p>

<p>I could ramble on about ISIS, but to summarize, yes, ISIS is a proxy army of the West, in particular the United States and Israel, and the only explanation for thinking otherwise is the cognitive dissonance in believing the United States would just never do such a thing, as ISIS furthers the goals of the geo-political policies these countries have had for decades.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe he&#39;s saying that IF terrorists wanted to inflict lots of damage and kill lots of people the mall/stores/shops on Black Friday would be a perfect opportunity. Also, a great opportunity would be any of the hundreds of sporting events/concerts etc... that happen weekly/monthly.</p>

<p>Attacking these situations would leave the corporations that own the retailers and entertainment venues at a loss. It would be perfect for maximum carnage but brutal for businesses. </p>

<p>So I do see what OP is trying to say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree to an extent, but I think the main point is that the mainstream media isn&#39;t going to fear-monger the idea of going out to shop on black friday, as that would cause backlash from the advertisers and corporate interests that fund them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh. Just like any other species on earth, our genetics vary from life person to person. Some didn&#39;t hit the lottery in the looks department, is a good example. </p>

<p>To think we are all born equal when it comes to our brains, is very naive and misinformed. It takes a certain level of intelligence to even begin to see reality, like REAL reality.

    <div class="md"><p>Other than not targeting black Friday there&#39;s plenty of other reasons why terrorist are not who they say they are.</p>

<p>Every suspension bridge is held up by cables, cables that terminate on land at one central location.  The location where these cables is terminated to is usually guarded by nothing more than a 4ft tall chain link fence. You could take a concrete saw and cut through the cables in a few minutes and drop the entire bridge. </p>

<p>Another thing to point out is that almost all major oil refinery are posisitioned off of highways or close to main roads. Marathon oil refinery off i-75 near detroit is a prime example. All of the holding tanks filled with hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil are all siting  not even a 100 ft off the highway. Once person could pull up with an rpg or grenade launcher and literally blow the whole place up </p>

<p>This is how I end up on a lisy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also want to point out that regardless of the targets, these attacks serve absolutely no logical purpose. If people can get past the &quot;they hate us because we&#39;re free&quot; &quot;They aren&#39;t rational&quot; &quot;they just want to invoke fear in us&quot; - they&#39;ll see that. Carrying out these attacks only serve to draw major world powers into taking further aggressive action against them, which they have no ability to defend themselves from nor do they have any ability to wage a legitimate war against these countries.  All it serves is giving the target country the political capital it needs to progress its geo-political agenda. It makes no sense for the weak organization, and perfect sense for those in power. Yet, somehow, many people just can&#39;t wrap their heads around that.</p>
