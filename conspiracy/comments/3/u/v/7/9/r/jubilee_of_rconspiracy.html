       Not too long ago I found my personal beliefs in regards to state secrecy needing to be abolished, and the operations of this sub to be in minor conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the utility of moderator transparency was achievable thanks to software developed by goldf1sh, I felt like we absolutely should implement that software here.
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a similar proposition for you all now that I would like to call the jubilee.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly allow me to preface my motives, intention and frustration behind this idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       My motive is to let some pressure off before it builds up and explodes, my intention is that you will ALL see why our rules are shaped the way they are because of my frustration that some of us would prefer anarchy over order when it involves how this subreddit functions.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I fully support our set of rules and understand the need for each of them, what I propose is a day each month of jubilee.  Maybe something like the first and last day of each month... fall where they may, that our rules which don't require a change to automods config (Facebook links and account age) be suspended from 0001 on the last day of each month until 2359 on the first day of the following month.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would be a rule free 48 hours that straddles the last and first day of each month.  A jubilee of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I expect that such an arrangement would be a festival of nonsense, but I would be dishonest if I didn't acknowledge that many users here whom I know to be regular loyal users desire such an opportunity to vent and post memes or call people shills etc etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       This thread is purposed by me alone to guage community interest in a jubilee. None of this has been set in stone or even discussed by the mod team, this idea is in its infancy.  I value your thoughts and opinions, your feedback is important here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kind regards,

       Interesting... I suspect the outcome would be a thousand meme shitposts and shill accusations once the subs detractors found out about it. I'd be interested just to see what would happen though even though I think the rules are mostly justified and work in our favour.

       That's kind of the point of me posting this, sovereignman was beat to stitches over his post insisting that people follow the rules.  A lot of people don't want the rules to apply to them, but they surely expect them to apply to "the shills/trolls".

       You can please some of the people some of the time... The suggestion that commenters should undergo a months wait before commenting was my favourite, though I think two weeks would be more reasonable. Removing the sub from r/all would be my preference, so much stupid comes from that.

       Double edged sword though, as soon as one of the controlled-opposition subs see it they'll divert the topic and manipilate their 'truth' to the top to keep the kids from seeing any inconvenient opinions or actual reality.

       What I'd be more interested in is transparency on just the top few threads. They seem to be hit the hardest.
      </p>
      <p>
       I go into the thread and top comment is a glorious embodiment of
       <a href="/r/conspiracies">
        /r/conspiracies
       </a>
       sentiments boiled down in a well phrased, meaningful expression.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then I come back a few minutes later, and the top post is utterly contrary to 99.99% of anything in this sub with a hundred up votes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think our rules or tools address this issue. It's not the case for most threads, but the ones that start to get notice, especially in regards to certain topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't but assume that brigading is happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this sub brings to light a topic, then others should feel welcome to join in. But sticking a plausible deniability post right at the top of the thread devalues any attention that the thread generates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps, we could make a feature or a heading of plausible deniability and condemn such posts to there?

       I'm guessing it's something that can track comment scoring over time, like a revision history and then graph them out.  This seems less like a bot and more like a firefox extension that puts flyout inline graphs next to username comment header or footer.

       Okay well what I just proposed would be a test to see exactly what this subreddit would be like with no rules, like you seem to think would be superior.

       Opening up the sub-reddit to attack for 48 hours is only going to benefit those who seek to attack the sub-reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, that doesn't mean I side with the rules. Rules #10 and #11 are wide-ranging and vague enough that they could be interpreted to remove any undesirable post. And I've seen enough completely egregious post removals under those rules that I know this sub-reddit has become only slightly better than the rest of propaganddit.

       Any system can be exploited. Any time you give someone a judgment call you open the door for abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been on discussion forums (in one form or another) for a couple decades now, and there's no forum I've seen that has survived a dedicated sustained attack. It doesn't matter what rules you create: there's an empire dominating this world and it suppresses the truth wherever it can.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm only here because of the size of the audience, but it's basically pointless nowadays. Reddit's algorithm requires 10 total points on a post within an hour to leave the new queue, and that just doesn't ever happen for any truth that's actually controversial.

       Nope. Don't celebrate holidays. To me, it would be like having a holiday on the first day of every month, which was the only time when we could express emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also don't feel that the real people here would be the ones to take advantage of this holiday at all. The trolls and the shills would be the ones to take advantage of this to make it look like a really bad idea, so that it stays a holiday and nothing more.

       I honestly don't see why we can't do something similar to this idea, similar to one i put forward some months ago, 'a free talk day'. Even if we did it once a month we could start an open thread via the automod where users can discuss what they want without having to abide by the house rules. Almost like an anything goes thread.

       Can't you just ban them? Isn't what they do considered harassment and against the rules of this sub and Reddit? Even a temporary ban would be great as it would cool off the trolls and, if you're wrong and they're just regular users, minorly inconvenience them.

       These guys are bent out of shape because I don't subscribe to their particular 911 theory.  I get it! Everyone wants to win the info war, but I'm unmoved by this particular organization and mostly because of the users here who subscribe to it and how they act towards others who don't buy it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a perfect world ALL 911 theories should be discussed here without people coming under assault for not signing up for the dominant one.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one particular org that im talking about has created a toxic culture where they shun and attack people for discussing other 911 theories. This is fine and dandy within their own forum, that's their business there.  But within this forum it creates conflict that doesn't belong here.

       first of all, calling it a jubilee is just gay.  secondly, it would cause people to stop saying "this sub is under attack/ controlled OP/ censored.  thirdly it would cause people to say "this sub is under attack/ controlled OP/ censored."

       i guess my take home point here is do it, but dont call it a jubilee.  and i want to go on record right now as being the first person to call it a JEWbilee.  call it what it is: shitpost armageddon.  i cant wait!!

       yes  i know what a jubilee is, thanks though.  that article explains it quite nicely, and i actually learned a little bit more about it.  you get on upvote (in addition to this thread being upvoted).  but all kidding aside, i think this is a good idea and could be both productive and entertaining.  i hope you go through with it.

       Your solution to bullshit tactics by mods is not to address it headon, reasonably, but to plan a silly day per month of anarchy?

       Why not address it. Why are you mad?

       I find all accusations of racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia to be feelings in the face of facts. Races exist and do matter. Sex is a massive fundamental difference. Homophobia is natural and "transgendered" people are insane.

       I just came into reddit after another working class week of work to see a change that supports college liberals who think identity politics and feelings mean more than anything else. On one of the few subreddits I thought was decent.

       The idea of a jubilee in this context isn't adding new rules.  I'm not sure you even understand the idea.  None of the rules would change, there would be a window of 'no rules at all'.
