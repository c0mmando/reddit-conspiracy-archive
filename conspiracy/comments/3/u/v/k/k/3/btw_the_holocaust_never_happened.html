<p>Torture and execution was very real too tho. At least in the KZ Buchenwald I&#39;m certain of it. There are a lot of documents on the &quot;Nazi doctors&quot; and their experiments. There are also plenty kilns to see. And since germans were very bureaucratic, there is plenty information on how many got killed and how they died, but probably you will tell me those numbers been faked.</p>

<p>I&#39;m curious, who do you want to defend in this crime and why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The real reality of the holocaust was that it was an exaggerated event. The whole history behind it, is a fabrication. Many Jews died. But, so did gays, gypsies, Slavs, the mentally ill, and others. Now, the reason and how they died is a whole different story. Under the current &quot;history&quot;, there is no business like the shoah business for Jews. Also, more Slavs were killed by the Jewish Bolsheviks in Russia than the Nazi&#39;s let die in the camps. 20 million Slavs to most likely 800,000 Jews.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s safe to say that torture and murder did take place in the concentration camps in Germany and Poland, but it was mostly carried on by the prisoners themselves. The German guards were held to a high standard. They were prohibited by their superiors from mistreating the prisoners.</p>

<p>Concentration camps became work camps to forward the Nazi war effort in the 1940s, and the fun and games the camp inmates had enjoyed up to that time -- a swimming pool, soccar games, symphony orchestra, live theater, movies, a library, a brothel, and so on -- gradually began to be overshadowed by the reality of Allied bombing, which began to deny the camps the supplies and food they needed.</p>

<p>The horrors of the Nazi concentration camps were twofold. One, the horror of disease, which the Nazis did everything possible to combat. Two, the horror of starvation, which the Nazis could not prevent toward the end of the war, due to relentless Allied bombing of supply lines.</p>

<p>The rest  was mostly mythological, and grew up as the inmates exchanged stories between themselves. It was fed by Allied anti-German war propaganda. As in the first World War, the Germans once again were accused of monstrous crimes, all without the slightest foundation in reality. The truth was, the Germans were much more civil and decent in their behavior toward the enemy than the Americans, British or Russians.</p>

<p>The Holocaust myth we have today has very little truth in it. Yes, people were rounded up and put into camps. Some of them were Jews. This was a bad thing, but it was considered necessary during times of war. The Germans did it to the Jews, the Americans did it to the Japanese.</p>

<p>There was no actual &quot;holocaust&quot; of Jews. They weren&#39;t burned alive in ovens. Their dead bodies were cremated after they died of disease, starvation, or other causes. There was no 6 million Jews killed by the Nazis -- this number is and always has been totally absurd and an affront to reason and common sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It hardly matters though, if one single Jew was killed in World War II, that&#39;s enough of a &quot;Holocaust&quot; for Jewish purposes. &quot;One Jewish fingernail is worth more than a million Arab lives&quot; etc.</p>

<p>So, if one Jew was killed in World War II, we&#39;re all guilty, our children are guilty, and our children&#39;s children are guilty, forever, of &quot;anti-semtiism&quot; and &quot;fascism&quot; and everything else.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t work in reverse, however. No individual Jew is ever responsible for anything other Jews have done.</p>

<p>It&#39;s only White people that have collective guilt. So for instance, all White people have &quot;White privilege&quot; and are responsible for the &quot;legacy of slavery and colonialism&quot; etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think about it this way:</p>

<p>If far fewer Jews were killed in World War II than commonly believed, wouldn&#39;t that be a GOOD thing? Wouldn&#39;t that be a cause for celebration?</p>

<p>But the reverse is true, the idea is to get the number of Jews killed in World War II as high as possible, and by whatever fantastic means you can think of: gas chambers, ovens, soap makers, leather made out of human skin, machines that masturbate Jews to death (no, I&#39;m not kidding, look it up) Nazis changing brown eyed Jewish ladies to blue eyed with the use of magical chemicals and needles, roller coasters that fly into flaming pits, etc., etc.</p>

<p>No story is too grisly or too fantastic - if you doubt a single one, you&#39;re a &quot;denier&quot; and a &quot;neo-nazi&quot; and &quot;love Hitler&quot; etc.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all rather ridiculous, I don&#39;t understand why people put up with the bullying by hate groups like the ADL.</p>

<p>But Jews are not the only Semitic people. Why does Anti-Semitism only refer to Jews? Palestinians are Semitic people. So, according to the dictionary (and language translation, heritage), hating Palestinians is anti-Semitic. But, that&#39;s not the case.

<p>Lol, by all definition the word is incorrect, yet thrown around.... I don&#39;t hate Jews.I&#39;m simply calling out their bullshit. European (AshkeNAZI Jews) are not even Semitic people (They are converts in religion only). Yet, they are the majority in Israel who are persecuting Semitic people (Palestinians). So, who is the anti-Semite here? Seems like the majority of Israel are the biggest anti-Semites the world has seen.....</p>

<p>This is such a pointless conversation, every time a ledditor talks about Jews he tries to be a smartass when bringing up that Jews aren&#39;t the only semites. Sure they aren&#39;t, but that doesn&#39;t change the definition of the term &quot;Anti-Semite&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the Jews are the only Semitic people? Got it. But, European Jews are not Semitic, so how do we define the term? Yiddish speaking Jews are not Semitic, so does anti-Semitism only refer to Semitic Jews or all Jews?. I need to know, so I do not become anti-Semitic. Ashkenazi are from Europe (Indo-European), than there are Hasidic Jews and then there are saphardic Jews. The latter two are more Semitic, but the former are converts in religion, not race. So, the definition seems like a blanket term/stacking the deck towards Jews. Palestinians are Semitic people, yet are not protected under anti-Semitism. You guys are great at being self proclaimed chosen people. I think Israelis&#39; based on the information are anti-Semitic, seeing how Palestinians are more Semitic than they are. Russian Jew is not more Semitic than a Palestinian, sorry. People in Israel are a bunch of anti-Semites! </p>
