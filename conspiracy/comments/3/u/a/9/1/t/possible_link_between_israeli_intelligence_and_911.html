       You guys know how ‪Donald Trump‬ and ‪Ben Carson‬ said that supposedly Muslims celebrated the twin towers attack in Jersey City, and pretty much every corporate media outlet denied and debunked that this ever took place? Well there actually were people celebrating but they weren't Muslims. They were Israeli citizens and suspected, by the FBI, as agents of the Israeli Intelligence Agency Mossad.

       are you kidding....possible link?  Perhaps you have forgotten to consider the photos taken by the "Isaraeli Art Students" themselves, standing in front of cases of controlled demolition fuses, in The WTC on floor 91?  Wherein their supposed project was to take out a window, after creating a ledge to stand on, and stand on that ledge while Rich Israeli elites watched from a Rented Penthouse across the way.  These were some of the same students that showed up at US Intelligence workers homes, trying to "come in and show and perhaps sell you some art". So, in review, we have a floor procured for these students by Israeli means, and photos of them standing in front of controlled demolition fuses, stacked from floor to ceiling......yeah, there might be a possible link.

       I heard they were just Israeli art students coming from a country that experiences terror daily, and their purpose was to document the event.  Probably for some art school project.

       Nothing suspicious in that.

       That was a different story.  Also I don't see anything odd about  Israeli students selling their art to pay for their expenses in and of itself.  What was suspicious and eventually got them caught was that they were selling overwhelmingly to US officials, mostly at the DoJ IIRC.  This prompted scrutiny and it was discovered that the art they sold had hidden surveillance devices.  Some people linked it to 9//1 but I never saw anything conclusive.  Looks more just like plain old spying to get inside information on US policy before it was made public.

       The guys with the moving van were unrelated AFAIK and were cheering and videotaping.  There were, I believe 5.  It seems likely that they had played a part in planning and were celebrating the success of what could well have been years of work.
