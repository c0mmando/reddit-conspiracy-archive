       Jewish owners sold Paris’s Bataclan theater right before the attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       &lt;The Bataclan theater, targeted in Friday night’s Paris terror attacks, was Jewish-owned for decades, but was sold two months ago, its former owners said.
      </p>
      <p>
       &lt;Pascal Laloux, one of the theater’s former owners, said Saturday that the theater was “sold in September after 40 years.” His brother Joel, the co-owner, told Channel 2 that they sold the theater on ==September 11,== and he recently immigrated to ==Israel==

       ==Pic4== It's Possible that the Paris attacks might be a hoax or partial hoax. Boston Bombing had both victims and crisis actors. 9/11 had some victim simulations called 9/11 Vicsims.

       I'm going to point this out again, because i got downvoted last time. The guys at the boston bombing were not "Craft Mercenaries".  That company wasn't even a merc group- they did weapons training.

       The guys at the bombing were national guard wmd civil support team from NY.  They're all easily identifiable from pictures on the internet.

       Craft did weapons training. They were not a mercenary army like that prince company. The guys in the craft hats at boston worked for a national guard wmd unit. I forget if it was ny or ma.

       Also, I have no idea what this post is. Israel is manipulative and not a fan of france or Germany, and I have no doubt that they are using isis. But this post is way out there and when you start blaming "the jews", I doubt your authenticity.

       You might be right, but the way that you present your argument will not convince anyone. Insulting the small group of people willing to hear you out is not only a disservice to your argument, but this subreddit and conspiracy theories as a whole. There is a difference between Israel and "the jews". One is a country that should be held responsible for horrible actions, the other is a group of people who live all over the world that follow a religion and have a range of views, and are not all trying to create Greater Israel. You come off as racist. If anyone is JIDF or whatever, it's people like you, who paint valid theories with an immature and racist brush.

       Naw. It was because of GameGate SJWs that posted CP on 8chan to shut the site down.

      <p>
       Here is a video of the creator.

       You are giving this cognitive disonance response because:
      </p>
      <p>
       1: You have never researched 911 or false flags before in your life.
      </p>
      <p>
       2: You are a shill or patriotfag.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll give you some slack so I'll assume 1. But that other reply to your comment is definitely a JIDF shill. Notice the Islamaphobic bullshit he's spitting.

      <p>
       In naval warfare, a “false flag” refers to an attack where a vessel flies a flag other than their true battle flag before engaging their enemy. It is a trick, designed to deceive the enemy about the true nature and origin of an attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the democratic era, where governments require at least a plausible pretext before sending their nation to war, it has been adapted as a psychological warfare tactic to deceive a government’s own population into believing that an enemy nation has attacked them.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1954 the Israelis hired a number of Egyptian Jews to plant bombs in American and British cinemas, libraries, and other civilian targets to be blamed on the Muslim Brotherhood or other malcontents. The plan, known as the Lavon Affair, was part of an effort to convince the British to retain their military presence in the occupied Suez Canal zone. Several bombings took place, but the British were ultimately forced out after Nasser nationalized the canal in 1956.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1962 the US Joint Chiefs of Staff authored a document called Operation Northwoods calling for the US government to stage a series of fake attacks, including the shooting down of military or civilian US aircraft, the destruction of a US ship, sniper attacks in Washington, and other atrocities, to blame on the Cubans as an excuse for launching an invasion. President Kennedy refused to sign off on the plan and was killed in Dallas the next year.

       In August 1964 the USS Maddox, a US destroyer on patrol in the Gulf of Tonkin, believed it had come under attack from North Vietnamese Navy torpedo boats, engaging in evasive action and returning fire. The incident led to the Gulf of Tonkin resolution authorizing President Johnson to begin open warfare in Vietnam. It was later admitted that no attack had occurred, and in 2005 it was revealed that the NSA had manipulated their information to make it look like an attack had taken place.
      </p>
      <p>
       In June 1967 the Israelis attacked the USS Liberty, a US Navy technical research ship, off the coast of Egypt. The ship was strafed relentlessly for hours in an apparent attempt to blame the attack on Egypt and draw the Americans into the Six Day War, but amazingly the crew managed to keep it afloat. In 2007 newly released NSA intercepts confirmed that the Israelis knew they were attacking an American ship, not an Egyptian ship as their cover story has maintained.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2001, attacks in New York and Washington are blamed on Al Qaeda as a pretext for invading Afghanistan. In the months leading up to the event, American negotiators had warned Afghanistan’s Taliban that they were interested in securing right of way for proposed pipeline projects, and the US would achieve this with either a carpet of gold or a carpet of bombs. Many Mossad agents were caught and arrested on that day in truck bombs including the infamous 5 Dancing Israelis. Bush administration’s first major national security directive, NSPD-9, a full-scale battle plan for the invasion of Afghanistan, including command and control, air and ground forces, and logistics, was drafted and sitting on the President’s desk to be signed off on September 4, 2001, seven days before the 9/11 attacks. The invasion proceeded as planned in October.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are but a few of the hundreds of such incidents that have been staged over the centuries to blame political enemies for attacks that they did not commit. The tactic remains in common use today, and will continue to be employed as long as populations still blindly believe whatever their governments tell them about the origins of spectacular terror incidents.

       I apologize,  but I didn't use the term Zionists. I just copy and pasted this from 8chan where there is 0 Political Correctness.  Jews are victims of Zionism as well and there is many who are against Zionists and Israel.
      </p>

       I think it is time you learned the story of how the Rothschilds hijacked an entire Religion.

       Let me be clear. Just because a small number of Zionist Jews caused the world's problems doesn't mean all Jews did it either. Zionism is not a religion but a political ideology like fascism, and you don't have to be Jewish.  But to deny people as being Zionists and to protect them with Anti Semitic threats is a conspiracy all on its own. When people express criticism of Israel, this is always what happens.

       You know the biggest Antisemites in the world are the Israelis themselves who promote the genocide of Palestinians. Jews and Muslims lived in harmony in Palestine and Jerusalem for centuries before the Rothschilds started systematically forcing Israel into existence.

       Naw actually that guy is wrong. I did not give you a list to indicate evidence of Mossad's involvement in 911.

       I mean I could but I think you'd just chose to deny history, facts,  and evidence. I think you are the type to look away from the truth so long as it doesn't change your comfortable worldview.

       We already know what happened on 9/11.  It was Al Qaeda.  There's a mountain of evidence proving that and no evidence for the Mossad.  Not one single piece of evidence.  So, it's not worth having a debate on it.

       Then they changed it to Friday morning, not months. As it stands now, the Times of Israel has a story up that says they were warned Friday Morning, not months in advance. The Update only says "Edited for Clarification". Proof:
       <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151114222324/http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-france-defense-experts-see-parallels-to-israel/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So there's the one that originally ran:
       <a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-france-defense-experts-see-parallels-to-israel/">
        http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-france-defense-experts-see-parallels-to-israel/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And then the Edited version that says they were only warned Friday. Would've been nice if they gave everyone else the heads up too wouldn't it?
