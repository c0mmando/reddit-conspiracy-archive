Over ten years of hunting down beating and killing every single reporter who not only would write critical stores about him and United Russia lackeys. I am sure he does seem quite a hero in the international press. The website you guys seem to love is nothing more then a mouth piece for him and his party.</p>

<p>If this were how discourse was supposed to go you couldn&#39;t mention anything about the states without reminders of how fucked up the CIA have been throughout history. But we get it, it doesn&#39;t have to be mentioned every time the US does something we agree with. It&#39;s not moving the discussion forwards at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like I can trust each country&#39;s state media on most things as long as they aren&#39;t about there own country. I.e. I trust RT for most things not related directly to Russia. AJ for most things not related to Qatar and US media CNN, MSNBC for most things not directly related to US.

    <div class="md"><p>Mainstream US news is absolutely biased and there is a lot of propaganda, but the extent is debatable. Fox news for instance is highly critical of the current administration. And many media&#39;s sources were critical of the Bush administration at times. Sure they are heavily influenced by the US government and their own corporate agenda.</p>

<p>rt however is straight up propaganda. </p>

<p>All of this is ultimately irrelevant because people should always question and point out sources with known ulterior motives. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t play into the whataboutism. If rt is bad we should question it and if CNN is bad we should question it as well.</p>

<p>Rt is straight up propaganda. Don&#39;t eat their bullshit just because US propaganda also exists.</p>

<p>(Edit: Since people are completely missing the point of my post. I will reiterate. It does not matter if CNN or FOX are propaganda. The discussion is about RT. RT is 100% propaganda. If you don&#39;t read Fox new because you think it is propaganda but are happy reading RT you are an idiot. )</p>

If I recall correctly, AJ was found by one study to have the highest ratio of popularly-perceived bias to actual bias of any news source under the study&#39;s purview. Of course, it was studying Americans&#39; media perceptions shortly after the 2001 WTC attacks, so maybe the popular perception has mellowed in the interim.

<p>Anyway that is the thing somehow US has managed to get everyone to forget their sins and focus on russian ones. 
Also the depression during the 30&#39;s in america also led to mass starvation but somehow only soviet union gets branded a mass-murderer for the starvation during 1932-1934. Which granted was partially caused by soviet &quot;managers&quot; who simply were not even remotely ready to do their jobs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>no, also it wasn&#39;t entirely deliberate, it was the complete and utter stupidity of people who came into power and inability to communicate, that is how the food shortage started, then when they understood that they are short on food they sent soldiers to collect it back and understandably it became even worse. mass starvation occured not just in ukraine during that time but in russia too and starvation has been quite frequent in russia before the revolution. 
What I am saying is that everyone seems to remember the great depression as a bad time yet none seem to blame the people who caused it through the crash of the stock market, much like the 2008 recently, the bankers were rather poorly managing banks in UK and yet they still got million pound bonuses even as the banks were going bancrupt and on life support from the government</p>

<p>The problem with reading known propaganda and trying to find the truth is the when the propaganda lines up with your own prejudices you will still eat it up. </p>

<p>The stuff that&#39;s been going on with putin is a great example of this. He is saying stuff that feeds into commonly held beliefs and is patially true, but he is using this to cover or distract from his own shady actions. </p>

<p>Take a step back and look at the facts of what has happened in the past few months. All Russia has done is step in to prop up one of their regional allies. They have been almost exclusively bombing Syrian rebels and spend much less time on isis. While he is positioning himself as the guy coming in to save the day he has done little to actually combat the threat all his rhetoric is against. It is just really stupid how all of reddit is full of threads praising him for stepping up to combat isis when the vast majority of bombings are still run by the us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re saying that Putin&#39;s claim of ISIS being supported by a nation&#39;s military is false?  Do you have a source to refute that?  Because there are plenty of sources that say he&#39;s right.  If you don&#39;t think the US is arming and funding ISIS, you have either a very short or very selective memory.  The US has been funding and arming groups for quite some time now.  That&#39;s how the US has been waging war in the ME and South America post-WW2.</p>

<p>Let me run this by you.  The US has openly stated they are arming and funding the Free Syrian Army as they are currently Assad&#39;s main opposition in the Syrian Civil War.  Many members of ISIS are also part of the Free Syrian Army.  How about Al Qaeda?  Hell, there&#39;s a youtube clip of Hillary saying the US created Al Qaeda.  Al Qaeda supposedly kicked a bunch of dudes out for being too radical.  Where did those guys go?  ISIS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>RT has been great over the last 4-5 years.  Recently it&#39;s fair to take a grain of salt, but for some people the simple expanded coverage is what draws people there.

<p>It&#39;s really annoying when I link an RT article to some idiot, and then I have to relink from various other news sources because said idiot is just waiting to pull the RT card.  </p>

<p>How about talking about the actual issue at hand which is governments actively supporting terrorists who are fighting in Syria.  </p>

<p>Turkey had no place to shoot down a Russian jet that obviously was conducting operations inside Syria.  </p>

<p>Only if you remove the context of the Syrian conflict would it make sense for them to act hastily.  But since we know what we do and everybody knows they&#39;re in Syria attacking terrorists, it&#39;s a moot point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t understand how much power Putin has in Russia. Lets put things in perspective, he&#39;s been in power for 16 years.
He told the Russian oligarchs not to participate in politics at the beginning of the last millenium, what he actually meant was &quot;do not support the opposition.&quot; The main opposition leader to Putin was high profile assassinated last year. Putin remained the de facto head of government even when he was only supposed to be the premier (2008-2012) he essentially never left Presidential office. Putin has maintained a steady 70-90% approval rating throughout his tenure. Only dictators and dictator-like presidents ever get those numbers (FDR, Washington). Under Putin Russia has regained its autonomy from the Western nations. Yeltsin was essentially a western installed puppet president who allowed Organized crime and the oligarchs to openly run the nation. It is suspected that between $20-200 billion has been stolen by Putin and his coterie since 1999. Putin has engaged in 5 offensive operations in the last decade. </p>

<p>The man is a modern, Hitler 2.0. This time with no racism or open genocide. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not even *bashing him (other than pointing out he is a dictator). Its just astonishing to watch a neo-fascist pretend to be a Liberal Socialist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean there is &quot;watching RT news&quot; and then &quot;watching shows that are on RT&quot;.  There are tons of quality shows on RT that get linked to on the sites that I go to.  I don&#39;t really watch any news channels loops though so I&#39;m not 100% sure what goes on there.  I&#39;ll say that RT is really great for picking up disaffected high profile Westerners and giving them their own show to say whatever the fuck that they want to say.  Also, in reality Russia is basically not shitting on Westerners or adversely affecting their life so there isn&#39;t a whole lot to be pissed off about there (and trust me that Ukrainians are more than enough capable of fucking their own lives up and they don&#39;t need Russians for that).  In many ways I see that RT is helping the West out by giving some of its great people a large voice to promote their ideas.  Whether or not Russia itself takes any of this to heart is not of huge relevance to me.  Now about Max Keiser for example I don&#39;t see how letting him run his show that exposes the huge fraud in the Western banking industry as being detrimental to Western society and actually I think the opposite.  Western elites are currently belligerent enough that they are a threat to the common citizens of their country as well as foreign elites and that is where the sort of unspoken alliance begins.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m 35 and from California and look at how much shittier California has become in my lifetime and how much better Russia has become.  We are each born on a point and the position matters but the quality and integrity of those people alive at that moment is defined by the first and second derivative of their actions.  This doesn&#39;t mean that you necessarily want to be in another place just because it is improving from a low position but I&#39;m <strong>not</strong> convinced that a place that was once great and is in decline means that all of those people are great just because they were born in that moment to inherit and then squander wealth and freedom.</p>

<p>Those are a few examples, or you could read pretty much anything <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT_(TV_network)#Budget">in this article.</a> Totally independent, except funded by the government, in the same building as government-run media, sharing the same executives, founded by people in the Kremlin, but yes totally independent corporation!</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when it comes to Russian Media, the most egregious lies are the ones which are portrayed on the Russian-language channels and feeds which are broadcast domestically or to neighboring countries. RT is specifically put together to put out a plausible, hip counter-culture vibe that does tend to appeal to the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> crowd - which doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it&#39;s correct or complete reporting. </p>

<p>Russia has always been skilled at foreign influence and propaganda. Did you think they would simply give up?</p>

<p>Look, you can&#39;t play this game of &quot;I don&#39;t think they lie, but its OK if they do because somebody else did...or at least I think they did...&quot; The two are different things. If you want to launch an assault on US media for being false with examples, go ahead. </p>

<p>But that doesn&#39;t defend RT, which is a fully-funded propaganda arm in pretty much every way. Understand? </p>

<p>nope. just observe reality. </p>

<p>the bottom line is that I can&#39;t witness something that&#39;s happening on the other side of the world, therefore I must take someones word for it. it would be nice if it&#39;s someone I trust, but the only people I trust are those who are in my life, near me and who I care for, or at least have enough contact with to know I can trust (or trust to know when they are lying to me.)</p>

<p>everything else with a grain of salt - which doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that I&#39;m going to run to swallow what somebody else says when they tell me that the mainstream is all lies.</p>

<p>how do you know they&#39;re facts? because they sound good? I think the talking head game is bullshit on any channel. it&#39;s a format which is setup so as to make you feel like you&#39;re part of a &#39;roundtable discussion&#39; while opinions are shoveled down your throat.</p>

<p>not exactly, I decide I don&#39;t want to get drawn into a text based conversation with you about one topic mainly because I felt I more strongly agreed with you than not, and then went on to continue conversations with others. I have to chose my battles, and I felt that you more more right than wrong so agreed where I could and moved on. If we could have a beer together, I&#39;d happily talk all night about the topic, reddit is fine for snippets, but I&#39;m not looking to write a book </p>

<p>I am never claimed to be neutral other than saying I don&#39;t accept any one channel as absolute truth. </p>

<p>However, I certainly won&#39;t back down my claim that Turkey is and has been helping ISIS, and that ISIS has been funded, protected and even created by the west and it&#39;s allies. </p>

<p>This is beside the point.  The point is that media sources are blaming a terrorist attack against Russian citizens on Russia&#39;s military actions in Syria, but seemingly fail to see the irony in not blaming attacks against french citizens and citizens of other western countries on the West&#39;s military actions in those same regions against similar groups.</p>

<p>When Russians are attacked it&#39;s because of Putin&#39;s failed foreign policy.  When Western European&#39;s and American&#39;s are attacked it&#39;s because Islamists hate our freedom.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Putin is at least telling the truth about ISIS. It&#39;s not a homegrown terrorist group. For example, have you ever wondered where poor terrorists got all those new Toyota trucks? From the State Department. Or how about all those military weapons? From the Pentagon. Or who they sold oil to? Western businesses. This is not speculation, it is documented.</p>

<p>One man&#39;s terrorist is another man&#39;s freedom fighter. ISIS is composed largely -- at least among the commanding ranks -- of the same people that took down the gov&#39;t in Libya. Then they got to Syria -- thanks to the Western powers that aided and abetted them -- and did exactly what the DIA predicted: expand into Iraq and morph into the terrorist group they always were.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know America created al-Quaeda and Osama bin Laden, but I&#39;m not convinced they created Daesh at this time. I thought America gave the Iraqis military weapons and gear and then after the Americans left, the soldiers abandoned their posts when they were overrun by Daesh and the terrorists just acquired a bunch of shiny new toys. Also I&#39;m sure they stole some stuff from Syria. Plus the terrorists receive funding from many Gulf states.</p>

<p>And yes there&#39;s a fine line between terrorist and freedom fighter. Like how Putin is supposed to be in Syria to help the world get rid of Daesh &quot;terrorists&quot; but instead he has also been attacking the Syrian &quot;freedom fighters.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s part of the reason why, in this matter, I think Mr. Putin has two legs to stand on. The truth is plain as day but isn&#39;t being acknowledged.</p>

<p>Daesh is armed, funded, and trained directly as a result of US policy. The Saudis, Turks, and Israelis might be doing a lot of the dirty work, but they are spending American dollars and under the direction of American intelligence and the Pentagon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure why anyone would expect Russia to behave in any other way. Russia is smart and it protects its interests. Europe and the US are always characterizing Russia as a threat when it is always the US and its allies provoking Russia. It makes no sense for the US to be messing around in Syria - but it makes great sense for Russia to be there. its basically on its back door. RT may be a mouthpiece for the Russian government but take that to mean that it tells the truth about the US and covers things the American media intentionally blacks out. I could care less how it reports on domestic Russian things. I&#39;m not in Russia so it doesn&#39;t matter. But it will tell me what my own government is doing where US news would otherwise just obscure or ignore the story.</p>

<p>Over ten years of hunting down beating and killing every single reporter who not only would write critical stores(sic) about him and United Russia lackeys</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ridiculous disinfo. If that were true there wouldn&#39;t be Russian edition BBC Reuters etc reporters in Moscow constantly writing negative press about him. Many of the slain reporters were also critical of Dagestani and Chechen crime lords, and when they get killed by the same mafia or crime groups, the western press is so quick to pin it on Putin without even mentioning that maybe it was a result of the reporter dealing in dangerous waters in those regions. </p>

<p>Especially when you consider the tiny reach these reporters had to begin with, Putin had way more to lose from them being murdered and being blamed for it rather than them continuing to exist and reporting negative things about him. </p>

<p>Believe it or not, Putin is not the only person in Russia, there are many criminal groups including Islamic ones near those aforementioned border regions that all have their own feuds and problems with the press. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>BBC NEWS Is going to town on him pretty much saying that the 224 death plane terrorist attack was the result of his air strikes</p>

<p>&quot;This was tough language from an icy-looking President Putin. Much of his comments were for domestic consumption. After all, he launched air strikes in Syria arguing that it would make Russia safer; instead, 224 people were blown out of the sky last month in a bomb attack - and now this. 
By rounding on Turkey, he is in part deflecting any suggestion that his own policy has backfired. But he is clearly furious too and it&#39;s not clear yet how that will translate into action.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s like the news is prepping the masses to be anti Russia</p>

<p>It&#39;s already a hard pill to swallow watching how much love France got and Russia getting none following both their losses, now this.</p>

The only reason NATO hasn&#39;t done an &quot;intervention&quot; is because russia is strong enough to make it a huge trouble and US needs for the public opinion to be on its side so not before russia actually truly invades ukraine or some other neighboor, which under putin it won&#39;t do because its stupid on so many levels. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the conflict there was since the 90&#39;s when russia could not manufacture much of anything, basically the south ossetia did not want to join the new independant georgia and instead wanted independance for itself, same for abhazia, and those little countries actually have people that are not georgians living there, actual abhazians and ossetians, they are an actual ethnic group. So in the 90&#39;s they had some fighting and georgians backed down. So over the years the pressure built along with some border problems, being as both georgians and ossetians are highlander people with rather hot temper and deep family ties there were clashes between civilians in the region, between civilians and police and all that. Then georgian president boldened by US military help, instructors and equipment along with overtures to join NATO(which would never happen) he went hardline and decided to answer another incident with an invasion burning civilian villages along the way then invading the capital and street fighting for days until russians could transfer enough forces to the region. Oh and while all this was going down an american warship was going to dock in georgia with a load of military cargo. Not humanitarian but military hardware.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, wikipedia paints a different sequence of events.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Russo-Georgian_diplomatic_crisis">Diplomatic crisis between Russia and Georgia</a></p>

<p>South Ossetian separatists committed the first act of violence when they blew up a Georgian military vehicle on 1 August 2008.</p>

<p>Georgian snipers assaulted the South Ossetian militiamen during the evening.</p>

<p>Ossetian separatists began shelling Georgian villages on 1 August</p>

<p>7 August 2008, Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili announced a unilateral ceasefire and no-response order</p>

<p>Ossetian separatists intensified their attacks on Georgian villages located in the South Ossetian conflict zone.</p>

<p>Georgian troops returned fire and advanced towards the capital of the self-proclaimed Republic of South Ossetia, Tskhinvali, during the night of 8 August.</p>

<p>According to Russian military expert Pavel Felgenhauer, the Ossetians were intentionally provoking the Georgians, so Russia would use the Georgian response as a pretext for premeditated military invasion.</p>

<p>The centre of Tskhinvali was reached by 1,500 men of the Georgian ground forces by 10:00 on 8 August.[69] One Georgian diplomat told Kommersant on the same day that by taking control of Tskhinvali they wanted to demonstrate that Georgia wouldn&#39;t tolerate killing of Georgian citizens. </p>

<p>Russia falsely accused Georgia of &quot;aggression&quot; against South Ossetia, and launched a large-scale invasion of Georgia under the guise of peacekeeping operation on 8 August.</p>

<p>What I see is Russia, brewing agitation in bordering foreign country, then precipitate a crisis, then invade to help the anti-government side, then establish permanent bases in newly acquired lands. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the same thing with Ukraine, just step by step dismembering border states into new empire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok first of all south ossetia was a separate country from georgia with its own government so there was no anti-government side. There were south ossetian government and georgian one. 
As for ukraine the trouble started there before russians did anything. </p>

<p>As for the story propagated by western media and seemingly written into wikipedia as official history I remember watching tv, both western and russian and I remember well the pictures, videos of how Chinvali defending itself for days before russians came. I remember the stories of people in the villages that were shelled by the georgians, the stories of people who were hiding in their basements as the georgians were fighting with south ossetian military in the streets of chinvali. The destruction in that city. </p>

<p>Bah, whatever I have learned enough to know that what actually happens and what gets reported by western media are two different things, I have learned enough to know that both US and UK only remember the parts of events that suit their narrative. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>for two years now ukrainians are basically neo-nazis</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I live in Ukraine and it is not that way.  Jews and Nazi types are getting along well enough because they hate the Russians more.  The government allows militias to exist because otherwise they would be fighting more civil wars on its territories and the country is so fucked up that anyone willing to fight against Russia is encouraged.  Somewhat recently one of the larger militias was given more official legitimacy when their leader moved up in the Kiev government.  Additionally, early in the conflict both Moscow and Kiev alike both had motivations to kill off Ukrainian patriots and zealots because they were motivated enough to take arms against the capital city and nobody in power wants those kinds of people around.  Ukrainians rallied against their corrupt capital and then strangely joined up with it just a few moments later when confronted with an external enemy.  So then many of these people were basically sent to their deaths in Donbas.</p>

Also why hate russians? What was that they did something so bad that hate against russians became pretty much the national policy? Have they done something in the last 20 years? 30? 
Also considering how many oligarchs are still around I would say the only thing that has changed is that one kind of criminal capital has been changed for the other kind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>its not hostile takeover when the people living there in their majority decide to join a different country. 
But all of that is semantics Crimea was part of russia for ages before Khruschev himself a ukrainian gave it to ukraine in the 50&#39;s.<br/>
Didn&#39;t change the fact that most of the people living there were russians, identified with russia as their country. 
Why didn&#39;t they object when the a legitimately elected ukrainian government was overthrown in an armed coup? Because it was convenient for them. 
Also when americans invade a country(there have been quite a few) under false pretences, occupy it for years, make war on the locals its all very neatly filed away as &quot;police action&quot; and &quot;bringing democracy&quot;. Everyone seems eager to say soviet union invaded afganistan and did all kinds of bad things there but somehow everyone forgets that the CIA sponsored mujahedin splintered and became several prominent terrorist groups like Taliban.  </p>

<p>I really don&#39;t understand this Putin pole riding. He&#39;s no different than Obama or any other world leader. He lies when it suits his needs, kills those in his way, supports those that profit him and his country and tells the &quot;truth&quot; when it makes him more powerful.</p>

<p>The blinders here are astounding.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s the fact that they are able to sell oil at all.  Despite being a terrorist organization they are able to move millions of gallons of oil, most of it probably going through Turkey.  </p>

<p>EDIT: Jesus Christ. I forgot I wasn&#39;t allowed to voice an opinion in this sub without being attacked. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right that Turkey downed a Russian plane then killed the pilots. I think it&#39;s bullshit that NATO is backing that move. Is Russia in the wrong to fly in controlled space? Yes. Does that give Turkey the right to kill two Russian soldiers? Fuck no. </p>

<p>Putin. I said logical. Logical. As in, the decisions being made re: fighting isis make sense to my wee little brain. Does that mean I support everything the man has ever done? No. People have both good and bad in them. I believe that at this point in time, the decisions being made by Putin are going to do more in the fight against isis than decisions being made by other countries, US included.</p>

<p>That being said, I don&#39;t believe that that negates things that Putin has done in the past. It doesn&#39;t make me want to go visit him and have tea and cookies.</p>

<p>Some of you attack anyone with a different opinion. Isn&#39;t that supposed to be exactly what this sub stands against?</p>

<p>The reason that this post is alive and well is because there is Something more. In recent history we&#39;ve failed at every war we&#39;ve been in. From the War on Drugs to the War on Terror.  And about every war following the one where the Vietnamese beat us. Our record is not good in recent history. Remember when we talked about &quot;body counts&quot; in Vietnam because the reality of the war was unpleasant? Pot - Kettle - Black, M&#39;kay?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing in my post equated the results of Russian wars with U.S. wars or said that the Russian government was equally or less justified than the American government in it&#39;s actions. I kind of like what Putin is doing. He&#39;s strategically placed himself in a position on the world stage where he can talk about things I want in the open without certain repercussions that may have been waiting for him had he said in the past what&#39;s he&#39;s saying now. But I&#39;m not going to pretend he&#39;s a &quot;good guy&quot; and that his intentions ultimately aren&#39;t for his nation state&#39;s best interests before any type of naive code of moral justice. America just happens to be the biggest bully on the international stage. If we took an objective view of things, virtually any type of resistance to foreign American military action could easily be seen as morally justified.</p>

<p>Putin probably isn&#39;t a &quot;good guy.&quot; Not sure what that is either, I&#39;m thinking about it. I don&#39;t think &quot;W&quot; was a good guy, or Obabma, not with drone strikes and the never ending war, the joy of Guantanamo Bay, and the treatment of whistle blowers. I think we have a terrible shortage of &quot;good guys.&quot; </p>

<p>The last &quot;good guy&quot; that comes to mind was JFK. </p>

<p>But, Putin is looking better simply by comparison. Pot-Kettle-Black</p>

<p>Forgetting who was poisoning people with polonium a few years ago... </p>

<p>Edit response: Recently I&#39;m observing everywhere a kind of amnesia about why Putin was considered the &#39;bad guy&#39;. He did many bad things throughout his career. His methods were always brutal (poisonings, false flags, bombings, etc.). His policy is still expansionist (Georgia + Ukraine). </p>

<p>He can restart the offensive in Donieck and Crimea at any moment and there shouldn&#39;t be amnesia about that, because that is a currently developing situation. </p>

<p>Seriously, this amnesia has to be some kind of automatic psychological behavior. </p>

<p>Literally every nation is the same. Wherever you are from, your country has done, or continues to do the same shit. You know what the difference is? There isn&#39;t a monolithic coalition with a strong media/military apparatus that constantly acts as a watchdog over you.</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost like we&#39;re not talking about the past, but <em>right now</em> - this moment. These crimes that are happening now.</p>

<p>You can say the exact same thing of the US. The banking crisis was the US&#39;s fault, the whole shitshow in the middle east is the US&#39;s fault even some of the problems with Russia are the US&#39;s fault(imposing sanctions on a UN nation is illegal). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, Turks immediately support any military action Turkey takes. The mood of nationalism is very high with my folk. Even anti-erdogan Turks support the plane being taken down. I even believe they would have supported the gov when the military intercepted the plane, instead of taking it down. They just cheer for every &quot;pride&quot; stuff the country does.</p>

<p>Turks wouldn&#39;t care about an Israeli or US plane, I think. The gov would support Israel and US though. Only when a Turkish plane is shot down they would get very angry. Every single killed Turkish soldier makes it to the news here in Turkey. Their pictures, names, funeral, tears of the mothers, everything. They would hate Russia or Syria for this.</p>

<p>I also would like to add to these conversation, that Turkey has one of the lowest educations in the world. US citizens are 1.8x smarter than Turks. So, ignorance does play a huge role in their opinions.</p>

And reflect on the fact that you are able to jump to conclusions (like you did here about the 10 warnings thing) without having knowledge about the entire situation. From there on onwards you can realize that you shouldn&#39;t do that and that situations aren&#39;t always like how they appear at first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That statement may not be as rash as it seems. Besides the reasons being mentioned in this thread, consider these exacerbating factors:</p>

<p>-Russia and the US want to be enemies again for various political and economic reasons. Among them, war justifies actions that would otherwise be blatantly for the benefit of a powerful business interest.</p>

<p>-Morally corrupt local leaders in the middle east, like everywhere else, are keen to accumulate wealth and power at any cost. They will even ruin their own people to keep it. The world powers can easily manipulate them as proxies in their war to cover up inhumane business arrangements.</p>

<p>-There are very influential christian wingnuts who are hoping for the end of times. They want to see the 2nd coming of Christ. In their left hand are angry muslims and other resentful people who want to basically see the same thing happen. In their right hand is big business.</p>

<p>-Israel has a lot of influence too and it would love to see its neighbors pushed into oblivion. It imagines that would satisfy its security and expansion needs.</p>

<p>-The general public&#39;s mood in Russia, the USA, and in Europe has almost successfully been turned to favor war. That may harm progressive movements in those nations which, of course, benefits Big Bu$ine$$.</p>

<p>OK, so are you counting from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_Russia#Russian_Federation_.281991.E2.80.93present.29">1991 onward?</a> Or would you like to give Imperial and Soviet Russia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_Russia">her full credit?</a> Or maybe you just want to exclude the Soviet period? (embarrassing)</p>

<p>Either way I think you&#39;re wrong.</p>

Turkey absolutely has the right to defend its sovereign airspace and shoot down any and all trespassers- in fact they gave multiple warnings which they were not required to give, but those warnings were serious. The Russians have been playing games of chicken/brinksmanship and it&#39;s finally bitten them in the ass.</p>

<p>It&#39;s disgusting to me if/that Turkey supports Daesh, in any way. I heard Turkey is buying cheap oil from the terrorists. I believe Turkey doesn&#39;t exactly &quot;support&quot; Daesh, but it may rather be an &quot;enemy of my enemy&quot; thing in that Turkey is content to let the terrorists fight the Kurds or something</p>

Anyway, the idea that a head of state had someone murdered doesn&#39;t really shock me or prove much, no? Has Obama done anything like this? Hillary? Bill? Etc...? of course they have. I&#39;m not arguing that putin is my hero, just that compared to the west he sure speaks directly. He may very well also be insane. I don&#39;t know.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What the fuck is up with this Pro-Russia bullshit everywhere? </p>

<p>You have Turkey, a State with an insane civil war just over its Southern border, and a State that does not want that civil war spilling into its State, and a State that is trying to protect its territorial integrity from a separatist group, on the one hand, shooting down an armed jet bomber from a completely foreign state - one that has historically wanted to gain access to the Mediterranean - <strong>which flew its bomber over Turkey&#39;s territory</strong>, on the other hand, and people are blaming Turkey?! Seriously?</p>

<p>Imagine if China were sending arms to separatists in the Southern part of the United States in the context of an ongoing civil war right on the U.S.&#39;s Southern border, and Russia decided to start flying jet bombers over Texas. Would anyone even consider if the U.S. acted correctly in the event that it shot down such a hypothetical jet? Fuck NO! So why are these ridiculous standards being applied to Turkey?</p>

<p>I suspect many people here linking stories and commenting aren&#39;t from Turkey, aren&#39;t even from the region, and have no fucking clue how Turkish people or the Turkish government operate on a daily basis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have doubts on this one, Al-Qaeda&#39;s connections to Saudi Arabia and CIA are clear but siren gas from turkey? Let&#39;s not sling mud just to see what sticks. Let&#39;s also not forget that when we say allies to the United States we really mean proxy agents that act within a space dictated by a bigger power. The Syrian regime uses siren gas, al-Qaeda MO doesn&#39;t align with gas.</p>

<p>Unrelated note (or guess): I think al-Qaeda has been resuscitated to fight the dirty war against isis. Could this be how they got siren gas? It could be a possibility because they&#39;ve been a hallow carcass for a while now. (I know I&#39;ve gone back on what I said in the previous paragraph but it&#39;s just two scenarios/ thinking with my thumbs) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure I&#39;m about ten times too late for this, but this is the <em>third</em> time that Russian jets have breached Turkish airspace: <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/10/6/9464847/russia-turkey-jets">http://www.vox.com/2015/10/6/9464847/russia-turkey-jets</a></p>

<p>After the previous breaches, Turkey warned Russia loudly and publicly that the next time a Russian jet breached the Turkish border it <strong>would</strong> be shot down. This came alongside NATO warnings that &#39;hey, maybe russia should cut this shit out.&#39; </p>

<p>But of course they didn&#39;t. Russia is ALL about the brinksmanship and the prodding at NATO borders because he&#39;s trying to see if it will continue to support its charter in the face of actual aggression. I am <em>extremely</em> skeptical of anything Russia says against Turkey at this time because his policy in regards to Russian jets and Turkish airspace has been to fuck with them as much as is humanly possible.</p>

<p>The brinksmanship doesn&#39;t even come close to ending at Turkey either. Between March and October 2014 alone Russia engaged in almost <strong>40</strong> instances of brinksmanship with Western nations. <a href="http://www.europeanleadershipnetwork.org/medialibrary/2014/11/09/6375e3da/Dangerous%20Brinkmanship.pdf">http://www.europeanleadershipnetwork.org/medialibrary/2014/11/09/6375e3da/Dangerous%20Brinkmanship.pdf</a></p>

<p>Seriously. Don&#39;t take Putin&#39;s word for gospel - his politics is at the very minimum as dirty as anyone else&#39;s, and all the evidence indicates his is far dirtier.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I started reading this, it immediately occurred to me that this is post Crimea. So it doesn&#39;t surprise me at all to learn that Russia has responded militarily given the extreme manipulation by western power brokers in that region. </p>

<p>The very first sentence begins with a world view I do not share &quot;Since the Russian annexation of Crimea...&quot; </p>

<p>Annexation ... In international law it is the forcible transition of one state&#39;s territory by another state or the legal process by which a city acquires land.</p>

<p>Crimea was not forced to join Russia, there was a vote. And although the legitimacy of that vote has been accurately critisied for example here: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/davidadesnik/2014/03/18/how-russia-rigged-crimean-referendum/">http://www.forbes.com/sites/davidadesnik/2014/03/18/how-russia-rigged-crimean-referendum/</a></p>

<p>There is still strong evidence to that shows the vote represented the views of the majority, for example here: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2015/03/20/one-year-after-russia-annexed-crimea-locals-prefer-moscow-to-kiev/">http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2015/03/20/one-year-after-russia-annexed-crimea-locals-prefer-moscow-to-kiev/</a></p>

<p>To be honest, I&#39;m going to stop now. To me, this is an unbalanced policy brief meant to be read by people with a very specific worldview--that of the west--not to mentioned very selective memories.  </p>

<p>I am from the west and must endure the sloppy use of language and arguments 24/7 and I&#39;m honestly sick of it. </p>

<p>I agree though, Russia certainly has not rolled over and played dead which the authors of this study suggest it do or else:</p>

<p><strong>&quot;The Russian leadership should urgently re-evaluate the costs and risks of
continuing its more assertive military posture, and Western diplomacy should
be aimed at persuading Russia to move in this direction&quot;</strong></p>

<p>How should the West help Russia move in this direction, well by shooting its planes out of the sky. Very fucking logical. That&#39;s think tank logical, and this piece is clearly meant to preach to the choir that pays their salaries. </p>

<p>Russia fights to keep its national interests above water while being almost completely surrounded by NATO countries controlled by a hostile US that is known for its backstabbing duplicity everywhere it sets foot. </p>

<p>So the actions of Russia described in this paper while accurate are to me wholly justifiable in the post Afganistan/Iraq/Libya world.</p>

<p>Russia has not invaded dozens of countries while the US and NATO have so therefore the west has no more credibility to me than Charles Manson. </p>

<p>I also recognize that Putin&#39;s no angel, but going back to why I posted this thread--love him or hate him, he&#39;s got a point, and that point to me is that what the West has done all over the middle east is nothing more than a monumental exercise in hypocrisy and someone must stand up for it to stop. Unfortunately, looks like Putin is the only guy with the capacity to do that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its very simple, Russia is targeting Assad&#39;s opposition, including the Turkmen minority near the border with Turkey. Turkey is pissed and they were waiting for a jet to stray over the border. One did, so they shot it down to make a point. Nothing complicated here. If you believe either Turkey when it says it showed restraint, or Russia when it says that Turkey is being the sole aggressor you are fooling yourself. Each side is making a point. How much farther will Russia go to support Assad? How much farther will Turkey go to support the rebels against Assad, and ISIS against the Kurds? </p>

Russia has no independed newspapers left, only 1 private tv channel that you can only watch through paid cable sub. Rewritten history books. During soviet times there was several pages in the history books about famine in ukraine caused by stalin, now there is only 1 sentence in the whole book. Stalin has been turned form a killer to a national hero in the span of just few years. </p>

<p>You know nothing about Russia op I am sorry to burst your bubble but you support a ruthless dictator that killed innocent people and robbed Russia out of trillions of dollars. Not a single politician alive today did more to hurt innocent people than Putin. But you can continue to worship him its your choice.</p>

<p>You dont know because you dont live there. There is no point even continuing the discussion with you because you are so misinformed its pointless. </p>

<p>I was referring to that particular quote, not everything he&#39;s ever said. </p>

<p>As for everything else you said I agree. I&#39;m sure I wouldn&#39;t want to live there and I am totally ignorant. </p>

<p>But to answer your point, I think despite his faults, he is the one who stands up to the US and nwo and I think he provides some measure of balance to the insanity that the west has become. His foreign policy, compared to the west, seem to be much more comprehensible, logical and even honest. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why I think he is generally liked. However, I don&#39;t dispute that fact that his government like all governments are based on a monopoly on violence and often use that monopoly in unfortunate ways. </p>

<p>More than 20 journalists have been murdered in Russia critical of the regime in just the last few years. More than 150 journalists since the 90&#39;s. Every single one either wrote about Putin or wrote about corruption.</p>

<p>Now tell me why would an honest person like you said kill so many? Ask yourself that.</p>

Imagine how hard it would be to govern any country if anything was done with total transparency; having a snake in power who actually loves his country, is extremely beneficial, as when he&#39;s ready to give up, everyone will likely want to throw him out and replace him with someone more modern. </p>

<p>Forgetting who was poisoning people with polonium a few years ago... </p>

<hr/>

<p>Edit response: Recently I&#39;m observing everywhere a kind of amnesia about why Putin was considered the &#39;bad guy&#39;. He did many bad things throughout his career. His methods were always brutal (poisonings, false flags, bombings, etc.). His policy is still expansionist (Georgia + Ukraine). </p>

<p>He can restart the offensive in Donieck and Crimea at any moment and there shouldn&#39;t be amnesia about that, because that is a currently developing situation. </p>

<p>Seriously, this amnesia has to be some kind of automatic psychological behavior. </p>

I&#39;m all for Russia as a world power, but Putin has his flaws, inherent and implemented, same as anyone.</p>

<p>Russia isn&#39;t &quot;good&quot;. Russia actually employs some horrible tactics on its people and it&#39;s probably not the best place to live if you like your personal freedoms or are someone who&#39;s gay and the like. </p>

<p>The only reason Putin is staying this shit and doing all this is because the Syrian war and ISIS inconveniences them. Putin don&#39;t have to pussy foot around politics to say what he wants but that doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s good or that Russia is now some bastion of goodness in the world. Good luck being a journalist in Russia criticizing Putin or his people... </p>

<p>Putin is not a good leader for his people, and not good for the world.</p>

<p>He has moments of good work, but his nation is one mistake away from collapse, and he keeps messing around with other countries, trying to flex until he eventually takes it too far and the real world powers finally stop humoring him.</p>

<p>It&#39;s disgusting to me if/that Turkey supports Daesh, in any way. I heard Turkey is buying cheap oil from the terrorists. I believe Turkey doesn&#39;t exactly &quot;support&quot; Daesh, but it may rather be an &quot;enemy of my enemy&quot; thing in that Turkey is content to let the terrorists fight the Kurds or something</p>
