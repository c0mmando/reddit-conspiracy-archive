       my buddy just dropped 2 300+ male deer, and I personally only buy red meat from a farm a few miles from my house, and chickens the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't trusted store bought in 3 years now.  It's pretty crazy when you go into a store and ask for a 3LB whole chicken and they look at you like well we have some 9LB chickens.

       Do you use deer corn? Do your neighbors within a ten mile radius grow vegetables? If so, odds are good at least some of it is GMO. And guess what: that goes in the deer, turkey, squirrels, birds, and so forth you're likely planning to hunt. They eat it just the same as anything else when they sneak into someone's garden at night.

       Suppose you actually live in BFE though, the middle of nowhere, no civilization around for miles. You live in the US? Are you near a wildlife management area/game reserve? Odds are good they're using GMO

       I don't know, you'd have to ask a fellow Canuck. I live in the states, Louisiana specifically, and that's how they do things here. Wildlife Management sources the cheapest feed they can, usually, and that all but guarantees GMO. If your government puts out any sort of plots in those wild areas for animals to feed at (and again, it's common here), then they could very well be GMO.

       At least the GMO's would be filtered through an animal and not eaten directly. This would alleviate many of the potential risks that could possibly arise from the poorly tested new organism creation fad.

       Yes, and admittedly wild game doesn't get exposure to antibiotics (maybe? unsure on this point) or growth hormones... But they can also be disease and parasite-ridden depending on the area and what bugs have been growing in the woods. Raccoons, for instance, are some of the most filthy, parasite-infested animals you will likely ever run across. In the wild it isn't
       <em>
        quite
       </em>
       as bad, but it's still bad enough that you have to cook them carefully if you intend to eat them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand the desire to keep away from this crap, I really do. The problem is, you have to realize that there's no telling what is and isn't GMO if they're not labeling it, or what has or hasn't ingested GMO crops. Also, depending on where you are, you can't hunt year round and there tend to be bag limits on game, so you won't be living off hunting alone any time soon. Not to mention buy-in and maintenance costs--guns, ammunition, camouflage, vehicles, feed, equipment to process them if you're doing it yourself, and of course time. It's a
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       expensive hobby to buy into if you want to do it right and get results, but after that initial buy in it tends to pay for itself over time.

       These are good points. While you can likely fill a deep freezer with deer meat, squirrel, dove, wild turkey, and fresh fish during the proper seasons and live on it all year, this would have a considerable investment in equipment, time, and skill development.

       Wild game that is usually parasite infested are animals that are traditionally not hunted for meat. Anything that looks healthy when killed, is cooked thoroughly, and that is traditional game, should be safe from parasites and diseases.

       I do, and it is. Consider this. A large deer may weigh about 140 pounds. You won't get that much meat out of it. By the time you're done cleaning it, removing the bone, and processing the meat you
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       have half that in meat, maybe. It's going to go pretty quickly. Also, to do it right, you have to prepare it so it doesn't taste too gamey. Using game to supplement your diet and lighten your food costs is great, but you can't live off it without higher investment in time, which most working people don't have. Time into managing the land/body of water, catching/hunting it, cleaning it, processing it (or paying to have it processed), time into prepping it before cooking it... Things like yoyos can help with fish, but you can't exactly use the equivalent in a snare on a deer, or squirrel, etc.

       You say that, but you'd be surprised. But yeah, cooking thoroughly is the best way to be sure either way.

       Yeah people don't eat raccoons or crows, they eat deer, squirrel, fish, pheasant, turkey. Really that was a non-sequitor and GMO's aren't monolithic there are plenty of places on Earth left where they are not. This attitude is self defeating.

       You would be mistaken, sir. It's a common 'black food' here--pretty much anywhere south of the Mason Dixon. I shit you not, they love it. Perhaps you shouldn't make assumptions on how others act based on what
       <em>

       No, it wasn't, in fact it was exactly on point. It seems you just don't like the idea that they're more common than you would like to believe--so of course, in your opinion, it would register as 'not relevant'. And no, they're not monolithic, just

       And vegetables are any better?  More GMO plants than there are animals, and it's so much easier to pawn GMO fruits and veggies off as "farm grown organic" at a farmers market for increased profit.  You could very well be eating veggies grown in human waste direct from China via cargo ship.

       I can see that. Interesting articles. I feel that GM veggies are the lesser of two evils. In addition to genetic modification and antibiotics that are pumped into the animals, many are also diseased from living in their own filth, cruelty aside. Plus meat is not sustainable, especially if we are headed toward a food shortage. I'm not trying to be preachy, I don't care if anyone else eats meat, that's just my personal belief. It's your health, you can make your own judgements as to whether eating meat is worth it.

       We all do, sweetheart. I grow a lot of my own veggies, but you're right, Monsanto has farms in a headlock and it is very difficult for ordinary people to find any type of food that has not been modified in some sort of way besides growing their own, which isn't possible for many people. So the question becomes: GM Veggies vs GM Veggies + Meat that has been pumped full of antibiotics and other nastiness. I'm seriously not trying to preach, only explain my POV. I don't know what's with all the offended people, if you think meat is safe to eat, go for it.

       my problem with meat is not "is it safe or not" - its more the pain what this animals have, what i care for

       most food this days is pure poison, but when you see how long people live this days than 100 or 1000 years ago than we still make something right.

       Likewise, I've missed 20 years of food's degredation with growth hormones, antibiotics and gmo feed. I predict the generation growing up in the last 20 years or so are in for a perfect storm of health issues when they grow up.

       A majority of the vegans I know tend to know what's nutritional for them and stick to that and live healthier lives. There's really no generalization of "shit" they eat like you say. The only overweight vegans I know are the ones who eat a lot of vegan sweets. That's a very slim margin.

       Shit wasn't meant in nutritional value. His talking point was gmo/hormones, with plants you have the same issue with gmo and herbicides linked to cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       To extend on this with an example: They had a label for "organic" wich meant non-sprayed but that only included a certain list of herbicides and they used another one in much higher concentration to get the label.

      <p>
       This is why i was saying quality control is not easier with plants.

       No we're not, you're just reciting evo-psyche bullshit that's never been proven. We have the jaws and the muscles that an herbivore would have. We behave like herbivores in groups and we breed like herbivores do. Humans are behaviorally closer to Bonobos than Chimpanzees and Bonobos eat a 70-90% plant based diet, only eating meat as a sweet when they are given an opportunity to do so. This bullshit is meat industry, capitalist propaganda.

       You misunderstand, they have molars and yet they are carnivores. We have incisors and yet we are naturally omnivores who ate mostly plant based diets (roughly 80% from what we can tell). My point is that just because we have incisors does not mean we are naturally predisposed to eat meat, it just means that we
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       have the capability to do so.

       Emotion does not negate the reason behind a statement or claim, this is a logical fallacy that only gets more powerful the more misogynistic our culture becomes.

       Humans are closest related to Bonobos who are omnivores but eat vastly more plant matter than they do animal. We can see from many hunter-gatherer civilizations left over that Humans naturally eat mostly plants with a small portion of their diet dedicated to meat. This due to our poorly adapted digestive system and our inability to fell prey with our hands and teeth. The idea that we are vicious predators is a bullshit construct of the highly aggressive and patriarchal enlightenment era scientific hegemony. The more we learn about humans the more evo-psyche becomes exposed as a bogus, agenda pushing (social-darwinistic literally) psuedo-scientific field.

       you guys do know that this is done with a majority of fish farms in the u.s. right? those fish are clones wich is why there is a flavor reduction and more fat to them than wild fish or "natural" fish farms. its also dangerous for the surrounding species of fish if a clone is accidently released into the wild.

       tbh, for all we know, this has been going on with other animals for a while and they are onky now more or less making it public.

       True, they have half the arable land of the US, but meat is still rather infrequently consumed.
      </p>
      <p>
       My in-laws feed all their food waste to a piglet and their brother butchers and prepares it. This will be the main meat they eat (less and less so, but still probably more than half).
      </p>

       I watched a Chinese guy come to a pub and order the most expensive thing on the menu (in China). It was a steak, looked gorgeous, but he looked scared.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I ran a business, my British friend wanted to do a roast for Christmas, so we did a big hunk of beef. I had 25 Chinese employees. Most didn't even touch it, the others ate some to show how brave they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       When my wife and I eat out, she generally pushes most of the meat to my plate and takes my vegetables. Meat consumption in China is on the rise, but that rise is starting from a comparably low meat consumption.

       I'd say that's rather dated, currently outside super rural areas people eat meat in almost every dish. They don't typically eat steaks like we do in the US but they eat tons of pork, more than anyone else in in the world.

       They should switch to a plant based, fish based diet and stop eating meat.

       Admittedly, yes. But China does not actually supply that large a portion of the US food supply. Unless you happen to enjoy seafood, in which case, yeah they have a large hand in that. A lot of it is trade deals, too. Certain countries getting better deals to trade us their crap as opposed to paying Americans for American-grown/raised food.

       I just see it as part of a general trend of putting the food supply in fewer hands, which is happening everywhere...(except Cuba?)

       Yes, the food supply falling into fewer hands is a
       <em>
        Bad Thing,
       </em>
       especially government hands... But the idea of cloning animals to produce meat if not a bad one, and that is what I meant.

       You misunderstand, they have molars and yet they are carnivores. We have incisors and yet we are naturally omnivores who ate mostly plant based diets (roughly 80% from what we can tell). My point is that just because we have incisors does not mean we are naturally predisposed to eat meat, it just means that we
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       have the capability to do so.
