       It is freezing out so they roll out one of the victims. Per usual, the photo doesn’t reveal much, expect — hum, wait just a minute. Why did they strip off his clothes? Not even a blanket? Are they trying to give him hypothermia? Put a wounded man out in the cold? And instead of ambulances, they take the injured away in a SWAT vehicle? What knuckleheads writes or falls for these scripts?

       I was shot in the winter and it was 7 degrees out that night.They cut my pants off of me before putting me on the stretcher.  I can guarantee you I did not feel the cold. The warmth of the bullet and the shock in my body made everything OK.

       Does seem odd. If the patient sustained life threatening injuries there should be a blanket under and over them to treat for shock, even if it was a warm environment. Could be possible that they are still trying to control the bleeding but I don't see why they wouldn't at least cover his extremities.

       Don't be absurd, the weather was reported that day and hour at -8 celesus with a 20 km wind. That's a 5 degree F chill factor. "A few seconds" to take an injured person out the door and put into a SWAT vehicle, again totally absurd:

       Click on the word "hypothermia" in my previous comment for a humorous video of someone frolicking in the snow and swimming in ice cold water.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think someone on a stretcher will be okay with brief exposure to sub zero air. A bit nippy, but they'll get to keep their toes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The leg looked a bit bloody, so like my previous comment, might need to keep an eye on the injuries (Also why you'd cut away clothing).

       Yes when I was a spry 100% healthy 14 years old I swam polar bear across Brainard Lake near Ward, Colorado. But it was summer and did I feel it. But what does that have to do with this scene and the protocol used?

       It's whether or not someone on a stretcher is going to get hypothermia from brief exposure to sub zero air.
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer is: NO
      </p>
      <p>
       So now that that point is over, that leaves the second point about using the SWAT vehicle as an ambulance, which I already explained in my first comment, so that point is over too.

       In most cases, at least here, I would stick up for crazy.. But dude, you're really stretching here. I can think of a few reasons not to bring that many ambulances into the area. It could contaminate the crime scene. Security for EMTs could also be factor.  As for the possible hypothermia.. They are already going to the hospital.. for all the bullets.. That sounds urgent to me.  I don't think blankets and hot coco are on anyone's mind in this situation.

       Complete nonsense. The area is secure, they are bringing out wounded. The protocol would then be to pull the ambulances as close to the doorway as possible, bundle the patients from the cold and take them out quickly one by one with minimum of handling. Then one ASAP trip straight to hospital.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putting them into SWAT vehicles (after exposing them to cold), taking them back out (again in the cold) and then to an awaiting ambulance is preposterous. Frankly I am shocked at how divorced from reality many of you "debunkers" are. Where do you get these story lines? That's why you can only resort to one-trick pony tricks of calling those on to this, crazy.

       You think there's protocol stating you have to rug up someone who's bleeding from a gunshot wound before going outside because it's a bit cold?

       Sub zero air exposure is a bit cold. It's a bit nippy, it's a bit titillating to the skin, it's a bit frosty, a touch chilly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could've said it was either a few seconds or a few minutes. I reckon a few seconds is closer to the fact.
      </p>

       People regularly go for swims in ice cold water, in case you're not familiar with reality, swimming in ice cold water is worse than air exposure to some single digit air temps.

       I grew up in Kansas rocket scientist. Saw it all. I would NEVER have gone out butt naked in light snow and 5 degree wind chill. Not even if I didn't have a bullet wound in my leg.  You have lent new meaning to the term "suspending disbelief".

       Yes, well advised to wear a coat in winter and much more likely to live a long life. What you are describing is social Darwinism. Darwinism doesn't work in medical treatment. And on that lighter note good bye.

       Fine, I'll climb aboard the crazy train. Who benefits? What do the Illuminati/CIA/reptillians stand to gain from this? This doesn't have the feel of a gun grab or a diversion. The circumstances are too politically charged. Everything people are saying about this (ie, christian extremism) are not the sort of things the PTB would want us arguing about this close to an election.
