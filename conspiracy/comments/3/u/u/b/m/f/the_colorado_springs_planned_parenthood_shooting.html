    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t be absurd, the weather was reported that day and hour at -8 celesus with a 20 km wind. That&#39;s a 5 degree F chill factor. &quot;A few seconds&quot; to take an injured person out the door and put into a SWAT vehicle, again totally absurd:

    <div class="md"><p>Click on the word &quot;hypothermia&quot; in my previous comment for a humorous video of someone frolicking in the snow and swimming in ice cold water. </p>

<p>I think someone on a stretcher will be okay with brief exposure to sub zero air. A bit nippy, but they&#39;ll get to keep their toes. </p>

<p>The leg looked a bit bloody, so like my previous comment, might need to keep an eye on the injuries (Also why you&#39;d cut away clothing). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes when I was a spry 100% healthy 14 years old I swam polar bear across Brainard Lake near Ward, Colorado. But it was summer and did I feel it. But what does that have to do with this scene and the protocol used? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s whether or not someone on a stretcher is going to get hypothermia from brief exposure to sub zero air.  </p>

<p>The answer is: NO</p>

<p>So now that that point is over, that leaves the second point about using the SWAT vehicle as an ambulance, which I already explained in my first comment, so that point is over too. </p>

<p>All that&#39;s left is to watch the funny youtube video and laugh at how crazy the Scandinavians are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In most cases, at least here, I would stick up for crazy.. But dude, you&#39;re really stretching here. I can think of a few reasons not to bring that many ambulances into the area. It could contaminate the crime scene. Security for EMTs could also be factor.  As for the possible hypothermia.. They are already going to the hospital.. for all the bullets.. That sounds urgent to me.  I don&#39;t think blankets and hot coco are on anyone&#39;s mind in this situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Complete nonsense. The area is secure, they are bringing out wounded. The protocol would then be to pull the ambulances as close to the doorway as possible, bundle the patients from the cold and take them out quickly one by one with minimum of handling. Then one ASAP trip straight to hospital. </p>

<p>Putting them into SWAT vehicles (after exposing them to cold), taking them back out (again in the cold) and then to an awaiting ambulance is preposterous. Frankly I am shocked at how divorced from reality many of you &quot;debunkers&quot; are. Where do you get these story lines? That&#39;s why you can only resort to one-trick pony tricks of calling those on to this, crazy. </p>
