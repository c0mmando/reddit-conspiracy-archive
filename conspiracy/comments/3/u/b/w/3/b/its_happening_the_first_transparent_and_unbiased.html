    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve played too much Jenga. Even if the top fell onto the rest of the building, it would require that every support column were taken out at the precise moment. Unless that happens the building does not collapse into itself, go google any demolition gone wrong, if but one or two charges don&#39;t go off at the right moment the building does not come down. Especially wtc7 that wasn&#39;t even hit by a plane. Go google building fires, there are some that burned for 48 hours and everything was gone but the building remained standing EVERY SINGLE TIME. Then there is also the fact that these building were built to withstand a plane flying into them, but, they were full of asbestos, which would have cost Lucky Larry billions of dollars to bring back to code, this way, with the terrorist insurance he got but a few weeks prior to the attack, he was able to sue the insurance company and get two claims paid out, because you know.. Ahem.. Two towers went down. I&#39;d say, you know if one went down and the other stood its perhaps plausible that somehow the plane made of aluminum took down this steel and concrete marvel of human engineering, but 3 buildings? And one that wasn&#39;t even hit by a plane, how stupid must I be. Oh but they managed to find a passport from one of the terrorists on the ground, in that pile of dust, bullshit! The US had been warned, a few times, where were the jets? Regarding the pentagon, the most secure place on earth, and there isn&#39;t one fucking video showing a plane going into the building? Haaaa!
But please tell me how a bunch of horrible pilots that could barely fly a small plane were able to pull unbelievable moves in those big planes? Did you know that Lucky Larry and his two kids all worked in the WTC towers, did you know that all of them had a reason for being late or absent that day. Google operation Northwoods. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ill be honest. I have no idea what point you are trying to make. Are you just trying to say that the weight of the collapsing 20 floors initiated the collapse? I.e. tge pancake theory? Well then, yes that appears to have happened. However, why did the buildings (all 3) fall at or near freefall? What would it take for that to happen?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, my point. I was presented with a claim that the angle of something was proof of something. I only tried to prove it wrong, since it seemed wrong to me.</p>

<p>Now as to physics/pancake/freefall. Honestly, I took a Physics class or two in my life, but it would be far above my abilities and knowledge to estimate the fall speed of a modern skyscraper that weighs half a billion tonnes after being hit by a passenger jet. It&#39;s hard enough with point masses and constant air pressure. But in this subreddit, everyone knows how to model exactly and come out with extraordinary conclusions. It was freefall! It must have been demolished! It turned to dust! Jet fuel and steel beams! WTC7 just fell on its own (left out: after burning for hours and being hit by tonnes of burning debris!)</p>

<p>That puts me off. The evidence shown is invariably weak, so I&#39;m not even convinced of the facts; And you think I&#39;m going to just trust every single one on this subreddit to come out with the right answer after their Physics class? You know how it should go - extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence and I&#39;ve seen none.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The original argument wasnt that the angle is proof. The guy said &quot;consistent with a controlled demo&quot;, which is exactly what all three appear to be (emphasis on appear because, as you say, neither of us are experts.) However, it really only takes a basic understanding of physics to see what is implied by freefall. You dont need to understand the weight of the buildung, its structural integrities, strengths, any of that. It is all rendered moot by the freefall speeds. That means there was not one bit of the building&#39;s frame holding itself up. Nothing was resisting the fall.  If indeed the steel had merely been weakened we would have seen a slower collapse (especially with wtc7). Instead what we see is almost total collapse, like somebody kicked out the cornerstone. That can only happn if a structure&#39;s supports are all disabled/removed/destroyed simultaneously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kicking the cornerstone wouldn&#39;t imply freefall. There would still be about a hundred floors of resistance. So if I were to accept that someone made the calculations correctly and something that&#39;s close to freefall was indeed not expected unless someone removed all support, that would include removing the WTC itself. Right? If the top 20 floors fell in a free-fall, that means there was nothing stopping them, not even the 80 floors beneath them.</p>

<p>This is consistent with what the other guy says about the building just &quot;turning to dust&quot; instantaneously. An option I&#39;m inclined to ignore.</p>

<p>So I see no compelling reason to accept any &quot;alternative&quot; theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you misunderstand what would happen if the supports were negated. The floors beliw could not and would not provide resistance. Jyst because they are physically below does not mean they have the ability to push up against the motion of falling. If there us nothing supporting them they fall at freefall speeds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont disagree with the pancaking thing per se. What is odd though is, again, the free fall speed. The cornerstone thing was just a sort of metaphor. I was just trying to convey the sense that for freefall speeeds to be reached it would be like knocking down a card at the base of a house of cards. The whole thing comes down all at once cause there is no force pushing it up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, the classic &quot;but I knew people killed/affected/involved&quot; excuse.  Classic.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there were remaining pockets of tenants, however the towers were almost exclusively leased by companies with very close relationships with intelligence agencies: Finance/banking.</p>

<p>From the discussion and incredibly relevant: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Over the Months/Years between the decision to demolish the towers and 911, as leases expired and or companies relocated, they were replaced with Front/Ghost Companies. One by one. </p>

<p>Normally in commercial real estate, when office space changes hands it is gutted, then renovated to suit its new tenant.</p>

<p>In this case, it would be COMPLETELY gutted in preparation for &quot;renovation&quot;.</p>

<p>Between the traffic to lower floors, subway, and the tourist traffic going all the way to the top, there would still be tremendous lobby traffic all day. </p>

<p>We have already identified companies with close ties to Intelligence, as nearly all of them were Banking/Trading companies.</p>

<p>This did not happen in a matter of days or weeks before 911, but slowly, one tenant at a time. At no single time would there be a drastic change in traffic. it would have been a gradual change.</p>

<p>I have a spreadsheet I will have to figure out how to post over here, showing nearly all of the top people in Building Operations, Property Management, Safety, and Security all were on the victim&#39;s lists. This goes for both Port Authority and Silverstein top dogs at the WTC.</p>

<p>Also with the Express Elevator/Lobby design, people would travel right by these floors, with no chance to notice, or accidentally get off there. After all, these were Banking and Trading companies, and even under normal circumstances they are secure. All of their business is either Confidential Customer Information, or Company Trading Secrets, so they don&#39;t allow people to just visit and wander around anyway.</p>

<p>After the &#39;93 bombing, there were security checkpoints, free movement around the buildings was restricted.</p>

<p>Material was removed as part of the &quot;renovation&quot; (which is constantly occurring in big office buildings) sent down the chute to trucks, sold for scrap or sent to the City controlled landfill. </p>

<p>Certainly there would be people involved in keeping up certain appearances, but it would not take that many, as many lower floors would provide traffic. Truthfully, Office tenants don&#39;t provide a lot of foot traffic except at the morning and evening rush anyway. </p>

<p>Besides, I have pored over the NIST photos recently released, and every picture I have from 911, and the things mentioned above simply are not there.</p>

<p>Controlled Demolition and other demolition outfits don&#39;t remove EVERYTHING from their sites for fun, as you can see in the videos above, they do it because it is necessary in order not to spread it out over a square mile. When it&#39;s trajectory would start at 1000 feet above the street, imagine how far it WOULD travel.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t buy that the &quot;death ray&quot; vaporized it all except for Ruth McCourt&#39;s Papal Ring, and it is not on the street or in the rubble pile, so if it was there, where did it go?</p>

<p>And why did we not see 75,000 phones rain down on Manhattan?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely nothing preventing shell corporations from picking up leases after other, real companies moved out.  The demolition crews would strip everything down, as they do every time a tenant changes, and over the course of months and years, they would have been able to maintain shells of skyscrapers.  It&#39;s no wonder the debris piles nowhere near matched conservative estimates on how large they should have been.   The more I research this, the more plausible it becomes.  Both towers were seeing very low occupancy, and we&#39;re losing money prior to the demolition.  It&#39;s no wonder Silverstein was able to purchase it for significantly less than it was worth.  Would the Port Authority make a deal that would lose them further money if that was really was the case?</p>

<p>Wrong.  You could get off the elevator at any floor and they had stairwells that opened onto every floor.  It was a regular office building, just an extremely tall one.</p>

<p>If the destruction of WTC 1, WTC 2, and WTC 7 were caused by fire, this would make them the first steel framed high-rise buildings in history to suffer total fire-induced collapse (combined with structural damage from the airplane impacts in the case of WTC 1 and WTC 2). They would also be the first fire-induced collapses to exhibit nearly all of the features of controlled demolition and none of the features of fire-induced collapse</p>

<p>The law of physics which governed WTC 1 and 2 are the same laws of physics which govern every other building everywhere else in the world. The naivety of everyday people in wake of this incident is nothing short of stunning. They just basically said, &quot;Oh damn, if only these buildings weren&#39;t hit by a plane/on fire/had a steel core/pancaked/structurally failed then the laws of physics would have applied and we&#39;d be OK&quot;. </p>

<p>It&#39;s crazy.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing complicated about it. None of the buildings should have collapsed. WTC 1 and 2 were both impacted high above their centre of gravity by planes which were extremely small and light when measured against the size and weight of the buildings, and the worst case scenario for ensuing fires is that there would be a local failure at point of impact, causing the damaged floors to slide off to the path of least resistance. </p>

<p>Just because someone flies a plane into your upper stories, it doesn&#39;t magically quadruple their weight. </p>

<p>Bullshit. They determined the truth by following the scientific method, and the truth they determined was that the official hypothesis isn&#39;t possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think what you&#39;re describing as being &quot;problematic&quot; is what scientists call a &quot;hypothesis.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A scientific hypothesis is the initial building block in the scientific method. Many describe it as an “educated guess,” based on prior knowledge and observation. While this is true, the definition can be expanded. A hypothesis also includes an explanation of why the guess may be correct, according to National Science Teachers Association.
<strong>A hypothesis is a suggested solution for an unexplained occurrence that does not fit into current accepted scientific theory.</strong> The basic idea of a hypothesis is that there is no pre-determined outcome. For a hypothesis to be termed a scientific hypothesis, it has to be something that can be supported or refuted through carefully crafted experimentation or observation. This is called falsifiability and testability, according to the Encyclopedia Britannica.
A key function in this step in the scientific method is deriving predictions from the hypotheses about the results of future experiments, and then performing those experiments to see whether they support the predictions.
A key function in this step in the scientific method is deriving predictions from the hypotheses about the results of future experiments, and then performing those experiments to see whether they support the predictions.
A hypothesis is usually written in the form of an if/then statement, according to the University of California. This statement gives a possibility (if) and explains what may happen because of the possibility (then). For example, if garlic repels fleas, then a dog is given garlic every day will not get fleas.</p>

<p>For God&#39;s sake man, it doesn&#39;t matter if there were 200 gallon barrels of kerosene up there.

<p>Being obnoxious and offensive to me for no reason really just exposes you as an immature troll with no real argument about anything. </p>

<p>When one object is at rest on top of another, the very fact that it is at rest proves it doesn&#39;t have the necessary energy to move downwards. The acceleration of gravity obviously can&#39;t have been sufficient to force the top section downwards because neither the acceleration of gravity nor the resistance in the object changed.</p>

<p>You asked me to &quot;back up&quot; something which is so self-evident a five year old child could work it out, and then when I politely explained why it is self-evident, you insulted me and changed Newton&#39;s third law to one of your own choosing.

<p>Who cares about hot air? Do you think fire only works by heating air or what?</p>

<p>If a dragon appeared about floor 85 altitude (obviously because it was sent by the Mossad) and vaporized floors 80-90, would you expect floors 90-110 to stay in their place because fire is hot? I guess it works the opposite way too - if a building is hanging from the ceiling, and it is hit by an extremely cold airplane in the middle, there&#39;s no way the building would crash to the ground because &quot;cold air moves downwards and thus can&#39;t affect the tension above itself&quot;.</p>

<p>Next up in Conspiracy Physics: the second law of thermodynamics means that all buildings will turn to dust eventually, so why not instantaneously mid-air?</p>

<p>You are misrepresenting what I said, yet again (sigh). I said I had explained this elsewhere in the thread.

<p>That is a freeze frame of the plane&#39;s fuel tanks exploding upon impact with the building. It proves there was no accelerant to fuel a fire and if you are trying to say that was how the actual fire looked inside then you are literally an absurd liar.</p>

<p>Can you please back up your (bullshit) claim that Mossad was not involved, and your second claim that it is funny to think that they might have been. Thanks.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, but I still don&#39;t know what takes more effort: moving 20 floors of a skyscraper aside, or having them fall and collapse the whole thing down. It&#39;s a really hard problem, especially since virtually no one has experimental data as to what happens when a jet plane hits a skyscraper.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the acceleration of gravity is still not enough to push the damaged 17 floors through the remaining 93.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No wait! I have my answer. Now everything is suddenly so clear. If you would, what would the acceleration of gravity have to be so that the top 17 floors would crash down onto the 93 floors below them? That&#39;s a really interesting and difficult problem and you&#39;re obviously an expert.</p>

<p>No you didn&#39;t you just threw out conjecture. The World trade center, was built with a concrete floor with essentially a large mesh skin with suspended floors. The floors would have been ripped through like layers of tinfoil and the outside would buckle like a broken straw under pressure. The concrete core that housed the lifts would have all sorts of fuel falling through them. Hell the updraught could have taken things out. And filming from below, at that angle it would look like it was falling much faster on the outside, even if it took a few seconds longer for the core. </p>

<p>You can look at the old original construction videos. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwc49cZKunQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwc49cZKunQ</a></p>

<p>There could have been an extra 2000 tonnes on that building alone in computers and bricks of printer paper. I&#39;m all for claiming it was a false flag. But a lot of people who no nothing about architectural engineering jumping on a bandwagon. Not considering real world conditions and dismissing real edvidence because that goes against the truthers narrative. </p>

<p>So let me just get this straight, lol. You began by literally making up a story about how there was lots of flammable material in the WTC offices struck by the planes. I pointed out that this makes no difference because the laws of physics, not lack of flammable material, is what makes the official narrative inconsistent with reality. You demanded evidence. I explained the basic laws of physics again, reiterated that you had simply made your initial story up, and I am guilty of &quot;throwing out conjecture&quot;?????</p>

</ul>

<p>&quot;They simply blew up columns, and the rest caved in afterwards. . . . This is controlled demolition&quot; - Danny Jowenko, building demolition expert and the owner of a controlled demolition company.</p>

<p><strong>Testimonies about Explosions</strong></p>

<li>Besides the obviousness from the very appearance of the collapse of Building 7 that it was a product of controlled demotion, there were vast amounts of testimonies about explosions in this building.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>“I was up in the emergency management center on the twenty-third floor [of WTC 7], and when all the power went out in the building, another gentleman and I walked down to the eighth floor where there was an explosion and we were trapped on the eighth floor with smoke, thick smoke, all around us, for about an hour and a half. But the New York Fire Department . . . just came and got us out.” - Michael Hess, New York City’s corporation counsel</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Barry Jennings of the New York City Housing Authority, corroborates Hess&#39;s version of events in a interview given on the day</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I was real close to Building 7 when it fell down. . . . That didn’t sound like just a building falling down to me . . . . There’s a lot of eyewitness testimony down there of hearing explosions. . . . [A]ll of a sudden. . . I looked up, and . . . [t]he thing started pealing in on itself. . . . I started running . . . and the whole time you’re hearing ‘boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.&#39;” - NYPD officer Craig Bartme</p>

<li>Swiss-Cheese Steel -  three professors from Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) had issued a report about a piece of steel from Building 7 that was described in a New York Times story by James Glanz and Eric Lipton as...</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>“perhaps the deepest mystery uncovered in the investigation.” 13 Part of the mystery was the fact that the steel was “extremely thin,” indicating that the steel had “melted away,” even though “no fire in any of the buildings was believed to be hot enough to melt steel outright.” Another part of the mystery was that atoms in the steel seemed to have combined with sulfur “to form compounds that melt at lower temperatures,” but as to the source of the sulfur, “no one knows</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The thinning and the holes even suggested that the steel had vaporized, an impossibility in a normal office fire.</p>

<p><strong>NIST’s Falsification and Fabrication of Evidence</strong></p>

<p>NIST’s WTC 7 report repeatedly committed scientific fraud in the technical sense, as defined by the National Science Foundation.Besides omitting and otherwise falsifying evidence, NIST also committed the type of scientific fraud called fabrication, which means simply “making up results”</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Falsification</strong> - NIST “omitting data.”  While claiming that it “<em>found no evidence of a . . . controlled demolition event</em>”  NIST simply omitted an enormous amount of evidence for that conclusion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Omitting Testimonial Evidence</strong> - NIST failed to mention any of the testimonial evidence for explosions.  NIST also failed to mention any of the reports of explosions just as the building started to come down. Even though vast amounts of video evidence corroborates this testimonial evidence</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Omitting Physical Evidence</strong>
NIST’s report on this building also omitted various types of physical evidence.
One of these was the piece of Swiss-cheese steel reported by the three WPI professors in a paper that was, as mentioned earlier, included as an appendix to the 2002 FEMA report.
Another was the melted iron, the RJ Lee Group, a scientific research organization,  proved this, the RJ Lee Group said in its final (2004) report, </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>spherical iron particles (the iron had) melted during the WTC Event, producing spherical metallic particles</em></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Melted Molybdenum</strong> - Another study was carried out by scientists at the US Geological Survey. Besides also finding the spherical iron particles, these scientists found that something had melted molybdenum, which has an extremely high melting point: 4,753°F (2,623°C).  Although these USGS scientists failed to mention this discovery in the published version of their report, a group of scientists led by Steven Jones, having obtained the USGS team’s data through a FOIA request, reported evidence that this team had devoted serious study to “a molybdenum-rich spherule.”  NIST, however, failed to mention this discovery by the US Geological Survey, although it is another federal agency.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nanothermite</strong> - A peer-reviewed report by University of Copenhagen chemist Niels Harrit and several co-authors, including physicist Steven Jones and chemist Kevin Ryan, showed that the WTC dust contained unreacted nanothermite. Unlike ordinary thermite, which is an incendiary, nanothermite is a high explosive.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Girder Shear Studs and Omission of Stiffener Plates</strong>
NIST claims that a steel girder connecting columns 44 and 79  broke loose. Having lost its support, column 79 failed, starting a chain reaction in which all the other columns failed. Leaving aside the impossibility of this scenario, NIST’s claims that it was not connected to the floor slab with sheer studs. NIST wrote: “<em>In WTC 7, no studs were installed on the girders</em>.”  In another passage, NIST said: “<em>Floor beams  had shear studs, but the girders that supported the floor beams did not have shear studs</em>.” 
Shear studs were used to anchor the beams and girders, including the girder in question and it is irrefutable that the stiffeners were omitted and that their inclusion in any analysis would render the NIST collapse initiation claim thoroughly impossible</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A Raging 12 th Floor Fire at 5:00</strong>
Although in its 2004 Interim Report on WTC 7 , NIST said that by 4:45 PM, “<em>the fire on Floor 12 was burned out</em>”  it claimed in its 2008 report that at 5:00, just 21 minutes before the building collapsed, the fire on this floor was still going strong.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p><strong>NIST admit that their theory is not consistent with physical principles, which means they are not based on the laws of physics.</strong></p>

<p>Building 7 came down at around the same rate as a free-falling object, it was in free-fall for 2.25 seconds. But in NIST’s Draft for Public Comment, issued in August 2008, it denied this, saying that the time it took for the upper floors — the only floors that are visible on the videos – to come down <em>“was approximately 40 percent longer than the computed free fall time and was consistent with physical principles</em>” 
As this statement implies, any assertion that the building did come down in free fall would not be consistent with physical principles — meaning the laws of physics. Explaining why not, during a “WTC 7 Technical Briefing” on August 26, 2008, Shyam Sunder said....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>free fall time would be [the fall time of] an object that has no structural components below it. . . The time that it took . . . for those 17 floors to disappear [was roughly 40 percent longer than free fall]. And that is not at all unusual, because there was structural resistance that was provided in this particular case. And you had a sequence of structural failures that had to take place. Everything was not instantaneous</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But in NIST’s final report, which came out in November 2008, it admitted free fall and free fall can only be achieved if there is zero resistance to motion. NIST no longer claim that its analysis was consistent with the laws of physics</p>

<p>Regardless of this fact, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxl06jxfgRk">WTC 7 went into free-fall (click for a compilation)</a>, literally gravitational acceleration <a href="http://i.imgur.com/N23Y89K.png">(the official reports even admit this)</a> which is impossible in a steel framed building, there is nothing in science or engineering that would explain how every single supporting column would disappear within mere fractions of a second, the only explanation, within the realms of science, is explosives of some description, taking out the columns in a timed sequence.</p>

<p>This violates basic Newtonian physics, IF, you choose to believe the official report that fires caused the collapse, obviously it is impossible for a building to go into freefall in any other scenario, this explains why NIST refuse to release there data for independent validation, the only relevant documents that support their theory that fire brought down a steel framed building (first time in history, still to this day) <a href="http://cryptome.org/nist070709.pdf">are classified for public safety</a>, they will not even release them to a <a href="http://cryptome.org/wtc-nist-wtc7-no.pdf">licensed NYC architect in regards a FOIA request</a></p>

<p>The acceleration of gravity in New York City is 32.159 ft/s2. WTC7 had 2.25 seconds of literal freefall, this is equivalent to approximately 8 stories of fall in which the falling section of the building encountered zero resistance. The collapse was complete in 6.5 seconds. Free-fall time in a vacuum, from Building 7&#39;s roof is 5.96 seconds</p>

<p>For any object to fall at gravitational acceleration, there can be nothing below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance. If there is anything below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance, then not all of the potential energy of the object would be converted to motion and so would not be found falling at gravitational acceleration (where did every single structural supporting columns go, instantly, at the exact same time?)</p>

<p>There&#39;s no exception to that rule, those are the conditions that must exist for gravitational acceleration to occur for the entirety of the duration of the time it occurs, this is basic Newtonian physical principles.</p>

<p>You either agree with this very basic concept, or you need to start making a case for a new realm of science that has never been witnessed before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NIST’s findings do not support the “pancake theory” of collapse, which is premised on a progressive failure of the floor systems in the WTC towers (the composite floor system—that connected the core columns and the perimeter columns—consisted of a grid of steel “trusses” integrated with a concrete slab; see diagram). Instead, the NIST investigation showed conclusively that the failure of the inwardly bowed perimeter columns initiated collapse and that the occurrence of this inward bowing required the sagging floors to remain connected to the columns and pull the columns inwards. Thus, the floors did not fail progressively to cause a pancaking phenomenon.

    <div class="md"><p>Ill be honest. I have no idea what point you are trying to make. Are you just trying to say that the weight of the collapsing 20 floors initiated the collapse? I.e. tge pancake theory? Well then, yes that appears to have happened. However, why did the buildings (all 3) fall at or near freefall? What would it take for that to happen?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re all agreed then. It fell at free fall because there was nothing impeding it. Because it&#39;s supporting structure collapsed. </p>

<p>Anyway good luck with your thing. I think these guys missed the boat though, most people are over WTC7 now.</p>

<p>Your basic definition of a valid argument is &quot;an argument that supports what I want to believe&quot;.</p>

<p>Being obnoxious and offensive to me for no reason really just exposes you as an immature troll with no real argument about anything. </p>

<p>When one object is at rest on top of another, the very fact that it is at rest proves it doesn&#39;t have the necessary energy to move downwards. The acceleration of gravity obviously can&#39;t have been sufficient to force the top section downwards because neither the acceleration of gravity nor the resistance in the object changed.</p>

<p>You asked me to &quot;back up&quot; something which is so self-evident a five year old child could work it out, and then when I politely explained why it is self-evident, you insulted me and changed Newton&#39;s third law to one of your own choosing. I truly wonder why you even bother replying to me, but then again I know it&#39;s just your ego overtaking your big mouth.</p>

<p>Do you think that an office fire on the 93rd floor was responsible for the implosion of a building weighing half a million tons and dozens of videos showing liquid steel pouring out the side?</p>

<p>Your replies are absurd. You hop from one stupid claim to the next, and then finish by attacking a straw man argument. It&#39;s almost like you&#39;re following a premeditated pattern of manufacturing bullshit.</p>

<p>What the literal fuck do dragons have to do with the laws of physics? Or Mossad?</p>

<p>You are <em>again</em> asking questions which have been answered earlier in the thread, by <em>me</em>, which you are too fucking <em>lazy</em> to read. The floors would slide off to the path of least resistance. They would not crush the path of greatest resistance down to street level.</p>
