       I was addicted to heroin for about five years and grew up with a mom who was addicted to it. I have known and see probably about twenty people die who were addicted to heroin. In my experience people who are use heroin don't kill themselves with a gun if they want to die, they overdose on heroin. The only way a heroin addict would shoot himself is if he didn't have enough money to overdose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tldr: Heroin addicts don't shoot themselves, they OD.

       from what I understand, he had over 3 times the lethal dose of heroin in his system, something like 675 mgs, and couldn't have functioned enough to shoot himself, let alone place all the works neatly back in the box.

       LD50 for mice. Of course it's unethical to test it in humans, but I'm sure postmortems of OD victims have established a reasonable average upper limit.

       Now, I don't have the time to read the whole thing right now, but were they injected or was it oral?  And what was the state of those injected?  Could they put away their kit in a neat manner and then aim a shotgun, right side up  (which it would to be since the shell ejected to his left), and have it spin 180 degrees to be upside down?  Cobain had a death grip on the barrel with his left hand.  His dominant hand.  One would think that he would use his dominant hand to fire and hold with his non dominant.  Just too much going on at the crime scene.  Check out "Soaked in Bleach".  It's on Netflix right now.

       Intravascular, as I said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would you ask me a question about a study you won't read? It has an abstract.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have no real indication of Cobain's tolerance level, and thus we have no indicator with regards to whether or not he was able to place items in a box and use a gun to commit suicide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why assume anything about the landing point of a shell casing?
      </p>
      <p>
       Wouldn't proper aim involve more coordination than pulling a trigger? Lefties are often trained (or grow accustomed) to do many things as a righty.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had a lot of issues with dramatic license taken in "Soaked with Bleach". Reminded me of a an episode of Hard Copy made in iMovie.

       The thing about narcotics is that you can build up a tolerance. I've heard stories of people deep into it who shoot as much as 1000 mgs. But that's over the course of a whole day. So 675 mgs all in one go still sounds like a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       It does seem kind of doubtful that Cobain would have been in any condition to put his stuff back in the box. I mean, why bother putting it away if you're planning on killing yourself?

       That's still massively lethal for someone with a strong tolerance.

      <p>
       The documentary about Kurt's death, "Soaked In Bleach", is great. It basically lays out all the evidence of everything going on at the time and all but proves that Courtney Love had him killed (or was at least complicit). He was definitely murdered.

       No, it isn't. There is no static medical definition of a "lethal dose" of heroin. Physiological tolerance can scale astronomically with regular use.

       In the latest documentary she and him come of as happily together. They joke around all the time and are open about their flaws. I don't advocate paranoia, but it could just all be a cover up of course. After all, Kurt himself once sang: "Just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean they're not after you."

       So many Hollywood and music industry stars die young under suspicious circumstances. There are rumors of satanic blood sacrifices conduced by various powerful people... impossible to confirm of course. But yeah this death was extremely suspicious. Just the fact that it was a shotgun is suspicious. Courtney Love is suspicious. Who the fuck knows what happened, we never will for sure.

       There are some really suspicious cases. Blood sacrifices are quite ancient and come from some ancient jewish rituals. The  Bible is full of those :

       To me, Stallone's son is quite the weird one. I think he was in "Daylight" and "Rocky 5". He called his son
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sage_Stallone">
        Sage Moonblood Stallone. Yep, his real name
       </a>
       . Sage and menstrual blood are both ingredients used in the occult. Sage having the reputation of cleansing, while menstrual blood is linked to sex magick. His other kids have normal names though.

       Make no mistake, I'd be high when I did it.. But I've experienced overdose once before, and it was not as pleasant as one might think.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gun gets the job done. Leaves a mess for the next guy (I wouldn't be able to resist being a dick one last time). And funnily enough, it seems slightly more... I realize saying 'respectable' is laughable when talking about suicide (terminal illnesses excluded obviously), but it's close to how I feel about the OD vs firearm thing. Also, it seems more instant and final - for someone at the end of their rope, why would they want to spend any more time than they had to shuffling off the mortal coil?
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, I cannot imagine ACTUALLY being in that place, but I am a tad morbid (heroin user, no doubt) and it's been a topic for discussion before.

       I've brought this theory up to some of my former friends and most agree but some are on your side. They say they would be worried they couldn't do enough dope to kill themselves. That's why I said if you had enough money. I mean you could cook up as much dope was you want then just hitting it till you fall out.

       there's not a hell of a lot you can do for ulcers. pretty much just acid blockers and an alkaline diet, and even then they may not fully heal.

       This is probably really late to the conversation but I just watched "Soaked in Bleach" and he did an interview about a year before his "suicide" and said he was cured of the stomach problems. Still probably fucked up mentally, but the stomach pain just wasn't there.

       It's possible, I worked with a guy that always showed up to work high on heroin and he always said that's how he would want to die.

       Oddly enough, it was how he died.

      <ol>
       <li>
        he was worth a huge amount which she kept if he was dead
       </li>
       <li>
        he was divorcing her
       </li>
       <li>
        he was removing her from his will
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       She was arrested on the day of his death for a drug overdose that turned out to be fake, following an anonymous tip-off from a hotel room that turned out to be hers, after making a false report to police a few days earlier pretending to be his mother that he was suicidal. That's just one collection of facts - these aren't disputed, they happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       His 'suicide note' for the majority does not seem to be a suicide note - it is written to his imaginary friend Boddah, telling him about why he is leaving music and unhappy in small writing, signs off. Then there are 4 lines that appear afterwards in large writing and the subject abruptly changes to being to Courtney and Frances and hinting he is about to kill himself and saying he loves Courtney so much. It doesn't make a lot of sense. Courtney's own attorney said Courtney accidentally left behind a notebook with pages and pages of her practising his handwriting just before he was found dead. Interestingly he was also found with
       <em>
        another
       </em>
       note written in his wallet saying that his marriage is a joke and he hates her. She
       <em>
        genuinely
       </em>
       claims (look this up) that she herself forged this note saying that he hates her, and put it in his wallet ... which is clearly not true but... the two alternatives here are 
1. he loved her, wrote a very odd suicide note and she forged a note from him saying he hated her (which makes little sense, but is her version of events) 
2. he hated her, wrote a note to himself saying he hated her (which doesn't seem forged) a note about him leaving music was forged with additional lines to make it into a suicide note (the 'conspiracy theory' view)
      </p>
      <p>
       either way, she is forging notes and lying about him - it's just a question of which of those you believe seems the more plausible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interestingly, her  personal private detective
       <em>
        she
       </em>
       hired (Tom Grant) at the time,
       <em>
        her
       </em>
       legal Attorney at the time(Rosemary Carroll), her own father, a LOT of people who knew them at the time, think she was guilty.
      </p>
      <p>
       The investigation was cut off by the Seattle police department and it was slated in the music press as conspiracy theory. It doesn't look like that.

       much easier explanation is that your wife that stands to lose an extraordinary amount of money, that threatens to have people killed a lot, whose enemies do die in suspicious circumstances, who kept telling people / hinting that you were suicidal and about to die/dead had you whacked.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a lot of pieces of evidence that he was not alone when he died, that his credit card was taken and used after his death, that lots of things in the room didn't make sense for him to be alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a lot to suggest she was trying hard to imply he was suicidal and that she knew he was dead before anyone knew he was dead. She faked reports, faked her own arrest, and hired the electricity company that 'found him' 2 days after his death when nobody else, by installing an alarm in the exact location his body was found.

       The motivation for Courtney was lots of money and unless she acted  independently then by definition it would be a conspiracy. You make it look like a suicide so that there is not an investigation. Events surrounding the government do not have a monopoly of conspiracy theories. Are you enlightened?

       She actually did have huge amount of connections - including in the Seattle police office investigating his death. She was and remains very influential. Extremely talented at making and connecting with influential people and manipulating. This comes up time and time again. Also how scared people were of her.

       Jim Morrison screams at the audience "You are all a bunch of fucking slaves"..dead in a bathtub in Masonic controlled France. Maybe Jim Morrison came back, maybe he is me, just maybe.

       The black knight could possibly be satan. As satan is described as the prince of the power of the air in the bible. God is love and gave his son to pay for our nasty sins. That is a lot of love. Satan is the opposite and wants to kill, steal, and destroy. He is the fallen cherub. A lot of folks blame God when bad things happen. Well satans greatest trick is to keep people dumb of his existence. Don't let the movies and the weird religious stuff keep you away from learning about Jesus. The savior of mankind, the new adam. As sin entered through the first man adam, redemption came through the new adam, Jesus the Christ, son of God Himself. But the enemy blinds people as described in the bible too. The devil wants people to ignore jesus. Through faith in Him are sins are cleansed and a transformation is started/achieved. We then become children of God. I was recently baptized and have experienced this transformation process. Its been difficult but also awesome. My old sin desires I now hate and I now want to help others, think less about myself and want to live a righteous life. Its interesting to me because hardly anyone talks about the transformation process of Christianity. Most people see it as a ritualistic, rule abiding, boring life. I'm actually a different person now and can do spiritual warfare, have the armor of God on. Its much more spiritual then people realize. Anyway, I'm not trying to convert anyone but look into reading the gospel of John. The Word of God. It has power in its writing.

       Jesus is my brother not my father, Jesus is not a deity to me we are deity. A true spiritual warrior would know, not believe or have faith, but unequivocally KNOW that they are an eternal being that has come from God. The creator and I are one, the father and I are one in the same being I am created but of the creator so we are one, we share everything. I see butterflies every single day after my awakening but I do not believe at all that Jesus is coming to save me but that I must be a part of the flat earth awakening in a much larger way than I have been doing. We must save ourselves what spiritual warrior waits for the cavalry, I  know if it is needed it may come but I must be in the battlefield. I have experienced the godhead as in I became god in a merging where I saw hundreds of thousands of human lives take place from a 1st person perspective as if I had lived them. I was an atheist before this experience. I know God very well now. We share a lot of moments together daily. I know Jesus very well but I don't worship him, when I first read of this guy I was very unimpressed when I was in 2nd grade onwards I was raised in private Christian schools. I learned about the Jews and the Jesuits and Rome. The Jesus I know said fuck you to governments, money changers and against people generally treating people like shit am taxed. We are of God and made out of the same substance. John 10:34 and Psalms 82:6 say the same thing Jesus wasn't the only begotten son so are you. Brother Jesus not God Jesus I will not worship any man. You worship the created I worship the creator.

       I don't understand your diatribe. There's a bible verse that says that the only way to the father through the son. Sounds like maybe you have a misunderstanding of scripture. We're not god. Have you had psychedelic experiences and that's whats promulgating your worldview/spiritual insight? I'd be careful with taking visions, hallucinations as gospel. I've had a demonic attack once after sharing the gospel on a suicidal website and people were typing in weird languages, I think some people got saved but a couple weeks afterwards a dark spirit grabbed and pushed me against the wall, I couldn't move nor talk, I tried to cry out to my parents, then I said in my conscious "jesus help me" and immediately the being left me : ). The demons fear his name. Its not religious hyperbole.

       Not saying your not genuine but we are not 'gods' according to scripture, we are children of God through faith in his son Jesus. Jesus does call us brothers and friends though if we love and follow him. I appreciate the response and candor : ). We can now call God our abba father because of Christ. Look into the book of John for what im getting at. Personally id make a pretty terrible "god" luls nor would I want the responsibility.

       Check out shatterthedarkness.net russ dizdar's ministry. He deals with spiritual warfare, demoniacs, military mpd, satanic cults etc most importantly with a good discipleship series id reccommend. He understands whats occurring on a spiritual level currently that I haven't seen from any other pastor and the love of God really comes through. God is love, and his commands are to love Him with all you are and to love others as yourself : ) its not a burdensome command. I just feel bad that so many people have misconstrued views of God because of the failures of men.

       No, it isn't. There is no static medical definition of a "lethal dose" of heroin. Physiological tolerance can scale astronomically with regular use.
