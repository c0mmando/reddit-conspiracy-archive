        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m sure many of you believe, as I do, that Lee Harvey Oswald could not have been the only person involved in the assassination of JFK. Today I had the pleasure of taking a drive by the grassy knoll where JFK was assassinated. I was able to see both the building where Oswald &quot;supposedly&quot; took his shot and the exact spot where JFK got hit. If any of you get the chance to see this area, you will definitely believe that Oswald could not have acted alone. The angles of the positions are very odd if Oswald was a lone shooter. My beliefs have strengthened after being able to see this area. 
Just wanted to share this experience with you all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is an interesting experience to stand in Dealey Plaza and stand at the (alleged) positions of various (alleged) shooters. My first thought was that the Dal-Tex building was the book depository because it make a straight shot. Realizing I was wrong I went into the museum and took a gander out of the snipers nest (you can&#39;t get that close because it&#39;s sectioned off). The spot puts a right handed shooter against some pipes in an awkward position firing somewhat parallel to the street (we can argue the actual blockage by the tree some other time). The timing and angle of the car, building, street, target, all make it a somewhat difficult shot. The Dal-Tex on the other hand is a straight view and shot through the back of JFK&#39;s head. My impression of the shot from the grassy knoll is that I could have taken JFK&#39;s head off with a good sized rock. You could make the shot all day. We can speculate endlessly on the number of shooters and their positions. Though I will convince no one, I think an honest appraisal of available documentation will lead to the conclusion that their was a conspiracy to assassination JFK.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people see the video and claim that his head movement indicates the motion of the bullet. The whole &#39;back and to the left&#39; thing. </p>

<p>The problem with that is that this isn&#39;t Hollywood. Bullets don&#39;t cause body parts to fly about, especially bullets that exit the body - which aren&#39;t expending all of their energy into the person. In fact, his head jolts noticeably <em>after</em> the bullet has already passed through, rather than during.</p>
