       It's been my suspicion it was somehow concocted to make those that believed Kennedy was not killed by Oswald seem crazy, but I have literally nothing to back this up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I'm specifically interested in when and where the doubts first garnered public attention, whether it be in a newspaper, periodical, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 2: Thank you r/conspiracy for your dedication to challenging beliefs. This is a topic I previously hadn't seen worth exploring.

       There were people doubting the moon landings from day one. The Apollo program was over budget and behind schedule and even the insiders believed they couldn't pull it off technologically. They couldn't even land the lander under test conditions on earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       But they pulled off four moon landings with nary a hitch.

       I don't remember ever seeing any mention of any doubters in the mainstream media ever, until the 2000s when shows like Mythbusters started pretending to "debunk" things.

       <p>
        The first book about the subject, We Never Went to the Moon: America's Thirty Billion Dollar Swindle,[8] was written in 1974,[9] two years after the Apollo Moon flights had ended, and self-published in 1976, by Bill Kaysing (1922–2005), a senior technical writer hired in 1956 by Rocketdyne, the company which built the F-1 engines used on the Saturn V rocket,[10][11] despite having no knowledge of rockets or technical writing.[12] He served as head of the technical publications unit at the company's Propulsion Field Laboratory until 1963. Kaysing's book made many allegations, and effectively began discussion of the Moon landings being faked.[13][14] The book claims that the chance of a successful manned landing on the Moon was calculated to be 0.0017%, and that despite close monitoring by the USSR, it would have been easier for NASA to fake the Moon landings than to really go there.[15][16]
       </p>
       <p>
        The Flat Earth Society was one of the first organizations to take up the cause and accuse NASA of faking the landings, arguing that they were staged by Hollywood with Walt Disney sponsorship, based on a script by Arthur C. Clarke and directed by Stanley Kubrick.[Note 1][17] Folklorist Linda Dégh suggests that writer-director Peter Hyams' 1978 film Capricorn One, which shows a hoaxed journey to Mars in a spacecraft that looks identical to the Apollo craft, may have given a boost to the hoax theory's popularity in the post-Vietnam War era. She notes that this happened during the post-Watergate era, when American citizens were inclined to distrust official accounts. Dégh writes: "The mass media catapult these half-truths into a kind of twilight zone where people can make their guesses sound as truths. Mass media have a terrible impact on people who lack guidance."[18] In A Man on the Moon,[19] first published in 1994, Andrew Chaikin mentions that at the time of Apollo 8's lunar-orbit mission in December 1968, similar conspiracy ideas were already in circulation.[20]

       Thank you very much! I find it interesting Kaysing no longer worked for Rocketdyne in 1969.

       And the Flat Earth Society? Could it get any easier to dismiss?

       If there's other early writing anyone knows of please do post it, but this seems to support my suspicion the hoax theory is of highly dubious origin.

       In reality - keep in mind NASA "lost" all of their original telemetry data and all of the original broadcasts.  Provably fake - take a look at Dave McGowan's writing on the subject, "wagging the moon doggie" - you should be able to find it on Google.

       We will know soon enough... wasn't there a student project to send a drone to the moon to take pics? I remember reading about it on here not too long ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       sure it was two russian students so who knows if the data can be trusted, but seriously, making a drone and send it there with a camera isn't that expensive anymore ... we can find out whether the moon landing was a hoax or not pretty easily.

       China sent a rover to take pictures within the last year, but the moon is huge and it's not like a rover could scour every inch for the touchdown. Unless NASA decided to do another, for some that would put it to rest.

       For me it originates with the knowledge that we could not, in the 1960's, get through the Van Allen radiation belts and  it continues because we still can't.

       Can electronics onboard a shuttle get through the belts?

       Ok, this is interesting. I'm not familiar with the belts, and a cursory google search brings up a Popular Science [brother to the ONLY 9/11 liars] article saying Apollo rocketed through it.

       Fuck, just when I was ready to dismiss it you've legitimately got me thinking.

       a lot of it started when people started seeing odditys in the pictures that the astronauts took.  things like no apparent dust or material not being moved during the landing.(there would have been some sort of dust crater).. and tons of other stuff. i have always felt they went.  but there may have been some back up shots and pre recorded studio stufff to broadcast in an emergency.     they didnt know what they were going to find so they faked a bunch of stuff and eventually it all got released over time.

       The dust moving would be more pronounced in Earth's atmosphere than on the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: After further consideration the dust should have been more affected on the moon. Lower gravity would mean less energy is needed to displace particles (at least from what I remember from physics).

       The moon landing was fake (IMHO). Cold war propaganda. Satellites exist, but human space travel isn't possible with our current technology. However, I do think we (humans) once, had the technology to do it.
