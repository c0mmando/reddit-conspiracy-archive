<p>I don&#39;t remember ever seeing any mention of any doubters in the mainstream media ever, until the 2000s when shows like Mythbusters started pretending to &quot;debunk&quot; things.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The first book about the subject, We Never Went to the Moon: America&#39;s Thirty Billion Dollar Swindle,[8] was written in 1974,[9] two years after the Apollo Moon flights had ended, and self-published in 1976, by Bill Kaysing (1922â€“2005), a senior technical writer hired in 1956 by Rocketdyne, the company which built the F-1 engines used on the Saturn V rocket,[10][11] despite having no knowledge of rockets or technical writing.[12] He served as head of the technical publications unit at the company&#39;s Propulsion Field Laboratory until 1963. Kaysing&#39;s book made many allegations, and effectively began discussion of the Moon landings being faked.[13][14] The book claims that the chance of a successful manned landing on the Moon was calculated to be 0.0017%, and that despite close monitoring by the USSR, it would have been easier for NASA to fake the Moon landings than to really go there.[15][16]</p>

<p>The Flat Earth Society was one of the first organizations to take up the cause and accuse NASA of faking the landings, arguing that they were staged by Hollywood with Walt Disney sponsorship, based on a script by Arthur C. Clarke and directed by Stanley Kubrick.[Note 1][17] Folklorist Linda DÃ©gh suggests that writer-director Peter Hyams&#39; 1978 film Capricorn One, which shows a hoaxed journey to Mars in a spacecraft that looks identical to the Apollo craft, may have given a boost to the hoax theory&#39;s popularity in the post-Vietnam War era. She notes that this happened during the post-Watergate era, when American citizens were inclined to distrust official accounts. DÃ©gh writes: &quot;The mass media catapult these half-truths into a kind of twilight zone where people can make their guesses sound as truths. Mass media have a terrible impact on people who lack guidance.&quot;[18] In A Man on the Moon,[19] first published in 1994, Andrew Chaikin mentions that at the time of Apollo 8&#39;s lunar-orbit mission in December 1968, similar conspiracy ideas were already in circulation.[20]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you very much! I find it interesting Kaysing no longer worked for Rocketdyne in 1969.</p>

<p>And the Flat Earth Society? Could it get any easier to dismiss?</p>

<p>If there&#39;s other early writing anyone knows of please do post it, but this seems to support my suspicion the hoax theory is of highly dubious origin.</p>
