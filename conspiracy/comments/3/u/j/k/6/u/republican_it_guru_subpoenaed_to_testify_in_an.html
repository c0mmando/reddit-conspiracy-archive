<p>Stephen Spoonamore who was mentioned in that news article was featured on an ABC interview on election fraud which never aired. He has worked for the Secret Service, Pentagon, FBI, and major banks detecting credit card fraud. He flat out states DIEBOLD is stealing elections. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BX6vcoIZdA4">You can watch that interview here.</a></p>

<p>Or Paul Wellstone, easily as far from the center establishment as Sanders crashed 11 days before election day in a race that was important to Democrats retaining control of the Senate.</p>

<p>Or Ted Kennedy who barely survived a plane crash.</p>

<p>Or John F. Kennedy Jr. who presumably crashed over the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Or John Heinz a Senator and previous husband of John Kerry&#39;s wife.</p>

<p>Or Ron Brown Secretary of Commerce who was allegedly soon to give evidence against figures in the department.</p>

<p>Os Mel Carnahan who died in a plane crash but still subsequently beat the incumbent John Ashcroft for a Senate seat (they just found another use for <del>Asscrack</del> Ashcroft).</p>

<p>There are many more.  these are mostly the mor suspicious ones.  The good thing abut small plane crashes is that they&#39;re fairly common and impact tends to destroy all the evidence.</p>

<p>Exposing this further is unquestionably in order.  Thanks for glossing over the relevant pieces, while attacking the messenger.  Your attempts here have been duly noted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How about another take on this.</p>

<p>Connell tried to squash the subpoenas he did not want to testify the article says so. he was Loyal to the Bush Family.</p>

<p>So with a friend testifying of 2 previous attempts at flying but cancelled because of suspicious problem with plane he actually goes through with a third?</p>

<p>My take is this guy is alive and well and someone else was in that plane. Medical and forensic ID records on Connell were switched out with this guy so they IDed him as Connell. Plane was flown by remote.</p>
