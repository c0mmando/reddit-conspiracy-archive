       There are many more.  these are mostly the mor suspicious ones.  The good thing abut small plane crashes is that they're fairly common and impact tends to destroy all the evidence.

       That in no way negates the point he's making.  Plane assassinations are the favored favor of our intelligence agencies along with certain unnamed agencies that do war through deception.

       Exposing this further is unquestionably in order.  Thanks for glossing over the relevant pieces, while attacking the messenger.  Your attempts here have been duly noted.

       How about another take on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Connell tried to squash the subpoenas he did not want to testify the article says so. he was Loyal to the Bush Family.
      </p>
      <p>
       So with a friend testifying of 2 previous attempts at flying but cancelled because of suspicious problem with plane he actually goes through with a third?
      </p>
      <p>
       My take is this guy is alive and well and someone else was in that plane. Medical and forensic ID records on Connell were switched out with this guy so they IDed him as Connell. Plane was flown by remote.
