<p>The comment I replied to was originally the top comment, but minutes later was hidden by a post by +30 upvotes. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3u2qlw/nato_calls_extraordinary_meeting_after_turkey/cxbjtwp">This comment I made in reply</a> to the comment I am mentioning above has gone from 4 upvotes straight to 0, up to 3, back to 0, up to 4, down to 2, up to 6, down to 3, back to 0, and this cycle keeps continuing. Look at some of the other comments in the section when you do this, their points don&#39;t fluctuate like this. </p>

<p>I want to be clear, I don&#39;t care about internet points, but it really is interesting how vote manipulation is so common. Why do they even allow controversial news to surface on there if they don&#39;t want the uncomfortable truths to be mentioned along with them?</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty childish how often everyone on here is ravenously looking for an angle to jab at someone. What if I was able to just delete this comment you&#39;d made here trying to be self righteous? You wouldn&#39;t like that, and you can&#39;t begin to tell me you can. </p>

<p>You&#39;re gonna down vote this, and you&#39;re gonna say &quot;well your opinion wasn&#39;t deleted so fuck yourself&quot; and I&#39;ve already clarified that several times here, this will be the final time I do this. I didn&#39;t know about vote fuzzing. This is a dead thread and the fact that you ignored the bolded disclaimer on my post and still tried to drop the same two cents in shows the level of awareness you possess. </p>
