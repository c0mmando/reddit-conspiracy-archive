       The comment I replied to was originally the top comment, but minutes later was hidden by a post by +30 upvotes.
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3u2qlw/nato_calls_extraordinary_meeting_after_turkey/cxbjtwp">
        This comment I made in reply
       </a>
       to the comment I am mentioning above has gone from 4 upvotes straight to 0, up to 3, back to 0, up to 4, down to 2, up to 6, down to 3, back to 0, and this cycle keeps continuing. Look at some of the other comments in the section when you do this, their points don't fluctuate like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to be clear, I don't care about internet points, but it really is interesting how vote manipulation is so common. Why do they even allow controversial news to surface on there if they don't want the uncomfortable truths to be mentioned along with them?

       Are you kidding me? I'm not allowed to not want my opinion potentially (to clerify again, it hasn't been as I discovered) oppressed? Why are you looking for an angle to demean my opinion?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's pretty childish how often everyone on here is ravenously looking for an angle to jab at someone. What if I was able to just delete this comment you'd made here trying to be self righteous? You wouldn't like that, and you can't begin to tell me you can.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're gonna down vote this, and you're gonna say "well your opinion wasn't deleted so fuck yourself" and I've already clarified that several times here, this will be the final time I do this. I didn't know about vote fuzzing. This is a dead thread and the fact that you ignored the bolded disclaimer on my post and still tried to drop the same two cents in shows the level of awareness you possess.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can downvote my entire post history, I've already been brigaded today and you don't see me bitching about it, they're website points.

        That'd make a lot of sense, it could just be the fuzzing then, and if it continues too much longer, I'll definitely delete this post. I didn't initially post to bring attention to my post, or to create controversy not present, it was just something curious.

       I think they've also loosened the vote fuzzing, it used to be a point or two but now it's like 4 points. My comments are fluctuating wildly with every refresh too.

       That'd make a lot of sense, it could just be the fuzzing then, and if it continues too much longer, I'll definitely delete this post. I didn't initially post to bring attention to my post, or to create controversy not present, it was just something curious.

       I'd rather be wrong about this one than to find out that vote manipulation spreads all the way down into little comments like mine.

       I'm as into conspiracies as he next guy, but you sound a little paranoid.  Reddit has a huge user base and
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       is a popular sub, so it's not unthinkable that your upvotes will fluctuate rapidly.  Not everything is a conspiracy

       Also, just a friendly FYI, this post is going to get brigades soon because

       I'm not really into conspiracies, this is just a slightly more open minded area for information. I posted here because I wanted a second opinion from someone who might know better than me on reddit voting, and as people pointed out, it's just fuzzing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah that's pretty weird, I wonder why the mods felt it was a good fit? This can't honestly be the first time someone didn't know what fuzzing was. Thanks for the heads up, I'll leave it up though cause fuck that guy.
      </p>

       I just noticed that you created this account just now, just to inform me of this. You're either a really nice guy, or you could be the one who posted it!

       Please stop with the paranoia.  You do know that at a certain point, accounts are new, right?  I created the account a few days ago so I could post in this sub but there is a three day moratorium on posting in here for new accounts.

       Haha you really like to pull the paranoia card huh? Like I'm just on my laptop hiding in my closet in the dark somewhere underground. If someone came across your post and coincidentally they also happen to link it to you as their first ever comment, you'd wonder too.
      </p>

       I didn't call you a shill, I said you could be a good guy or the one who posted it, if you think that's paranoia then your a completely irrational thinker.

       Chill out dude, it seems like you're in some sort of cognitive distress.  Just take a few deep breaths and relax.  Not everything is a conspiracy and posts like this really don't contribute much to this sub.  Be the bigger person and ignore that shit.  After all, in your own words you don't care about points...your reactions clearly show that you do...

       I mean at the very least you're dedicated. You're stubborn in the admirable way that a donkey is stubborn about trekking up a mountain, it's sort of endearing. It's almost like you're convinced that demeaning me will in any way sway my opinion.

       No one is gonna see this little conversation we are having, set your ego aside.  You're really dancing in circles with yourself here, so this can just be the end of the discussion if you're just gonna keep tossing rephrased "u mad bro?" nonsense at me.
