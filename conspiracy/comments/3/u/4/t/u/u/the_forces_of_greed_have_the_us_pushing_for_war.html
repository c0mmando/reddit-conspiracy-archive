<p><strong><em>WE THE PEOPLE</em></strong> need a push for the prosecution of the criminals (the bankers, politicians, and MIC) who funded the current threat they created and the threat to the world.  </p>

<p><strong><em>Enough is enough.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>A show of force is necessary.  On all fronts.  Not with violence, but with the weapons they use.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ink, paper, and our right to peaceably assemble.</strong> </p>

<p>Not only in front of elected officials, but in front of those companies, bankers, and in front of all MSM outlets themselves. </p>

<p>The papers and TV stations.   </p>

<p>Let the MSM know they are just as guilty for spreading the lies and propaganda and are no longer credible or relevant.   </p>

<p><strong><em>Enough is enough.</em></strong>  </p>

<p>Demonstrate.  Record it.  Post it everywhere.  The MSM won&#39;t do their job, so it&#39;s up to us.    </p>

<p>Show the world the CITIZENS of the US are not behind the psychopathic elected officials and want them out as much as every one else.</p>

<p>Let the bankers know if there is another &quot;terrorist attack&quot;, they will be held responsible and the death penalty is an acceptable punishment for first degree murder in the eyes of the people.  The war they want will be against them.</p>

<p><strong><em>Enough is enough.</em></strong></p>

<p>If we follow them blindly, we are no better than the German population that did the same following the Nazi&#39;s.  And we will suffer the same fate.  Except with the nuclear option.  </p>

<p>If the people do not make their voices heard, we will be just as guilty as those sick fucks trying to lead us into this.</p>

<p>When we start to lose a conventional war (and we will), what do you think our next step is?</p>

<p>The war necessary is a war without weapons, and a war for peace.  Not for empire and bankers who need to make an extra buck.  For everyone else on this planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Such were the words of JFK and he had the power to do so...and his death, in broad daylight in the streets of a major city goes unpunished. More, people mostly can&#39;t even get to the point of punishment because we get stuck at &quot;magic bullets&quot; that are found magically in perfect shape on gurneys that were next to the ones used.</p>

<p>MLK taught that but he played ball, and when he didn&#39;t, he was shot.</p>

<p>And we are just some folks on the internet and each of our voices contend with 50 bots and if we can be heard over them, the website itself shuts us out and if that isn&#39;t enough, the site is shut down.</p>

<p>And we start to make headway and bang bang shots fired by those misfits (even though those misfits have badges beneath their street clothes) and people get scared, the morale high ground is lost.</p>

<p>And if people go beyond...</p>

<p>But it doesn&#39;t and people are not just scared to get in trouble, they are scared that all those they are trying to protect from a government preying on them will be those that denounce them the loudest.</p>

<p>Enough is enough. The only way out is technological advancement that renders current forms of hierarchy pointless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Change where we direct our resources and technology.</p>

<p>The guys working to provide cheap housing solutions, that have low operating costs are given nothing.</p>

<p>Mike Reynolds started developing the Earthship in the 70s. I didn&#39;t see academia or government helping him. In fact, the government put obstacles in his way. </p>

<p>An Earthship uses few inputs and takes care of all the inhabitants needs. Where is the support to develop them? As of now, they are decent, but if researchers, funding, regulation catered to them, they would develop to the point of taking people beyond their current standard of living, everywhere. All the basic requirements of life would be enjoyable at no expected cost because the solution to the needs have been built into the house with the intention of lasting, not generating GDP.</p>

<p>Eliminate make work projects. So much of our labour is just to preserve the status quo, little is productive or innovative. What&#39;s the point of acting like we are capitalists when we are corporate fascists?</p>

<p>If the government has no interest in removing the basic needs of humanity, then individuals need to advance the technology to do so. </p>

<p>If we are working towards the individual&#39;s advancement, rather than social advancement, then each improvement advances the lives of all.</p>

<p>A Thai architect developed a method of providing 7-8 C of cooling using rainwater and a drip dispersed by a fan. This brought down the operating costs of air-conditioning, the heat exhaust which forces cooling requirements up, and the energy costs which makes the residents less dependent on society.</p>

<p>But it doesn&#39;t get pursued because less cost means less profit to someone, less struggle for the home owner which causes people to be more demanding when you try to take something such as tax from them.</p>

<p>For the government, problems are their livelihood. We should only expect that they will generate more. We can&#39;t honestly expect them to tackle issues and end them for good. It&#39;s on us as individuals to gear our work to each individual so that the tools and methods are available for people to tackle them on their own or within their community.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree! Obsolete the old paradigms through constructive use of technology.</p>

<p>Wiki government? A Transparent auxiliary  mechanism of taxation and revenue allocation.</p>

<p>Decentralized democracy? The Bitcoin of government?</p>

<p>The eventual outlaw of forprofit housing, a wealth cap? A contributionalism based incentive system? The eradication of money! The cessation of amoral wealth hoarding! Global transparent resource pools.</p>

<p>So many things to build and make accessible.</p>

<p>The problems we face have a solution, and I believe that a better mousetrap is the solution.</p>

<p>Change the world through constructive action instead of destructive action.</p>

<p>Channel our dissatisfaction of the way things are into motivation towards making things the way they can be. Let those the game the system fall into irrelevance, and be forced to adapt to the newer, effective ways of humanity tending to itself. We are only as limited as our lack of solutions currently are.</p>
