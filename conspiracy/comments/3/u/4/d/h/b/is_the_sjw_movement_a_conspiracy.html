       No one can willfully be this stupid and yet there are large groups of college students coming under this form of group think, which basically amounts to disguised racism and a push for segregation. Using buzz words like "cultural appropriation" "offensive" "oppressive" etc. Does anyone think this is just a clever way to divide people as a means to keep them controlled. As a distraction to more important issues, or are there really that many moronic college students who's lives are so banal that they need to invent a cause because they're bored?

       It's a strategy called "Divide and Rule". You find the most extreme radicals in every ideology (Black Lives Matter, Gender bullshit, White Supermacists, etc) and you give them money and air time. Create racial fault lines in society and everyone's too busy talking about "Diversity" and "Equality" to focus on the real issues: Money and War. "Multiculturalism" is being used as a weapon to undermine our society and Barbarra Lerner Spectre has admitted to that:

       Memes aside, that's what I've been thinking for a few months now. COINTELPRO is pushing the SJW movement not only to divide and rule, but also to push pro-censorship / anti-free speech agenda. It's actually very obvious that the likes of Aneta Sarkeesian are being influenced by third-parties, and they, in turn, influence the gullible, dumbed-down, insecure teenagers.

       Its the same thing with 'racism', and the two-party system, and all kinds of stuff.  A long time ago, the elites caught on that people tend to think in binary fashion...'us' vs. 'them'....it works for pro sports, it works for keeping people in line too.
      </p>
      <p>
       The interesting thing about racism is the etymology of the word, there wasn't even a word for it before 1900.  I mean, sure people from different groups didn't get along, but 'racial oppression', as a concept, was invented by the bolsheviks to demonize their german enemies during the Great Wars of the 20th century.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will probably immediately recoil from this assertion, as the programming runs that deep, but its true, racism is an entirely false concept.  The genius of it is that it closely aligns with an actual phenomenon in nature where life forms tend to be territorial towards other groups, where the 'out groups' are hated and feared as a function of biology; to protect the group from rivals and disease.  It is entirely normal for different groups of people to be suspicious and hostile towards each other, but more often than not, the different groups were identical in appearance rather than the hostilities being generated by the race of the 'other'.  In nature, when a light-colored dog attacks a dark-colored dog, is it 'racism'?
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the concept of 'racism' was created, it began having real-world effects, sort of like how the creation of the legend of the 'tooth fairy' caused parents to hide money and children to place teeth beneath their pillow.  The creation of 'racism' was a stroke of evil genius.

       You can't be fucking serious.  But I guess you are.  And at least five people agree with you...
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you implying that before the word racism was invented, African-Americans had equal rights?!  That whites treated people of color with respect, as equals?!
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason there was no word for racism wasn't that people weren't racists - the literature of the time makes it clear - but because the people who were writing the literature saw nothing wrong with treating people of color badly.

       I never said people weren't treated badly, maybe even because they were different nationalities, but it wasn't until the 20th century that 'racism' became a 'thing'.  It's pretty obvious to those of us who aren't bedazzled by sociological buzzwords that there is a lot of ugliness in the world, but no one ever says 'hey, look at that guy's skin, I hate him!'.  I mean, it's ridiculous.  And you can go ahead and believe it if you want, but I am not going to fall for the lie that is 'racism'.  Matter of fact, I am willing to bet that 90% of EVERYTHING associated with 'racism' is entirely manufactured, and just because you read it somewhere or someone told it to you, you believe it.  That's fine, but I choose not to.

       Though I agree to a certain extent, I hope you can concede that the same exact thing happens on the other side of the ideological spectrum, as far as xenophobia, Tea Party antics, etc-- the legitimacy of classic conservativism is being drowned out by the voices of the most insane modern commentators.

       Take, for instance, Ahmed, the kid with the clock. The media showed us images, videos, soundbites of people with that skin tone with weapons, dressed differently, being violent.
Then, a kid of that skin tone shows up to school with what looks sort of similar to the images we've seen.
Then everyone shames each other via media for connecting the two. 
Then we second-guess our own minds for making this correlation on any level of our psyche.
But it's hard to stop consuming that media that fed you visual lies for so many years. After all, you don't want to be excluded from "the know."
So, we create this circle and get stuck.

       Hard to say.  It's a lot like the "Tea Party" movement, or the "Occupy" movement, in that in it's origins, it stems from quite legitimate, and understandable lists of issues.  However these social movements that actually show promise to make a noticeable change in the world usually pick up a little bit of steam before being hijacked by insane people who try to thrust their own insane issues into the spotlight.  The loudest members of any group will always come to represent the group as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
       So with the teaparty,
begins with "the current tax system is broken"
and becomes "Lets get rid of all the mexicans!"
      </p>
      <p>
       The Occupy movement
begins with "corporate greed is ruining this country"
and ends with a lady named "Ketchup" representing the group, in "vaginal solidarity" on the Colbert report.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Social Justice movement
begins with "Some groups in this nation face clear, and objective disadvantages, and we should work towards equality."
and becomes
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/">
        Tumblr in Action
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure some level of this probably comes from controlled opposition, but a large portion of it could just be crazy people who want a bit of the spotlight.

       Like many ideological movements, I'm pretty sure it's just a misdirected pileup. This is coming from someone who studied "social justice" for her Master's degree. I now shudder and cringe at the contemporary association.
      </p>
      <p>
       Justice is important. Anti-oppression is important. The social justice movement as it stands is a big sobbing pile of shit that undermines both of those concepts. But I really do think that, rather than some purposefully directed agenda, this is just a bunch of over-enthusiastic young people running forward with broader concepts they don't quite understand. In any ideology, lack of nuance results in ridiculous levels of generalization.

       For deeper intellectual roots, there was, among other groups in the Euro avant garde of the 60s the CIA links to the Frankfurt School.  The far right are starting to talk about "cultural Marxism" but they have the wrong end of the stick (of course).  It was a long term movement to create a divided and anti-majoritarian Left.

       You hit the nail on the head. The worst part about this whole SJW movement is the manipulation of these useful idiots emotions in order to shut down discussions they don't agree with. "Feelz before realz" in other words. It's getting bad now and the fact that our educational institutions are actively promoting this type of behavior doesn't help.

       Yes.  Even it didn't start out as one of the tentacles of "Hydra", they'd come take it over eventually anyway.  Anything that is prominent in the media is prominent on purpose, and is done in an organized, controlled fashion.
      </p>

       Most obvious is the whole "think of the women!" fearmongering that is used to destroy any semblence of online anonymity and privacy.  I.e. look at the policies being promoted at the UN summit Anita Sarkeesian and Five Guys girl spoke at.

       The SJW movement can certainly become exploited by special interest groups, and those with a hidden agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just one small interesting example: take a look at the story of the Invisible Children organization and their Kony 2012 campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2012 all across the country thousands of high school SJW kids attended massive demonstrations, conferences  and other gatherings at events where they rallied to this cause.  Essentially behind all the 'making a difference' was a multi million dollar money-making operation.  The film was widely criticized for largely ignoring the fact that Joseph Kony was already pushed out of Uganda long before the film was made.
      </p>
      <p>
       This popular youth movement formed massive support for U.S. military involvement in Uganda.  It was known that in 2012 about 100 American Special Operations troops were helping to coordinate the hunt for Joseph Kony.  By  2014 the United States announced they would deploy at least four CV-22 Ospreys, refuelling planes, and 150 Air Force special forces personnel to assist in the capture of Kony.
      </p>
      <p>
       A useful bit of trivia:  Uganda is an oil rich nation with a supply of over 6 billion barrels of oil discovered there about a decade ago.  This is the fourth-largest oil reserves in sub-Saharan Africa.   Currently Uganda plans for construction of the longest heated crude oil pipeline the world to bring this supply to market.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another interesting bit of triva: Jason Russell the cofounder of Invisible Children and director of the film, was later hospitalized due to a temporary psychotic breakdown.

       If everything is a conspiracy then of course whatever this SJW thing is as well.  Though still less likely than South Park being part of the conspiracy.

       Related: A few years ago when I was at uni, a lot of my professors spouted out SJW-ideologies and for a while I was "brainwashed" by it. Like I would say things like "white people are the root of all the problems in the world" (lol). It was because that type of stuff was basically being taught in a lot of my classes &amp; I fell for it for a while.
