    <div class="md"><p>I posted this earlier in another thread but it fits here as well.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s assume for a moment that what the gov is saying is 100% legit (which its not btw).. It just means that no more traditional &#39;voice&#39; specific mass surveillance (under just this specific program) is now allowed against US citizens.</p>

<p>The challenge with this is that there are still dozens (if not hundreds) of additional surveillance programs in place today, and &#39;voice&#39; specific mass collection over traditional phone technologies is just one (rapidly shrinking) piece of the overall surveillance pie toolkit.</p>

<p>Rest assured that Google, Facebook, Twitter, and most all other social media companies are happily selling and/or freely sharing far more personal data about US citizens under a number of alternative surveillance projects (like MUSCULAR) and these social medial sites are a lot more effective at tracking you because you all freely give away most of your privacy to them.</p>

<p>Also, it should be noted that VOIP (voice over IP) services like Skype, Google Hangouts, and those low cost bundled phone services offered by your cable companies) are not counted as &#39;voice&#39;..  </p>

<p>VOIP technologies are the future of all voice communication but VOIP technologies fall within the classification of mass &#39; data&#39; surveillance which is still 100% allowed as of this Sunday.</p>

<p>TL;DR - assuming this were actually true voice specific surveillance is just a very small part of the mass surveillance being used against US citizens.. The bigger threat has always been data surveillance which is still very much in place and far more damaging.  Also VOIP based voice communications are not classified as &#39;voice&#39; so technically there is already a glaring hole in this that openly allows for more mass surveillance of voice communications.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok based on a couple of PM&#39;s I feel like there needs to be a bit more clarification here.</p>

<p>So yeah it is true that all voice including legacy telephone at some point is gonna switch to digital along its circuit path..  This technically means that ALL voice becomes VOIP at some point.   The way understand this is that the wire tap / mass surveillance being discontinued is the very specific surveillance that takes place at the phone (end-user side) not at the switch and data side.</p>

<p>So painting this as a line with two distinct points where there are two people (one one either side) having a conversation, it&#39;s only the technology that directly connects the user at the extreme end of both points that is no longer allowed.  (Let&#39;s call this Analog)</p>

<p>Any technology that sits in the middle of those two analog points are still very much up for grabs, and those routers fall completely under the jurisdiction of a number of mass data surveillance programs today thanks to companies like AT&amp;T brokering clandestine deals with the US government as far back as he early 1980&#39;s.</p>

<p>In addition to this, if you happen to be talking through a non-analog technology at either side of the line that is clearly a digital VOIP &#39;software&#39; driven communication tool (like Skype, Google Hangouts, etc.) you are still 100% within the data side of things and not the analog side so you fall within the scope of any data mass surveillance programs out there.</p>
