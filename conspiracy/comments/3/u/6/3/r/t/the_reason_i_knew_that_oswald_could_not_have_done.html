by Douglas Herman, 
<a href="http://www.strike-the-root.com/51/herman/herman16.html:">http://www.strike-the-root.com/51/herman/herman16.html:</a></p>

<p>A Shooter Looks At The Shot Heard ‘Round The World Recently I finished reading the definitive book (which I highly recommend) on the obviously, government-sanctioned, JFK assassination. Written from the unique perspective of a professional shooter, &quot;Kill Zone: A Sniper Looks at Dealey Plaza,&quot; not only demolishes all the arguments of lone-assassin proponents, but examines the myriad reasons why Kennedy was killed.</p>

<p>“The reason I knew that Oswald could not have done it, was because I could not have done it,” said former US Marine sniper, Craig Roberts. Credited with numerous kills while serving in Vietnam , Roberts turned an objective eye on the shot heard ‘round the world. After he visited Dealey Plaza, after viewing the so-called “sniper’s lair,” on the sixth floor of the book depository, and after staring at the large oak tree overspreading much of Elm Street, Roberts said, “I walked away from the window in disgust. I had seen all I needed to know that Oswald could not have been the lone shooter.”</p>

<p>But Roberts, a retired police investigator, wanted to know what did happen. Not content to dismiss the improbable feat, he delved into the crime from every angle.</p>

<p>“First, I analyzed the scene as a sniper . . . I looked at the engagement angles. It was entirely wrong…Here, from what I could see, three problems arose that would influence my shots. First, the target was moving away at a drastic angle to the right from the window, meaning that I would have to position my body to compete with the wall and a set of vertical water pipes . . . This would be extremely difficult for a right-handed shooter. Second, I would have to be ready to fire exactly when the target emerged past some tree branches that obscured the kill zone. Finally, I would have to deal with two factors at the same time; the curve of the street, and the high-to-low angle formula—a law of physics Oswald would not have known.”</p>

<p>Not content with his own critical appraisal, Roberts turned to another, equally knowledgeable shooter. “According to my friend, Gunnery Sergeant Carlos Hathcock, the former senior instructor for the US Marine Corps Sniper Instructor School at Quantico, Virginia, it could not be done as described by the FBI investigators.”</p>

<p>“Let me tell you what we did at Quantico,” Hathcock recalls. “We reconstructed the whole thing: the angle, the range, the moving target, the time limit, the obstacles, everything. I don’t know how many times we tried it, but we couldn’t duplicate what the Warren Commission said Oswald did. Now if I can’t do it, how in the world could a guy who was a non-qual on the rifle range and later only qualified &#39;marksman&#39; do it?”</p>

<p>Of course, sergeant Carlos Hathcock was only the most famous American military sniper in history, credited with a confirmed 93 kills. But apologists for a lone assassin, who continue to enjoy mainstream media sponsorship 40 years later, continue to argue that an average shooter like Oswald, using a decrepit, war surplus weapon, could have killed Kennedy. Case closed.&quot;</p>

<p>Not often mentioned is the problem anybody shooting would have with the rifle, which would have hit the pipe or the wall in order to be pointed correctly at the target at the positions where Kennedy was actually shot. Is this why the space is closed off so that people can;t see this problem for themselves?</p>

<p>When you understand that Lee Oswald did not kill Kennedy, you have to ask yourself who did. The author of the story above believes this:</p>

<p>I devoutly believe the same sort of people who conspired to kill Kennedy—wealthy, well-protected elites, war lovers and imperialists--also conspired to mastermind and thus profit from the events of 9-11.</p>

<p>Most of us who write for STR presently own guns, have shotguns, or received weapons training while in the US military. As a teenager, I owned shotguns and rifles, a semi-automatic .22 with 4x scope, was briefly a member of the NRA and an enthusiast at the local gun club. Later, I earned a sharpshooter ribbon with a weapon I had never shot before, the M-16, as a US Air Force trainee.</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps the greatest reason many Americans believe Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone and killed Kennedy is that a majority of Americans have never shot any guns, and certainly not a rifle with a scope. If the Warren Commission had been composed of unbiased shooters instead of senators and lawyers, the final verdict would likely have rejected the ludicrous assumption that Oswald acted alone. The “trumpeting of falsehood, however virtuous in intent,” was indeed a vicious lie, supported by the government then and now.&quot; Douglas Herman</p>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t surprise me to find out he fired the first bullet</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many people either don&#39;t know or forget the fact that Oswald was observed in the 2nd floor lunch room within 90 seconds of the assassination.  It is impossible for him to have run there from the 6th floor (after having hidden the rifle, no less) in that time following the shooting and appear anywhere near calm and collected.  But there he was, having a Coke, no gun.  It was physically impossible for Oswald to have fired any shots during the assassination.  He wasn&#39;t at the window.  The tests for gunshot residue came back negative -- he had not fired a rifle on that day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s sad how even now in documentaries about the Kennedy assassination they make repeated mention of the fact that Oswald was &quot;a Marine Corps sharpshooter,&quot; which makes him sound like some expert sniper or something.  The sharpshooter qualification is the middle score for Marines, the lowest qual is called &#39;marksman&#39; (which sounds like someone who is a good shot, but in fact it just means you can hit the broad side of a barn at 500 yards).  Oswald qualified as sharpshooter for one year of his enlistment and marksman the other 3.  He was a below average shot who we are supposed to believe fired 3 shots in something like 8 seconds from a crappy Caracano rifle at a moving target 300 yards away and hit every time.  The Warren commission tried to replicate these results but were unable to, most likely because it is humanly impossible to achieve such a feat.  I think they concluded by saying that Oswald somehow did it alone anyway, case closed.   </p>

<p>I think the last paragraph sums up why people still buy this lie, it&#39;s because most Americans have very little awareness of the physical realities of the world around them and what little awareness they do have can be erased/ subverted when they are told a scary story.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Warren Commission test including 3 expert shooters. They were using the Caracano rifle, that was the supposed murder weapon. Their test was seeing if they could get off 3 aimed shots in the official time window. One small catch here; their target was &#39;stationary&#39;, and the best any of the three could pull off was 2 hits.</p>

<p>So the official test to prove Oswald was capable of pulling off the feat, was at a stationary target, using expert shooters, and it was still a failure...</p>

<p>How much more proof do you need?</p>

<p>Note: They also mention in the report that the scope was junk, they would adjust one axis (vertical) and it would screw up the other (horizontal), and vice-versa.</p>
