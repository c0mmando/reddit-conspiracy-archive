       Casey was campaign manager of the successful presidential campaign of Ronald Reagan in 1980, and served on the transition team following the election. After Reagan took office, Reagan named Casey to the post of Director of Central Intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hours before Casey was scheduled to testify before Congress related to his knowledge of Iran–Contra affair, he was reported to have been rendered incapable of speech during an operation to remove a brain tumor. Casey died of a brain tumor in 1987 at the age of 74.

       "Seriously -- I personally was the Source for that William Casey quote.  He said it at an early Feb. 1981 meeting in the Roosevelt Room in the West Wing of the White House which I attended, and I immediately told my close friend and political godmother Senior White House Correspondent Sarah McClendon, who then went public with it without naming the source ..."

       I honestly don't know where the bottom is of the things we have been led to believe are true which are either false or semi-false. I haven't found it yet, that's for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, I operate on the principle that humanity hasn't changed that much and so our behaviour is predictable. We were knowingly sewing deceit through organised religion thousands of years ago, so it is only fair to assume we would also use politics to achieve our ends.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that humanity ultimately suffers from the same problem which holds most species back. They are ruled by the nastiest, most ruthless, who scare or deceive the others into ignorance or submission, and who very often get them killed to further their own ends.

       He was 74, it happens. He's an old man. He's sedated. Blood pressure becomes low. Pulse slows. Its not a conspiracy. Just read about their bumblings in organising and funding the contras - at one point they transferred 10 million the Sultan of Brunai donated into the wrong Swiss bank account because they got the account numbers mixed up - which was a legitimate criminal conspiracy.

       Casey was a company man all the way, he had no doubts or second thoughts. He believed in the righteousness of their actions just as much as the rest of them and would have said the exact same thing as the rest of them.

       I've recently realized that most of these big conspiracy sites are full of disinformation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never thought I would reach this point where I can say that mainstream media is a
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       reliable source for information than alternative media. It's because grand alternative media organizations and sites are most probably run by the CIA themself.

       I think what he means is they more thoroughly fact check their work, as could be expected given their access to resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the information comes in snippets- "Pilots Couldn't Fly Cessnas", "5 Israelis arrested Celebrating To wer Collapse"- as these mainstream sources are far less likely speculate what the grand implications might be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most "facts" conspiracy "theories" are based on were first reported by major news outlets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: re-read the part about the CIA running them. That baseless speculation could be as easily made about mainstream sources.

       of course most "alternative" media is COINTELPRO , but MSM is infinitely more dangerous . the reality the msm manufactures leads to millions of deaths and uncountable amounts of money being stolen.

       I listened to Bill Cooper's advice "Don't believe a single word anyone ever tells you if you can't verify it by yourself"

       Cointelpro didn't target the media. It targeted political activism. The communist party. Civil rights movement. Black panthers. Anti war.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there is a if not deliberate effort then an active disinterest in not preventing the dissemination of distracting conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people are going off on wild goose chases then they're not doing anything about the every day reality of being nicked and dimmed by the rich and powerful, government institutions being rolled back except to support the rich and powerful, environmental degradation, civil rights, anti-war, etc. in fact there can be a bit of a rightwing tinge in conspiracies that thinks its good!

       Bill Cooper's advice is sound, but almost no one who is reading these conspiracy websites follow his advice. A lot of people have a tendency to believe everything posted on these sites because they know 'the government can't be trusted'. I think the CIA benefits hugely from this and plants their own set up conspiracy sites with more falsehoods.
      </p>
      <p>
       MSM isn't 100% reliable of course, but if I have to make a judgement on MSM it's that I can say that it's
       <strong>
        biased
       </strong>
       , but not necessarily outright false in
       <em>
        most
       </em>
       cases. Whereas these major conspiracy sites tend to include false and unverified information or even silly rumors.

       I only really pay attention to what was said by people who were murdered by the state for speaking up. Like Phil Schneider and Bill Cooper.

       IMHO Jones and everyone working for/with him are part of the controlled opposition program (different from the dissinfo department). Or Snowden .

       Read up on the propaganda model.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media intended for the 'elite', New York Times, Wall St Journal, London Financial Review, etc will tend to have a more accurate picture of the world and events. They are read by the people running the show, they need an accurate picture to run things properly, there are filters still of course they're not going to say every US president is a war criminal, but you can decode and figure out what they're not saying.

       Serious question. Do you have a list of articles for ZeroHedge, AlexJones, and DavidIcke (reptilian speculation aside) which discredits them factually, especially where it is obvious disinformation (rather than simple mistakes or admitted speculation)?

       I am not an expert analyst. I don't go and read every article those websites write. And certainly haven't done so in the last year. Some things become clear through experience, and through confirmations from various sources that for instance Alex Jones never criticizes Israel for anything. He keeps focusing on the bankers and the New World Order but never addresses the zionist connection, always evades it. So he has become known as a gate keeper for Israel.
David Icke is one of those guys I instantly dismissed when I learned that he was the one pushing the reptilian theories. I also instantly dismiss anything relating to 'flat earth' theories. I don't have to investigate things like that, nor want to.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I've initially said, these websites aren't 100% factual wrong, but their conclusions and implications lead to dead ends. Which is why I believe it's best to avoid them completely in my opinion. Sure there are a minority of people who are able to read these websites and not fall for the falsehoods these sites preach and maneouver their way around them, but this group of highly critical thinkers are very rare. Which is why it's better to avoid them for the majority of people, myself included.
I have to admit that I can't state the exact reasons why I distrust globalresearch and zerohedge but I believe I have encountered a few suspicious things being claimed by those sites, but at the time I haven't made the effort to make a note of which article it was. Something I need to keep in mind to do so in the future.

       What's the nature of the disinformation coming from zerohedge? I was familiar with the others, but as long as you see the obvious libertarian bias in zerohedge, I thought a lot of the current event information seemed legit? If I'm wrong I'd like to know for sure.

       I feel like when people see the light, they generally take a pretty extreme turn in their political view to either far right or far left.  Alternative news websites will often reflect that, and more often than not imo take a more extreme right wing slant for a host of reasons.  So I agree zerohedge's main issue (and most of those websites he lists tbh) is the solutions it offers for the problems it exposes.  Either way, it's the same reason we visit these sites and this subreddit in the first place is because they expose stories and ideas we won't ever see in the msm.  Who cares if the other 1/2 to 2/3 of it is hogwash?
