<p>Extract from article in link above:-</p>

<p>&quot;This convenient method of reasoning was displayed with particular clarity in connection with the government’s investigation of SIDS deaths in Tennessee. In 1978-79, eleven babies were found to have died within eight days of a DPT vaccination. Nine of the eleven had been vaccinated with the same lot of pertussis vaccine, Wyeth #64201 and five (four from the same lot) had died within twenty-four hours of vaccination.</p>

<p>A statistical analysis of the clustering of deaths revealed that the likelihood of observing four or more deaths occurring randomly on any of the first eight days after the use of lot #64201 was 3 in 100. … E.B. Mortimer later reported that the probability of this being a chance association was even lower — between 2 and 5 in 1,000.1</p>

<p>The statistical evidence in favor of a connection between the deaths and the DPT shot was strong. Would the medical authorities bite the bullet and admit the vaccine was related to the deaths? Absolutely not.&quot;</p>

<p>So it&#39;s some paper which pulls all kinds of inflated and fake CDC statistics to then say we need more vaccines to save lives, and makes the assumption that vaccines are perfectly safe, despite the fact that those studies have never been performed, and despite the fact that we know that infant mortality gets worse the more vaccines you give.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since I&#39;m probably crazy I actually wasted a few hours repeating this study with 2015 numbers. I used the same statistical analysis, data sources, etc. For 2015 at least, there&#39;s no correlation between vaccine schedule and infant mortality in the top 34 (28 after excluding the same ones they did) countries for infant mortality.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the graph I got in the end:

<p>Linear regression gave me a flat line. ANOVA analysis came up with no significant correlation.</p>

<p>If anyone wants the excel file I used, or any of the data let me know and I&#39;ll pass it along.</p>

<p>Edit: I find myself wondering why a 2011 study used 2009 numbers. Is that the only year it works for?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, only the first world. I took the best 34 countries from the world factbook, exactly the same as they did.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the initial list of countries:</p>

<p>Monaco
Iceland
Japan
Singapore
Norway
Bermuda
Finland
Sweden
Czech Republic
Hong Kong
Macau
France
Italy
Spain
Anguilla
Belgium
Germany
Guernsey
Austria
Luxembourg
Israel
Malta
Belarus
Netherlands
Andorra
Switzerland
Ireland
Jersey
Lithuania
Estonia
Korea, South
Slovenia
Denmark
Isle of Man
Liechtenstein</p>

<p>Any country with fewer than 5 infant deaths I excluded, same as they did. So, Isle of Man, Andorra, Monaco, etc.</p>

<p>After that, I got the lists of which vaccines are used from the same sources as they listed, mainly the ECDC. I remembered to count DTAP 3 times, same as they did (though the ECDC lists all the vaccines separately, very handy).</p>

<p>I had some trouble with the vaccine schedules of one or two of the asian countries, but not nearly enough to affect the final result.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As long as they don&#39;t bring up that paper again, I&#39;m happy enough without a response.</p>

<p>Side note, I&#39;ve been thinking about this and it seems like a lot of posters here should agree with me. &quot;Ask who stands to benefit&quot;, right? The original autism paper was from a rival producer of vaccines. </p>

<p>This paper here was originally published under &quot;Neil Z Miller, Independent researcher, Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA Gary S Goldman, Independent computer scientist, Pearblossom, California, USA&quot; and they listed &quot;No conflict of interest&quot;</p>

<p>But what&#39;s this? They issued a correction later: &quot;Neil Z Miller, Think Twice Global Vaccine Institute, USA Gary S Goldman, Computer scientist, Pearblossom, California, USA&quot; and they list conflict of interest as &quot;Neil Z Miller is associated with the ‘Think Twice Global Vaccine Institute’. Gary S Goldman has not been associated with the ‘World Association for Vaccine Education’ (WAVE) for more than four years but was, at the time of publication of the article, still listed as a Director for it on the WAVE website.&quot;</p>

<p>So they&#39;re associated with and funded by three anti-vaccine organizations but they originally hid this fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>God, I feel like I <em>should</em> be paid after the time I spent redoing that paper with 2015 stats.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why I bothered, I could have debunked it by pointing out flaws. Hell, the flaws the authors point out in their own discussion basically kill the paper.</p>

<ol>
<li>They didn&#39;t account for vaccine coverage. A country with 90% coverage and 12 vaccines should count the same as 50% coverage and 20 vaccines.</li>
<li>If vaccines are beneficial you&#39;d expect to see <em>more</em> of them in countries with poor health, not less. The more infant diseases there are, the more vaccines would be used to try and prevent them. Some countries use like twice the vaccines the US does and I&#39;ve never heard of most of the diseases, but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a problem there.</li>
<li>They don&#39;t take into account any possible reason other than vaccine use to account for infant mortality. What if totalitarian regimes are more likely to mandate strict vaccine use and also more likely to have poor health? We don&#39;t know!</li>
</ol>

<p>This study could be done properly, and it has! To get rid of all these confounding variables it&#39;s as simple as looking at a single country with multiple time points, rather than multiple countries.</p>

<p>The data and causation is strong, but it seems more like you don&#39;t want to consider the possibility that the vaccines could be causing any harm</p>

<p>Look into the internal memos these companies send, this one was after babies died from a specific batch of DPT vaccine, they advised to split the batches to different states in the future, so as it wouldn&#39;t be so easy to track down that a bad batch of vaccines were the cause of death.</p>
