<p>Must Read !!!</p>

<p>After World War II people around the world thought that it was last major war on Earth. This does not look appearing now.
In 1944 major countries of world sat in New Hampshire(Bretton wood conference) to declare dollar as a world currency backed by gold(Gold Standard).US had reserve gold to print paper money.US started printing money and was enjoying the economy boom. From 1945 to 1965 everything was fine but in 1965 US had war with Vietnam and in effect of war US economy started tumble. Until 1970 US was printing more and more dollar to overcome financial crisis. This made countries to start disbelieving in dollar and asking for gold in return of dollar.US had printed more dollar than gold it had. Redeem of gold would have destroy US economy. There fore, US president Nixon ended gold back dollar and started printing more and more dollar to strengthen the economy.Dollar value in international markte was gradually plunging as it was only paper money not backed by gold. Nixon took very smart move, went to Arab and asked to take dollar in exchange of oil. US also promised to give protection and weapons(This is called Petro-Dollar system). This was first seed sow for current war. Other OPEC members (Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,United Arab Emirates and Venezuela) also followed Arabia exchange policy. US economy started emerge but other countries(China and Japan etc) had to make export oriented policy to get dollar to purchase oil.US economy is like a vehicle which can not run without oil.</p>

<p>In 1999 enemy of dollar had come into the picture &quot;Euro&quot;. In 2000 Iraqi president(Russia-China pro) Saddam Hussain decided to sell oil in Euro and assured death warrant of him. US economy(dollar) might derail if Iraq and other OPEC members follow it.
In 2003 Bush invaded Iraq pretending of chemical weapons to save their dollar and destroy the entire country. Iraq again started selling oil in dollar.
Libya&#39;s Gaddafi declared to use gold Dinar for oil in 2010. He also tried to form African union and was planning to launch a satellite which was going to serve African nations. Gaddafi step was against US and European nations who have been sucking entire Africa continent for years. So US and EU invaded Libya and killed Gaddafi. Syria moved away from the dollar in 06 and Iran in 08.</p>

<p>Now US has to keep Russia and China away from natural resources(oil and natural gas) and has to compete Euro/Yuan/Rubel as well. Today the US-backed wars in Ukraine and in Syria are but two fronts in the same strategic war to cripple Russia and China and to rupture any Eurasian counter-pole. Natural gas has become the favored “clean energy” source for the 21st Century and the EU is the world’s largest growth market for gas, a major reason US wants to break the Russia-EU supply dependency to weaken Russia and keep control over the EU via loyal proxies like Qatar.</p>

<p>The world’s largest known natural gas reservoir sits in the middle of the Persian Gulf straddling part in the territorial waters of Qatar and part in Iran.China signed agreement with Iran to develop gas pipeline infrastructure to bring the gas to China .In July 2011, the governments of Syria, Iran and Iraq signed an historic gas pipeline energy agreement and this triggered US-Saudi-Qatari war to remove Syrian president Assad. This pipeline would run from the Persian Gulf(in Iran), to Damascus in Syria via Iraq territory. The agreement would make Syria the center of assembly and production in conjunction with the reserves of Lebanon. This is a geopolitically strategic space that geographically opens for the first time, extending from Iran to Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.</p>

<p>Shortly after signing with Iran and Iraq, on August 16, 2011, Bashar al-Assad’s Syrian Ministry of Oil announced the discovery of a gas well in the Area of Qarah in the Central Region of Syria near Homs. Russia, with Assad in power, would be a major investor or operator of the new gas fields in Syria.
Iran ultimately plans to extend the pipeline from Damascus(Syria) to Lebanon’s Mediterranean port where it would be delivered to the huge EU market.
Syria would buy Iranian gas along with a current Iraqi agreement to buy Iranian gas from Iran’s part of South Pars field.</p>

<p>Qatar, today the world’s largest exporter of LNG, largely to Asia, wants the same EU market that Iran and Syria eye.
For that, they would build pipelines to the Mediterranean. Here is where getting rid of the pro Russian-Iranian-Chinese Assad is essential.
In 2009 Qatar approached Bashar al-Assad to propose construction of a gas pipeline from Qatar’s north Field through Syria on to Turkey and to the EU.
Assad refused, citing Syria’s long friendly relations with Russia.</p>

<p>That refusal combined with the Iran-Iraq-Syria gas pipeline agreement in 2011 ignited the full-scale Saudi and Qatari along with US assault on Syria and cause of rise of ISIS. ISIS is now war army of US+Israel+Saudi Arabia+Qatar and many other countries. US announced attack on ISIS but wanted to capture Syria. Now in counter attack Syrian president called his alliance Russia and China.</p>

<p>Now world is on the verge of polarisation, Russia+China+Iran+Syria+Iraq... and US+Israel+Saudi Arabia+Qatar+UK...</p>

<p>US is trying to rapture EU economy to down euro using IMF by weaken its member countries economies. Greece is one of the victim recently(Spain, Italy, Portugal are in queue).</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia is manipulating oil price to weaken Iran indirectly Russia. China is in currency war with US. China did de-value its currency to compete with dollar(China market crash in Aug-Sept).</p>

<p>France voted against Israel for Palestine in UN in Sept-Oct 2015, recognized as a state and stabbed to Israel, and looking for 2 states solution theory.
France had to pay for this by #AttackinParis</p>

<p>China is capturing African countries and making lot of investment. Mali is recently attacked because its President went to china door to ask help and get rid of US occupied gold mines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our current situation is <em>very</em> alike what we saw leading up to the first world war. Like you stated, we are currently undergoing a polarization of the globe, countries are taking sides and making allies.</p>

<p>All we need now are for the super-powers to arm up and an incident (I&#39;m thinking a false flag on scale with the 9/11 attacks) to set off the powder keg.</p>

<p>1 year? 2 years? 5-10? Hard to say, but with the current escalations, I wouldn&#39;t be too optimistic. Remember, this war will have the combined nuclear arsenals of all major super-powers, so the need to have a standing army with the state-of-the-art-technology is not really a priority this time around. First-strike scenarios are key.</p>

<p>Line up is wrong a bit, you watch by action not by words when thinking military strategics. A politician can lie to the news reporter but through action show their real alliance.</p>

<p>USA+Russia+China+Iran VS CIA, Israel, Saudi, UK,</p>

<p>Even then, most countries will be at war within themselves.</p>

<p>I.E the polarization propaganda you speak of seems to be race and religion based as well. Meaning Christians won&#39;t be gun ho to kill Christians, Muslims won&#39;t be gun ho to kill Muslims, white will not be excited to kill whites blacks not excited to kill blacks etc, etc. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if at the same time, civil wars breakout within countries as well.</p>

<p>This also doesn&#39;t even account for the outliers.</p>

One will come out of the microwave a lot hotter than the other. I gave you the information to do your own experiments but hey apparently you couldn&#39;t think of trying that for yourself. Seeing how you could so easily believe the nukes don&#39;t exist thing it&#39;s clear that your just incredibly stupid and afraid of living in a world were such a weapon exists.
