       Exactly this.

      <p>
       ...and it's very disheartening for the prospects of the human race getting up off it's knees when we look at how many people -
       <em>
        in this sub alone
       </em>
       , to say nothing about the rest of the world - go right along with the race baiting and are falling right into the b.s. propaganda against "this" race or "that" race.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's fucking infuriating and stupid that so many people are actually THIS fucking stupid and don't see that the problem is not with each other, but with TPTB that are controlling and manipulating the narrative so as to empower themselves by getting us to go against one another.
      </p>
      <p>
       Divide and conquer, people.  That's all TPTB do.  If we could stand up together
       <em>

       their propaganda, brainwashing, and manipulation, we would go SO much further as a species and as a civilization.

       I would say that it goes against the plan for the NWO because it conflicts with cultural Marxism. However it helps add to the state of perpetual conflict which will allow the "elites" to temporarily distract the public from what is more important to them (trading long term benefit for short term). Or perhaps there are two groups of elites in competition with each other.

       I'm not familiar with what Marxism is - culturally or otherwise - but it would seem that anything that involves the citizenry REALLY uniting together and helping each other independent of what TPTB dictate is something they (tptb) will consider as going against their plans.

       It’s been said by various sources that there are various competing factions of elite groups on this planet - all vying for dominance very much at the expense of the 99%.  They may occasionally be in conflict with one another, but it seems they
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       agree on one thing:  "The 99% are nothing but our cattle." and they seem to all agree in terms of treating us as such.  Some elites may lobby for slightly more "humane" ways of treating the livestock and slaughtering the cows, but, at the end of the day, even these types still very much
       <em>
        eat cows

       Cultural Marxism is the idea of one race, one language, and one culture. This is essential for the formation of the NWO. Marxism was created by a German Jew named Karl Marx who is also accredited to have been the founder of communism. Also there is no doubt that these elites are infighting but it would seem that they play by certain restrictions, which is unfortunate for us because they would probably kill each other.

      <p>
       Hmm.  I’m definitely not referring to cultural Marxism then because we are, of coursed,
       <em>
        many
       </em>
       races, and I don’t think that’s necessarily a bad thing at all.  However, I espouse the idea of one language most definitely.  And as far as culture?  I think that we could/should all have one “meta culture” of sorts in the sense that we should all abide by some foundational tenets.  However, I’m totally okay with a plethora of different variants of that foundational tenet so long as they don’t go against the foundation of “honor for all beings”, etc, etc…
      </p>
      <p>
       But no.  The idea of “one race”?  Na.  We’re
       <em>
        many
       </em>
       races.  No reason why we can’t all still be one even within the context of our many differences physically and racially speaking.

      <p>
       Well, having one unifying people is also essential for the formation of a good, healthy, flourishing world and civilization.  The difference between the global unity that I’m personally talking about and the stereotypical NWO is that the NWO is a denigrating paradigm under which all of society is ruled with an iron fist by an elite few.  What I’m talking about is a people, race, and culture that are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       ruled by a nefarious elite, but that
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       still function together as one, global species.  Big difference between those two things even though they both espouse the idea of “global unanimity” and may look similar superficially speaking.

      <p>
       Absolutely.  Correct and agreed.  They fight amongst themselves, but they’re ALL together
       <em>
        against
       </em>
       the general population.

       I was commenting on your rebuttal that international diplomats can be expected to act in a way that reflects the will of the people but as we can see in every which way, that tends to be the antithesis of what happens. I am not suggesting that every awful things that happens is "da JOOS" but I do however entirely comprehend how Israel is complicit in the occupation of their territory with little regard for Palestinian lives, and this upsets many people because we all know the Jewish shtick to be one that reminds you of the holocaust yet they are actively engaging in the very thing that almost exterminated their people. I should know, my family is Jewish. But I am not a Zionist, I am ashamed of many of my people.

       anything in us politics that divides the population over petty social issues just allows aipac and a bunch of other rich organizations to maintain stranglehold over the corrupt political process

       I don't know if you really said the truth that you are a Jew, but I am literally sick of seeing every conspiracy being linked to Israel, and the Jews. And yeah, you can say the classic line that oh the anger is directed towards Zionists, but I don't feel so.

       Yeah, I am telling you the truth about that. But the important thing to remember is that I am not my government, while I am American that does not make me responsible for the actions of my government, just as being Jewish does not make you responsible for the atrocities against the Palestinians. Unless you support them, in which case you are complicit.
