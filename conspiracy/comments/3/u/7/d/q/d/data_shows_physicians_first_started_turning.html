        <h3 class="title">Data Shows Physicians First Started Turning Against Vaccines After The 2009 Swine Flu Scandal</h3>
        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">85</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2015-11-25 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/liverpoolwin.html">liverpoolwin</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here I present evidence that physicians are slowly turning against vaccines, especially so since the Swine Flu Scandal in 2009.  It&#39;s worth noting that even in 2005 they had their doubts about specific vaccines in the childhood schedule.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s travel back 10 years and examine this 2005 study, it found that physicians where mostly pro-vaccine, though some against the Hib vaccine, which is linked to <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1116914/">Diabetes Type 1</a>, and also many declining or delaying the dangerous combination vaccines, MMR and DPT.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16263976">How do physicians immunize their own children?</a></p>

<p><strong>&quot;Ninety-three percent of the surveyed physicians agree with the current official vaccination recommendations and would apply them to their own children. However, the observation that 5% of nonpediatricians would not use Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine if they had a child born in 2004 is unexpected and concerning. In contrast, both groups gave additional vaccines than those recommended to their own children. Among physicians in Switzerland interested in immunization, a significant proportion of nonpediatricians decline or delay the immunization of their own children with the recommended MMR- or DTP-based combination vaccines&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Then comes the 2009 Swine Flu Scandal, which was initiated in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_flu_pandemic">April 2009</a>, the whole episode turned out to be a money-making scam by Big Pharma, even the highly respected Council of Europe had to step in and call out the shenanigans...<a href="http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2010-06-06/news/council-of-europe-slams-unjustified-swine-flu-scare-waste-of-public-funds-275598/">Council Of Europe slams ‘unjustified swine flu scare’, waste of public funds</a></p>

<p><strong>The   handling   of   the   H1N1   pandemic: more transparency needed</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://assembly.coe.int/CommitteeDocs/2010/20100329_MemorandumPandemie_E.pdf">http://assembly.coe.int/CommitteeDocs/2010/20100329_MemorandumPandemie_E.pdf</a> </p>

<p>Now, fast forward to a <a href="http://file.scirp.org/html/22932.html">2012 study - Vaccination practices among physicians and their children</a>, which found that attitudes started to change in 2009, interestingly at the same time as the Swine Flu Scandal, when it became clearer than ever that the whole vaccine business is completely corrupt and is not about health at all.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;While most pediatricians and pediatric specialists (95% and 93%) have adhered to the recommended ACIP vaccination schedule up until 2009, a potential for change emerged with 10% of pediatricians and 21% of pediatric specialists claiming they would not follow the recommendations for future progeny.  Despite their education, physicians in this study expressed concern over the safety of vaccines.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://file.scirp.org/html/22932.html">Vaccination practices among physicians and their children</a></p>

<p>So what we&#39;re seeing is that as the propaganda is stepped up and becomes more obvious, as Big Pharma push to make more money both from vaccines and from the <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0008382">autoimmune diseases which vaccines induce</a>, now more people are starting to wake up.  So the greed of the 2009 Swine Flu scam has now created an equal and opposite reaction, with educated and intelligent people quickly waking up to the madness of the current situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The latter, but another thing to realize is that by pumping out constant vaccines, it serves the government&#39;s goal of being able to pump out an emergency vaccine in the event of a true pandemic flu. Pharmaceutical companies aren&#39;t going to keep the pump primed and oiled without getting some filthy lucre for it. Flu shots fill the void - and when/if there is a big pandemic flu or something like Ebola and we get a working vaccine, we have the apparatus for widespread production and distribution.</p>

<p>Problem is the lack of thought re:repercussions of seasonal flu shots, and the thoughtless, reckless pushing of vaccine after vaccine on healthcare workers and children, but I believe the impetus on the government side was the bird flu scare back in the early 2000s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Small Pox has long since been eradicated (through quarantine), Small Pox vaccines are not in the childhood schedule as the risk of the vaccine clearly far outweighs the non-existent benefit</p>

<p>As for Polio, it&#39;s a disease of poor sanitation, in the First World it&#39;s nothing to worry about, also if you have tonsils then you already have Polio antibodies.  The vaccine is a failure as it&#39;s causing the majority of Polio in the world.  There are a few countries which still have Polio, mostly from the vaccine, it would make far more sense to sort out their sanitation issues rather than to keep harming them with these dangerous jabs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Small pox wasn&#39;t eliminated through quarantine it was eliminated by a global vaccination program. This is a fact and not some sort of conspiracy. They have been vaccinating people for over 150 years, it&#39;s not some big pharma conspiracy. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox#Eradication">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox#Eradication</a></p>

<p>And secondly polio has been mostly eradicated through childhood vaccination. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poliomyelitis_eradication">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poliomyelitis_eradication</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/polio/">http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/polio/</a>
Basically all children in America get polio vaccinations, where all the cases of polio in the U.S.?</p>

<p>And lastly, if you have tonsils it does not in any way shape or form mean you polio antibodies. If that were true no one would get polio and die if they have tonsils and that simply not true. Your tonsils are part of you lymphatic system which is your immune system and it can help from getting polio but it doesn&#39;t prevent it. </p>

<p>You really should read about things you seem to care about. It&#39;s so silly to think just because you have tonsils you won&#39;t get a highly infectious and deadly disease that has been killing millions of people with tonsils just shows how out of touch you are with the situation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the people directly involved in the Small Pox eradication said that at best the vaccine only speeded up the eradication slightly, but the problem was that it was an incredibly dangerous vaccine, regularly causing autoimmune disease.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very unlikely that someone with tonsils would have problems with Polio unless they were immune-compromised.  Even still Polio is an incredibly mild illness in the majority, most never know that they&#39;ve had it.</p>

<p>Polio was renamed, that&#39;s why there&#39;s no Polio in the US, it now goes under many other names.  Even Polio from the vaccine has another name, NPAFP, that one is twice as deadly as wild Polio, but it doesn&#39;t show up in statistics because it&#39;s now no longer called Polio.</p>

<p>In areas of good sanitation there is no reason to vaccinate against Polio, in areas with bad sanitation they would need to first create a safer vaccine for it to be worthwhile, otherwise they&#39;re mostly spreading a disease worse than Polio itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See Vaccines Are They Really Safe and Effective? By Neil z. Miller.  The book has 916 cites.  You must do your own research from both sides.  95% of everyone who is exposed to the natural polio virus won&#39;t exhibit any symptoms, even under epidemic conditions. Physicians desk reference PDR, 55th edition. Montvale, New Jersey, medical economics, 2001and Burnet M et al, the natural history of infectious disease, New York, NY, Cambridge University Press, 1972, page 16.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, you don&#39;t have to quote basically common knowledge about the 95% number and cite a physicians handbook to sound smart. You copied that off a vaxtruth.com article citation, simply regurgitating what you read off a website with an agenda without even questioning it. </p>

<p>Polio is a real disease and used to kill around 300,000 people a year. It&#39;s not fake and you can&#39;t just not vaccinate people and expect them to not get sick. I&#39;m not exactly sure your position, but it sounds like you think diseases are fake and pose no risk?  Say it doesn&#39;t affect 95% of people? Would you want your child to be one of the hundreds of thousands of people per year that would die of the disease, since it only is a problem for 5% we decided not to easily prevent it?</p>

<p>It&#39;s simply ludicrous to think 300,000 people dying a year is some how preferable to a few dozen a year due to a (extremely rare) bad vaccine. </p>

<p>Neil z miller is a total quack and has zero formal education or is a doctor in any way shape or form. He has self published everything, he is self employed by all of his own anti vax foundations. </p>

<p>Zero real credentials. Zero real citations by actual doctors and scientists. No one considers his work valid in any way. He&#39;s a con man that makes money by selling books. I&#39;d really like to see the 900 actual scientific peer reviewed citations. </p>

<p>This person lays out CONCRETE criticisms of this book and why it&#39;s complete quackery and no good for actually learning a balanced view on the subject to make an actually informed decision. Instead, it just preys on fear to generate book sales. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok expert who quotes a website that quotes no sources.  That quote I took was from the book I just mentioned not from whatever website you googled.  It quotes legitimate sources and was written by a medical researcher.  Did I mention it comes recommended by a neurosurgeon?  Oh yes I did, and yes the research does have credibility.  Again, the concrete criticisms website.... it references no sources nor does anything near countering any points of the book.  Maybe you should actually look into both sides of the argument which was what my post was recommending.  It&#39;s a polarized topic which it shouldn&#39;t be.  As the previous poster mentioned, the risks have been found to outweigh the benefits of the smallpox vaccine.  There are pros and cons.  There are many risks to taking vaccines for illnesses which are not dangerous themselves or are incredibly rare.  Polio deaths were falling dramatically by the time the vaccine was introduced likely due to sanitation and nutrition improvements.  Those who are taking vaccines should understand the whole story and that&#39;s all I&#39;m saying.  Understand the whole story and make a choice for yourself. BTW your numbers are way off: <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/E/reported-cases.pdf">http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/E/reported-cases.pdf</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>My numbers were for the world, do you do know that vaccines dont just happen in the USA, right?</p>

<p>Secondly you took that physicians citation from an anti vax site, its the only place that has those words on the entire internet besides the actual book and its not on the internet to just cite like that.</p>

<p>Secondly, IT WAS NOT WRITTEN BY A MEDICAL RESEARCHER!!!!  You cant just &quot;research&quot; medicine and become a medical researcher.  You have to be a university educated doctor.  Which neil miller is not.  He has no credentials that he didnt make up and no one cites him.  Show me the 900 citations you talked about!</p>

<p>He largely bases his &quot;research&quot; on one doctor who lost his license because HE LIED ABOUT THE DATA!!!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/01/23/the-disneyland-measles-outbreak-and-the-disgraced-doctor-who-whipped-up-fear-about-vaccinations/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/01/23/the-disneyland-measles-outbreak-and-the-disgraced-doctor-who-whipped-up-fear-about-vaccinations/</a></p>

<p>Sciences means repeatable, if hes the only one to ever get these conclusions, which was then concretely debunked, it means it was wrong, maliciously so or not.   </p>

<p>And lastly, if the polio vaccine is so dangerous, why arent people dying at anywhere close to the same right as not vaccinated people?  How come polio completely disappeared in the USA once there was widespread mandatory vaccination?</p>

I told you already, google master, that I pulled the quote from a physical book, you know the kind you hold and read.

    <div class="md"><p>Those who were vaccinated for flu had worse symptoms when they contracted Swine flu than those who weren&#39;t vaccinated. The thought behind it was that when vaccinated Swine flu victims caught it, their body tried to use all of the antibodies it had against flu before fashioning its own antibodies against Swine flu. Like pulling swords or throwing cards in Magic the Gathering or something - let&#39;s try our current weapons before fashioning a brand new sword - since those vaccinated for flu had more existing flu antibodies to attempt to fight the novel flu (i.e., more cards to throw), this extended the time before attempting to craft a new antibody and thus, worse symptoms due to the virus having more time to replicate.</p>

<p>One reason I&#39;m anti-flu shot for myself, we really don&#39;t know the outcome of having so many different flu antibodies resident in the body when a novel and more virulent flu appears (and we don&#39;t know who keeps which for how long - I&#39;ve heard 6 months in some cases, which would make some flu vaccines useless, but if longer--and I assume some flu virii hang out forever, see also flu-induced recurring neuritis--keeping up on flu vaccines could actually be dangerous when fighting a novel flu). And the data we see from the Swine flu hit indicates that maybe, just maybe, having so many different antibodies against flu can actually be more dangerous than having the few you get randomly.</p>

<p>This all kind of gets thrown out the window if you are around little kids, though, because there&#39;s no choice in the matter - most kids are now given Flu mist, which is a live virus, and typically at least 2 of the 4 strains in the quadrivalent do spread to others.</p>

<p>Something to think about, parents, at Thanksgiving and Christmas with elder relatives or otherwise immunocompromised. If you&#39;re going to FluMist your kids, get it done in September or earlier, not RIGHT before Thanksgiving or Christmas.</p>
