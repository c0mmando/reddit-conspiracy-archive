       Everyday I visit this sub looking through all that has happened as of recent and am constantly met with the same pattern and realization that it all comes down to being the media censoring speech and our population being misinformed and malleable. Though I rarely see any discussion of how
       <em>
        we
       </em>
       could fix this; especially when our right to assemble and freedom of speech is being infringed upon. Which brings me to the purpose of this post: to attempt to create a place where we can brainstorm any solutions to this issue amongst each other with hopes of making some form of progress or resolve.

       People don't even care about evidence, which is all over reputable sites such as Wikipedia. We can create a massive, organized Wikipedia compilation of false flags and other declassified events, sociological terms, etc. and people wouldn't bother to investigate merely because they find such information to be "unbelievable."
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that people immediately shut down any new information that challenges their worldview; we can thank mirror neurons for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       A solution would be to create easily consumed information, such as infographics, gifs, or even art/songs (similar to what socialist realism accomplished), so that these closeminded sheep can be coaxed closer to the truth.

       To me the most important thing to demonstrate to a person is how mainstream consensus thought does not equate to truth.  Show the methods of topological psychology that are employed to create consensus on topics.  When you expose the history of think tanks, their funding sources(banks, multinationals, gov'ts) and the programs those think tanks have been responsible for it bridges the gap for a lot of people between conspiracy theory and reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       'Propaganda' (1928) (
       <a href="http://whale.to/b/bernays.pdf">
        http://whale.to/b/bernays.pdf
       </a>
       ) by Edward Bernays is a great starting point.  Bernays was a nephew of Freud and worked in the Office of Public Information under Woodrow Wilson during WW1 creating propaganda techniques to influence public opinion.  He is often referred to as "the father of public relations".  Here a man responsible for creating mass brainwashing techniques telling us how these things work.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next step is to look at the network of think tanks.  Wellington House in the UK is a decent place to start.  Wellington House birthed the Tavistock Institute which can be considered an umbrella organization over other think tanks in the Western world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some other important names in the history of propaganda and mass brainwashing that you might want to research:
       <br/>
       -Trofim Lysenko (Soviet who introduced the concept of enforcing pseudo-science as real with the power of law (hello space program))
       <br/>
       -Willie Munzenburg
       <br/>
       -Walter Lippmann
       <br/>
       -Lord Northcliffe
      </p>
      <p>
       Next it is helpful to examine a specific recent propaganda effort.  The campaign to get American interested in Iraq in 2003 is perfect.  The WMD lie is very blatant and recent.  Show the video of Bush laughing about that lie (
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O35NA6TywAg">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O35NA6TywAg
       </a>
       ) There is the babies ripped from incubators made up story told by the daughter of a foreign ambassador and presented as real.
      </p>
      <p>
       So much of our culture, education, entertainment is heavily influenced by these think tanks.  A very interesting case study is the history of gangsta rap.  It is not just some organic creation of black culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also interesting is children's public television programming.  Sit down and watch some of it carefully to see what messages are being sent to children.  When the show is over, look at the list of sponsoring think tanks mentioned at the end.

       This would do all kinds of positive wonders... Basically the idea of adults having at least one thought out, planned and intended psychedelic experience either with Psilocybin or DMT to truly experience the power of the mind and see what it is like to dissolve boundaries and feel and think things like never before.

       I have been thinking about that too. I dont know if you saw those
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBCGOTxmR5U">
        fakelivesmatter mimes
       </a>
       I see on twitter but I thought that was a good idea even though that particular mime could be used to discredit the truth movement since its attached to blacklivesmatter.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it would be a good idea to saturate the masses with these kinds of messages and how insane they really are.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think that we should try to create a vision on how the world could be different without the kind of government we have in place now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think yes men did a documentary on that how they circulated a fake news paper that show the good thinks that were happening or what could happen if we didn't have a corrupt government.
If more and more people started sharing there own experience with there personal relationship with corruption in a symbolic way I think it would do more to wake people up than anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       The documentary
       <a href="http://www.goldenpath.net/videos/century-self">
        "Century of The Self"
       </a>
       really taught me that you can tell people the truth until you are blue in the face, with no real results. Unfortunately, people only really respond to inner desires. People have a desire to speak the truth and be free, you just need to encourage it from an internal point of reference so that people can make it their own. People have to think they came up with the solution as oppose to be told about the solution.
I think in this country we have too many mediums trying to tell us what to do and it turns people off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing we can do its group together in small groups to work on projects that would help wake people up. I think we need to really understand and use some of the methods of Edward Bernays under the umbrella teaching people how to wake up themselves to their own truth.

       I have definitely been thinking about this. I feel like we need to focus on the most powerful points of view that they (TPTB) always try to hide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Focused concepts to awaken the general population
      </p>

       <li>
        The Petrol Dollar
       </li>
       <li>
        Suicide rates in the US military
       </li>
       <li>
        ISIS/Terrorist groups are mainly mercenaries supported by NATO countries
       </li>
       <li>
        How building WTC 7 fell on 9/11
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       As for, solutions/discussion on how to actually fix things... I thought

       I'd say we can all do whatever we want, seeing as how we are individuals, each with his or her own ideas and convictions. There's nothing monolithic about the subscribers to this sub. We don't all believe the same things. We don't all have the same goals. I think much of what I read here is complete nonsense. The issues I believe are the most important issues facing the Western world are largely ignored by the rank and file of this sub, and Reddit as a whole.

       It can't be done.

       Edward Bernays figured out almost a century ago that all people need is to hear ANYthing repeated in media by the 'experts' to become completely and inexorably convinced that what they hear is the absolute and final truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       They will never even attempt to find out  for themselves  and will not believe  anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bernays proved it by causing millions of women to take up smoking  back in the 1920's,  by having  his paid experts call cigarettes 'torches of freedom' in newspapers and magazines.

       You use the word "truth" like

       use the word truth...

       Seriously, for people who claim to be interested in exposing the truth, many of the people on this sub don't seem interested in engaging in much critical thinking, collecting evidence, or considering issues in an unbiased manner.

       People don't even care about evidence, which is all over reputable sites such as Wikipedia. We can create a massive, organized Wikipedia compilation of false flags and other declassified events, sociological terms, etc. and people wouldn't bother to investigate merely because they find such information to be "unbelievable."
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that people immediately shut down any new information that challenges their worldview; we can thank mirror neurons for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       A solution would be to create easily consumed information, such as infographics, gifs, or even art/songs (similar to what socialist realism accomplished), so that these closeminded sheep can be coaxed closer to the truth.
