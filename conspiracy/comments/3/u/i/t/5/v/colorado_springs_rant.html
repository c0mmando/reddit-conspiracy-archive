How can these comments have <em>so many</em> fucking upvotes?
TERRORISM IS NOT REAL! For fucks sake! People! Sheep! Look at who will benefit from this opportunity! People don&#39;t just go out and start shooting shit up! These are all false flag attacks attempting to keep you scared and in line!
Moreover, it&#39;s to keep <em>us</em>, the only ones who can save us, DIVIDED. Black white, brown, Christian, Muslim, pro-life, pro-choice, gay, straight, red, blue: NONE OF IT MATTERS.</p>

<p>THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IS YOUR GOVERNMENTS ARE USING GUNMEN ON THEIR OWN POPULATIONS AND BLAMING IT ON OTHER PEOPLE. WAKE THE FUCK UP</p>

<p>Even if one leviathan isn&#39;t planning all these attacks, there is definitely a smorgasbord of independent leviathans running around with their individual agendas taking advantage of situations like these. </p>

<p>Some of the more common themes among the more domineering and less noble of these leviathans are the &quot;divide and conquer&quot; and the &quot;rule by fear&quot; themes.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t have to be a planned event for the vermin to make it into a feast. </p>

<p>Although some of these leviathans definitely appear to take a more active role in creating these situations some times, either leaving foreshadowy clues in or taking inspiration from pop culture. The Aurora and Sandy Hook batman connection. </p>

<p>No, it does not. The more united I am with you, the more you drag me down and drain my power.</p>

<p>Do you understand that most people have no interest in &quot;uniting&quot; with you? In fact, I&#39;d dare to say that most people don&#39;t want anything to do with you. </p>

<p>In fact, maybe we should all &quot;unite&quot; - against <strong>you</strong> - ever thought of that?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You see, we don&#39;t want <strong>you</strong> to control us.</p>

<p>There is no &quot;we&quot; here. I think you are missing the point completely.</p>

<p>Your notion that we should all &quot;drop our difference and unite&quot; is EXACTLY what the &quot;powers that be&quot; want. That&#39;s why the big corporations push globalism, multi-culturalism, interracialism, anti-racism, and open borders.</p>

<p>Your type are useful idiots playing into their hands.</p>

<p>No, I expect the moderators to remove it, as it breaks the rules and is nothing but a childish rant you spewed out because not only do you not have any counter-argument, you likely can&#39;t even comprehend the point.</p>

<p>So you have just a bunch of glittering generalities about &quot;united&quot; and getting &quot;past our difference&quot; and when you are confronted with someone who doesn&#39;t buy that idiocy, you have no retort other than long, profane screeds of ad-hom.</p>

<p>It&#39;s amusing that you used &quot;pre-teen&quot; as an insult, that suggests to me you are quite insecure about your age and lack of experience. Perhaps you should learn a little bit more before trying to sit at the grown-ups table.</p>

<p>And you did have quite an emotional reaction there. You are so insecure about your ideas of &quot;uniting&quot; and &quot;getting past our differences&quot; even the slightest bit of disagreement sends you into spasms of rage and anger.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not what communists and globalists have been promoting. They want to break up nations, families, cultures, peoples and turn them into a homogenized mass of consumer/proles.</p>

<p>I mean, obviously, they dress it up in flowery language, but the reality is is that these proles never had the &quot;means of production&quot; therefore they aren&#39;t &quot;reclaiming&quot; anything.</p>

<p>Instead, &quot;the elites&quot; use these useful idiots to destroy any organic social organizations.</p>

<p>If this was really about class you wouldn&#39;t find progressive leftists spewing nothing but hatred for the white working class. See - just about every thread on reddit from a progressive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually I think you&#39;ve conflated your terms. I think you meant to say that capitalist globalists have been promoting this consumer-culture homogenization. </p>

<p>Of course, this only makes sense, because capitalists have long ago coopted the name of communism,</p>

<p>What is a prole? I&#39;ve never before read this term.</p>

<p>You are correct in debunking the myth of reclaiming ownership of the means of production. Ownership is a capitalist notion that needs to be redefined to coexist with a communist world. The indigenous peoples of this Earth didn&#39;t own anything before we reduced everything to capital and various individuals claimed everything.</p>

<p>Really what we should be more on about is simply removing centralized hierarchies from our societies than on redistributing everything. Fuck off with a centralized government fixing anything. Let the people fix things themselves.</p>

<p>No, there is no &quot;we.&quot; Essentially, no one outside of your progressive cult is interested in communism, &quot;removing centralized hierarchies&quot; or the rest of this outdated blather. Really, the 1860s called, they want their Marxism back.</p>

<p>Just read any progressive lefty website, you will find nothing but hatred and contempt for the white working classes.</p>
