    <div class="md"><p>Yes and as I said that force is energetic input.</p>

<p>Entropy is just a measure for disorder. Chemical reactions usually just tend to go towards the side with the highest entropy because that&#39;s the most spontaneous. That doesn&#39;t mean the reactions can&#39;t be turned around.</p>

<p>Cells do experience the effect of increasing entropy. It&#39;s what you call aging. The thing is, the body is able to slow this down a ton because it can renew and repair it&#39;s cells. Obviously this costs energy and the cells get that from the food you consume.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Exactly. There is a force called Entropy that takes everything from Order to Disorder. The current explanation for evolution is that magically/randomly all these particles just happened to bump into each other and form life. It&#39;s ridiculous. Randomness is mathematically impossible and does not exist. When you hear a scientist say &quot;Random Mutation&quot; that is no different than saying &quot;God did it&quot; because there&#39;s equal proof for God as there is for Randomness... 0.</p>

<p>In my opinion, there must be a natural force (exactly like Gravity or Entropy) that is moving in the opposite direction of Entropy. This is Entelechy and what Schopenhauer called &quot;The Will&quot;. If you are interested in that I would suggest checking out &quot;The Principle of Sufficient Reason&quot; by Schopenhauer.</p>

<p>Does this explain how an Ape changes into a man? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>When grass started to take over and reduced tree density, apes were forced to traverse through flat land in order to find food as the distances between trees in Africa grew larger and larger. Apes that learned to stand more and more upright were better at spotting prey and predators, our ancestors (which were <em>not</em> modern day apes) were those that eventually spended most of their time on the ground. Those same ancestors eventually learned to develop tools, social structure, and language, those that didn&#39;t did not survive as well. The most intelligent of those early humans went on to dominate the planet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>? Does this explain how a fish stands up and walks?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, today there are fish that are able to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJLCSsnhLFc">walk on land with their fins</a>. Fish that were able to do this for short periods of time had a unique evolutionary advantage in both finding food on land, and being able to crawl back into the water should they find themselves beached on land. Modern day mammals evolved from those that eventually spent most of their time on land, and those developed more advanced appendages.</p>

<p>It is random in the sense that reproduction produces unpredictable advantages that may or may not be beneficial, those with beneficial mutations are able to reproduce and pass on those traits more than those without them. Evolution is determined by those that survive, not random chance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s just not fully explained.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is why our scientists are using all available information in order to improve our understanding of evolution. There is significantly more evidence supporting evolution than refuting it, which is why 99.9% of the community supports evolution, and the 0.1% often benefit from religious groups that have everything to lose from scientific evidence and evolution proving their religious texts wrong.</p>

<p>So if evolution is this long gradual process then shouldn&#39;t there be tons of half-fish, half-lizard type animals? Where are all the gradation species in between the classic fish and the walking animal that they evolved into?</p>

<p>Furthermore, the appearance of appendages you think is due to Random Mutations right? There is no such thing as randomness. The idea that fish could flop around on their stomachs long enough until - BAM! - Wow. Now one of them have feet! And that was random.... It&#39;s ridiculous. </p>

<p>Feet on fish is NEW INFORMATION added to their DNA. Randomness does not exist. You keep insisting that evolution is some long and gradual process, evolutionary biologists have already shown this is wrong. This is an excerpt from the Journal of Nature by a biologist named David Reznick:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Darwin anticipated that microevolution would be a process of continuous and gradual change. The term macroevolution, by contrast, refers to the origin of new species and divisions of the taxonomic hierarchy above the species level, and also to the origin of complex adaptations, such as the vertebrate eye. Macroevolution posed a problem to Darwin because his principle of descent with modification predicts gradual transitions between small-scale adaptive changes in populations and these larger-scale phenomena, yet there is little evidence for such transitions in
nature. Instead, the natural world is often characterized by gaps, or discontinuities. One type of gap relates to the existence of &#39;organs of extreme perfection&#39;, such as the eye, or morphological innovations, such as wings, both of which are found fully formed in present-day organisms without leaving evidence of how they evolved.&quot;-- Reznick, David N., Robert E. Ricklefs. 12 February 2009. Darwin&#39;s bridge between microevolution and macroevolution. Nature, Vol. 457, pp. 837-842.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are proposing the &quot;Classic Sweep&quot; formulation of Evolution. It has been thoroughly debunked already.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll let the evolutionary biologist David Reznick respond. This is an excerpt on the topic from the Journal of Nature vol 457:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Darwin anticipated that microevolution would be a process of continuous and gradual change. The term macroevolution, by contrast, refers to the origin of new species and divisions of the taxonomic hierarchy above the species level, and also to the origin of complex adaptations, such as the vertebrate eye. Macroevolution posed a problem to Darwin because his principle of descent with modification predicts gradual transitions between small-scale adaptive changes in populations and these larger-scale phenomena, yet there is little evidence for such transitions in
nature. Instead, the natural world is often characterized by gaps, or discontinuities. One type of gap relates to the existence of &#39;organs of extreme perfection&#39;, such as the eye, or morphological innovations, such as wings, both of which are found fully formed in present-day organisms without leaving evidence of how they evolved.&quot;-- Reznick, David N., Robert E. Ricklefs. 12 February 2009. Darwin&#39;s bridge between microevolution and macroevolution. Nature, Vol. 457, pp. 837-842.</p>

<p>Also, I am genuinely interested in your link and I would like more info. Do you have links with pics to these fossils? I want to see them because your link talks about &quot;evograms&quot; almost in a theorectical way. There&#39;s only one line about finding fossils of &quot;evograms&quot; that had turned to &quot;tetrapods&quot; 300 million years ago. Seeing pictures of these fossils would be very persuasive. </p>

<p>I also went to Rational Wiki to find a list of transitional species of animals. This is what it says: <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_transitional_forms">http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_transitional_forms</a></p>

<p>Right. But as of yet, there is no explanation.

<p>No it doesn&#39;t. It explains it using a concept that has no basis in reality. There is absolutely no difference between saying &quot;God did it&quot; and &quot;Random mutations did it&quot;. Why? Because there is just as much evidence for the existence of God as there is for Randomness.</p>

<p>For example, say for whatever reason (chemicals, radiation, whatever) the average height for humans slowly continues to grow until some point in the future nearly every human is 10 feet tall. For what we consider &quot;human&quot; today, being 10 feet tall is impossible. But if that&#39;s the new norm (without surgery or artificial enhancements), are they still considered human, or the same type of human as today&#39;s humans that has an average height less than 6 feet?

<p>This is microevolution caused by natural selection. I agree that this is happening. But this doesn&#39;t explain how a human could turn into a completely new and different species.</p>

<p>Think of a fish. You think that slowly and gradual, over millions of years, it just grew legs, got out of the water and walked right? That would mean there had to be some &quot;random mutation&quot; that gave it fully formed lungs so it could breath on dry land. That would mean thered have to be another &quot;random mutation&quot; at the same time so it could walk around and collect food. Where are the half-fish, half-lizard fossils? Where are the &quot;transitional&quot; animal fossils that have both fins and feet? They don&#39;t exist. </p>

<p>What you&#39;re describing is microevolution caused by natural selection and its correct. The current way that macroevolution is explained is by &quot;random mutation&quot;. Randomness does not exist. My only point is that there is no sufficient explanation for macroevolution yet. &quot;Randomness&quot; is an unacceptable answer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re misunderstanding my point. There is no difference between micro- and macro-evolution. &quot;Macroevolution&quot; is an artificial line drawn by scientists when enough mutations have accumulated (when the microevolution has progressed past a certain point in your terms) that there is a distinction between the two species. </p>

<p>Like, there&#39;s nothing genetically different between a human today growing to be 10 feet tall and a hypothetical future where all humans are 10 feet tall. The difference is that the one today wouldn&#39;t be considered a new species because it&#39;s an abnormality caused by a mutation. In the hypothetical future, all humans have this mutation and it&#39;s normal for those humans. But what we consider &quot;human&quot; today don&#39;t have it, so it&#39;d make sense to draw that distinction (label as separate species) between current humans and future 10 feet tall humans. </p>

<p>Also, &quot;random mutation&quot; is not truly random, you&#39;re right about that. There is a probability for all mutations to occur. Some are more probable than others (the mutation that causes Down&#39;s Syndrome is much more common than the one that allows someone to be 9 feet tall [current record height] for instance). Whether the mutation happens or not is not random, but there&#39;s so many factors and variables that in <em>practical</em> terms, it&#39;s up to chance. But it&#39;s not 100% random, which is why we can do site-directed mutagenesis and &quot;guide&quot; mutations in cells with a good degree of reliability. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Divergence pushes lineages apart, and extinction erases the bridge that once joined them, creating the appearance of discontinuity. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s an interesting article, but it&#39;s a review of Darwin&#39;s views on how micro- and macro-evolution interact, not a definitive study on evolution. <em>On the Origin of Species</em> was published in 1859, and is not representative of the last 150 years of research.</p>

<p>Reznick concludes: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Understanding macroevolution requires the integration of ecology, evolution and the role of history in shaping the diversification or decline of lineages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Darwin had a start on evolution, but didn&#39;t have the context or tools that we have today. There&#39;s some debate about macroevolution, but it&#39;s about details, not whether it occurs or not. What Reznick is saying in his conclusion is that while extinction events tell part of the story, it&#39;s the things that are harder to find and study (population regulation, single-species extinctions, rapid diversification in a limited area) that would be more useful. But by their very nature they&#39;re very difficult to study (good luck finding the exact skeletal remains you need from tens of millions of years ago when all you have is a general region of a continent) or don&#39;t leave much trace at all (how are we supposed to discover the population changes from tens of millions of years ago when all we can find are parts of skeletons that may or may not have lived in that time period?).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Short answer: we&#39;re not sure why. Small simple things started no longer being simple, became complex, and snowballed from there. It&#39;s not entirely known how, but over billions of years (long fucking time), complex cells formed and all that splitting turned into tiny creatures.</p>

<p>How this happened is like the primordial ooze that had the goldilocks combination of chemicals to create life. Again, we don&#39;t know why, otherwise we&#39;d know why Earth is special. We just know, based on Earth having liquid water and all life needing water, that water is important.</p>

<p>The not totally outside theory is that whatever jump started this process possibly didn&#39;t originate here and arrived back when Earth was still being bombarded by meteors, which might have been carrying small life forms from elsewhere. Again, a theory not entirely dismissed by mainstream science, since we just don&#39;t know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A law such as 2nd law of thermo makes a statement about a closed system, what happens inside some boundary.  No matter how big or small you draw that boundary, no matter how many systems enclose other systems, each closed system must obey the 2nd law.  So for example, Sun-plus-Earth system has to obey the law.  But an open system, such as the Earth receiving sunlight through a boundary around it, does not obey the law because you&#39;re not accounting for the entropy increase in the Sun.</p>

<p>Sure, take the whole universe as one closed system.  Entropy can decrease in some places (Earth, or life, for example), while increasing overall.  At the boundary, the law holds true.</p>

<p>when they are in fact fundamentally identical.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No they are not. David Reznick, an evolutionary biologist, has this to say on the matter in the Journal of Nature vol 457:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Darwin anticipated that microevolution would be a process of continuous and gradual change. The term macroevolution, by contrast, refers to the origin of new species and divisions of the taxonomic hierarchy above the species level, and also to the origin of complex adaptations, such as the vertebrate eye. Macroevolution posed a problem to Darwin because his principle of descent with modification predicts gradual transitions between small-scale adaptive changes in populations and these larger-scale phenomena, yet there is little evidence for such transitions in
nature. Instead, the natural world is often characterized by gaps, or discontinuities. One type of gap relates to the existence of &#39;organs of extreme perfection&#39;, such as the eye, or morphological innovations, such as wings, both of which are found fully formed in present-day organisms without leaving evidence of how they evolved.&quot;-- Reznick, David N., Robert E. Ricklefs. 12 February 2009. Darwin&#39;s bridge between microevolution and macroevolution. Nature, Vol. 457, pp. 837-842.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the vertebrate eye is the result of a &quot;long slow gradual&quot; process, where are all the transitional species of animals with half-formed eyes? Shouldn&#39;t there be all sorts of species in the intermediate process of evolving eyes? Why haven&#39;t we ever found a species of animal that doesn&#39;t have a half formed eyeball?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You mischaracterized randomness</p>

<p>You think Randomness exists? If every cause has an effect and every effect is the result of a cause, how does &quot;randomness&quot; interject into this process?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol I love seeing this argument over and over... Its not like apes suddenly turned into humanoids, there was a long And gradual shift of genes in a species. Ie: there is a type of muscle that dangles flesh outside its shell. This flesh resembles the prey of a larger fish. The muscle reproduces by attracting the larger fish by flicking the flesh, and when the fish gets close it sprays its offspring into its gills, where they grow for a while. So did this reproducing tactic come about randomly? No! The muscles that had the flesh that more closely resembled the prey were more likely to attract the larger fish, and had a greater opportunity to reproduce, thereby passing down its traits to the next generation. The new generation however, due to random mutation (I explained how its not actually random iin a previous response above) will have variations in their genes. If one of these offsprings has a trait that more closely resembles the prey than its parents, then that offspring And its offspring will be more likely to reproduce and make more offspring with better traits And so on. Also... I&#39;m pretty sure the vegetable corn was man made through evolution... Lol just look at dog breeds, different breeds of animals but of the same species.</p>

<p>This is called the &quot;Classic Sweep&quot; formulation of Evolution. It has been entirely debunked. David Reznick is an Evolutionary Biologist and here&#39;s his response to this argument (Excerpt from the Journal of Nature Vol 457):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Darwin anticipated that microevolution would be a process of continuous and gradual change. The term macroevolution, by contrast, refers to the origin of new species and divisions of the taxonomic hierarchy above the species level, and also to the origin of complex adaptations, such as the vertebrate eye. Macroevolution posed a problem to Darwin because his principle of descent with modification predicts gradual transitions between small-scale adaptive changes in populations and these larger-scale phenomena, yet there is little evidence for such transitions in
nature. Instead, the natural world is often characterized by gaps, or discontinuities. One type of gap relates to the existence of &#39;organs of extreme perfection&#39;, such as the eye, or morphological innovations, such as wings, both of which are found fully formed in present-day organisms without leaving evidence of how they evolved.&quot;-- Reznick, David N., Robert E. Ricklefs. 12 February 2009. Darwin&#39;s bridge between microevolution and macroevolution. Nature, Vol. 457, pp. 837-842. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dr. Ben Carson is a famous neurosurgeon (who is now running for president) who does not believe in evolution. He&#39;s a highly religious Christian and so believes in intelligent design. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also in medical studies and find myself agreeing with you on the matter. From the tiniest subatomic particles to the massive planets and stars found in our universe, everything hints at a creative design. Just learning about all the insanely complex pathways found in our bodies whose precision determines if we live or die was enough to convince me. </p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to wrap our minds around how much is truly there, but we can absorb enough information to understand that life is too grand in scope to be just a stroke of random luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I meant to imply that the overall complexity of life when viewed at both minor and major scales combined with the delicate nature of this complex life is reason enough for me to believe that it was intelligently created. </p>

<p>Especially considering that as far as we know, life is exclusive to Earth. So incredibly rare and complex and beautiful.</p>

<p>I view the intricacies as signs of creative design. Everything just seems to fit in so neatly, almost in puzzle like fashion, and when you consider the amount of &quot;puzzle pieces&quot; needed to make life work it just seems like the logical assumption.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its not even close to a logical assumption, it is a cop-out. Your saying you don&#39;t know how something this complex could ever arise, so you make an uninformed guess that isn&#39;t backed by evidence. Your also making a HUGE assumption that we are the only life consider how infinetely massive the universe is, and that we may not even bee the only universe. Also, you have no evidence or data to back your opinion or to disprove the law so you have no voice in the community. You can have your beliefs, but without evidence that is just what they are, and I&#39;m not going to take your side when their is tons of evidence backing evolution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suggest you watch the video that i_saw_a_moose linked. The video itself is 2 hours long and it refutes the theory of Darwinian evolution from every possible angle. </p>

<p>Much of the scientific FACT that is stated in the aforementioned video are things that I learned from years of undergraduate study in Biochemistry and my further studies in medicine. If I were in fact &quot;copping out&quot; I would not have dedicated my time, energy, and money to pursue further learning. I would have stopped my pursuit of knowledge once I got my BS degree and found a job and settled down and had some kids or traveled or something. I&#39;m extremely passionate about finding the answers to life&#39;s hardest questions and it seems the more that I learn about biological processes and the world that we live in, the more at peace I feel about life&#39;s ultimate question. But it&#39;s critics like you who make me doubt my reasonings and so I strive to learn more and more, until I find myself at a point where the thought of life coming from anywhere but an intelligent designer would be ignorant. Because at that time, I would know better than that.</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t a conclusive answer, and there never will be, so we can debate over reddit until our fingers fall off, but without a solid answer there can&#39;t be a satisfying resolution for either side of the argument. All you can do is take what you know and form a reasonable answer to the unanswerable. And at this point in my studies and my life, I am leaning heavily towards the assumption that life had to be designed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that scientific laws are not fact, and that they can and should change with new evidence. I&#39;m at work and on mobile, could you possibly give me the big points or the quick version of the counter argument. I have no issue with intelligent design as long as its on the basis that the designer used evolution or what have you, to create everything. Once I started learning probabilities and physics, strng theory suggests that there are other universes, possibly infinite, if that&#39;s true, then every possibility will occur in these universes, and we are just in the jackpot universe because we have to be or else we couldn&#39;t exist. So my take away is that our reality is just a probability that had to happen somewhere and we just happen to be in it. That all these &quot;random&quot; occurances and coincidences is just a probability.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Back to your complex and beautiful life being a sign of intelligent design, rabbits have 2 stomacks. They partially digest their food, poop it out with extra exzymes on it, and then eat their feces to fully digest it and to get the rest of the nutrients. There is nothing beautiful, logical, or complex about that. Wouldn&#39;t it be more logical to assume that if it was intelligent design it would have been done differently</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Random&quot; is just part of one part of the theory of evolution.</p>

<p>The Theory of Evolution has three parts (variation, inheritance, selection). Variation involves changes from parent to offspring, inheritance involves the characteristics of that offspring being passed to its offspring, selection involves the environment acting to affect the reproductive success of organisms. (It&#39;s surprising how many people feel free to criticize the theory bitterly, without even knowing the definition of it.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a reply. 
It&#39;s a question that will never be answered. </p>

<p>There can be evolution and God. Everything is always evolving and evolution didn&#39;t just appear...there was some spark. </p>

<p>Some may call it God in it&#39;s many different words/forms that humans invented the definition of. </p>

<p>Eventually for myself, I figured it was better to spend my time knowing that I am here and what I can do to help our fellow humans, the planet and myself. That has been a lot more rewarding.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really not our/your job to ponder it.
It&#39;s mental gymnastics and seems interesting for a while.
I thought it was cool to look at the possibilities from all the different angles at one point in time.
But it&#39;s mental gymnastics that really doesn&#39;t provide value or worth. </p>

<p>The same questions will be asked as long as there are humans here.
Who made god, god...? Did evolution make God or vice versa?
It&#39;s the same circle jerk and the never-ending question that has been around since the beginning of time.</p>

<p>It all came from some where and evolved, and it&#39;s really not our business to analyze it. However we got here, we all know in our heart the right thing to do. 
Quiet the mind and stay true to what your heart says, and it all works out just fine.</p>

<p>Best of luck with your schooling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its because you aren&#39;t denying a theory, your denying a scientific law. Its called &quot;the law of evolution&quot; which is pretty much a theory that is agreed apon by the scientific community. Its not wrong to question things and try to disprove things, but you need cold hard facts to disprove a scientific law, and it becomes aggravting when creationists think that their beliefs or what they THINK the correct answer to be beats out scientists research and data that was PEER REVIEWED (other scientists studied their work just to try and disprove it but could not). And then you run into situations where logical falicies are presented to try and break your case... Like the one about the 2 bath and 3 bedroom townhouse above... But it is your right to question, so please ask away sincerely and I will respectfully answer as best I can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not &quot;taboo&quot;, it&#39;s just that evolution has been questioned scientifically and honestly for 150+ years now, and confirmed and explored in countless ways.  So new &quot;questioning&quot; these days generally comes from religious or conspiracy people, not from scientists or honest seekers of truth.  The honest people read the evidence and see how solid it is.  The deniers bring up tired old arguments that have been refuted long ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes this point exactly. It becomes infuriating when your met with logical fallacies, disproved arguementS, and just peoples religious beliefs day in and day out, when the theory was scrutinized so hard for so long but was never debunked, and then when the ENTIRE scientific community agrees apon it but people still have their doubts... If you have evidence or a sound counter theory then by all means let&#39;s discuss away, but you need to be on the ball to disprove a scientific law.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just.... I&#39;m so sorry the education system failed you so miserably... organs weren&#39;t created all at once, or because the organism &quot;wanted&quot; them. These traits were refined and changed over countless generations, and the traits that made reproduction more PROBABLE were more likely to be passed down and or altered. So to your example above: I&#39;m trying to protect myself from a toxic rain that happens every night. IM lucky enough to have a roof. I place it over my head and am shortly protected. I have enough time to have a child, but the rain pools under me due to a lack of walls and I die. My child has a roof whose sides of the roof hang down and create a wall. He stays dry and has a child. Unfortunately, some nights are windy and the roof and walls get blown over due to lack of foundation. My child dies. My grandchild, was born with a sound foundation however, along with both a roof and walls. He is safe and can live a long life. Because of his safe foundation, he attracts more mates than those without a foundation, and has more and more children. Some may not survive, but more of his children will survive. After about 3000million years, over the generations the roof, wall foundation building animal thing developed rooms. Offspring with 3 bedrooms and 2 baths were more favorable mates, and eventually all the species of townhouses had 2 bath organs and 3 bedroom organs along with the very old organs of a roof, walls, and foundation...</p>

<p>Same with chemistry.  There are rules about which elements will form molecules with which other elements.  Rules about what kinds of molecules can attach to the polymer backbone of an RNA or DNA molecule.  It&#39;s far from random.</p>

<p>Suppose you take some huge number (who knows, 10<sup>50</sup> ? or is that too big ?) of atoms and let them bang around against each other in space or on Earth.  Very quickly you&#39;d get simple molecules (H2O, NH3, CH4, CO2, etc).  Every now and then, some of those would bang together and form an amino acid such as such as glycine, NH2CH2COOH.  And so on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think religion exists because of human nature.  We are social animals, our brains are wired to see patterns and to come up with narratives.  And we fear the same painful things: loss of parents, death, lack of control.  So we invent a new, super-parent in the sky.  We come up with a story that death isn&#39;t really death, you just pass over to a different, better place.</p>

<p>Sure, religion is a &quot;huge part of human history&quot;.  But that doesn&#39;t mean that any of the supernatural beliefs in religion (god, soul, afterlife) actually are true.</p>

<p>Yes, I say ZERO good evidence that any god exists.  Can you give me a single solid piece of evidence, other than &quot;lots of people have believed religion&quot; ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not how evolution works. Also, there is no energy input in your example and obviously your screws aren&#39;t procreating.</p>

<p>Evolution goes a bit like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Because of incorrect DNA replication or DNA damage by for example radiation, new traits might appear in organisms.</p></li>
<li><p>These traits (phenotype) are caused by the organism&#39;s altered genome (DNA, genotype)</p></li>
<li><p>Some traits turn out to have a negative impact on the organism&#39;s survival and chances to spread their genes to the next generation. Organisms with this negative trait will die earlier and will not be able to give a copy of their DNA that causes the trait to the next generation. Because of this, the trait will (partly) disappear from the gene pool.</p></li>
<li><p>Then there are the useful traits: they increase the organisms chances to survive and it&#39;s chances to pass the trait to the next generation because they end up becoming father or mother of more youngs than average. These positive traits will become more and more prominent in the species untill all of the organisms in that species have the trait.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I was going to type out a big answer, but as you said your believe in the evolution theory depended on it I decided to look for a good explanation online. I found <a href="http://ideonexus.com/2012/02/12/101-reasons-why-evolution-is-true/">this</a>. It&#39;s not a huge text that nobody would want to read, but it&#39;s a great compilation of what scientists have discovered and what we know.</p>

<p>The thing is, with the scientific method: the scientific consenus will never claim it&#39;s the truth. There is no 100% certainty in science and that&#39;s what makes it so damn good: it&#39;s open for debate and if shown sufficient evidence, scientists will change their opinion. The scientific consensus is our current, best possible understanding. </p>

<p>As you can see, it isn&#39;t just wildly accepting something extremely complex. It&#39;s based on tons and tons of evidence and research. </p>

<p>The reason people who believe in God or people who try to push intelligent design aren&#39;t believed, is not because scientists are hardcore atheists, but because these people simply can&#39;t come up with any better evidence for their claims. The idea thag God created these things isn&#39;t based on the scientific method, but on a lack of understanding of the evolution theory and the evidence behind it.</p>

I hope i didn&#39;t lead you to think that, as a person who believes in creation, that it means I disregard science. That is the furthest from the truth.

    <div class="md"><p>Its actually extremely logical. Its not like structures just formed, they were shaped over millions of years while the organisms underwent millions of different factors. And yes... It is pure chance in the sense that traits that were favorable made the organism more likely to survive, and therefore more PROBABLE to reproduce and pass traits down. Mutations cause variations. These can increase the PROBABILITY to reproduce and pass down the better traits And so on... So really, your looking at the results of millions of years of slight changes that increased the probability to survive and reproduce.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take the tin foil hat off. You are correct in a way. We saw science currupted by the tobacco industry and the war on drugs, but whose agenda is evolution serving? Also, when you talking about scientific laws these scientists are already going to be well established and are going to be trying to make a name for themselves by solving these problems. They are going to be influenced by the need to have sound data to be able to stand up and make an argument to their peers, or else another peer will come along, disprove their theory and they loose their name in the history/science books along with whatever awards they dreamed of achieving. Not everything is smoke in mirrors, but I do agree that in some cases science has been known to be corrupted. But what you see in those cases is shady evidence that IS disputed, but for whatever reason never seems to die. BUT it is much different with scientific law then with theory. Scientific laws are going to make a huge name for the founder, along with awards. It will also have to stand up to the scrutiny of the community because it will have to be universally accepted, and there is always going to be that other guy trying to disprove you because he wants to be right and to win the glory, so the data and evidence is going to be disputed until found to be sound. If you wish to dispute the LAW of Evolution, please submitt your research and data to be published and the community will review it.

    <div class="md"><p>Macro evolution promotes a very clear agenda in terms of social Darwinism.  The idea that we, as a society, started off stupid and we&#39;re becoming smarter as we go along.  We know that ancient societies had technology we don&#39;t understand.  We know they made structures we can&#39;t replicate today.  The gap could be accounted for due to the dark ages and the destruction of old knowledge, but the point still stands.  Our civilization isn&#39;t really evolving.  Most of the social changes praised as &quot;progressive&quot; are just throw backs to the old Roman and Babylonian types of societies.</p>

<p>This might be going off into something you think is too kooky, but it&#39;s also being used to promote homosexuality/transgenderism.  Listen to an Obama speech about gay marriage and see how many times he mentions society &#39;evolving&#39;.  There&#39;s this ignorant idea that rejecting homosexuality is archaic people unable to accept change.  Most of the ancient world openly engaged in homosexuality to some pretty strange extremes.  I&#39;ve heard people attribute homosexuality to human evolution.  Nature&#39;s population control so to speak.  I think it&#39;s either a cover up for things like BPA (a chemical released from plastics that&#39;s shown to disrupt male sexual developement.  In rats and monkeys it causes males to act like females, engage in homosexual acts, and leaves the females completely uninterested) or it&#39;s part of a larger agenda to push homosexuality on people.  They may be doing this for population control or they might just want people to have this perversion.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not wearing a tin foil hat, I upgraded to full on tin foil plate armor.  I&#39;m pretty sure that the whole stage set up by the mainstream media is a show.  The presidents are decided behind closed doors and do what the real leaders tell them.  The textbooks are designed to promote their agendas.  The scientists that challenge evolution are slandered, shamed, and shunned while the powers that be hold up evolution as peer reviewed and irrefutable.  How much do you really know about macro evolution outside the government approved textbooks?  I&#39;m not saying it can&#39;t be true, but I&#39;m skeptical.  It&#39;s being pushed on us left and right by the media and that sends up my red flags.</p>

Nobody is trying to make you gay they are just trying to make you tolerant of other gays because nothing they do is wrong... Homophobia makes it hard for people to accept themselves when they finally come out, because they feel loke there is something wrong with them when they really have no controll... Do i think gays are weird? Sometimes, but i really dont give a shit who bangs who as long as it is consentual... Why are you so concerned with what another man does with his penis? And outside of govt approved textbooks there are reputable magazines, scholarly articles, fossil records, thousands apon thousands of scientists who steadfastly agree with evolution...

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, I&#39;m very chill.  You asked what agenda evolution could have and I gave an answer.  I wasn&#39;t talking about Obama calling homosexuality human evolution.  I understand his meaning well, I was just pointing out his diction. The idea of gay evolution is one that I&#39;ve heard many other people express, as I said, as a natural population control.  I know a lot of gay people.  What they do really doesn&#39;t concern me but the thing is that there&#39;s definitely an agenda in the media.  It isn&#39;t just coincidence that Bruce Jenner becomes a woman and they give him a TV show.  Dude made $100mil over his whole life as Bruce, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/caitlyn-jenner-richer-kardashians-experts-article-1.2244402&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;frm=1&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;sa=U&amp;amp;ved=0CCwQFjAHahUKEwij1JajyY_HAhVIGz4KHacUCEE&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHYTRyjXvtDZ-gmVbn730SLci2r3Q">as Caitlyn he&#39;s lined to make $500mil over the next 5 years</a>.  So brave.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t blame you for not questioning.  6 months ago I would&#39;ve thought it what I&#39;m saying is crazy.  I thought people that talked about Social Darwinism were religious nuts that were scared we were gonna start killing poor people or something.  I thought people that were against gay marriage were just &quot;right wing homophobes&quot;.  You have to look at the picture very broadly before it starts coming into focus.  The problem with trusting the science put forward by the government/corporations is that there are plenty of examples of the them hiding and omitting finds they don&#39;t want known.  They pick and choose the stories that get printed in the paper.  They pick and choose which articles get published.  They give publicity to the people they like.</p>

<p>They do.  All the time.  They&#39;re the &quot;nutcases&quot; that you dismiss without taking the time to research.  There are articles and books all over the place about it.  Again, you won&#39;t see it advertised on mainstream media like Richard Dawkins, and most people are conditioned to reject it outright.  They leave the scrutiny out of the textbooks and people cheer them on for it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re the one that needs growing up.  I&#39;m just sharing info with you and you&#39;re acting like it&#39;s a personal attack.  At the end of the day you believe whatever you want to.</p>

You religious nuts are all the same. Have no idea what your talking about, but are stubborn as mules (you gotta be part ass) when it comes to your own beliefs. Dude, I used to be super religious but then science opened up my eyes: real talk: dad died before I was 7. I watched a horrible disease consume him until he asked the doctor for extra morphine and never woke up. I was 7... This made me the most hard core religious but. But I&#39;m a smart guy, and I saw through the lies. Anybody who can think logically can see the truth. Good luck to you friend and may you find peace knowing that there is nothing after death, only the void. </p>

<p>This in no way addresses how a fish &quot;randomly&quot; could grow legs and lungs at the same exact time in order to breath and collect food. It in no way addresses the fact that there is NO fossil evidence for &quot;transitional species&quot;. Here&#39;s an excerpt from the Journal of Nature vol 457 on this exact problem: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Darwin anticipated that microevolution would be a process of continuous and gradual change. The term macroevolution, by contrast, refers to the origin of new species and divisions of the taxonomic hierarchy above the species level, and also to the origin of complex adaptations, such as the vertebrate eye. Macroevolution posed a problem to Darwin because his principle of descent with modification predicts gradual transitions between small-scale adaptive changes in populations and these larger-scale phenomena, yet there is little evidence for such transitions in nature. Instead, the natural world is often characterized by gaps, or discontinuities. One type of gap relates to the existence of &#39;organs of extreme perfection&#39;, such as the eye, or morphological innovations, such as wings, both of which are found fully formed in present-day organisms without leaving evidence of how they evolved.&quot;-- Reznick, David N., Robert E. Ricklefs. 12 February 2009. Darwin&#39;s bridge between microevolution and macroevolution. Nature, Vol. 457, pp. 837-842.</p>

<p>Separate groups of organisms belonging to the same species may adapt in different ways to better exploit diverse environments or resources. They also may evolve varied characteristics for attracting mates. That is, different groups evolve in different directions. Over time, these groups or populations may become so different that they can no longer breed together--separate species are formed.</p>

<p>This in no way addresses how a fish &quot;randomly&quot; could grow legs and lungs at the same exact time in order to breath and collect food. It in no way addresses the fact that there is NO fossil evidence for &quot;transitional species&quot;. Here&#39;s an excerpt from the Journal of Nature vol 457 on this exact problem: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Darwin anticipated that microevolution would be a process of continuous and gradual change. The term macroevolution, by contrast, refers to the origin of new species and divisions of the taxonomic hierarchy above the species level, and also to the origin of complex adaptations, such as the vertebrate eye. Macroevolution posed a problem to Darwin because his principle of descent with modification predicts gradual transitions between small-scale adaptive changes in populations and these larger-scale phenomena, yet there is little evidence for such transitions in nature. Instead, the natural world is often characterized by gaps, or discontinuities. One type of gap relates to the existence of &#39;organs of extreme perfection&#39;, such as the eye, or morphological innovations, such as wings, both of which are found fully formed in present-day organisms without leaving evidence of how they evolved.&quot;-- Reznick, David N., Robert E. Ricklefs. 12 February 2009. Darwin&#39;s bridge between microevolution and macroevolution. Nature, Vol. 457, pp. 837-842.</p>
