<p>if is the president doesn&#39;t mean he is right.</p>

<p>if is a famous scientist doesn&#39;t mean he is right.</p>

<p>if is just some famous talkhead on tv, yes is most likely lying and deceiving you.</p>

<p>always check what they are presenting. what they are saying. check, analyze, research.</p>

<p>it is the rule, not the exception, that what the type of people listed above are presenting, are just lies to fool you.</p>

<p>binladen, crazy science, imaginary people in the sky, list goes on and on and on with each event one may chose to check</p>

<p>I mentioned the shills/gatekeepers</p>

<p>their roles is to enforce the lies those famous people tell.</p>

<p>there is a simple check to find out who the shills are:</p>

<p>they say you are wrong because the famous people said something different.</p>

<p>a person that is genuinely interested of the topic of discussion, will argue with facts, ideas, even if those are wrong.</p>

<p>the shill is not interested in the topic. is writing words to you because he was paid to do it.</p>

<p>When shit hits the fan, and people rise up against the government, I believe the mass media will pretend to be on our side. They will act like they are for the people, and they will still try to sway the public mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I stopped admiring &quot;a&quot; person for being part celebrity when I realized its not a prerequisite for integrity and morality. Acting is not as noble as people make it out to be. 
A person that forgets who he is and mimics fake emotions is not someone who is righteous.</p>

<p>This become apparent to me in the middle of the Kony 2012 campaign: 
Small african guy, Kony, leader of Lord&#39;s Resistance army, &quot;recruits children, gives them AK&#39;s.&quot;
When this campaign was deemed unsuccessful, actors Clooney and Rihanna went up-front in conferences for public support on yet another military intervention, now to stop children with AK47 with our superior M16 firepower. <em>Please intervene to kill these children with AKs.</em></p>

<p>This happened just as troops we&#39;re taking final leave on another failed invasion, on false-pretenses, Iraq war, leaving a destabilizes leaderless mess of a region.</p>

<p><strong>Celebrities, actors, singers</strong> should not be used to draw people into conflict, yet they did.
It&#39;s getting hard to find someone in the bussiness that has not sold-out &quot;his soul&quot; for either money, fame or a bit of power.</p>

<p>If you didnt notice a lot of celebrities opt-out of life by overdosing (Cobain, Ledger, Winehouse, R.Williams), while few have the power to cut the game before it gets bigger than them. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7b5hJ0G_9c&amp;amp;t=0m29s">Dave Chappelle</a> canceled a million-deal contract and flew to Africa for vacantion. He took a break from fame and huge money, just as his carreer was starting, to say NO to ideas that wasn&#39;t his, to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcY1FEVFLbg&amp;amp;t=2m04s">decadent and political drivel</a>. You barely hear from him nowadays, if you want to see what became of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eirBtt7wIDU">his show</a>, it was replaced with a more &quot;politicaly-correct&quot;  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3h6es6zh1c">K&amp;P</a> </p>
