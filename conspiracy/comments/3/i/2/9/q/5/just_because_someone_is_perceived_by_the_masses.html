      <p>
       if is just some famous talkhead on tv, yes is most likely lying and deceiving you.
      </p>
      <p>
       always check what they are presenting. what they are saying. check, analyze, research.
      </p>
      <p>
       it is the rule, not the exception, that what the type of people listed above are presenting, are just lies to fool you.

      <p>
       I mentioned the shills/gatekeepers
      </p>
      <p>
       their roles is to enforce the lies those famous people tell.
      </p>
      <p>
       there is a simple check to find out who the shills are:
      </p>
      <p>
       they say you are wrong because the famous people said something different.
      </p>
      <p>
       a person that is genuinely interested of the topic of discussion, will argue with facts, ideas, even if those are wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       the shill is not interested in the topic. is writing words to you because he was paid to do it.

       Also beware of disinfo agents. We will agree with 90% of their words, but they mix it in with 10% bullshit so it is hard for us to tell.

       When shit hits the fan, and people rise up against the government, I believe the mass media will pretend to be on our side. They will act like they are for the people, and they will still try to sway the public mind.

       Thing is, the journalism grunts are likely unaware or in denial about their participation in creating propaganda, so they will support other commoners until orders come down. Just saying it will be a real rough environment to try to sort disinfo from good info leaked by moles (until it is edited away).

       You're kinda preaching to the choir, man. Most people in this sub realize this. I guess it could be good for new comers, but shit from the new que rarely make it to the hot page. I'll upvote because hopefully those that need to see it do.

       I stopped admiring "a" person for being part celebrity when I realized its not a prerequisite for integrity and morality. Acting is not as noble as people make it out to be. 
A person that forgets who he is and mimics fake emotions is not someone who is righteous.

       This become apparent to me in the middle of the Kony 2012 campaign: 
Small african guy, Kony, leader of Lord's Resistance army, "recruits children, gives them AK's."
When this campaign was deemed unsuccessful, actors Clooney and Rihanna went up-front in conferences for public support on yet another military intervention, now to stop children with AK47 with our superior M16 firepower.
       <em>
        Please intervene to kill these children with AKs.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       This happened just as troops we're taking final leave on another failed invasion, on false-pretenses, Iraq war, leaving a destabilizes leaderless mess of a region.

       <strong>
        Celebrities, actors, singers
       </strong>
       should not be used to draw people into conflict, yet they did.
It's getting hard to find someone in the bussiness that has not sold-out "his soul" for either money, fame or a bit of power.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you didnt notice a lot of celebrities opt-out of life by overdosing (Cobain, Ledger, Winehouse, R.Williams), while few have the power to cut the game before it gets bigger than them.
