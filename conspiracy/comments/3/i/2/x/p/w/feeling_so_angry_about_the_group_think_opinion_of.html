        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>people are so naive about these psychiatric &quot;disorders&quot;. I tried to explain on another thread about how ADHD just refers to kids not paying attention in class and doesn&#39;t actually have a known physical basis. People postulate a dopamine imbalance theory, I explained that thats far more unlikely to be present in a child than psychosocial issues such as a harsh environment or bullying causing lack of concentration in class. I also pointed out how classrooms are not natural environments for children and so you&#39;d expect that a lot of them would act out against it, how children have a natural instinct to play.</p>

<p>I also directed them to studies showing how early environment affects the physical development of the brain and how a brain that stuggles to concentrate is almost certainly a product of a harsh environment, so to treat the problem the route cause should be investigated, they shouldn&#39;t just be given stimulants. </p>

<p>People come at me saying, oh my Son definitely has ADHD, you should see him when he&#39;s not on his medication, he drools and twitches, he&#39;s obviously ill! Then it goes away when they take their drugs! So I explained to them that their children are exhibiting withdrawal symptoms from ritalin, which anyone would experience if they suddenly came off the drug. They just ignore that because they think they know best because of what the doctor has told them. I could tell them I have a degree in Neuroscience to add credence to what I&#39;m saying but I like to try and convince people by getting them to understand, not just flashing credentials like doctors and psychiatrists do. </p>

<p>I also explained how if people did actually have unexplained dopamine imbalances, the absolute worst way of treating that would be to exacerbate the imbalance by taking a drug that causes synaptic dopamine levels to fluctuate wildly.</p>

<p>But people don&#39;t even respond to this logic, they just blank it. They&#39;ve been told something by some establishment figure, &quot;your son has a dopamine imbalance&quot;, </p>

<p>its just like how they still claim depression is a serotonin imbalance even though that has been disproven years ago, it helps them to explain why they&#39;re giving you SSRIS.</p>

<p>I just feel so frustrated that people won&#39;t even engage logically, preferring to just believe what they&#39;ve told by an authority figure, even if it doesn&#39;t make sense under close examinatiion.</p>

<p>I tell them to closely examine what they think and they just refuse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have ADHD/ADD, and I take Vyvanse for it.  It makes me feel like I think I should always feel and how I used to feel in high school/early college without medication.  I use my energy and focus to research real conspiracies, discuss them with you guys and in real life, and write my blog about them.  I do think that we are way overmedicated for several reasons, mainly profit and maybe to cause dependency and/or dumbing down/complactincy  of the population.  But at the same time, I think people, like myself, do have an actual problem with energy and focus.  In the couple of years before I began taking medication, I was aware of a problem developing in my attention span that wasn&#39;t previously there.  My mind would race at night and keep me awake, then during the day I couldn&#39;t engage in anything and didn&#39;t have the energy to even perform simple necessary tasks.  However, the underlying cause of this problem and its actual physiological properties are difficult to pin down.  </p>

<p>Our nationwide problems that are diagnosed as ADD/ADHD could come from a myriad of causes that all contribute in varying degrees.  I think some of these causes are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Diet.  Most people just don&#39;t eat right or even know what eating healthy means.  Massive amounts of sugar and other unhealthy additives essentially &quot;hijack&quot; our brains by getting the chemicals out of balance so we keep craving junk food.  This cycle robs us of essential nutrients our brains require to function optimally.</p></li>
<li><p>Poor sleep cycles.  Without a proper sleep routine, our brains can&#39;t perform the maintenance that goes on during a full night&#39;s sleep.  Disruptions in our normal sleep patterns are caused by numerous factors that weren&#39;t around 30+ years ago when ADD diagnoses were scarce.  Now our &quot;always on&quot; society makes us fear we might miss something important if we went to bed at 10 and woke up at 6 every day.  Additionally, all the blue light we get from our devices disrupts our natural melatonin production.</p></li>
<li><p>Constant distractions.  The capability of being connected to the entire world 24/7 provides literally millions of more distractions that weren&#39;t prevalent 30+ years ago.  No wonder we have more problems with attention because there&#39;s exponentially more to pay attention to and ever curious individuals like myself constantly fall into the trap of simply wanting to absorb some new tidbit of information.  This is what drives us to Reddit and drives girls to instagram (I hope my gf doesn&#39;t read this comment, lol)</p></li>
<li><p>Significant lack of exercise.  It&#39;s pretty easy to understand that the more you exercise, the more stamina you&#39;ll develop.  I think the proportion of people participating in actual stamina-building activities on a frequent enough basis for it to have a lasting impact is significantly lower than it used to be. We get everything delivered to our doors.  We drive to work or class and sit in traffic.  We sit at our computers at our desks or on our couches all the time.  There&#39;s so many shows and movies that the media makes you feel like you&#39;re missing out if you don&#39;t watch them.  So we now we have Netflix binges which didn&#39;t used to be a thing.</p></li>
<li><p>Unknowing consumption/exposure to harmful chemicals.  I think this one is huge.  Everyone should watch a documentary on Netflix called The Human Experiment.  Basically our current legislative system takes an &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; regarding possible harmful chemicals in the products we consume.  This is why breast cancer rates for women AND men have each risen 30% since industrial chemicals became the standard in all our products.  This means that you can&#39;t specifically blame it on birth control because it&#39;s happening to men as well. And it&#39;s happening most likely from something harmful we&#39;re ingesting without our knowledge.  We have no way of testing the several decades and generations of exposure to things like BPA in plastics without having several decades worth of data.  Therefore today&#39;s widely accept chemicals could be the next decade&#39;s BPA.  This is why you see TONS of commercials about &quot;has you or someone you know taken x medication and had serious side effects or death?&quot;  Our system is so corrupt that we&#39;ll constantly roll the dice with people&#39;s lives just to make more money, which is the real underlying cause if you ask me.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In conclusion, OP, I don&#39;t think your debate needs to be whether or not depression or ADD is caused by serotonin imbalance or whatever because it&#39;s not really relevant.  The fact is that due to a half century long amalgamation of negligence regarding the points I just mentioned, people, myself included, are having real problems paying attention and having what I&#39;d consider a normal energy level.  Because even though I take as many of these measures into my own hands as possible like eating right, trying to go to bed and wake up early, not drinking out of plastic containers, exercising every day, without my medicine, I&#39;m still an exhausted and distracted couch potato.  So instead of spreading the word about ADD not being real, I think you should redirect your efforts into telling people how corporations are allowed to put harmful chemicals into the things we consume for their own financial gain.  And how our poor decisions affect our health and the health of our children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your kind words! I&#39;m glad you enjoyed my thoughts. I&#39;ll give you the link for my blog, but I should preface it by saying that my blog is very much in its infancy. I only started it this summer as a way to preserve and organize my thoughts because I was getting frustrated with the slow pace of our long overdue revolution. Also I couldn&#39;t find anywhere that tries to tie all these issues we talk about in this sub together so that&#39;s my ultimate goal with my blog and to provide possible solutions to these problems. As far as sources go, I try to always link within my posts where I get my information. Misconceptions really piss me off so I try to spread as few as possible. Anyway, if you&#39;re still interested in taking a look at my [so far] sparse blog, it can be found at driggsreport.wordpress.com 
Any views or comments would be greatly appreciated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with most of your points, I think you understand very well what I&#39;m talking about. It basically all ties into the larger &quot;conspiracy&quot; of capitalism, that is that profit is king. The conspiracy aspect is that people are led to believe that the pharmaceutical industry is acting in their best interest, when in fact its main priority is profit. Maybe its second or third priority is people&#39;s wellbeing, but if there is profit to be made, that comes first. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the reason there are dangerous chemicals in food. That&#39;s the reason people eat harmful margarine to &quot;lower cholesterol levels&quot; and its also the reason there are dectectable levels of SSRIs and Estrogen contraceptive drugs in the water supply, enough to affect the behaviour of birds, and we&#39;re not told about it. In fact that may be another thing that is probably affecting people&#39;s brains.</p>

<p>Its also the reason I believe big pharma encourages people to believe they have problems with their brain that need to be fixed with medicine. I can&#39;t separate this from the wider problems I have with capitalist consumerist society, ritalin is just one of the things children are allowed to consume for someone&#39;s financial gain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Precisely.  The overwhelming majority of our problems are, in fact, just byproducts of this flawed everything-for-profit system that&#39;s been pounded into our heads for the last century that it&#39;s the best and only option.  Let&#39;s redouble our efforts into developing and promoting better alternatives.  I&#39;ve been thinking of making a sub called <a href="/r/createagoverment">/r/createagoverment</a> or something where people can post policy ideas and we can discuss their pros and cons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder if these designer drugs/clean amphetamines are intentionally made that way so to fuel the drug running operations of the FBI/CIA who seem to have some sort of arrangement going with the various drug cartels from other countries&#39;, namely the southern border of the US.</p>

<p>They legally give the population a taste for it, and convince everyone that there is something wrong with you if you have emotions... which is fucking scary. Acting human? You might have (X)!</p>

<p>Let&#39;s make you question your existence based on life struggles that the majority of the population goes through! Hush hush though, can&#39;t talk to your friends about what&#39;s going on, (the stigma of &#39;mental disorders,&#39; a stigma that arose at the same time as the rise of such diagnoses themselves), talk to your friendly doctor instead! Tell them the drugs your friends take/the drugs the TV said you should try for (X)!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Families with mothers or fathers with NPD (Narcissistic Personality Disorder) and/or BPD (Bipolar Personality Disorder) greatly affect their children&#39;s ability to function normally, both at school and at home. There are so many moving parts for a young boy growing up in a household with, say, a neurotic bitch mom and an enabling alcoholic father, for example.</p>

<p>Then, the boy can&#39;t sit still for some meaningless lecture from their boring-as-fuck female teacher, and the spiteful bitch of course fails him (it wouldn&#39;t ever be <em>her</em> fault). And, that&#39;s just the beginning.</p>

<p>Then, the teacher walks down to the school psychologist&#39;s office where they call the dysfunctional mother in to &quot;discuss the boy&#39;s problems&quot;. How convenient for them all, right? They can all absolve themselves from being failures in their roles by blaming him for some phantom disease, and Dr. SSRI Needle gets her free trip to Hawaii from the drug dealers as a pay-off.</p>

<p>The solution is to inject the boy with narcotics, sit back with a shit-smirk and observe him like a gaggle of creepy sadists with skirts and a rabid case of feminism. It&#39;s all so fucking disgusting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People very blindly accept whatever a doctor prescribes to them, it&#39;s kind of a disturbing trend I&#39;ve seen throughout my life. I think people are logical enough to fear harm to their children, but lack the critical analysis to question authority. A simple google search is really all it takes, a few hours out of your day to get a firm grasp on the fundamentals of pharmacology, but people rarely are willing to devote the time. </p>

<p>Personally, I have experienced this in my own way, in a story I&#39;d like to share with you, and get some thoughts from a neuroscientist like yourself. I am a recovering addict, and I&#39;ve been to quite a few rehabs in my day. I understand the concept of dual-diagnosis, and that addicts rarely ever only suffer from addiction. However, at every single rehabilitation facility I&#39;ve encountered, they hand out antipsychotics like it is fucking candy. I mean, you might think I&#39;m exaggerating for hyperbole, but I swear to god. I&#39;m talking about really potentially toxic drugs, that these doctors are signing off on these drugs without so much as a a background check on the patient. I&#39;m talking real antipsychotics. Stuff like Seroquel and Risperdal. Not to mention everybody is practically offered an array of SSRI&#39;s, SNRI&#39;s, and all of the other classic antidepressants. It&#39;s a pharmaceutical company&#39;s wet dream, I swear to god. Can you comment on this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It absolutely sickens me. </p>

<p>SSRIS are purported to work on depression because of the serotonin imbalance theory which has been proven to be wrong for the past 10 years.</p>

<p>Yet the general public still believes that theory. People get very aggressive about it when you question it because they want to believe they are ill. Maybe they think its easier that way.</p>

<p>its an absolute travesty that people are trusting doctors, who are really just pharmaceutical pushers, and that trust is being abused to destroy people&#39;s brains. I&#39;m not exaggerating, i&#39;ve heard anti psychotics being refered to as a &quot;chemical lobotomy&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The worst part was, the doctors really didn&#39;t so much as hint at how strong these medications are. In addition, they weren&#39;t used to treat specific disorders, rather to help symptoms like not being able to sleep, or feeling depressed. But depression is fucking normal when you&#39;re coming off of drugs, and here you are being offered anti-psychotics. I can&#39;t believe it. They wouldn&#39;t give you any opportunity to research or understand what drugs you were being offered, it&#39;s not like you have access to an internet connection in a rehab.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like the problem is the pharmaceutical industries influence within medicine. People generally trust doctors because they are there to help them. The problem is that doctors are influenced by pharma in many ways. Several years ago I was prescribed an SSRI. At the time I was very sceptical of a drug being the solution to my problem. I was depressed but I was quite certain that it was caused by my life circumstances at the time and my feelings of hopelessness towards the future. I had to visit my doctor to get a sick note for college and he heavily persuaded me to go on an SSRI. I don&#39;t believe he was being malicious. He genuinely thought that it was a safe and effective treatment. </p>

<p>Now, as I said I was very sceptical of the drugs ability to help me but you need to understand that when you are in that situation it is very difficult to go against doctors orders. When you know nothing about the field and your doctor as well as many scientists and regulators etc. have approved the drug and found it to be the best approach. You don&#39;t want to be like that person who puts off cancer treatment in favour of vitamin pills, do you? You&#39;re not anti-science are you? These are the thoughts that run through your mind. Even the most sceptical people in this situation will begin to doubt their own beliefs. Maybe I do have a chemical imbalance? Maybe all these clever scientists and doctors are right and I should try this treatment? What&#39;s the worst that could happen when the regulators have approved it for use?</p>

<p>So I don&#39;t think it is right to blame the patients in this case. I think the problem is very clearly medicine being broken. Good science does not take place and so doctors prescribe treatments that are ineffective and unsafe. It is very difficult for an ordinary member of the public to know this though. The whole point of evidence based medicine is that it is supposed to be backed by good robust science, that&#39;s why people have faith in it.</p>

<p>I do share your frustration at the apparent stockholm syndrome that many people on SSRIs seem to exhibit. Often they will go on a drug for a temporary life situation, then later when they try and stop the drug they will experience withdrawal symptoms. They then believe that this is actually the original problem returning and that they need to stay on the drug forever. They will then praise the drug as being life saving and become very angry if you criticise it. Ironically if they never started the drug in the first place they would most likely have recovered naturally over a few months and be completely fine drug free. However, now they have a dependence on a drug that was completely unnecessary in the first place. So the drug harmed them in a big way but they don&#39;t even know it and they actually praise the drug and believe it is wonderful.  </p>

<p>I feel like this problem is magnified by the embedding of the idea of many psychiatric disorders and their causes and treatments in our culture. In many ways the pharmaceutical industry has been successful at marketing these disorders to the point where they are now widely accepted. The first thing people ask if you mention psychological problems is &quot;are you on meds?&quot; like that is the go to treatment. Everyone has heard of ADHD and Social Anxiety Disorder. Even bipolar which was once a very rare condition is now frequently spoke of. Even the term &quot;mental illness&quot; itself implies that you have something biologically wrong. An illness that needs some sort of medical intervention. </p>

<p>I do feel rather depressed with the state of things. I feel like it will take something monumental to cause change. Many people have already died or been harmed significantly by the current paradigm. I&#39;m not sure what it will take... </p>

<p>When the consensus was that serotonin imbalance causes depression, which it was, about 10 years ago, a lay person with enough intelligence could have questioned that.

<p>You don&#39;t seem to understand what&#39;s going on here. I&#39;m not saying people shouldn&#39;t question scientific consensuses or work to improve the efficacy of scientific study, or harbor doubt about scientific consensuses. That&#39;s all fine, of course. But a consensus being problematic, alone, does not justify disbelieving it and definitely doesn&#39;t justify believing some contrary proposal. All I&#39;m saying is to tentatively accept and act in accordance with scientific consensuses in areas where you are a layperson.</p>

<p>So, you can provide me with all kinds of reasons a consensus might be problematic. But since I&#39;m a layperson, I can&#39;t meaningfully evaluate the impact (if any) of those particular potential problems. So I&#39;m gonna side with the consensus, tentatively.</p>

<p>You haven&#39;t given me any reason to do otherwise. Because there isn&#39;t any.</p>

<p>Brain homeostasis... same really..

<p>For example, (speaking from experience) chemistry 101. In the first year, you learn everything and more that an entire 5 years of high school chemistry teaches. Same is the case with languages. First year Japanese covered all of the five years of high school Japanese and more.</p>

<p>So what&#39;s the fucking point laboring away at a snail&#39;s pace during high school??? One would have been better off just reading a bunch of good literature and learning crafts and trades, things that actually take quite a lot of hands-on physical experience to master.

<p>You can learn things without studying them in college. Sure. I&#39;m good with that. But you can also easily be fooled by misinformation when you haven&#39;t studied a topic in that kind of educational/professional setting.</p>

<p>Where a topic is heavily disputed amongst experts, go ahead and study it yourself and form an opinion.

    <div class="md"><p>this wasn&#39;t written by me but by someone who has been diagnosed with ADD and it echoes my opinion: &quot; &quot;there are studies that conclude medication is more effective in this children.&quot; Studies funded by the billion-dollar pharmaceutical industry? Pharmaceutical company spending on marketing far exceeds that of its research budget—so don&#39;t take their research too seriously. Many doctors get thousands of dollars—often in the form of &quot;promotional payments&quot;—to offer their patients unremarkable drugs. In fact, research has proven that doctors prescribe more of these unremarkable drugs while under the influence of pharmaceutical marketing. The truth is, you, me, and Charles can speculate all day long about the causes of ADHD, but science does not know yet. Many techniques to correct the condition are being employed. I personally suffer from ADHD and I go back and forth on the subject. I&#39;ve taken Ritalin on and off (a common stimulant assumed or believed to correct ADHD). It does not correct attention deficit issues. All it does is give you energy—and so the burst of energy allows you to accomplish more. Patients confuse energy with &quot;focus on less interesting tasks&quot; and &quot;impulse reduction&quot; and &quot;calm inner restlessness&quot; and &quot;a fog clearing&quot; and &quot;a light switch being turned on.&quot; Like a religion, it&#39;s a &quot;belief&quot; that the drug is curing them (a placebo effect), but in fact, the same issues continue... More energy is undoubtedly helpful in our society.﻿&quot;</p>

<p>This is what is called a straw man argument.  It is a common form of argument by those who cannot stand on the merit of their own facts.  The straw man is an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent&#39;s argument, while actually refuting an argument which was not advanced by that opponent (ie: Google and YouTube for half an hour).

<p>I think you&#39;re right on the money with this.

<p>Well, I have to agree. It assumes that all children should have a natural predisposition to socially interact with large numbers of people their own age, in a world none of them really understands yet. I&#39;d like to see data proving this condition exists and that it is beneficial to development outside of the arbitrary confines we ourselves have put into place. You could easily flip it around, and say that without the interaction children are forced into at school, there would be no bullying or child-suicides, and that, for some children, it is precisely factors such as bullying which restrict their development as adults by destroying their confidence, which makes it extremely difficult for them to lead happy or fulfilled adult lives.</p>

<p>Not education. Indoctrination. That&#39;s what school is essentially about. It&#39;s about getting a bunch of really young people together and training them all to think in a certain way before they get old enough to think for themselves.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a conspiracy for you: </p>

<p>ADHD medication can be used as an &quot;off-label&quot; treatment for dissociative disorders. If someone had mild dissociation, it could be concluded that one has &quot;focus issues&quot;. I think some part of over-prescribed amphetamines is to cover up how much of a problem child abuse is, or, less conspiracy, doctors just don&#39;t know how to recognize dissociation and called it a new thing altogether. </p>

<p>Abuse is not the only reason a child would dissociate, keep in mind, and I&#39;m not saying this would extend to all cases, but ADHD-pi symptoms could be a case of derealization/ depersonalization. Or something like borderline personality if they are prone to dissociation and lashing out, which again, is a common diagnosis for someone who has undergone child abuse.</p>

<p>This is just speculation.</p>

I have over a dozen writing projects that I am working on; the only ones that get finished are the ones with an editor and a deadline, because like everyone else, I have bills to pay.

<p>Copypasta from further down the thread:</p>

<p>I was diagnosed with dyslexia, dysgraphia (my handwriting is shit and I guess its a &quot;real disorder&quot; lol), and ADHD in middle school. They put me on Ritalin and then Adderall. (I stopped taking them when I was 15)I&#39;m 23 now, I&#39;m on the Brain Grain diet and it works very well, Its basically gluten/soy/dairy free. Organic and non gmo. I have unlimited energy, my brain makes connections quicker, I just all around feel better and happier. I think ADHD is more a nutrition deficiency than anything. When I look at high school, I was drinking monsters, redbulls, eating fast food, etc etc. Garbage, no nutrients to my brain, only items that delivered instant gratification. Sugar, caffeine, amphetamines etc. people should really give this diet a try. Two weeks was all it took before I started seeing real change.</p>

<p>Its possible you could benefit from stimulants. There are lots of other things that would be better though without the side effects! Modern life is so full of distractions and worries that it is hard to pay attention to things. I think you&#39;re just mega stressed out. Your mind is trying to process too much at the same time. All these distractions are too much for you at the moment,  you need to relax, simplify things.  I think what you really need is to be a sous chef at a yoga resort in Bali for a while, clear your mind!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could not agree more. Most of the opinions people have on ADHD or depression drugs being required or good come simply from the doctor prescribing them, and then their children really do function better on them. </p>

<p>Of course your kid functions better on adderall, he&#39;s on fucking amphetamines, they make anyone focus better and pay attention more easily. That&#39;s not evidence that your kid has any particular disorder though, it&#39;s just evidence that amphetamines work to help focus, in anyone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of my friend&#39;s son was eventually diagnosed with ADHD.  He was not bullied in school.  His parents did not physically abuse him.  Instead, he was spoiled rotten.  </p>

<p>He learned at a young age that his mother would cave if he had a meltdown every time she told him &quot;no&quot; about something.  He got gifts on his cousin&#39;s birthdays so he would not feel left out.  Mom would do some of his homework  so he would not get angry if he could not play video games after school. As he got bigger, he would physically threaten his mom during his meltdowns.  </p>

<p>Mom took him to several doctors who suggested discipline and parenting classes.  She eventually found a doctor who agreed the problem was ADHD.  They got a prescription and her son now has some of the side effects from that medicine.  </p>

<p>His grandparents, other family members,  and I disagreed with the diagnosis because he did not behave like an ass-clown whenever we watched him without his mother around.</p>

<p>So I suspect this friend is not the only parent who accepts an ADHD diagnosis because a prescription is easier than parenting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you sure about that? My existing understanding was that the metabolism of excess dopamine released into the synapse by both amphetamine &amp; methamphetamine increased the production of free radicals beyond the capacity for them to be quenched by the existing mechanisms.</p>

<p>I think there might also be other mechanisms that promote that neurotoxicity, but I can&#39;t remember off the top of my head. In any case, just a quick <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=amphetamine+neurotoxicity">search on pubmed for amphetamine neurotoxicity</a> yielded countless titles talking about this very phenomenon.</p>

<p>I have a feeling you might be thinking about cocaine, which isn&#39;t AFAIK neurotoxic. Cocaine works not by releasing dopamine but by blocking its reuptake. I don&#39;t quite understand why that would be any different and I haven&#39;t looked into it the exact mechanisms, but have at least heard that from a few sources.</p>

<p>As far as &#39;psychedelics&#39; could treat ADHD, well, meth is also a psychedelic. It&#39;s hard to really say what&#39;s a stimulant and what&#39;s a psychedelic, they all act to one extent or another on shared sets of receptors for dopamine, serotonin, and other neurotransmitters.</p>

<p>ADHD is really just being bored, so anything that increases one&#39;s enthusiasm for the task at hand would work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;I could tell them I have a degree in Neuroscience to add credence to what I&#39;m saying but I like to try and convince people by getting them to understand, not just flashing credentials like doctors and psychiatrists do.&quot;</p>

<p>The degree is the only reason they really trust doctors&#39; words so much. Well that, and the propaganda of the for-profit medical industry. Funny how the US is one of the few (only?) countries&#39; that advertise pharmaceuticals to consumers far, far more than doctors.</p>

<p>EDIT: In addition, in their line of work, there is no possible way that doctors can keep up with the mechanism of action for every new drug coming out these days. Do doctors have to study to keep their credentials? I sincerely don&#39;t know, but seeing as how important it is to be on top of such information when dealing with human lives, I would hope so...</p>

<p>Sorry for rambling, it sounds a lot better in my head but I just want to throw a couple cents out there.</p>

<p>Amphetamines boost the shit out of your ego (and I&#39;m an ENTJ so natraully I tend to struggle with ego at times) You feel superior, you have this mind set that anyone who doesn&#39;t think like you is stupid/wrong. You have an extremely left brain view. Desire to just be &quot;productive&quot; and being hyper focused does not help learning IMO. Learning involves pattern recognition, and under the influence of bigpharma I always feel my pattern recognition is decreased not seeing certain patterns I would normally see on a sober state. If they wanted to drop adhd, stop feeding these children garbage at school. Also, well we are on neuroscience, I think LSD and shrooms have a massive potential if micro dosed and not abused. They actually assist in helping with pattern recognition and memory from my experience. Learning a new language is much easier, learning new concepts is much easier, and unlike adderall (where I would forget ideas or what I learned), the information would be retained. If they cared about the children and wanted them to actually learn, we would see a lot more research about certain illegal &quot;drugs&quot;. Drugs vs medication. its in the dose.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very good point man, kids eat junk and their parents expect them not to have behavioural disorders? Ridiculous! Give a child a handful of sweets and he&#39;ll run around for 20 minutes like a maniac. Just the modern high sugar is bound to cause hyperactivity and kickback hypoactivity! There are also all sorts of chemical additives, found in drinks like lucozade and irn bru, that &quot;may cause hyperactivity in children&quot; aka definitely does but they don&#39;t want to admit it. It amazes me people don&#39;t think about the connection between the food they eat and their brain function/ behaviour! It seems so obvious to me</p>

if they affect children, it probably screws with adult brains too, no reason to believe otherwise.</p>

<p>Both my boys were diagnosed with ADD, the younger with ADHD &amp; Dyslexia. At no point in time did I ever medicate them! I went toe to nose with plenty of teachers and admin. in four different states! </p>

<p>The Dyslexia was undeniable but the other two <em>labels</em> were more about figuring out how my sons learned best, keeping them busy and feeding them healthy diets! </p>

<p>We even <em>clobbered</em> the dyslexia by using his strengths and not focusing on his deficits!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve argued rounds with my youngest daughter and SIL (with his three <em>degrees</em>!) about medicating my oldest grandson to no avail! It&#39;s gut wrenching to watch him all doped up at eleven and they take him off during <em>breaks</em> and he&#39;s all over the map!</p>

<p>Exactly! </p>

<p>My (all!) kids are all talented in very different ways, gifted in some areas, not so skilled or <em>inclined</em> in other disciplines. Have one daughter on her way to Med School. Her passion is Neurology!</p>

<p>Kids (people) are not meant to be <em>cookie cutter copies</em> of one another but that is what <em>Public School</em> demands. That is what <em>forced medication</em> intends.</p>

<p>I was very fortunate to be an at home parent through budgeting, planning and <em>owning</em> the responsibility of my progeny. Public School in America is a <em>retardation</em> of the masses by design.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The worst part was, the doctors really didn&#39;t so much as hint at how strong these medications are. In addition, they weren&#39;t used to treat specific disorders, rather to help symptoms like not being able to sleep, or feeling depressed. But depression is fucking normal when you&#39;re coming off of drugs, and here you are being offered anti-psychotics. I can&#39;t believe it. They wouldn&#39;t give you any opportunity to research or understand what drugs you were being offered, it&#39;s not like you have access to an internet connection in a rehab.</p>

<p>you&#39;re coming across as quite condescending in this point. </p>

<p>Yes, I know. I was responding in kind to the condescension in the post I was replying to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t think anything complex can be learned in half an hour, but of course people could learn things off the internet if they wanted and had researching skills and dedication. You don&#39;t need to have gone to a university to know things. Thats a little bit elitist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can learn things without studying them in college. Sure. I&#39;m good with that. But you can also easily be fooled by misinformation when you haven&#39;t studied a topic in that kind of educational/professional setting.</p>

<p>Where a topic is heavily disputed amongst experts, go ahead and study it yourself and form an opinion. But where a scientific consensus exists, defer to it until you gain a level of expertise so as to justify believing something contrary to it. Such expertise can only be attained (by most people, at least) through university-level coursework.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like the problem is the pharmaceutical industries influence within medicine. People generally trust doctors because they are there to help them. The problem is that doctors are influenced by pharma in many ways. Several years ago I was prescribed an SSRI. At the time I was very sceptical of a drug being the solution to my problem. I was depressed but I was quite certain that it was caused by my life circumstances at the time and my feelings of hopelessness towards the future. I had to visit my doctor to get a sick note for college and he heavily persuaded me to go on an SSRI. I don&#39;t believe he was being malicious. He genuinely thought that it was a safe and effective treatment. </p>

<p>Now, as I said I was very sceptical of the drugs ability to help me but you need to understand that when you are in that situation it is very difficult to go against doctors orders. When you know nothing about the field and your doctor as well as many scientists and regulators etc. have approved the drug and found it to be the best approach. You don&#39;t want to be like that person who puts off cancer treatment in favour of vitamin pills, do you? You&#39;re not anti-science are you? These are the thoughts that run through your mind. Even the most sceptical people in this situation will begin to doubt their own beliefs. Maybe I do have a chemical imbalance? Maybe all these clever scientists and doctors are right and I should try this treatment? What&#39;s the worst that could happen when the regulators have approved it for use?</p>

<p>So I don&#39;t think it is right to blame the patients in this case. I think the problem is very clearly medicine being broken. Good science does not take place and so doctors prescribe treatments that are ineffective and unsafe. It is very difficult for an ordinary member of the public to know this though. The whole point of evidence based medicine is that it is supposed to be backed by good robust science, that&#39;s why people have faith in it.</p>

<p>I do share your frustration at the apparent stockholm syndrome that many people on SSRIs seem to exhibit. Often they will go on a drug for a temporary life situation, then later when they try and stop the drug they will experience withdrawal symptoms. They then believe that this is actually the original problem returning and that they need to stay on the drug forever. They will then praise the drug as being life saving and become very angry if you criticise it. Ironically if they never started the drug in the first place they would most likely have recovered naturally over a few months and be completely fine drug free. However, now they have a dependence on a drug that was completely unnecessary in the first place. So the drug harmed them in a big way but they don&#39;t even know it and they actually praise the drug and believe it is wonderful.  </p>

<p>I feel like this problem is magnified by the embedding of the idea of many psychiatric disorders and their causes and treatments in our culture. In many ways the pharmaceutical industry has been successful at marketing these disorders to the point where they are now widely accepted. The first thing people ask if you mention psychological problems is &quot;are you on meds?&quot; like that is the go to treatment. Everyone has heard of ADHD and Social Anxiety Disorder. Even bipolar which was once a very rare condition is now frequently spoke of. Even the term &quot;mental illness&quot; itself implies that you have something biologically wrong. An illness that needs some sort of medical intervention. </p>

<p>I do feel rather depressed with the state of things. I feel like it will take something monumental to cause change. Many people have already died or been harmed significantly by the current paradigm. I&#39;m not sure what it will take... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It gets even better. That article was written by the editor-in-chief of the lancet.</p>

<p>There are plenty of scientists who are well aware of how corrupt the research process has become, and has been.</p>

<p>Layman skeptics, on the other hand, like the people who populate r/conspiratard, are incredibly naive to the way this world works, and will tout corporate-sponsored scientific consensus as total fact.</p>
