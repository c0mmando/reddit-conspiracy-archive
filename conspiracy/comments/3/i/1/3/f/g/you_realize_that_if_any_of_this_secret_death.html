        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Skull and bones, illuminati, whatever demon worshipping organization you believe exists. Well, they flew an airplane into a building twice, blew it up and killed thousands so they could lead a country to war to sacrifice millions more lives. They poison our food water and air to masturbate to a slow torturous death.
So. Nukes. Nuclear weaponry. A hoax? I hope it is, I sincerely hope all nuclear powers are nothing more than a sham, just like Sandyhook and Charleston. But if the nukes are real?
Do you realize the people with their finger on the trigger literally worship Satan (don&#39;t get it twisted, this isn&#39;t to mean satan and God are real, those are falsitudes to manipulate and control) and literally bleed and rape children in sacrifice to their false gods of money and daemon. My point is these people have no limits, and they want go build an arsenal large enough to make humans extinct.
This probably is all wrong, this is probably all just insane rambling, but it is disconcerting because if I&#39;m right and these insane people do have access to these bombs, well... We&#39;re all going to die soon. Imagine Hiroshima and Nagasaki, now imagine that, but in every major city, in every country. 100,000,000 dead, in 1 hour. Keep your eyes open, stay safe, I love you all.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve likely never met a truly wealthy person, in fact we don&#39;t even know most of their identities. CEOs and corporate managers aren&#39;t the elite, they are the minions. And, yes, your average corporate MBA manager can&#39;t find their ass with both hands and a mirror.</p>
