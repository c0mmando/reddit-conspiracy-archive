       Skull and bones, illuminati, whatever demon worshipping organization you believe exists. Well, they flew an airplane into a building twice, blew it up and killed thousands so they could lead a country to war to sacrifice millions more lives. They poison our food water and air to masturbate to a slow torturous death.
So. Nukes. Nuclear weaponry. A hoax? I hope it is, I sincerely hope all nuclear powers are nothing more than a sham, just like Sandyhook and Charleston. But if the nukes are real?
Do you realize the people with their finger on the trigger literally worship Satan (don't get it twisted, this isn't to mean satan and God are real, those are falsitudes to manipulate and control) and literally bleed and rape children in sacrifice to their false gods of money and daemon. My point is these people have no limits, and they want go build an arsenal large enough to make humans extinct.
This probably is all wrong, this is probably all just insane rambling, but it is disconcerting because if I'm right and these insane people do have access to these bombs, well... We're all going to die soon. Imagine Hiroshima and Nagasaki, now imagine that, but in every major city, in every country. 100,000,000 dead, in 1 hour. Keep your eyes open, stay safe, I love you all.

       It's not about you. It's about your children or your family's children. If you don't have children it's about your loved one's children. If you don't have loved ones then I don't know what to tell you. Nihilistic belief structure gets you into trouble.

       I tried to explain that to someone, that the powers that be are as dumb as the general pop. And much like the general population, you have those among them that are smart and get how to be subtle and patient.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then you have the hotheads who are impatient and lack control that decide to rush things screwing everyone over.

       You've likely never met a truly wealthy person, in fact we don't even know most of their identities. CEOs and corporate managers aren't the elite, they are the minions. And, yes, your average corporate MBA manager can't find their ass with both hands and a mirror.

       There are powers much stronger than those in charge of the evil on this planet making sure that the planet itself is not overly harmed.  This means that nuclear war is not super likely.  As such, although some of the "secret death society stuff" is indeed true, it doesn't in the least necessarily mean that "we're all going to die soon".

       Get deeper. Learn more of what God is. Read Tantra, read the stars, read events, read archetypes, read the world, read yourself, read the Universe. 
Without Satan there is no God, balance is what we seek, where both are accepted and empowering the Human. We are Gods of our world. Heal your soul, heal your spirit, be kind to yourself, experience God through transcendance. Then reach the power to heal the world. Reach your potential. Namaste, soon-to-awaken God.

       They don't want us all dead... Remember, they like the feeling of control and power. No power if there is no one to control. They want the world to cower to them in fear. That's what they love.  The moment we all stop fearing what they will do, that's when the rats that they are will truly reveal themselves. Then and only then will we be able to exterminate the corruption that exists.

       they already had enough fire power to destroy humanity 50 years ago, they've been trying to
       <em>
        lower
       </em>
       the arsenal ... sure they're building better weapons, but they're trying to lower the nuke numbers ... and i don't mean iraq and iran, US and russian governments did get rid of a lot of nuclear arsenal since the cold war ended (or did it ??)
      </p>
      <p>
       secondly, they have written on a stone (somewhere in ohio?) that optimum population of the world is 100 million people. so no, they won't kill all of us, only most of us (if you're right)
      </p>
      <p>
       oh and they don't worship satan, they worship power and consequently money. they don't give two shits about religion, religion is just a tool to control the masses.

       You hope nukes are a hoax? Fuck that shit, bring on the nuclear holocaust! I rather that compared to economic collapse and our decay into barbarism. You either get nukes, a nice quick ending, or you get to fight against the marauding hoards over walmart leftovers.

       They may ultimately kill a bunch of us, maybe even a majority of us, but I doubt they'll use nukes; far more likely some kind of virus or pathogen. Hopefully they find some formula that only kills people with 100 IQs or less, then most of us here will be fine.

       But seriously, there's a whole lot more going on here than the evil Satanists/Luciferians who it seems currently hold sway. Don't despair. Let's see what happens in September. Should it begin, don't lament. Take action. We've all been gathering here for a reason. Maybe this is it.
