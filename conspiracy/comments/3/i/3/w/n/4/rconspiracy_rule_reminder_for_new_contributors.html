       Please familiarize yourselves with the page rules before posting, this is especially relevant to new users.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mods try to give most subjects a place but certain rules need to be enforced. Examples are image posts, keep them at a decent standard. Image posts without reference are subject to removal. The same goes with embellished post titles and posts with caps lock titles. They can and will be removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       This page is a difficult one to moderate sometimes because everyone deserves a voice and every subject deserves discussion but please follow the rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       One last point before you all fall asleep.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comments or posts that suggest 'all conspiracy theorists/alternative thinkers' believe the same ideas or theories are now subject to removal. The moderators will not tolerate the notion that an audience of 300,000+ people all believe the same thing. Comments of this nature are ignorant..

       Please remember that this page is for free thinkers.

       That's probably because people were spamming "Jews did 9/11" shit for a while there.  My guess is that it was a very lazy, yet effective, psyops of some sort.  In general it is easier to create false parallels between two groups than to refute evidence and actually debunk things; a good example is the Oathkeeper wikipedia entry that claims they are a neo-Nazi group.  It's ludicrous, of course, but people are easily led into making that association and so it stands.

       In my experience, it's precisely Zionist Jews making these sort of false correlations and straw man arguments. When truthers want to convince someone that Jews were involved in 9/11, they tend to just show them the evidence that Jews were involved in 9/11.

       I don't think anybody here genuinely believes all living Jews were involved in the 9/11 attacks, if that's what you're suggesting. If you're Jewish and weren't involved, then I can see why you'd have a problem with other people saying "Jews did 9/11", but at the end of the day, they did do 9/11, so I think the truth far outweighs any offence you might take from the way it is worded.

       I haven't seen the evidence that the Jews were involved.  Mossad could certainly have played a part, but they are a very secretive organization and I doubt they would let anything leak if there was anything to leak.  One thing that I have seen evidence for is that Israel tried to warn the US repeatedly about the attacks.

       Yes, it is predominantly the evidence of Mossad's involvement which has created the phrase. That said, there is also quite a bit of evidence against Zionists in America, as the links above will show.

       Israel is a big place, and not everyone there will have wanted these attacks to happen, or even known that internal elements were involved. There is also the very legitimate possibility that they simply wanted to cover their own tracks. Consider that even in America, there is much evidence that the FBI tried to warn of the attacks, and could have quite easily prevented them, but they were unable to because of the actions of their own government -- particularly in its six refusals to give them a warrant to search the hard drive of Zacarias Moussaoui.

       As I said, I don't doubt that some in Israel had fore-knowledge, some even tried to warn the US.  There just doesn't seem to be a lot of evidence that they actually participated.  The first link you posted just doesn't have enough footnotes to be very credible.  I can see why they would be happy about it though, Israel was getting more and more isolated on the global scene at the time.

       The explosives residue discovered on the Mossad agents, and the bomb which went off at George Washington bridge both imply a lot more than "foreknowledge". They imply direct involvement.

       I agree that more than one source would be better, but for someone apparently concerned with "credibility", even you must concede that the American FBI is a highly credible source, which is where this information has come from. The first part at least, about the Mossad agents testing positive for explosives residue. The third link I posted is a transcript of the FBI file on their arrest, which was recently declassified.

       Fair enough. You would be right to be wary of propaganda on the internet, but I believe this article is far too detailed and specific to be considered such. It gives precise names and precise information. Propaganda tends to be a lot more cloudy, vague and is unmistakably emotive.

       If you are in the "non-conspiracy community" then it is because you do not believe in conspiracies. Hence, it cannot then be incorrect to say you don't believe in conspiracies. Calling someone a dupe for this belief is completely in line with the facts. You have admitted the belief and the belief is demonstrably wrong. Conspiracies can and do happen.

       I wonder if some of you even think before you speak.

       Clearly, I am not, so stop being fucking ridiculous. The one and only thing which could possibly qualify someone as being in the "non-conspiracist community" as you put it, is that they don't believe in conspiracies. The OP was discussing taking a belief which is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       homogenous among a group, and then using it as a blanket argument to discredit the entire group. This is obviously something quite different and your attempt to fallaciously merge the two concepts simply betrays your own dishonesty.

       You would have to be completely anti-science to think that the hormones from the Female Birth Control Pill couldn't have an affect on the future sexuality of a developing fetus.  We already know that it affects a woman's taste in men.

       I don't agree with that comment at all. We offer open viewing of moderation actions, encourage readers to message the moderators if posts have been removed and tolerate all subjects.
      </p>

       Your suggestion that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is increasingly censoring posts is absurd. This post is just a rule clarification for new users.

       I did NOT say I wouldn't support it. In fact I would vote to sticky it even though it's over a year old.

       If you want it stickied, then submit it and ask the mod team through modmail to sticky it instead of just bitching about it in comment threads.

       Actually that's your 2nd most common contribution.

      <p>
       I would vote for an AMA with the real Richard Gage.  But since Mr.Gage has apparently been contacted by a certain group of users here and he has claimed that he will never do an AMA here then I guess that's out of the question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly Gage has created an atmosphere that is toxic for independent thought and only rewards people who parrot his exact words.  If you're not an architect or engineer then your opinion doesn't matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       That all being said if the real Mr Gage would please stand up and do an AMA then I would vote for it, unfortunately I don't think Gage does speaking events if he doesn't get paid for it so I doubt that will happen.

       I would never take pay to spread information on reddit. Many users do, mostly higher level subreddit moderators.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if I was a mod and someone offered me money to sticky a thread—let's say about abortion—I would never consider it.

      <p>
       You seem fixated on passive aggressive accusations rather than being a mature human being. You're a waste of time and a terrible moderator lol, stop harassing me please

       Also its kind of stupid to make a "passive aggressive" accusation... let's say, about abortion.  Right before you accuse someone of being fixated on passive aggressive accusations.

       Oh no you don't. Both you and controlled-demo-wtc (same person?) have been antagonizing some of the mods here ever since your new accounts were created after being previously banned for personal attacks. Sure, you post some decent stuff but your behavior always makes it seem like you're intentionally torpedoing
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and the 9/11 Truth movement to boot.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is your last warning. Knock off the personal attacks on users and mods or you're gone again. And if that happens, any more new accounts you create will also be banned on sight. And believe me, your tactics are very recognizable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: It would not surprise me in the least if you two (one?)
       <em>

       the fake Richard Gage and planned this whole scenario all along.

       This is a message I sent to all mods three nights ago, under the consideration that (1) mod didn't like Richard Gage:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Hey guys, Sorry about the tone. I'm as aggressive as some of you. I know that's off putting, but shit don't get done unless people push for change. I see no one else trying to highlight the issue. Bull by the horns guys. This is the anniversary of the greatest OP the USA shadow government has ever pulled off. Problem is they forgot about Newton's laws of motion.
       </p>
       <p>
        How about 4 stickies (1 per week, all 4 weeks of September) all pertaining to the controlled demolitions of the three towers?
A physics lesson with David Chandler (can be a youtube w/o the ae911truth logo on it, just because)
       </p>
       <p>
        A link to the New Pearl Harbor video with discussion. I am not affiliated with anyone or organization. Just need to make that clear for some.
       </p>
       <p>
        A look at exploding debris with David Chandler (once again, non ae911truth related)
       </p>
       <p>
        And maybe a general discussion on the last week pertaining to the general direction we've taken as a result of 9.11.01, which includes links to the first 3 weeks' discussions.
       </p>
       <p>
        That's a suggestion all mods are welcome to think about.

       The mod team almost never agrees on 100% on anything so that isn't much of a shocker.  We are okay with not agreeing 100% on anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you please stop these phony "gottcha" posts?  Nobody is impressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lete spell it out to you, there is a lot more to this community than AE911TRUTH.org, we don't adopt official positions on conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ae911truth is equally welcome here as Judy Woods or flat earth.  This is a generic conspiracy theory sub.  Each of the mods are individuals who are welcome to hold whatever opinions they wish and we do so regularly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every time something is posted or stickied that isn't ae911truth, it isn't the end of the world.  As a matter of fact I was invited to mod the 911 centric subs and I declined because its not really my thing.  So as hard as this is going to be for you to believe, I'm really not here to sabotage the ae911truth movement but because of their intolerance for outsiders they have chose to repeatedly sabotage me as well as other mods here.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when your suggestions about ae911truth stickies aren't received with enthusiastic jubilation perhaps you should reflect on your past behavior towards the mods here instead of doubling down on more of the same behavior!

       This sounds a lot like you want the entire month of September to be a Richard Gage festival.  Not going to happen.  There are dozens of 9-11 theories and they are all equally welcome here.  And some people don't even want to talk about 9-11 so they talk about other things.  I think 30 days of anything is a stupid idea, one that isn't going to happen.

       You just made a claim about being attacked personally by ae911truth advocates and yet you show no proof.

       Its not my final decision to make, but I've been around here long enough to know that nothing survives a sticky for a month.  Its a greedy idea to dominate an entire month. There is no way it would ever pass a vote.

       This sounds like a pretty reasonable request since 9/11 is around the corner.  Of course, if it is not a popular link then I could understand if mods don't think it is worthwhile.  Personally, I think Chandler's work is the best thing to start a newbie out with and would be fine with getting his video stickied too.

       In no way am picking sides here, but it would be really cool if there was a way to participate as a subscriber of what the next sticky post would be. Whether it be a weekly public poll, or online vote,  or some other way to more collectively participate,  I think it would be a great thing for this sub.

       Last year the mods did this and it died down after they removed the 9/11 documentary feature, and posted hitler and holocaust stuff during September. There's a clique behind the scenes my friend. The moderating here is compromised.

      <p>
       Majority opinion about what? You have to be specific. After you've stated specifically what you're referring to, then provide us with evidence which confirms your belief that this is the majority opinion. What analysis have you done? If you can properly evidence your claim, then I don't think anybody will have a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       But of course the OP isn't simply talking about wonky -- but innocent -- assumptions about "majority opinion". He's talking about deliberate false syllogisms where you might say:-
      </p>
      <p>
       Subject A believes this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subject A is part of group X.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore group X must believe it too.

       Great point? Allow me to retort.
      </p>
      <p>
       "No crying" - how condescending. Also, I want to point out something:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        No crying about content with which you disagree. No lobbying for banning certain topics.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       These are two different things. I don't think topics should be banned. But I
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       express my disagreement for theories I think are either unfounded and ridiculous and/or thinly veiled racism.
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3cbkgp/if_youre_still_in_denial_about_stormfront/">
        I have proven, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that Stormfront
        <em>
         does
        </em>
        brigade this subreddit.
       </a>
       I don't think their obviously racist posts should be removed, but that's absolutely not the same thing as saying "no crying about content". That's just another way of saying "no passionately disagreeing with posts", which is absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know the Duke thread being referred to, and I admit the one guy in there was being a bit immature and hard-headed. But such a blanket statement of "no crying" is again, condescending to say the very least.

         I think JFK was likely killed by the CIA, which implicates those in power in the CIA at the time: Namely, then-future-, now-former- president George HW Bush. Which brings about greater suspicion of his sons.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I think that a global and near-ubiquitous banking cartel has manipulated the powers of government in almost every country on the planet towards the ends of keeping their own power. I think this bit of conspiracy has been on-going for over two centuries.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I think 9/11 was not a false-flag operation, nor an operation condoned by 'the US government'. That being said, I believe that a certain group within the government (neo-cons and the military industrial complex) knew it was being planned - at the very least - and did nothing, or at worst, facilitated the planning and execution of the event, in order to draw the US into a "war on terror". Subtle difference between a false flag and this - a
         <em>
          government
         </em>
         commits a false flag. This wasn't done by 'the government', it was done by a corrupt group
         <em>
          within
         </em>
         the government, and I recognize the difference.
        </p>
        <p>
         This was done to create the demand for weapons and weapons technology, creating a new arms race. The difference though, is that this arms race is against a bogeyman who, while I don't deny the existence of, is very much inflated. I'm speaking of course of Terrorism. I think that many, but not all, terrorist attacks are encouraged by certain pockets of the government in collusion with keeping the war on terror going. Note: This does not include the 'staging' of terrorist attacks. While I don't discount that it could happen, I also haven't seen any evidence to the affect that I consider conclusive, so I reserve my judgement.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I have my suspicions regarding Edward Snowden. He was covered by the media far too well for it to be anything but condoned by the government in a big way. If the mass media can be convinced to keep quiet about JFK and TPP decades apart, they'd be told to shut up about Snowden if they were at all worried about what was being done. They aren't. Further, Snowden is a liar and no better than Bradley, in my eyes: He claims to have read the documents prior to handing them off, but when questioned point blank, he dodged the question. It happened on John Oliver's show. The guy wasn't just a data-analyst, he was a counter-intelligence trainer: He
         <em>
          taught classes
         </em>
         on being a convincing liar. He had a very long history with various intelligence agencies. I think he should be arrested as a traitor and convicted as one too, however keep in mind: He was a civilian, not military. Therefor, his punishment would almost certainly be less than that of Bradley/Chelsea Manning.

       I'd really like to identify here what exactly in this post you what you felt was inappropriate material, or offended you.  I actually felt it was a very genuine and heartfelt debate, on both sides,  and was one of the best discussions I've ever had on reddit.  The video was a powerful video on its own,  you have to realize it's going to elicit a powerful response on both sides of the argument, whoever's side you agree with.

       Responding to this just because it's tangentially related - can the mods
       <em>
        please

       try to watch out a little more for antisemitism? There is a fine line that goes from Israel does bad things and manipulates the US to do nothing about it --&gt; Jewish elite do this everywhere and control the world --&gt; blanket statements about Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not Jewish or Israeli. But I think less of this sub every time I see bullshit antisemitic comments that don't get removed, because that doesn't at all demonstrate a community of people willing to evaluate evidence like adults.

       I've been called an obvious shill a number of times. It's a useless ad hominem attack: If I'm a shill but my arguments are valid and the facts are true, then so what? Likewise, if I'm not a shill, and my facts are wholly wrong and arguments riddled with fallacies, does that make the argument better?
      </p>
      <p>
       Argue the point, not the person. If the shill is so obvious and spreading falsehood, it should be easy to argue that, no?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit - Watch how this works: let's pretend that the rule against calling someone a shill was removed. Anyone can call someone a shill now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well what's the point of a shill? To derail discussion. It's not to
       <em>
        guide
       </em>
       discussion, not here - it's to derail it entirely. To make
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       look bad. Right? Well there's no faster way to derail discussion of a topic than to call someone presenting a cogent argument, a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefor, a shill would argue that calling someone a shill here should be allowed, as that would be their easiest-to-use tool to derail any given discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefor, I could argue that
       <a href="/u/TheCocaineFairy">
        /u/TheCocaineFairy
       </a>
       (and you)
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       obvious shills, because shills want to be able to call people shills, as it would serve their purposes easier than real arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why it's useless to call someone a shill, unless your goal is actually to derail the conversation.

       Me and you both know that you can distinguish the difference between a normal person and a shill just by looking at their history. If the account was made that day and they are constantly arguing about the same thing then they are most likely a shill. Example: there was a poster saying that holocaust revisionism was bullshit and we should just blindly accept the official story because 6 million. I lurked them and noticed that the only thing they would post was defending the official story of the holocaust. Also, if someone is going to preach the wonders of GMOs and tell me how I should drink monsanto's glyphosate because its safe, well then they are a shill by default, or a troll.

       If someone called me a shill, depending on what they said, I would either defend myself or lol it and move on. I wouldn't get all crazy about it or spend much time thinking of it either because I know it's not true. I feel that basically everyone who isn't a shill would react pretty much the same way, and wouldn't cry to the mods or the subreddit for protection or censorship simply because of that. And I don't feel that it derails the conversation if the user is shilly and others call it out, it is useful information.

       Reporting the violation of a posted rule is not "crying to the mods for protection", it's expecting everyone here to play by the posted rules.

       This is my point with regards to the "crying" comment: There's a big group of people here who treat any dissent as 'crying', and that's a form of censorship in and of itself.

       It isn't useful because it can't be evidenced. 99.9% of those called a 'shill' are just... called a shill, there's no evidence for them

       shills. The only 'evidence' is "what they're arguing", which is again - indicative that calling someone a shill is only to shut up the disagreeing argument.

       I shouldn't have to explain and give all my proof for why I think a certain user is a shill, every single time I want to make other users aware of that user acting shilly.

       These shilly people who hang out here basically state that conspiracy theorists are the types of people who would go to their houses after certain discussions because of how crazy and irrational they are, but in actuality I feel that it's the opposite, they are truly the aggressive ones.

       When I've pointed someone out to be shilly, it's not to make a show of it or to intentionally hurt that user, it is to make people aware of the shillyness of that user. You might not think it's important, but I do because I feel that it is manipulative and deceptive behavior. It's not useless because it can protect others from falling into their traps.

       You're just trying to get people to ignore other people's arguments, and you're doing so by ad-hominem attacks, not by disproving their arguments.

       Again: There is no better form of subversive censorship than calling someone a shill. Calling someone a shill is, itself, manipulative behavior.

       It's obvious. In fact that's exactly what a Nazi-shill would do: Carefully avoid making any direct Nazi-related quotes, then demand someone prove it any time they're caught red-handed. Edit: You also didn't explicitly deny you work for the Rothschilds. Case closed.

       I can protect myself because I'm not a shill and I wouldn't have to work as hard to prove that I'm not one, which definitely isn't the case for shills and probably the main reason why they work so hard to make sure that the rule stays.

       It's not about 'working hard' it's about 'often'. If all you are doing is denying allegations of being a shill, you're not discussing anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, I can show exactly the opposite using my own logic: Shills don't want the rule to stay, shills want the rule to go, because there's no easier way to derail conversation than by calling people shills. It'd be giving them an invaluable tool.
      </p>

       It does contribute to the discussion, because if the user is a shill, then the argument/debate is dishonest from the beginning. It's a huge waste of energy. If that user is shilly, and is called out by another, then others can confirm their own suspicions, look through their history to see any evidence for themselves, be more aware of it, or completely ignore it. We are just going in circles now though. We have different perspectives. Let's just leave it at that.

       Actually, I was trying to tell you
       <em>
        what a shill is
       </em>
       . What you think of the definition means nothing. My subjective opinion on the definition of the color blue doesn't change the actual color of the sky. There is an objective definition of 'shill', and it heavily implies compensation in one form or another. I cannot think of a single time when it wouldn't.

       So you're telling me that a shill definitely has to be paid directly? Did you consider that there may be people who will act enthusiastically about a product because they are somehow tied in with its risks or benefits? Maybe part of another industry that can be affected for example.

       Compensated, not paid directly. They have to have something 'in it for them'. That covers those people who act enthusiastically about a product because they're tied to its demise or success (see 50 Cent, Vitamin Water, and his 'pump and dump' stock scheme).
      </p>
      <p>
       If they aren't getting compensated in any way, then what's the difference between that 'shill' and a person who just honestly believes a thing? Answer me this, if nothing else.

       We're getting somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can you prove that a particular user stands to benefit? We'll use me as an example: I've been called a shill for Nestle. Something fierce. All because I defended the use of baby formula for mothers who need to supplement their breast milk. In that thread I was called a shill no less than a dozen times by as many users.
      </p>
      <p>
       How could someone evidence that I stood to gain from Nestle's 'good' reputation? I mean really: What could they point to? Nothing but my personal financial statements. Information that isn't available on the internet. Hardcore doxxing, enough to be IP-banned from reddit entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Use any other instance you like: How can someone show this 'shilly behavior'? I'm not even arguing shills don't exist – they absolutely do – but even I can't figure how I might go about
       <em>
        proving
       </em>
       a specific user
       <em>
        is a shill

       while staying within the confines of the rules of this sub and of reddit at large.

       I get what you're saying, but to me, absolute proof isn't necessary. It's an observation and an assumption of the user based on whatever evidence. Just like how most of us here will be labeled as conspiracy theorists, even when we don't bring up a conspiracy. Do we go all ape-shit about it or even focus that much on it? No. lol.

       If someone chooses to label us, then that is their choice, but we should have the same choice.

       False, its nearly impossible to discover a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       A quick glance at their user history will only confirm their bias, bias doesn't make a shill.

       Actual shills typically use multiple accounts and there is often a subtle association you can discover between these groups of accounts.  But not always.

       Glad to hear someone of authority hear say this. Shill accusations are rampant here, and they serve to shut down conversation immediately. That said,I've noticed that enforcement of this rule seems better lately.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing I have noticed however is that regular and long term users of this sub seem to be exempt from this rule. There are a number of users (won't name anyone specific, but you can go to any vaccine or 911 related thread to see it) who make it a habit to call about anyone who disagrees with them a shill and never seem to have any warnings levelled against them, despite being reported.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are prominent users being protected by mods? Do you stand by this differential treatment?

       I will however give a user more chances to follow the rules after warnings if they have demonstrated in the past that they can contribute positively to the sub.  Let's be honest here, even if we ban someone they aren't gone for good so the last thing I was to do is make a potentially good user into a guaranteed bad one.

       Now if someone is named "rich_white_man" and their first contribution involves calling people niggers...  I probably won't even warn them before I ban.  These are some cases that aren't even worth hearing.

       Glad you don't think so, but a cursory glance at populated threads of the topics I mentioned there are recognizable users habitually engaging in this behaviour. In fact, I can think of one occasion where a mod expressed admiration for another user's comment in which they called me a shill.

       I actually am not pursuing banning of any users. As this issue if largely related to promoting mature discussion, I would argue a public warning from moderators explaining why accusations are against the rules (it's dishonest and unfalsifiable) would be far more productive. It can be a standard copy-paste, and I think public displays of the rule being enforced would go a long way to changing the culture here.

       Sometimes. I've had one user (since shadowbanned) stalk me across multiple threads in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , calling me a Jewish shill and hurling invective and just obvious abuse over the space three or four days. In between the posts, he was sending me bizarre PMs encouraging me to kill myself. These were reported to the admins.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of engaging him, I asked him to stop and reported the posts.
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3if2nh/if_the_bubble_touches_me_youre_going_to_be/cug6cji">
        To this day, his posts remain
       </a>
       - this is just one example of about a half dozen other threads where he was doing the same thing. Because these posts were reported, this means they were looked at and approved by a moderator - which the mod log at the time clearly showed. I can't imagine the same leniency being afforded to me, a non-conspiracist, if I engaged in this way with a believer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the same mod log showed you tried to deal with the user with a ban, I'm guessing you were either overruled or changed your mind.
       <a href="/u/SovereignMan">
        /u/SovereignMan
       </a>
       is also very fair at enforcing the rules against trolling here, if he's around he can be counted on to take the reports on their merits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately the other mods, from what I've seen, are very patchy and may exhibit less neutrality when the "victim" of the trolling isn't a conspiracist. Either that or they just don't remove trolls, no matter how obvious, in any circumstance.

       I was the one who banned him, and I was the one who unbanned him. There were no other mods overruling me although we do have an understanding in place where a mod can be overruled by the other mods, to create balance.

       I think we all tend to bias on the side of conspiracy theorists because this subreddit belongs to conspiracy theorists.  That being said we expect everyone to follow the rules regardless of their alignment with the term 'conspiracy theorist'.

       The problem with allowing real users here to call others "troll" or "shill" is that we would then have to allow trolls/shills to call the real users here "troll" or "shill". Then we would get, as we have in the past, threads degrading into dozens of name calling comments, thus distracting from the topic at hand.

       Maybe people should engage in debate without dismissing the other side's arguments by resorting to ad hominem attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think someone's a shill, out argue them. Don't just scream "shill" and ignore them. Otherwise, the guy who happens upon the thread and happens to be ignorant of the facts of the matter will see a convincing argument rather and become better educated, rather than what looks like an attempt to dodge the debate and remaining ignorant.

       So, I really think it would be very helpful if this post is going to be stickied here,  to provide some examples of the things we are trying to keep at a minimum.  The overly-broad, and politically correct request is ambiguously vague and confusing to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a new contributer here, I can't fully decipher if this is directed at me,  or something I may have posted,  and if it is,  I'd like to ensure that I don't continue doing it,  and adhere to the rules here.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would really help if the mods here would leave a few examples of posts that they saw that they weren't happy with and thought may have broken a rule.  If one of my posts is included,  I really won't be offended in the slightest.

       just glad that stickied propaganda about planned parenthood is finally gone. and this is a problem with the rules, if i can't complain in comment threads about an obvious abuse of power like that was, then what? send a private message to the mods that will never see the light of day, and likely have no bearing on what you do anyways (highlighted by you reinstating
       <a href="/u/flytape">
        /u/flytape

       We know that astroturfing is a thing now. Do you feel that it is okay to do and that we shouldn't point out users who could possibly be involved with it?

       Last year the mods did this and it died down after they removed the 9/11 documentary feature, and posted hitler and holocaust stuff during September. There's a clique behind the scenes my friend. The moderating here is compromised.

       Prob not, mods do as they please most of the time around here with impunity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mostly if you call em out nothing happens and everyone forgets rather quickly.

       Just like the "NO CAPS" rule was broken by the mods no more than about a week and half ago.

       You mean a censored useless sub like all the others?

       No one comes to reddit to get the information the mainstream already agrees on. If they wanted that they would read their newspaper headlines .

       Forget "credible" . Well make up our own minds thank you.
