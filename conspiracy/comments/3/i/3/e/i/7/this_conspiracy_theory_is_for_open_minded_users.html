        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Sirius, a star, since ancient times an extremely important place in the sky. That place where everyone looked at night, knowing that it was a special and magical place.The ancients believe that “gods” came to Earth from Sirius, bringing knowledge to humanity.</p>

<p>They were the “sons of God” of “Enoch,” beings that visited ancient Sumer, helped erect empires such as the Ancient Egyptian empire with Isis and Osiris, but also the ancient Maya and Toltec empires.According to the Ancient Dogon, from Africa, who have spoken for millennia about the “black sister”, the (in)visible one, giving extreme details about a star system that wasn’t discovered by science for years later.The ancient Dogon knew a lot of things that we, mainstream civilization learned only recently. so how is this possible? Is there a slight chance that these “gods” from Sirius did in fact visit our ancient ancestors and thought them among other things, the location from where these “gods” came?</p>

<p>While Sirius was known since ancient times, only in 1834, the German astronomer Friedrich W. Bessel established the accurate movement of Sirius, a system that had a extremely strange movement in the sky. Therefore another body must have been present that interrupted the proper orbit of Sirius. Sirius is 26 times brighter than the sun and is located only 8.5 light years away, which is a relatively “short” distance when it comes to measurements in space.</p>

<p>In 1851 we got to know more about Sirius when another astronomer, Peters took a new step in calculating the orbit of the disturbing stellar body. He deduced that the period of the “pair” was 50 years; Based on the study of the system he deduced the masses and components, which showed that the body that caused the stellar distortion was in fact Sirius B, which is equivalent to the mass of our sun. </p>

<p>So if Sirius B measures just like our Sun, how does it remain “invisible” even though it is located 8 .5 light years away, practically the same distance as its twin, Sirius A.Sirius remained an enigma up until 1915 when WS Adams, from the Mount Wilson Observatory realized that Sirius B was in fact a “white dwarf”, But mysteriously, all of this was known by the ancient Dogon around 5.000 years ago. </p>

<p>Just like the ancient Egyptians, the ancient Dogon new about Sirius because these ancient cultures had the same “teachers” that came for the stars, coexisting with men, providing us with the necessary tools to develop as a society, as a civilization.Today we know that the Sirius system is one of Earth’s near neighbors. Astronomers believe that Sirius is gradually moving closer to our Solar System, so it will slightly increase in brightness over the next 60,000 years.Sirius is also known colloquially as the “Dog Star”, reflecting its prominence in its constellation, Canis Major (Greater Dog).</p>

<p>The heliacal rising of Sirius marked the flooding of the Nile in Ancient Egypt and the “dog days” of summer for the ancient Greeks, while to the Polynesians in the southern hemisphere it marked winter and was an important star for navigation around the Pacific Ocean.But the ancient Dogon knew a lot more. </p>

<p>They described Sirius as a “triple Star system,” meaning that not only did Sirius have A and B, but also C. This star was called by the Dogon as “Emme ya.”Are we missing something big in history? Many researchers believe that we are missing something bit in history, and that, in the future we will understand ancients stories described in the past are real.</p>

<p>I have just recently read about aliens or beings from other planets and solar systems or galaxies coming down to inhabit earth.  Though this seems farfetched, I can believe that there is life on other planets.  Why would earth be the only planet with living beings on it?  I have not read enough to really understand how this all works out. What I read helps to make things in the bible that are somewhat hard to understand, more understandable. I will keep researching.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you aware that the various mystery schools teach this same mythology about Sirius to their initiates for the purpose of entraining their minds to practice magic? If you want to know what the deal is with Sirius, why don&#39;t you just go channel the same spirits they do, who I&#39;m sure will be more than happy to tell you the same things they tell everyone else?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if lucifer is, in reality, benevolent?  And they have steered you into an illusive belief through &quot;ancient text&quot; that he is a harbinger of all things evil?</p>

<p>Think about it.  More than 99.9% of the people are brainwashed from a young age to associate evil and negativity with the Devil, lucifer etc.  Such widespread agreement deserves some skepticism, no?  </p>

<p>Thanks for an honest reply; this just came to me after reading your comment, and in no way am I a satanist, but just a confused individual in search of the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m no stranger to that line of thinking. Personally, I have come to evidence that it is flawed, and I am convinced by that evidence beyond any doubt, but I understand that you come from a different place, and that the information we&#39;ve encountered is different. I&#39;d like to stress, though, that I&#39;m a pretty intelligent dude, pretty resistant to conditioning, and spent the majority of my life faulting Christians, entirely convinced of the ridiculousness of their belief - but eventually came to determine that I was incorrect, and that a lot of the avenues through which I had received data in that time were deliberately engineered to cause me to believe falsely. I&#39;m in the middle of something right now, so I&#39;m not going to get into it all like that, but that&#39;s my testimony, and I&#39;m not making it up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my understanding, we were created by another, more advanced human-like civilization – still residing in the Milky Way, but on the &quot;other side.&quot; There were seven different scientific teams on the &quot;Earth project&quot;; Lucifer (as we call him) was one of the lead scientists, in charge of what we call the Semitic race. Where he gets his bad rap is that he loved Earth women, and he and his team broke the rules in that regard. His home planet said, &quot;Well, if you love them so much, you can just stay there,&quot; thus the legend of his &quot;fall&quot; or &quot;exile&quot; from &quot;heaven.&quot; He and his team were denied travel back to their planet and lived among us – which is where much of the Old Testament tales originate. You can&#39;t believe any of them word-for-word because 1.) humans understood Lucifer et. al. to be &quot;gods,&quot; and 2.) translations through history. An example is the &quot;burnt offerings&quot;: the alien team liked their bacon extra crispy and wanted to make sure it was free of Earth-based pathogens before they would eat it.</p>

<p>FWIW, I was taught that &quot;Satan&quot; is a different Eloha (singular of Elohim, see Genesis 1:26) and one of the 12 Elders from the home planet. He was against the Earth project and believed it was cruel and irresponsible to create a planetary race that didn&#39;t have all the intellectual and spiritual knowledge that they had. He has long sought for the complete destruction of Earth rather than have conscious beings live under so much confusion and suffering. </p>

<p>I was raised a Southern Baptist, went through an existential crisis with it all in college, then found Raelianism in 2007. The book to read is <a href="http://www.rael.org/download.php?view.1">Intelligent Design</a>. It does not patch every historical hole or answer every existential question, but has certainly scratched a lot of my itches and made me comfortable with what feels &quot;true&quot; and &quot;right&quot; about being human.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vincent Van Gogh was also a deep thinker, into philosophy and spirituality as well as painting. He believed that stars were like train stations for souls; the bigger they are, the more places you can get to from them, if you have the credentials. He arrived at this conclusion before the lead poisoning, BTW. According to ancient Egyptian cosmology, you have to pass through Sirius, which seems to be personified by Anubis, to get to the domain of the gods, which one would expect to be the brilliant cloud of stars around the galactic singularity; you can&#39;t get there directly from the sun, personified as Ra.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I am open to this idea, it should be noted that Sirius is the brightest star-system in the sky, a fact that would obviously be significant to any culture practicing naked-eye astronomy.  Considering early navigation was guided by the stars it is only sensible that ancient cultures would share similar cultural ideas about the brightest star (i.e. the guys doing all the international travel are obsessed with stars ).  I would still put Sirius at the top of the list of &quot;star-systems to visit&quot; once humanity gains that ability.  Of course I seriously doubt the public will be made aware of that ability until much after we acquire it...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The significance of Sirius A to the Dogon people is not a mystery for reasons you have cited. The mystery is how they knew about it&#39;s other Stars, Sirius B (magnitude ~8.5, meaning you can&#39;t see with the naked eye even in the darkest areas), and Sirius C (we have yet to directly observe it, we suspect it is there because of orbital perturbations of Sirius B). Sirius C&#39;s maximum mass has been estimated to be such that it can&#39;t be more than a red dwarf star, with an apparent magnitude to earth of 5 to 10 more than Sirius B, meaning 13-18 magnitude. This would put it out of range of all but the most potent professional telescopes, and due to the proximity of it to such a bright star, would make it even more difficult to detect. Pretty sure some dudes in some grass huts didn&#39;t figure that out for themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the Dogon people are an interesting case.  I&#39;m not dismissing the hypothesis that they had access to alien knowledge,  but we do know that  French astrological expedition led by Henri-Alexandre Deslandres was in Dogon territory for 5 weeks in the 1890&#39;s and it&#39;s pretty reasonable that they would have exchanged knowledge with them while there. To me, the explanation &quot;there is no other way, so it had to be aliens&quot; is never a good argument and only becomes weaker when a perfectly plausible alternative comes to light.</p>

<p>Think about it.  More than 99.9% of the people are brainwashed from a young age to associate evil and negativity with the Devil, lucifer etc.  Such widespread agreement deserves some skepticism, no?  </p>

<p>Thanks for an honest reply; this just came to me after reading your comment, and in no way am I a satanist, but just a confused individual in search of the truth.</p>
