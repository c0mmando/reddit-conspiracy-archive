    <div class="md"><p>this! Is very important. 
It is not an accident that there are three huge trade deals discussed right now in the western world. In my opinion they also have similar names to confuse the normal media consumer. Also I have noted that in europe media almost only discusses TTIP and in usa TPP. Of course that&#39;s because each one affects a different region but without full media coverage of all the trade agreements you can&#39;t build the bigger picture. In my opinion it&#39;s the last big imperialstic effort of the empire (usa) and her allies before the shit hits the fan. They want to remove any barries which could hold further economic development (for the elites) and strenghten their hegonomy to defend of exactly the BRICS States which already line up to push the old elites og their thrones. Thats why they are not included. </p>

Even if the NAU is theoretical, the trade agreements would bind us with other countries, for which the theory could potentially still hold weight.

    <div class="md"><p>Age does not necessarily bring wisdom. I like to think I have acquired my share.</p>

<p>But be that as it may, longer life does bring <em>perspective</em>, and this can be just as valuable in seeing repetitions in the behavior of nations, not always people (unless is is Democratic or socialist movements which are always infiltrated and destroyed), that perpetuate the status quo.</p>

<p>I was born while my Dad was away in Korea. I came through boyhood hearing about the &quot;Domino Theory&quot; in SE Asia. Through HS, I watched the &#39;Nam on the &quot;Nightly News&quot;. Panama, Grenada, Beirut, then the NeoCons (rhymes with &quot;always wrong&quot;) came to power and we finally get to THE BIG LIE (IRAQ WMD) so we can get THE BIG WAR (Afghanistan wasn&#39;t going to destroy <em>that</em> much stuff)...but <em>Iraq</em>, well, now there was a Sovereign nation invaded by the US on intelligence that was twisted to suit the needs of the warmongers.</p>

<p>I fear the American public is now too firmly anti-US boots on the ground that TPTB will unleash a true atrocity, blame X to start the next war.</p>

Also look into the executive officers for the BRICS New Development bank - there are globalists and even duel agents for the International Monetary Fund among its ranks. BRICS NDB President K.V. Kamath has even conceded that the NDB and the IMF/World Bank are complementary institutions, not rivals.</p>

<p>Also, according to Indian economist Amitendu Palit of The Brookings Institution, TPP is expected to &quot;eventually mature into a regional trade agreement covering the entire Asia-Pacific.&quot;</p>
