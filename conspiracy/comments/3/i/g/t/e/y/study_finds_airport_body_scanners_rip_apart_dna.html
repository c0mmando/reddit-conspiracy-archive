<p>&quot;A team led by Los Alamos National Laboratory found that although the forces these waves exert on double-stranded DNA are tiny, in certain circumstances resonant effects can unzip the DNA strands, tearing them apart. This creates bubbles in the strands that can significantly interfere with processes such as gene expression and DNA replication, which can create highly mutagenic states predisposing to neoplastic (i.e., cancerous) growths.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A new model of the way the THz waves interact with DNA explains how the damage is done and why evidence has been so hard to gather&quot;</p>

I really only travel once or twice a year and the two airports I visit are somewhat inconsistent with using the scanners and most times they are just shuffling every other person through the scanner and most times I&#39;ve just ended up by chance in the metal detector line.

<blockquote>
<p>The possibility that low frequency electromagnetic radiation may affect genetic material, enzymatic reactions, etc. was introduced long ago (3), and since then has been a subject of constant debate. The energy of such radiation is too low to directly disrupt any chemical bonds or cause electronic transitions. Only a resonance-type interaction might lead to an appreciable, biological effect. In biomolecules such interactions are possible through the ubiquitous hydrogen bonds that have energies in the THz range. Numerous in vivo and in vitro experiments have been conducted to clarify low frequency radiation&#39;s ability to cause biological effects, such as chromosomal aberration, genetic damage etc. The experimental studies have been conducted under a variety of conditions, but mostly at frequencies below 0.01 THz, power below 1 mW/cm2, and short exposure times. The data collected in these conditions led to mixed conclusions: some studies reported significant genetic damages while others, although similar, showed none (4). The major international research project, ”THz-bridge” (5), which was specifically concerned with THz radiation genotoxicity concluded that: under some specific conditions of exposure, change in membrane permeability of liposomes was detected and an induction of genotoxicity was observed to occur in lymphocytes. Hence, this project confirmed the existence of THz genotoxicity, but it remains unclear under which specific conditions such effects occur.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Recent measurements confirm that only extended (6 hours) exposure to a weak THz field can cause genomic instability in human lymphocytes (6). Independently, it was reported that neurons exposed in vitro to powerful THz radiation (over 30 mW/cm2 ) cause infringement of the morphology of the cellular membranes and intracellular structures (7). The same work also showed that at decreasing power and/or at different frequencies the morphological changes do not occur. Recently, it was further pointed out that exposure to a low level THz radiation can interfere with the protein-recognition processes (8). It was also shown that exposure of mice to 3.6 THz high power (15 mW/cm2) radiation, for 30 min caused behavioral changes (9), while under short (5 min) exposure the changes could not be detected. <strong>Thus the available experimental data strongly suggest that THz-radiation can affect biological function, but only under specific conditions, viz. high power, or/and extended exposure, or/and specific THz frequency.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.5294">http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.5294</a></p>

<p>&quot;We consider the influence of a terahertz field on the breathing dynamics of double-stranded DNA. We model the spontaneous formation of spatially localized openings of a damped and driven DNA chain, and find that linear instabilities lead to dynamic dimerization, while true local strand separations require a threshold amplitude mechanism. Based on our results we argue that a specific terahertz radiation exposure may significantly affect the natural dynamics of DNA, and thereby influence intricate molecular processes involved in gene expression and DNA replication.&quot;</p>

<p>A new report by an independent task force commissioned by the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM), has found that people absorb less radiation from airport X-ray backscatter scanner than they do while standing in line waiting for the scan itself.</p>

<p>Measurements made on two scanners in active use at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), as well as seven other scanners not in active use at the time of measurement, found that full-body scanners deliver a radiation dose equivalent to what a standard man receives every 1.8 minutes on the ground, or every 12 seconds during an airplane flight.</p>

<p>Put another way, an individual would have to receive more than 22,500 scans in a year to reach the standard maximum safe yearly dose determined by the American National Standards Institute and the Health Physics Society, according to AAPM Report No. 217, &quot;Radiation Dose from Airport Scanners.&quot;</p>

Luckily, I&#39;ve seen TSA agents leap in front to stop the kid from going through...but seriously, they do that and then turn around and tell me &quot;It&#39;s totally safe, you know it&#39;s not radiation!&quot; like I&#39;m some kind of lunatic and haven&#39;t done the damned research to know I don&#39;t want to go through them and after they did a damned heroic Superman sweep to save a kid from going through...</p>

<p>If everyone stood up, they&#39;d have to stop using them - they need to get people through the lines and the goddamned things don&#39;t really work anyway, except to catch smuggled money. That they use those and NOT metal detectors is asinine. If they really wanted to &quot;catch turrorists,&quot; they&#39;d never skip the metal detector...and yet, every time, people walk through the detector OR the MMW machine. It&#39;s so stupid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just tell them you want to opt out of the body scanner (if you get chosen for one, sometimes its just random) and they will pat you down instead. I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about it. I&#39;ve done them before and while I&#39;m sure they aren&#39;t good for you, I don&#39;t think going through once will give you terminal cancer. Just eat extra healthy the next few days and try not to worry about it too much. I would be more worried about people who travel a lot and go through them on a regular basis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do it all the time. They just go around yelling &quot;Male|Female ASSIST&quot; and you wait a few minutes and someone who totally doesn&#39;t want to feel you up will come and go through the motions and maybe strike up a conversation to cover the fact that they&#39;re groping you and it&#39;s humiliating for both parties. Sucks, but just takes a few minutes. So few people even bother anymore that they are usually not total assholes about it anymore, but YMMV. </p>

<p>I found, for awhile, they stopped using the MMW machines and just used metal detectors, which is a much smarter security posture anyway (running you through the naked scanner where the agent may not even really be paying attention and plenty of things aren&#39;t caught by it and never metal detecting is just dumb from a security perspective IMHO), but last few times I&#39;ve travelled, I&#39;ve had to opt out.</p>

<p>Also, if you&#39;re tempted to feel like you have to tell them why you&#39;re opting out, you don&#39;t have to. There are plenty of valid reasons, though. One hilarious-sad reason is that a lot of the time, they end up fondling the people who go through the machines anyway! WTF. And real reasons, I have family members who beat cancer whose doctors told them to avoid them. And kids shouldn&#39;t go through them (TSA will usually actually enforce this, which shows there&#39;s SOME humanity somewhere).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the article --</p>

<p>The evidence that terahertz radiation damages biological systems is mixed. “Some studies reported significant genetic damage while others, although similar, showed none,” say Boian Alexandrov at the Center for Nonlinear Studies at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and a few buddies. Now these guys think they know why.</p>

<p>Alexandrov and co have created a model to investigate how THz fields interact with double-stranded DNA and what they’ve found is remarkable. They say that although the forces generated are tiny, resonant effects allow THz waves to unzip double-stranded DNA, creating bubbles in the double strand that could significantly interfere with processes such as gene expression and DNA replication. That’s a jaw dropping conclusion.</p>

<p>And it also explains why the evidence has been so hard to garner. Ordinary resonant effects are not powerful enough to do do this kind of damage but nonlinear resonances can. These nonlinear instabilities are much less likely to form which explains why the character of THz genotoxic
effects are probabilistic rather than deterministic, say the team.</p>

<p>startquote</p>

<p>A new report by an independent task force commissioned by the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM), has found that people absorb less radiation from airport X-ray backscatter scanner than they do while standing in line waiting for the scan itself.</p>

<p>Measurements made on two scanners in active use at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), as well as seven other scanners not in active use at the time of measurement, found that full-body scanners deliver a radiation dose equivalent to what a standard man receives every 1.8 minutes on the ground, or every 12 seconds during an airplane flight.</p>

<p>Put another way, an individual would have to receive more than 22,500 scans in a year to reach the standard maximum safe yearly dose determined by the American National Standards Institute and the Health Physics Society, according to AAPM Report No. 217, &quot;Radiation Dose from Airport Scanners.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I am unclear on the different types of machines.  Someone, maybe not OP, did mention X-rays.</p>

<p>Of course, it stands to reason that a known X-ray problem that you&#39;re exposed to for the whole length of the flight might be a lot more serious than some brief exposure to some scanner, regardless of which technology it&#39;s using.</p>
