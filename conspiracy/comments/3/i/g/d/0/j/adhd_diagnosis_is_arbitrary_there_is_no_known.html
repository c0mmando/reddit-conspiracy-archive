        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Say for example two kids are struggling In class. One is struggling a bit worse. Neither pay very much attention. One is just bad enough to be called ADHD according to the criteria, the other one isn&#39;t. Now this raises the question of responsibility. The moderately bad child is considered badly behaved by society, just a bad kid. Society doesn&#39;t help him. It is his fault.</p>

<p>The really bad kid is diagnosed with ADHD. In the eyes of society, his behaviour is not his fault. Various mechanisms kick In to help him. He probably ends up doing better than the moderately bad kid. People think oh that&#39;s fair the really bad one was Ill, the quite bad one was just a prick.</p>

<p>Do you see a problem here? There isn&#39;t a major physical process separating these two. Its just a question of arbitrary classification. One of them concentrates very badly and one concentrates quite badly. They both probably have weak cortical areas of the brain compared to the average. But there seems to be a common assumption. Its not the ADHD kids fault, he&#39;s ill. But bad kids are just stupid pricks who deserve to fail. The sad thing is that its completely arbitrary. There is no physical reason one group should take responsibility and the other group cannot. </p>

<p>The idea that ADHD kids are somehow ill and and badly behaved kids aren&#39;t seems to very popular and pushed hard by psychiatrists. But they&#39;re leading people to believe there is a physical basis for this, that there is some distinct process that they&#39;ve detected occurring in the brains of ADHD kids which means they are ill and normal badly behaved kids aren&#39;t. But this simply isn&#39;t true. ADHD is diagnosed on the basis of, do they behave badly enough? Its a simple question of scale and its entirely arbitrary. There is no evidence that ADHD is a disease, or a causative agent in its own right. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>thanks buddy! I just had a look at the scale for diagnosing ADHD. It is truly horrible. Here are a few choice highlights I took issue with.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nichq.org/childrens-health/adhd/resources/vanderbilt-assessment-scales">http://www.nichq.org/childrens-health/adhd/resources/vanderbilt-assessment-scales</a></p>

<p>This is what I said to the psychiatrist who sent me this scale.</p>

<p>There are a few glaring issues with this scale.</p>

<p>&quot;1. Talks excessively&quot;.... who defines &quot;excessively&quot;?
 It depends whether or not you like the child if you consider his talking excessive. A lot of kids talk a lot.</p>

<p>&quot;2. Has difficulty waiting in line&quot;
 All kids have difficultly waiting in line, it depends how long they have to wait for. Scale makes no mention of waiting time. How do you define &quot;difficulty&quot;?</p>

<p>3.&quot;Is “on the go” or often acts as if “driven by a motor&quot;
 lol, what? who the hell can grade that?</p>

<p>4.&quot;Runs about or climbs excessively in situations in which remaining seated is expected.&quot;
its really just sad that instinctive child behaviours are being defined as illness here. Do you understand that being seated for long periods is bad for posture and health? So kids who have an instinct to protect their own health from sitting all day are considered ill for doing that? Sitting all day leads to major back problems in later life.</p>

<ol>
<li>&quot;Has difficulty playing or engaging in leisure activities quietly&quot;
OK... ok... what. This is just ridiculous and disturbing now. what kind of a child plays quietly? reading this is upsetting me. What kid doesn&#39;t have &quot;difficultly&quot; (completely subjective term) playing quietly? have you ever actually seen a kid play &quot;quietly&quot;?</li>
</ol>

<p>6.&quot;Loses temper&quot;
 Oh yeah, this is completely unrelated to environmental factors obviously. Have you considered that someone is more likely to lose his temper if he doesn&#39;t like who he has to spend all day everyday with?</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry but this scale is a joke.</p>

<p>And this is actually how ADHD is diagnosed! this ridiculous scale, full of subjectivity and open to interpretation! It is quite literally absurd. I can&#39;t believe anyone can defend this shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy cow, that&#39;s pure insanity. Cut recess and all kids fit the criteria...</p>

<p>I can&#39;t believe people justify it either, but people who profit off it and lie to themselves about the impact can. Lots of pressure in the schools to rope kids in due to additional funding provided for &quot;special needs&quot; kids. I know a few parents who left public schools because of administration pressure to drug their kids. I wish these people would wake up to what they&#39;re really doing to these kids (and young adults, many now in their twenties and thirties) could stand up and fight to ensure what was done to them doesn&#39;t happen to the next generation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Psychiatry and its research is completely controlled by big pharma.  Its terrifying how they are misleading the public to take brain damaging drugs to &quot;fix&quot; &quot;chemical imbalances&quot; in their brains.</p>

<p>What&#39;s most insane is the research industry is trying to use the psych drug induced brain abnormalities in patients with depression, schizophrenia, ADHD, etc. as their proof that the mental illnesses have physical causes/evidence.  They are literally giving people brain abnormalities with their drugs and then saying, &quot;Aha! You see, we have proof people with these diseases have brain abnormalities!&quot;.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s have a look at an real example shall we.  Here&#39;s an actual Yale study from a few months ago about how teen brains with bipolar disorder develop differently:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006322315002772">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006322315002772</a></p>

<p>Article about the study: <a href="http://www.madinamerica.com/2015/06/teen-brain-develops-differently-in-bipolar-disorder-when-medicated/">http://www.madinamerica.com/2015/06/teen-brain-develops-differently-in-bipolar-disorder-when-medicated/</a></p>

<p>Near the end of this study they very briefly mention <strong>&quot;The majority of subjects were taking psychotropic medications.&quot;</strong>  And <strong>&quot;Subjects reported varying medication combinations, and medications were not studied systematically. Studying medication load would be ideal; however, reliability of reports of specific medications taken and amounts were not clear.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Basically, like saying &quot;Yeah we didn&#39;t control for the brain drug usage in these individuals like we should have, but never mind that, look at these brain abnormalities in bipolar teens!&quot;  </p>

<p>See how fucked up all this is? </p>

<p>A <a href="http://time.com/3399344/antidepressant-changes-the-brain-study-finds/">2014 study</a> showed that just a single dose of an SSRI antidepressant is enough to dramatically change brain structure <strong>in a healthy individual!</strong></p>

<p>Antipsychotics are known to shrink brain structure and <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763413001486">are the cause for the brain abnormalities</a> we see in schizophrenia patients.</p>

<p>Psychiatric drugs are a multi-billion dollar brain damage scam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I very much agree. School is just a brainwashing exercise. Children have instincts to learn via play, not to learn by sitting in windowless rooms. Sitting for long periods is extremely bad for their health. It is fighting their instincts to keep them locked in classrooms. The way mother nature intended us to learn was via play.</p>

<p>I am convinced that children are suffering from a major deficit of play. Seeing as psychiatrists have looked and failed to find a physical cause for ADHD, you can assume the reason is enviromental.</p>

<p>Then you notice how they&#39;re being forced against their instincts to sit in classrooms, and lead horrible boring lives, and it becomes obvious. ADHD isn&#39;t a physical disease. Its just a reaction to being extremely bored.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry, but this just seems like an uninformed rant. </p>

<p>It&#39;s grossly overdiagnosed, especially in children but to say there is no physiological basis for ADD is abjectly false. It&#39;s a speed mismatch of the prefrontal cortex in relation to the rest of the brain, which has been imaged with PET and SPECT scans.  </p>

<p>ADD may be overly medicated also, but that doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t exist. Some can manage ADD with heavy amounts of exercise and proper diet. I did so unintentionally when i was in the Navy. When I was running 6 miles a day, my symptoms were much less. Some people self-medicate with caffeine which can work but has diminishing returns over time. </p>

<p>I think there is a serious problem with big pharma &quot;pushing&quot;  these days, but to say something doesn&#39;t exist is just because it&#39;s being abused by pharmaceutical companies is nonsense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bullshit. It&#39;s been imaged! They have seen it on SPECT and PET scans. They have seen how it reacts to exercise, medication, food, sex, fear. </p>

<p>You are making claims based on what? Your opinion? For the first 2.5 decades of my life, I thought ADD and ADHD were strictly behavioral, that I could just work harder and it would be ok. Bullshit. I developed coping mechanisms, but the underlying condition was and is still there. Medication doesn&#39;t fix this either, it only temporarily corrects for the deficiency. </p>

<p>You say it&#39;s not proven. Do you believe that atoms exist? You&#39;ve never seen one, how do you know they exist? We can image them with electron microscopes (I&#39;ve done this myself, in fact).  We can perform tests that show they are there. </p>

<p>Just the same, we can know certain disorders exist in the brain by comparing them and imaging them. It&#39;s fucking science. Perpetuating ignorance on this just gives more validity to the ones abusing the system, pushing the pills and makes the rest of those trying to fix the problem, look like morons for buying into your opinionated shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im by no means the only one saying this. Here&#39;s an interesting story in the guardian about how a kid was threatened with expulsion to take the drug, he hates taking it but is sadly addicted. Some interesting opinions.

<p>There are books on either side of the debate:

<p>The opinion of a neurologist: adhd as fraud
<a href="http://psychrights.org/research/Digest/ADHD/ADHDAsFraud.htm">http://psychrights.org/research/Digest/ADHD/ADHDAsFraud.htm</a></p>

<p>The &#39;father&#39; of adhd, one of the researchers who helped define how it is seen today, admitted on his deathbed, &quot;ADHD is a fictional disease.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you say &quot;it has been imaged&quot; by these scans... Firstly, there&#39;s no way either kind of scan could detect a speed mismatch. This would involve investigating action potential rates. Not saying you&#39;re wrong about your theory but if you could link me to a paper I&#39;d been interested to see. </p>

<p>Secondly, if adhd is an extreme personality group, then brain scans will pick up brain differences compared to controls. This does not imply that there is some cause of these brain differences, different personality types have differing brain structures. Plasticity. So when people say &quot; scans have shown physical differences between an add group and controls&quot;, I don&#39;t doubt it at all. I also don&#39;t doubt extremely angry people would have slight differences in brain structures. Or extremely loving people. Or people with good memories. Any time you select for a personality type, you will be able to detect structural differences. </p>

<p>The science of atoms is very very different to the science of brain &quot;disorders&quot;. Having said that there is something interesting about atoms. They do exist, but they&#39;re mostly energy. They&#39;re made out of &quot;objects&quot; with no measurable size, linked up by energy. So if you asked &quot;does matter exist&quot; it would be a more interesting question. ADHD does exist. But it&#39;s nothing but a classification of personality types. </p>

<p>When you say &quot;we know certain disorders exist&quot; what you mean is, we know extreme personalities exist. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>same, we can know certain disorders exist in the brain by comparing them and imaging them. It&#39;s fucking science.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know it&#39;s totally fucking it!</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry to tell you this but long term use of Ritalin will have created the exact dopamine insensitivity that some people claim is the cause of ADHD. So while it may not have been an organic problem originally, after 25 years of Ritalin use, I can assure you, it is now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was diagnosed with ADHD at s younger age in grade school. Took concerta which turned me into a zombie. All the qualities I had were suppressed. It turned me into a whole other person who didn&#39;t eat any food and never had an appetite like a normal teenager should of had. Fuck that stuff and these wild diagnoses. Didn&#39;t the doctor who discovered adhd say on his deathbed that it is a fraud and it was just to sell pharmaceuticals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy cow, that&#39;s pure insanity. Cut recess and all kids fit the criteria...</p>

<p>I can&#39;t believe people justify it either, but people who profit off it and lie to themselves about the impact can. Lots of pressure in the schools to rope kids in due to additional funding provided for &quot;special needs&quot; kids. I know a few parents who left public schools because of administration pressure to drug their kids. I wish these people would wake up to what they&#39;re really doing to these kids (and young adults, many now in their twenties and thirties) could stand up and fight to ensure what was done to them doesn&#39;t happen to the next generation.</p>
