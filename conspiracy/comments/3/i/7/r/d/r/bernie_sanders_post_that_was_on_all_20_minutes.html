<p>Vote Smart&#39;s Synopsis:</p>

<p>Vote to pass a bill that requires more disclosure of lobbying information and which members request earmarked provisions.
Highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Requires lobbyists to file quarterly disclosure reports (Sec. 101).</p></li>
<li><p>Requires all general appropriation bills to include a list of earmarks with the name of the member that suggested the earmark (Sec. 501).</p></li>
<li><p>Increases the fine for non-compliance with lobbying disclosure requirements from $50,000 to $100,000 (Sec. 106).</p></li>
<li><p>Calls on Representatives, Delegates and Resident Commissioners of the House of Representatives to disclose all employment negotiations and suggests that the member should not vote on any issue that may present a conflict of interest as a result of employment negotiations (Sec. 202).</p></li>
<li><p>Requires permission from the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct before any Representative, Delegate, Resident Commissioner, officer, or employee of the House of Representatives can accept any travel gift, such as transportation, lodging and meals from a private source (Sec. 301).</p></li>
<li><p>Prohibits lobbyists from being a passenger on a corporate flight at the same time as a Representative, Delegate, Resident Commissioner, officer or employee of the House of Representatives (Sec. 303).</p></li>
<li><p>Authorizes &quot;random audits&quot; of information disclosed by lobbyists by the Office of the Inspector General of the House of Representatives (Sec. 401).</p></li>
<li><p>Encourages all members of the House of Representatives to receive ethics training and requires all employees of the House of Representatives to participate in ethics training every two years and new employees to complete ethics training within 30 days of being hired (Sec. 502).</p></li>
<li><p>Limits individual yearly donations to a 527 organization&#39;s non-federal account to $25,000 (Sec. 1003).</p></li>
<li><p>Repeals limits on party expenses for a candidate in general elections (Sec. 1004).</p></li>
<li><p>Terminates all pension payments to any Member of the House of Representatives who is convicted of certain ethics violations, including bribery of public officials and witnesses, acting as an agent of foreign principles or of defrauding the United States (Sec. 601).</p></li>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Voted NO on restricting independent grassroots political committees.</p>

<p>A &quot;527 organization&quot; is a political committee which spends money raised independently of any candidate&#39;s campaign committee, in support or opposition of a candidate or in support or opposition of an issue. Well-known examples include MoveOn.org (anti-Bush) and Swift Boat Veterans for Truth (anti-Kerry). Voting YES would regulate 527s as normal political committees, which would greatly restrict their funding, and hence would shift power to candidate committees and party committees. The bill&#39;s opponents say:
This legislation singles out 527 organizations in an effort to undermine their fundraising and is a direct assault on free speech.
This bill would obstruct the efforts of grassroots organizations while doing nothing to address the culture of corruption in Congress.
H.R. 513 is an unbalanced measure that favors corporate trade associations over independent advocates. Corporate interests could continue spending unlimited and undisclosed dollars for political purposes while independent organizations would be subject to contribution limits and source restrictions.
H.R. 513 also removes all limits on national and state party spending for Congressional candidates in primary or general elections--an unmasked attack on the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act and clear evidence that the true intention in advancing H.R. 513 is not reform, but partisan advantage in political fundraising.</p>

<p>This is completely untrue. There were several punitive measures in the bill that would make ethics offenders pay a heavier price then the status quo, as well as measures to try and educate and prevent these ethics problems.<br/>
Examples of these include; </p>

<p>Increases the fine for non-compliance with lobbying disclosure requirements from $50,000 to $100,000 (Sec. 106).</p>

<p>Authorizes &quot;random audits&quot; of information disclosed by lobbyists by the Office of the Inspector General of the House of Representatives (Sec. 401).</p>

<p>Encourages all members of the House of Representatives to receive ethics training and requires all employees of the House of Representatives to participate in ethics training every two years and new employees to complete ethics training within 30 days of being hired (Sec. 502).</p>

<p>Terminates all pension payments to any Member of the House of Representatives who is convicted of certain ethics violations, including bribery of public officials and witnesses, acting as an agent of foreign principles or of defrauding the United States (Sec. 601).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(3) H.R. 513 is an unbalanced measure that favors corporate trade associations over independent advocates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what is the difference between corporate trade associations and independent advocates when they both are required to register as the same 527 organizations?  This bill was only directed at those who are registered lobbyists,  and the bill makes absolutely no distinction between corporate trade associations or independent advocates.  This is a red herring in my opinion. </p>

<p>I have not yet read the entire text of the bill,  only the highlights of it by VoteSmart. I&#39;m very surprised to see this claim,  but if true, it certainly is cause for concern.  I don&#39;t know if it is a deal killer,  meaning I still think the pro&#39;s still outweigh the con&#39;s,  but I do understand this point if true. </p>

<p>I just skimmed through the entire text of the bill and didn&#39;t see this provision right away,  but again,  I could be mistaken. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keep in mind this was 2006. Our critique needs to be in context.</p>

<p>The 2002 McCain-Feingold Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act was still at full strength. We were a full 4 years ahead of 2010&#39;s <strong>Citizens United</strong> decision that let loose the gates of corporate spending and opened SuperPACs to unlimited indirect political activity.</p>

<p>What was going on then? Total 2006 outside spending (regardless of partisan leaning) was around $171m. The left-leaning outside spenders out-raised the GOP by a big margin, on the back of what was then a record donation by Soros - $20m. By comparison, 2014 hit $880m in outside spending, and 2016 is predicted to easily top $2bn with the Kochs declaring an intent to spend $1bn between them. </p>

<p>Today and 2006 are <em>completely</em> different ballparks. And we shouldn&#39;t forget that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>read the actual text of the bills before you say anything. Online Freedom of Speech Act: &quot;To amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to exclude communications over the Internet from the definition of public communication.&quot; -<a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?c109:2:./temp/%7Ec109vW5rl1::">http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?c109:2:./temp/~c109vW5rl1::</a></p>

<p>This would allow unlimited funding for anything online campaign related and Bernie Sanders is correct in voting no for it. You can never go by the title of a bill. you always have to read the full text and then some.</p>

<p>edit:</p>

<p>Federal Election Integrity Act of 2006 is the same way.<br/>
&quot;(1) INDIVIDUALS VOTING IN PERSON-(A) REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE IDENTIFICATION- Notwithstanding any other provision of law and except as provided in subparagraph (B), the appropriate State or local election official may not provide a ballot for an election for Federal office to an individual who desires to vote in person unless the individual presents to the official-- (i) a government-issued, current, and valid photo identification;&quot; <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?c109:4:./temp/%7Ec109UW1dyQ::">http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?c109:4:./temp/~c109UW1dyQ::</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s another voter ID law requiring government issued ID at the time that you submit your ballot. And again Bernie is right for voting no for this law.</p>

<p>&quot;Public communication. The term ‘public communication’ 
means a communication by means of any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication, newspaper, magazine, outdoor advertising facility, mass mailing, or telephone bank to the general public, or any other form of general public political advertising.&quot; <a href="http://www.fec.gov/law/feca/feca.pdf">http://www.fec.gov/law/feca/feca.pdf</a> pg.31 </p>

<p>These are laws pertaining to public campaigns. If we removed cable or mailing from the list image the amount of spam you would get from every candidate. Think if the Koch brothers or Rupert Murdock had unlimited funding for campaign videos.</p>

<p>They claimed medical advice is not allowed, which is simply untrue. They allow medical advice all day long, and only apply that rule when it&#39;s convenient for them. Anyway, I reworded everything and resubmitted my comment, then asked for approval, and they simply ignored me because there&#39;s nothing they can say now.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d still say breast milk is the best option. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.unicef.org/nutrition/index_24824.html">Breastfed children have at least six times greater chance of survival in the early months than non-breastfed children.  An exclusively breastfed child is 14 times less likely to die in the first six months than a non-breastfed child, and breastfeeding drastically reduces deaths from acute respiratory infection and diarrhoea, two major child killers (Lancet 2008). The potential impact of optimal breastfeeding practices is especially important in developing country situations with a high burden of disease and low access to clean water and sanitation. But non-breastfed children in industrialized countries are also at greater risk of dying - a recent study of post-neonatal mortality in the United States found a 25% increase in mortality among non-breastfed infants. In the UK Millennium Cohort Survey, six months of exclusive breast feeding was associated with a 53% decrease in hospital admissions for diarrhoea and a 27% decrease in respiratory tract infections.</a></p>

<p>We just need to do something about these toxins, and there are some ways you can avoid them. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfluorooctanoic_acid">Industrial waste, stain resistant carpets, carpet cleaning liquids, house dust, microwave popcorn bags, water, food, some cookware and PTFE such as Teflon.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Toxicologists estimate that microwave popcorn could account for about 20% of the PFOA levels measured in an individual consuming 10 bags a year if 1% of the fluorotelomers are metabolized to PFOA.[76] Fluorotelomer coatings are used in fast food wrappers, candy wrappers, and pizza box liners.[78] PAPS, a type of paper fluorotelomer coating, and PFOA precursor, is also used in food contact papers.[63]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hopefully you didn&#39;t miss that long, drawn out debate I had with the Nestle shill last week. I think part of the problem in 3rd world countries is mixing the formula with shitty water (shill&#39;s argument), and the other (main) part of the problem is the immune system benefits you get from breast milk. I think the reason the deaths are higher is 3rd world countries is also explained by the shitty hospitals. Still, in first world nations, the deaths from formula are extremely high even with chlorinated water and decent hospitals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why anyone thinks formula is okay is insane. Maybe a bit or a supplemental amount. How were children fed for centuries? Millennia? Formula is eugenics. Weakening the overall gene pool. It is a way to make customers for big pharma. It is the perfect weapon against a mother who has a job.</p>

<p>How is using the convenience of formula to weaken children justifiable unless it is eugenics?</p>

<p>I would disagree with you on BS being the best candidate for the job currently.  He&#39;s been in Washington for 30 years, but now all of a sudden wants to change Washington, lol.  </p>

<p>We need someone who is not an entrenched career politician if we truly want to see Washington change.  Howard Shultz, Ben Carson, and Donald Trump I feel are all better choices for president then Bernie Sanders.  His voting record is a clear glimpse into what type of president he&#39;s going to be, and in my mind, when he votes against investigating Jack Abrahmoff, a political fundraiser who was caught funneling money to candidates on both sides, that&#39;s just about all I need to see myself.</p>

<p>lol, Bernie is much more likely to bankrupt America then Trump would be, but I do sympathize with you somewhat on Trump, which is the reason he was last on my list.  I think the effect he&#39;s having on political correctness is absolutely a great thing for political discourse, as well as the fact that both the Republican and Democratic establishments are trying to derail him.</p>

<p>I really do like Dr. Ben Carson the most though.</p>

<p>That I can dig, it certainly is making things a bit more interesting. I hate Trump because my family were some of the people he fucked over unashamedly then goes on TV saying he actually cares about America. </p>

<p>I&#39;m really sorry to hear that.  I know that you aren&#39;t alone, and that there are probably quite a few family&#39;s who he&#39;s fucked over, in real ways.  Someone told me the other day, Trump can definitely not be bought, but will be quick to sell out the American people if the price is right.  I&#39;d never though of it like that, but it certainly does make a lot of sense, seeing how he&#39;s a business man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely do agree that his voting record,  compared to Hillary Clinton&#39;s is much better,  and he has bird
Voted &quot;the right way&quot;, and against the Democratic establishment  many,  many times,  but he still has quite a few votes I&#39;ve found through VoteSmart which really make me question him. </p>

<p>Check my comment history if you want to see some of the more questionable votes he&#39;s made. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aaron Shwartz just took 2 barrel rolls in his grave. Mods are just volunteers that are told what to do by reddit. Because if they don&#39;t they will no longer be a moderator especially in r/politics.</p>

<p>The point being with these rules is so that safe speech continues on reddit and content they don&#39;t want to be discussed gets trashed. Not freedom of speech, you people are already letting them place rules over the Internet. Reddit already tells me to do enough.</p>

<p>hard to say, one side says if he goes to far he can&#39;t be elected, other side says you don&#39;t go far enough it won&#39;t matter.  he did say one thing i&#39;m very much behind, that he can&#39;t do it alone, that we the people would need to stand up and support him in getting a new congress elected that is not corporate whores, in that i&#39;m most definately behind him.</p>

<p>lol, grilling from the press.  i don&#39;t know that i&#39;ve seen that in my lifetime. </p>
