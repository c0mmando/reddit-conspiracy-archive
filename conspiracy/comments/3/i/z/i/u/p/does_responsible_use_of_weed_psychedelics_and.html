      <p>
       I ask this because, long story short, I dabbled a handful of times over the course of just last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to talk about MDMA most specifically, a substance I've been exposed to a total of three separate times. Each experience was so rewarding and fulfilling, I can't for the life of me understand how there are addicts to this substance. The last thing I felt compelled to do after each time was another round the following day, much less the following month.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, here is a brief timeline of personal experiences I happen to base my theory on:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         November, 2013 - Protests in Ukraine are starting around this time as a I light up a bong bowl one evening at a friend's house after work. Although I'm not personally religious, I have always been a big believer in following your gut and intuition when in some degree of critical doubt. There are certain realizations that just hit one sometimes, whether it's as predictable as a current event or as enlightening as falling in love. So this conversation among a few of us gets political fast when this vision - or - THC induced idea, rather - hits me that the resulting series of events in Eastern Europe from that point onward could very likely spiral into a new cold war and potentially a hot war of NATO's and Russia's doing unlike anything ever seen in seventy years. If you happen to have seen the latest Avengers movie, remember that scene when that female mutant character who has it out for Tony Stark (forget her name) first realizes Ultron plans to destroy the entire world simply by tuning into some kind of telekinetic sixth sense. In a similar light to my own experience with weed at the time, the idea that Russia would intervene in the name of protecting Russian speakers in Ukraine, which Russia eventually did, seemed chillingly inevitable to me at the time as I lit up another bud bowl. I shared this thought with everyone else. They remained skeptical of my assessment until just the following February. Keep in mind it was also not yet obvious at that point in time (Late 2013) that the protests in Ukraine, not quite unlike those just short of a decade earlier (the Orange Revolution) that did not result in armed insurgency and civil war that we're seeing today, would descend into Euromaidan upheaval, regime change, and regional war involving Russia. I think it is obvious that this is one way marijuana may make one more privy to alternative explanations for contemporary world affairs, hence another reason the substance is dangerous in the eyes of power hungry politicians.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Early March, 2014 - My first MDMA roll (trip). First discovered Dave Matthews Band. Chain smoked weed halfway through. Very vividly inspirational. Improved clarity and focus. Would not recommend for a rave. At one point, I was mentally time travelling to previous life experiences and viewing mutli-decade old childhood soccer game halftime orange snack times as if they were being experienced again! 3/4 of the way into this state I was in, news was breaking that the Russian army was rolling into Crimea. If you happen to have ever seen V For Vendetta, you will remember a scene when Inspector Finch first realizes how unexplained history comes together in a mental montage of sorts. I saw the unfolding series of events involving Ukraine then as a continuation of WW2 masterminded by the political heads of both Russia and the U.S., as rationale to further pillage each country's respective population. I immediately started considering personal alternatives to a military draft that's seemed inevitable to me ever since. Also felt compelled to read Murray Rothbard's For A New Liberty my first time. Terrence McKenna's 'tripping apes' hypothesis  seemed to make a lot more sense from here onward to explain at least to some degree basic human evolution.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         June 2014 - My second MDMA roll. No weed this time. Go on a joy ride across town to help a friend move. Northern lights show on the ceiling at the end of it! News was that CIA operative Qaddafi-era defector General Khalifa Haftar was attemtping to seize political power in Libya. America-friendly General Sisi was further consolidating his own power against the population in neighboring Egypt. Uncanny historical parallels to Iraq's Saddam and Chile's Pinochet were noted, despite widespread mass media 'praise' for Sisi's 'law &amp; order' stability measures.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Mid-August 2014 - My third and most recent MDMA roll. Day after Robin Williams' death. Fallout from Ferguson was fresh. Police brutality is rampant in my city. Cops just killed a guy down the street. ISIS crisis coverage was everywhere. Seemed obvious from the start that they were the same 'moderate' Libyan and Syrian rebel groups supported by the U.S. just the previous year. Everyone in politics is losing their collective shits over a bunch of beheading-happy militias with machetes who happen to be struggling to control vast swaths of desert as it is over half a world away. While rolling I note immediate renewed fluency in conversation. I look at impending ISIS doom and gloom coverage and instead of all encompassing 9/11-invoking intoxicating fear that was intended, I feel able to see right through it and laugh at it. Like I could 'take on the whole empire myself.' Hold a meeting later in the day with a former co-worker that ends up our most productive meeting yet. Resolve to flee inner city Phoenix (an abysmal apartheid regime for Mexicans) for Southern California the very next day. Cali kush helped a ton ease the comedown I was feeling just a couple days later. Also helped me fall in love on a deeper level than I ever had before up until that point.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       If there was one recurring theme I noticed each time that I rolled, it was not only greater connectivity with others, as well as this overwhelming desire to improve myself as a person and come to terms with long since past personal predicaments. There was this revelation of sorts that I noticed that seemed to suggest we humans were our own 'gods' in a sense. As 'guardians of our galaxy,' the sky should be seen as the limit to our potential as individual people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I gained an immaculate appreciation to the concept of individual liberty of all people while on these substances.
      </p>
      <p>
       I contend that this is one reason above others world governments dread legalization.

       Here are the proven facts about the 'war on drugs' begun in 1968:
      </p>
      <p>
       The government became terrified in the late 1960s as readily available acid became a recreational 'experience of choice' in a wide variety of social, university and youth communities.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the most profound effects reported by most people was an awareness of the connectedness of all living things, a deep respect for life and a completely noncompetitive, nonwarlike set of beliefs that seemed to flow from the experience of dropping acid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nixon and the military absolutely freaked out that the whole 'tune in, turn on, drop out' mentality was a direct result of the higher awareness triggered by the acid.
      </p>
      <p>
       That was the beginning of the official 'war on drugs'.  Basically they fought drugs because it made the population resistant to global militarization and military service.  They saw it as a menace to the entire military-industrial cabal that rules our country to this day.

       Timothy Leary's, "drop out" was a message to enlisted men in the military. He himself had dropped out of West Point, the premier U.S Military Academy, many years before. Though he did go onto be a corporal in the Army specializing in psychology.

       Weed and molly most people use just to have fun, so although you can use them for personal growth/introspection, most people don't. Which is why the government is finally coming around to legalizing weed because it's just so minor compared to other things out there, and doesn't really have as much of a mental bend as more powerful psychoactive drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       LSD and shrooms are the two biggies. The government keeps these two illegal for a very VERY good reason, for very different reasons than heroin and cocaine are illegal for example. Those drugs are illegal to create markets for the CIA to make money in, for private prisons, and to justify expanding police forces. They don't actually benefit you on a mental level the way LSD or shrooms do (or other similar substances such as LSA etc. etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
       LSD/LSA/Shrooms etc. dissolve preconceived thought structures very effectively, and essentially wake people up from the haze they are living in. The mental haze that modern society creates. Tripping is one of the healthiest, most beneficial things you can do, and it intrinsically makes you more creative as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government does not want creative people that see the "system" for what it is. They want motivated workers, and predictable people. Predictable is controllable. That's what matters.

       Yeah, I definitely believe this. LSD, especially, increases neuroplasticity and helps you re-form deeply embedded cultural or cognitive programming. TPTB have spent too much money and effort programming you just right for you to go messing that up!

       Excellent post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just some concise thoughts for you that I feel pretty strongly about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Psychoactive drugs act as an amplifier of self-generating thoughts.  Thus, if one has led a life of intelligent introspection, he/she is bound to hit seemingly novel, useful ideas. The system doesn't want us reaching new ideas about politics, government, war, terrorism, since it relies on and feeds off of the status quo, and in general, ignorance.

       I've often thought one of the many reasons weed is illegal and alcohol is legal is because alcohol makes you "dumb" and docile, while weed gives the user a sort of intense introspection.
      </p>

       Big G doesn't want you to think too much about who you are or what you are and what your place is in this world, they want you to work hard all week and numb yourself on your time off.

       I know of casual drug users who are steadfast in their mainstream political views so it may or may not have something to do with this, but in my opinion it more concerns government-control of the drug trade and getting the masses hooked on pure forms of narcotics, leading to their early death or imprisonment. Dilute forms of illegal drugs are actually quite beneficial: for example dilute cocaine can be used as a substitute for coffee and is thought to be more effective than coffee as a stimulant.

        Here's an interesting article about how governments have banned dilute forms of drugs to create black markets

       I agree with your comment and I think there should be a distinction between drugs which are heavily abused and psychedelics which generally speaking are not addictive. Then again, I wouldn't consider consuming a massive amount of LSD particularly beneficial. As with most drugs, there are therapeutic doses and there are recreational doses like how a dose of dilute cocaine would be considered therapeutic, whereas snorting cocaine is recreational and probably detrimental to health. Once dilute forms of cocaine and other narcotics became banned, there were no safe alternatives and so concentrated forms of these substances became prevalent (people even started injecting cocaine which is much more fatal) and thus these drugs are commonly portrayed as harmful and non-therapeutic, when the opposite is actually true when they are used in a dilute form.

       Really nice read. Ask yourself this...is it any surprise that alcohol is legal while weed isnt? Alcohol is more addictive, causes permanent brain damage (rather than creating new connections like weed does). Not only that but it can make even the nicest people violent.

       The pro-drug media would like us to believe that almost everyone has used illegal drugs at some point in their lives, and that in the 60s and 70s, "everyone" was doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that in mind, I would fully expect Western society to have evolved into the new stage that these people claim comes from use of these substances.

       There is the methane theory for hemp and the deliberate association with marijuana as a drug with African American and Mexican culture in a very negative way.

       I wonder if, considering that generally speaking we have the same powers that be running the show now as when the drug/users were criminalized then later enhanced as crimes, the drug laws are r ooted in the powerful often referred to here as illuminati, or libetarian, did not ban them, in particular marijuana,  because of the usefulness for many beneficial reasons. There is that ancient connection between an Arab group and the earliest that I know of Illuminati group, the Templars though there is Charlemagne, was there an Eastern connection there before he aligned with the Roman Christians?

       In my 20s I did so many drugs. My favorite was MDMA. Real MDMA that was powdered. Back then in order to press into pill form it had to have additives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many would cut with heroin or meth so it wasn't clean in most cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       I felt so good during and after it. Over time I got older and realized that I didn't need drugs to cope with life I needed stability more. So I quit that shit and just grew out of it I guess.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of the people that were around during that phase of my life still do drugs to some extent and none of them are what I would consider a success. They are more like functioning alcoholics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Partly why I don't support recreational use of weed. Medicinal yeah all day long cause it works, but just getting high cause you can seems like dumbing down the population to me or a way to buy support from the younger generation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I support medicinal use for MDMA as well cause its been shown to help with PTSD. If we can get just one cured of those damn emotions and become functioning as a member of society with MDMA then do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have a culture of older people that still think reefer is the devil. We need to have an age where you did good and now you got to go. People are living longer then they should and its putting a strain on the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't ask me what the age should be cause I don't have an idea. With all these drugs that are legal with a script makes you wonder how they are considered safe yet the ones nature gives us are so damn bad.

       So you're suggesting someone would lace a pill with a more expensive drug? Look at an ecstasy test result database; there is not one instance of H laced MDMA. It's an urban myth. Methamphetamine can be found somewhat irregularly. MDMA does not need adulterants to be pressed into a pill. How do you know your powder is pure? Wouldn't it be far easier to cut a powder with any other powder? The market responded so gleefully with Molly because it was easy to cut. A dealer can't get mdma pills and cut the pill with anything. The assumption you've made that a powder is more pure than a pill has no basis in reality and has lead to the majority of Molly not even being mdma.

       Its what I was told by the guy pressing the pills. Then with dancesafe they tested a few for other drugs. Said they had the drugs I listed
      </p>
      <p>
       When I took powder in they went right to the color they said was MDMA. So that's how I knew.

       Not a doubt in my mind it was MDMA. It was tested crystal rocks from Europe each time.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't so much hallucinations I experienced as it was renewed clarity, focus, and recollection of memories and intuitions I had long since forgotten about. Made me feel more whole overall, as if I was able to experience more of myself as well as the wider world around me. That one time with the 'northern lights' was the only thing close to a hallucination that I experienced, and this lasted no more than just a few minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if you take a look at erowid and other trip report sites, you will notice that some users have been known to experience visuals much more intense than mine were. I took no more than 70-120 mg of the stuff each time. Visuals are apparently most certainly not unheard of with MDMA, especially when taken in higher dosages.

       Drugs (psychedelics in particular) are illegal because they expand your consciousness, allow you to think for yourself, and ignite the natural curiosity within you. This inevitably makes one question the validity of this dystopian reality the governments have forced upon us. This is dangerous to them for they require subservience, ignorance, and blind faith in order to maintain their control over the world's population.

       Either that or there are some people that are just resistant to bullshit. I've dabbled in recreational drugs here n there over the years, there are some things that politicians and public figures say that just don't sound right. Like, it sounds and feels so faked, so staged I don't understand how people could by it.

       Cocaine and heroin are money-making boogeymen. Both make one self-centered (I only know of the former, I'm sure the latter is the same or worse). Weed is relaxing and generates thought but makes one complacent. I thinks MDMA is similar but way more potent, yet had been proven to have therapeutic effects to PTSD sufferers. The stuff that's hard to find- LSD and mushrooms- really opens your mind. I've had a small dose of the latter, but I know these substances really broaden your thoughts. They are also the hardest to source. I'm sure this isn't an accident. LSD can lead to an "ego death," imagine anyone with some semblance of awareness of current affairs dosed with LSD. Money is bullshit, "freedom" is bullshit, war is a racket, etc. If more people were able to use LSD to percieve "objectively," or more so laterally, public opinions would change en masse...

       If you look closely, most of those advocating for anti-drug legislation are Jews. Most pharmacists in the United States, coincidentally, happen to be Jews. In Hollywood, a predominantly Jewish industry, the use of alcohol abounds while the use of other substances are subtly stigmatized in films. Think about it: have you ever SEEN a Jew smoke weed or roll on MDMA? NO! Essentially, what I'm trying to say is that China is to blame.

       I can count the number of times I've posted in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       on one hand with several fingers missing, including this post. That kind of reasoning is why.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time, I've oft wondered if
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is the kinda crowd who'd be onboard for
       <a href="/r/Technostism">
        /r/Technostism
       </a>
       .
