       Looks like we've got ourselves a meteorologist here! Would you kindly avail us of your scientific expertise by explaining how the recent atmospheric conditions in Massachusetts and California have affected the formation, dissipation and visibility of airplane contrails, preferably with the specific data supporting your theory?

       Contrail formation is a function of the atmospheric profile for temperature, pressure and water vapor content.

       Then one should be able to conclude atmospheric conditions simply by watching the behavior of aerosols, making data from other metrics basically unnecessary. Why aren't they used to forecast weather or as a metric for atmospheric conditions if the conditions required are so consistent? Why aren't persistent contrails ever predicted?

       Good point.  I hadn't tought of that.  I'll let the WMO know that they can just "watch" sub-micron particles and they'll know the vertical distribution of temperature, pressure and water vapor.  Thanks.

       Well they only persist when conditions are A, B and C right? So if the trails are persisting it means conditions must be A, B and C otherwise the trails would dissipate. If the data from temp, press and saturation metrics indicate A, B and C than it can be concluded that trails will be persistent during those conditions. Use your science and tell us when atmospheric conditions in the NE will be most ripe for artificial, jet-sourced cirrus clouds to form and persist.

       Yeah, so contrail formation will only tell you that the conditions are such that A, B and C are occurring.  That's a narrow combination of parameters, and it doesn't work if there aren't any planes flying.  Which means you won't know much if there aren't any trails.  Oh and also that only gives you information about the atmospheric profile at the contrail altitude.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meteorologists need full atmospheric profiles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now regarding your question, as I said in my other comment, the burden of proof is not on me, but if you want to honestly show that those cannot be contrails, then I can give you a few tips.  (Although the idea that they are not contrails is silly, you will learn a few things about the atmosphere.)
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Learn about contrails and the conditions under which they form
       </li>
       <li>
        Learn how to download and analyze atmospheric profiles; different organizations provide such data, usually based on "reanalysis" of collected weather data which includes data from ground stations, balloons and satellites.
       </li>
       <li>
        For any given observation of *trails, get the airliner altitude from some flight tracking website, download the atmospheric profiles for that day, and see if the conditions were about right at the altitude at which the trails formed.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       If you observe trails forming when they shouldn't, then come back and make a post here with your data.  If you are right it will be investigated.

       Look, chemtrails aren't my area of interest, but your epistemology is terrible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why didn't they see any trails today? Because of atmospheric conditions. How do you know the atmospheric conditions are appropriate? Because they didn't see any trails.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's circular reasoning.

       I don't even know how to argue with you. You're just wrong. Chemtrails are not contrails, I've seen both on the same day, the same atmospheric conditions. There is nothing that leaves gigantic clouds in the fucking air. No jet exhaust that does that. You can stop trying to hard now.

         Atmospheric conditions change with altitude and location.  How do you know the conditions were identical?

      <p>
       Correct.  What happens is that clouds cause more clouds to form.

       Contrails just do not linger in the air all day, or form 'clouds'. I don't have anything else to say about it. Neither of us can really prove our point, so... it's useless arguing.
      </p>
      <p>
       'Clouds cause more clouds to form'. This doesn't make any sense. Airplanes do not create clouds on a clear blue day. They just don't. Something is being sprayed using airplanes. You're not going to convince me otherwise because you have no evidence. And I can't convince you, either. So bye!

       SE USA here. I've absolutely noticed a decline in the trails recently. Still seeing them here and there, but it's nothing like the norm. Loads of fighter jets fluttering about, though. And yes. Beautiful blue skies that make you stop and stare.
