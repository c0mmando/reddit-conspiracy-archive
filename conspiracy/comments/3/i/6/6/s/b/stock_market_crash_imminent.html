       It's happening, within a month or two we are going to have a pretty darn big crash.  Probably sooner at this rate. Let's all pay close attention to what is going on in the coming months, whatever is going on behind the scenes will come to light at least to an extent when the markets plunge.

       What are you talking about ?  People are predicting a "crash".  To me, that means 50% drop or more.  You can make a KILLING if you accurately short that kind of thing.  You buy an option to sell Apple 3 months from now, at 80% of today's price.  Most people think the price of the stock then will about what it is today, so they'd love to buy at 80%, so they'll sell you those options, lots of them and for very cheap.  3 months from now, the price is down to 50%, you buy at the 50% level and sell at the 80% level.  You're rich !

       I agree with this. If I knew what I was doing and what stocks to short -- Twitter? Apple? Luxury brands galore? -- I'd do it. But you never know what the reaction is going to be to a crash from the government, who can change the laws and rules anytime they want.

       Just stay out of debt, because that's how they've got you. Once you owe them money, they can possibly put you in debtors' prison or track you even more than they do now, or who knows what.

       If we have an economic collapse, a lot of people will vote for the guy who seems the least corrupted, too. The guy who says he will put the brass tacks to the wealthy elite who caused this mess. We'd definitely see a Sanders v Trump election, at that point. Then, if the whole thing isn't completely rigged from the get-go, it'll just depend on which side has more people show up to vote.

       Who knows? You're in good company, there are literally millions of you, and many haven't paid anything on the debt in a year or more. Student debt is one of the things you'd hope they'd try to reorganize come the collapse. But who knows? They change the rules and laws all the time. 
But I'd say you're better off w/ student debt than automobile loan debt, credit card debt, loan shark debt, etc.

       Wait until it happens then hit the streets and get these guys arrested. Don't listen to financial advice given on reddit please. Don't try to out smart the market. Stay conservative for sure, but shorting the market can lead to infinite losses, and with the government making the markets far from free, you would be better of trying to predict how they try to fix it than trying to guess where the markets goin

       This all sounds strangely familiar....

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On October 8, the Indonesian stock market halted trading, after a 10% drop in one day.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Times of London reported that the meltdown was being called the Crash of 2008 and older traders were comparing it with Black Monday in 1987. The fall that week of 21 percent was not as large a drop as the 28.3 percent fall 21 years earlier, but some traders were saying it was worse. “At least then it was a short, sharp, shock on one day. This has been relentless all week.”[17] Business Week also referred to the crisis as a "stock market crash" or the "Panic of 2008."[18]

       Exactly! Men control the world's finances and these men love symbolism, which is why the Shemitah is important - they will make sure that major events happen on the date that they feel matters. They will make the superstition come true.

       Anyone who spends anytime in this subreddit and does any research at all has got to see that that practitioners of the dark occult are deeply involved in the financial system.

       What they believe may or may not be "true" or "real." But that doesn't matter -- their belief itself is real, and guides their actions. You don't have to believe in Islam to be blown up by a suicide bomber. You don't have to be Christian to see you local abortion clinic's doctor get shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       These occult beliefs DON'T HAVE TO BE REAL to have people following the script dictated by those beliefs. All they have to have are people who DO believe they're real and are acting accordingly.

       Regardless of who or what the beliefs of the elites are, it's the majorities willing participation that enslaves us.

      <p>
       Your silly comparison to being blown up by a suicide bomber has nothing to do with our controlled monetary system, or the headline of this post.  You just threw the above nonsensical statement in, which proves nothing but your lack of understanding and awareness.

       I don't like bananas, or "believe" in the health benefits, but I should be cautious, because many people do, and on my morning walks I may slip on a banana peel and fall to a slippery death.

      <p>
       I drink alcohol, but I don't "believe" in driving while intoxicated. But a lot of people do drive while intoxicated. I'm always on the look-out for these silly drunk drivers, because my life's in danger while on the road.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you see how silly your logic is here, because these things are uncontrollable and do not require participation to be affected. This is the complete opposite of our controlled monetary system, which affects everyone but only when there is collective participation.  And this is where we are now.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are enslaved to the money masters because we have agreed to their terms, and I don't need the Shemitah to blame or explain a crash in the economy. Why, because the Shemitah is bullshit!

       Depends on how far off of the deep end you want to go.  Some believe that there is a line going back to the Pharaohs that have accumulated and passed on vast amounts of wealth.  Keeping their beliefs rooted in the occult.  Basically, all of the people in power today are from the same bloodline.

       Ya know, talking down to people and being snarky only serves to undermine your points, which are actually valid and should be heard. This isn't the best way to reach people. Have patience. Some people haven't had the exposure and experience to be able to wrap their head around the all encompassing truth, yet. If you want people to come to share your philosophical understanding of reality, then you're going to need to present it as a place where people are welcome. Alienating people with an arrogant, demeaning tone of superiority will only widen the divide.

       Not true at all.  It doesn't matter how you say or explain something.  If they are not ready to wake up, then they're not going to wake up, and nothing I say will do it.  I have a lot of experience in conversing with people who will fight me at every sentence no matter how kind and compassionate I am.  And when I say fight I really mean they have no ability to listen to anyone but themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact 99.9% real life conversations I have are one-sided, where I simply listen.  The majority today are completely distracted and caught up in the game. They have know idea how to quite their minds, and have lost their ability to critically observe and rationalize.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this why a variety of tactics can and should be used.  Let's face reality here, some people can obtain awareness in 3 seconds, some may see it in 30 years, or 50.  But some individuals will never see it even on their death beds.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why Zen masters would stir things up.  If you have a drinking problem, well then the first thing they are going to do is get you insanely drunk.  Or maybe you want to obtain mysticism, become godlike and get one up on the universe, so they will stir up your competition with the universe, encouraging it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? Because some monks will come back to the Zen master realizing how silly and ridiculous the whole pursuit was, there is no point in competing with the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again when people are ready to wake up they will, and will seek the information they need to aide them in their journey.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember when I was still struggling, and those more knowledgeable would get frustrated with my lack of understanding. It happens, and they too would try everything they could to wake me up, including insults. And now years later I can reflect on what they said without anger, but with appreciation and understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't always have to be compassionate to have a positive and lingering affect on people.

       My experience has shown me differently. And if you're following Zen masters who are actively judging others, then you might be following the wrong masters? Haha. Expressing frustration, yes. I get that. Insults, sure, if they serve a purpose. But that purpose is to reach people. I guess, to me, saying "I'm going to make you look stupid" seems like it would serve the ego more than it would serve reaching others.
      </p>
      <p>
       But anyway, Zen is Zen and your way is your way. I don't want to judge that. Just offering my perspective. I usually subscribe to that whole "catch more flies with honey than vinegar" mentality, but then again, who wants a shitload of flies around, right?

       Don't try to wake up anyone my friend. This is why Zen masters don't go around trying to convert people or make them see the truth. I have been practicing the teachings of Eastern philosophy for many years now and I have recently understood that people will only wake up when they are ready.
      </p>
      <p>
       React with compassion to those unwilling to wake up instead of with force, life and suffering will be their teacher as it was and still is mine, as much  as it is of the majority of the world.

       If we have an economic collapse, a lot of people will vote for the guy who seems the least corrupted, too. The guy who says he will put the brass tacks to the wealthy elite who caused this mess. We'd definitely see a Sanders v Trump election, at that point. Then, if the whole thing isn't completely rigged from the get-go, it'll just depend on which side has more people show up to vote.
