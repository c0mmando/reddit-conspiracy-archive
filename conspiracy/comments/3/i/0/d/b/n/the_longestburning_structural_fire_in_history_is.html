<p><strong>February!</strong>   </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>In February 2002, firefighter Joe O&#39;Toole saw a steel beam being lifted from deep underground at Ground Zero, which, he says, &quot;was dripping from the molten steel.&quot;</em>  </p>

<hr/>

<p><em>A conspiracy of silence, or culture of silence, describes the behavior of a group of people of some size, as large as an entire national group or profession or as small as a group of colleagues, that by unspoken consensus does not mention, discuss, or acknowledge a given subject.</em>  </p>

<hr/>
</blockquote>

<p>An event of this magnitude merits little scientific intrigue? Nobody accounts for <em>all the evidence</em> and offers an explanation? Does description define criminality?  </p>

<p>Journalist Nafeez Ahmed&#39;s take on molten steel is compelling.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A commentator has attempted to &quot;debunk&quot; the findings of molten steel at Ground Zero,... There are a number of problems with this approach, first and foremost which is the overriding ideological predisposition to &quot;prove&quot; that no molten steel was found. This is a disingenious position, as looking at the data itself, the sheer volume of people who witnessed the molten metal demonstrates that the phenomenon did exist. The vast majority of observers insisted that this was actually molten steel, not any other kind of metal, which was often seen to be dripping either directly off steel beams, or from the cores where the beams were originally erected. Now looking at the data in its totality, the insistence that it was not molten steel in the face of this credible testimony is simply bizarre. The insistence is not founded in fact, but merely in the assumption that all the observers at Ground Zero were wrong. My position is simply this:  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>the data largely speaks for itself, and in the absence of convincing evidence to the contrary, should be taken at face value.  </p></li>
<li><p>whereas a final conclusion may not be deductible on this basis, preliminary probable inferences are justifiable on the basis of the available data.  </p></li>
<li><p>such inferences based on reasonable grounds indicate an unresolved anomaly in the official narrative...  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>It is noted in the FEMA metallurgy report, ffs.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Evidence of a severe high temperature corrosion attack on the steel, including oxidation and sulfidation with subsequent interganular melting, was readily visible in the near-surface structure.&quot;</strong> (Barnett 2005, C.2)</p>

<p><strong>A liquid eutectic mixture containing primarily iron, oxygen and sulfur formed during this hot corrosion attack on the steel. This sulfur-rich liquid penetrated preferentially down grain boundaries of the steel, severely weaking the beam and making it susceptible to erosion. The eutectic temperature for this mixture strongly suggests that the temperatures in this region of the steel beam approached 1,000 degrees Celsius (1,800 degrees Farenheit), which is substantially lower than would be expected for melting this steel.&quot;</strong> (Barnett 2005, C.2)</p>

<p>I for one am sick to death of these shills cropping up on the internet to &quot;debunk&quot; the people who legitimately debunked the government&#39;s absurd story.</p>

<p>would have damped down any thermite reaction due to leftover unreacted material, even thermite is confined by two elements of the so called fire triangle. heat being one, and fuel density being critical for the other two.</p>
