    <div class="md"><p>1) The official narrative is that fire took down all WTC buildings - fire from the jet fuel from the planes or falling debris on the other towers that were destroyed. (How did pulverized dust from the Twin Towers cause fires or structural damage in the other WTC buildings? Nothing was on fire that fell from the Twin Towers and they were turning to dust as they fell.) If it was blamed on explosives, far too many inquiries would ensue and the key players would likely be found out. It&#39;s also possible that explosives weren&#39;t used AND the official story is also not true. (see point 3)</p>

<p>2) Have you ever considered that the patsy hijackers weren&#39;t told the whole story? If the planes were actually hijacked via remote control, then the patsies could have been on the planes, but were paid to conduct a &quot;routine hostage situation&quot; - or so they thought. They may have been duped, as well, in order to support the suicide-mission, muslim story.</p>

<p>3) It probably wasn&#39;t a controlled demolition in the way that we know it. Secret technology was probably used, much like the case of the Manhattan project. We&#39;ve never seen skyscrapers pulverize and turn to dust in front of our eyes before...ever. We also never saw anything like Hiroshima and Nagasaki before... until it happened. <strong>New technology was likely used.</strong></p>

<p>I agree entirely with 2ndlinesteps, and I would even take it a step further that new technology could have been used to make it <em>appear</em> that planes hit the buildings.</p>

<p>One of the planes was reported to have landed in Cleveland.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I realize it sounds nuts, I spent years making fun of people like myself I assure you.</p>

<p>I think the hologram theory is plausible.  There must be something that explains how a hollow tube can pierce the building&#39;s steel frame and emerge from the other side.  When the B 52 bomber hit the Empire State Building in the 40s it didn&#39;t make it past the elevator shaft and the building opened for business the following Monday.</p>

<p>As far as the deal made with the poor victims I could only use my imagination.  Although, I find it highly unlikely that they would have been allowed to live.  </p>

<p>Laugh away Nanonaut.  You asked, I tried to point you in the right direction.</p>

<p>EDIT: The B-52 wasn&#39;t invented until 1955...  It was a B-25 that hit the Empire State Building.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The victims could still be clueless.  The hijackers take over the plane except they are nothing like the Muslim hijackers with box cutters.  </p>

<p>They are dark government characters and they give some sort of story about how the plane is changing course and for their safety a few of them should call loved ones and say such and such.  Then they land somewhere.  </p>

<p>The optimist in me says they are given an opportunity to accept a position in some sort of break away society in another country or underground or something.  The realist says they were probably lead into some safety room and &quot;silenced.&quot;</p>

<p>EDIT:  I forgot the second part.  </p>

<p>So then they fly cloaked crafts right by the buildings while nailing it with some sort of explosive device.  Perhaps they projected an image of a plane but I&#39;m not even sure they bothered with that at the time.  I don&#39;t think any credible witness ever claimed to have seen a plane hit.  We just have the video footage.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are countless witnesses (who would ALL have to keep this quiet for the rest of their lives) and dozens of video angles of the plane hitting.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but a few of those witnesses are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-pLwI7dcQ0">terrible actors,</a> which makes me wonder.  Also, some of the footage of the plane is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sc3oSyCkU8">questionable.</a></p>

<p>And yeah, that was part of what I said: the hijackers would instruct some passengers to call loved ones and say the plane is being hijacked and they would either believe it is for their safety or perhaps they just have a gun pointed at them.  </p>

<p>A hologram does not explain a hollow tube piercing a building&#39;s steel frame.  However, a hologram would explain a holographic tube.</p>

<p>Also, the Empire State Building did not sustain a prolonged fire resulting from that B-52 crash.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The so called hijackers or the so called commercial aircrafts may not have been what hit the towers,   the pentagon,  or the field in Pennsylvania.    There is plenty of doubt as to flight speed, plane dynamics,   plane flight paths,  claimed maneuvers of the planes,   phone calls from the planes,  pilot training,  etc.  etc.  which means that whatever hit the two WTC towers most likely were not a commericial jet piloted by the so called hijackers.    That is not a stretch,   it is a very likely possibility.</p>

<p>So,  the planes that did hit the two towers could have been military drones or something like that,   which mean that we would not know how they were equipped or what they were carrying.    The impact and effects of impact would be open to a lot of questions if what hit the various locations was not what we are being told.    It would explain the reported speed,   the maneuvers,  the strange flight paths,   and also the so called phone calls and other anomalies would then stand in a new light.</p>

<p>Once you realize that the so called hijackers were most likely part of a group of patsies controlled within the covert operations of various intelligence and fringe groups,   that they were basically a diversion,   then some of the logical fallacies of the official story become easier to see through.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is another matter ,  where the lists of passengers on the commercial aircraft that are claimed to have been used are studied.    Passenger manifests,   in flight phone calls,  and such are studied,  and contradictions and impossibilities are disclosed.    Details of flight paths,   claimed landings at airports in Ohio,  etc.  raise more questions.    Overlapping flight paths,   lapses in flight path information,  etc.    Switches to departure gates,   anomalies in take off times.    Strange claims regarding the hijackers being sighted,   their passports,   their luggage etc.  that don&#39;t add up.   Who the hijackers even were,   who was funding them,  who was making their travels possible and giving them their orders,   there are a lot of unanswered questions here,   and the fingers that are there point to some very very strange anomalies indeed.    </p>

<p>Even the so called bodies,   bones,  etc.  of those claimed to have been on the flights,  as the response to the events unfolded at the various locations,   much was not found.    What was actually found that proved that so and so was definitely found at such and such place?    Its pretty complicated,   and I think there is room for a lot of doubt.</p>

<p>As far as what passengers and airline employees went missing that day never to reappear?  If they were not where claimed,  then where could they have disappeared,  or been handled?   Does the burden of explanation for that fall on me?    Or does the burden fall more on you,   to show how an inexperienced pilot could have flown a plane well over its design limits on a trajectory that is unlikely they could have achieved?</p>

<p>Or to explain why even the FBI had abandoned trying to support the existence of phone calls that were shown to be impossible.</p>

<p>With this many questions raised,   and this many unsatisfactory answers,   the burden of proof does not fall on you or me,   except on whether or not we are willing for the future of the world to rest on a cover up,  where thousands of innocent lives are in the balance based on lies and cover ups.    Whether we are going to demand a proper investigation,   or not.    That is the final call.    If you don&#39;t question the existing story,   then I suppose you are maybe fine with the US going along with a bunch of lies.    You are fine with consequences being orchestrated that are not justified by the information.</p>

<p>Most people now admit that the terror wars were unjustified.    But the conversations and investigation we are talking about have not been properly investigated,   and the matter has become mostly taboo to approach.    What kind of world are you wanting to have.    To allow the existing cover up to stand is to assure a dystopian future.</p>

They all just felt like quitting life and never seeing their families or friends ever again to help push this agenda, and promise to keep the secret until death? You&#39;re fucking retarded man</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember,  genius,  the WTC 1 and 2 were largely rendered into dust.    No one is saying 3000 people didn&#39;t die on 9/11.    Just that if the planes that hit the towers could have been drones,  because what those planes did was not possible to have been done by the claimed commercial aircraft and the &quot;hijackers pilots&quot; who didn&#39;t know how to fly,  not even Cessnas,  what to speak of the claimed commercial aircraft.  The claimed hijacers could not have flown the claimed planes in that manner at that altitude even if they had known how to fly.    So,   what did hit the towers,  its worth investigating!</p>

<p>There are plenty of witnesses and whistle blowers who have exposed flaws in the official story(ies).    It is common knowledge now that the US knew that Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11 for example.    Yet this is still rarely reported in the media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its a lot less deniable for a terrorist act to use commercial airlines rather than just explosives.  It gives opportunity for camera footage in the airport, and an instant sense of terrorism and cause/reason for devastating destruction.  Explosives are ambiguous and harder to prove a source for.  It would be a lot more hearsay.</p>

<p>But really, it also gave people more option to get rich with all of the Airline stock trading that happened right before/after the incident, and the independent insurance claims on the twin towers for &quot;two&quot; terrorist attacks because of two planes.</p>

<p>The buildings were in need of complete remodel due to asbestos (very expensive proposition), complete destruction with explosives just in case or in order to guarantee destruction makes good business sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All four of the planes used on 9/11 just happened to be nearly empty compared to the usual amount of people on the planes. Now, when we pair that fact with the fact that the Twin Towers were nearly empty, and then we are starting to see just how unlikely it is that this is all just a coincidence.</p>

<p>Still, there is more to be looked at here.</p>

<p>Flight 77&#39;s passengers consisted of mostly DOD-connected people, including one man who had worked on black ops, and had never talked about his work. Others had military backgrounds. Out of all the people with military backgrounds, the majority of them had Navy backgrounds. This is a strange coincidence, considering that the part of the Pentagon that was hit was the Naval Ops center, and numerous Navy intelligence personnel, including the man who was organizing a response to the WTC attack, were killed in the crash. (<a href="http://killtown.911review.org/flight77/passengers.html">http://killtown.911review.org/flight77/passengers.html</a>)</p>

<p>Pretty unusual passengers. It&#39;s suspicious that these people would be on Flight 77, since there is a lot of suspicion of a military drone flying over the Pentagon while bombs went off, ever since testimony came out indicating that the plane flew on the North Side of the CITGO gas station. </p>

<p>Then we should note that many people on Flight 93 weren&#39;t supposed to be on the flight in the first place.. As team8plus, who made this excellent discovery said, &quot;If this is the case - just how many people were actually booked onto Flight 93 in the first place? Was it an exclusive flight just for the hijackers?&quot; (<a href="http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/flight_93_passengers.html">http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/flight_93_passengers.html</a>)</p>

<p>The planes were nearly empty, Flight 77 was suspiciously heavy on military/DOD/defense contractor passengers, and the passengers on Flight 93 weren&#39;t even supposed to be on it in the first place..</p>

<p>Now that we&#39;ve taken a look at the planes (Which also counts for Shanksville, considering the only alleged loss of life there was the passengers on Flight 93. I say alleged because I don&#39;t believe Flight 93 hit Shanksville.), and the World Trade Center, we will go on to the other event on 9/11, which is the most controversial event of them all. The Pentagon event. So many different theories have been put out (I, myself, support the flyover theory), that people have been utterly confused by it all. This confusion is by design, of course. The real hot evidence at the Pentagon is the evidence of planted eyewitnesses and the evidence of bombs inside the Pentagon and testimony indicating the plane flew on the north side of CITGO and testimony indicating the plane &#39;pulled up&#39;.</p>

<p>But, we are taking a look at how the part of the Pentagon that was hit was nearly empty. </p>

For example &quot;suspiciously empty plane&quot; - doesn&#39;t answer my question of why the pilots were willing to commit suicide. &quot;Suspiciously empty&quot; so are the pretend dead civilians in hiding for their whole life now? Seeing has how you actually believe the planes were &quot;unusually&quot; empty?</p>

<p>&quot;Suspiciously lots of DOD workers.&quot; Okay, so?? The gov just felt like killing them? What is the reason? There is zero point in just saying &quot;hmm suspicious all these DOD people died&quot; without saying the motive for the gov to kill them</p>
