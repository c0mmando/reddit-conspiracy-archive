        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Okay guys, here it goes:</p>

<p>I am an American citizen, and i love this country. I do not believe America is the &quot;best&quot; country, nor do i believe that it is the worst. From what i have seen, as far as first world countries go, America is more or less the same as all the others. Sure, we are big. Sure, we have a ton of weapons. Sure, our culture has managed to invade every other population on the planet, but we are by no means the &quot;best&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been on Reddit a while, and i have witnessed the anti-<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> circlejerk, but i&#39;ve never really been completely on board, because plenty of your points seem to be pretty <del>cognoscent</del> cognizant (thanks <a href="/u/SphericalTriangles">/u/SphericalTriangles</a>), and every visit to your sub i&#39;ve made has resulted in myself browsing through dozens of pages of content. I don&#39;t agree with everything i read on here, but I think we can all agree that our government is fucked.  There is no transparency, and frankly, if there was, i think we as the American populous would be absolutely revolted. </p>

<p>Every word we say electronically is monitored by countless government agencies, the police routinely use weapons of war against civilians, and almost every member of our government is owned by any number of special interest groups. and that is only a fraction of what is wrong. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s my question though: what can we do? </p>

<p>What can I do personally as a single person? </p>

<p>Is there anything we can even do, or are we doomed to being pawns of a government that cares more about securing their kickbacks, than about the safety and well-being of it&#39;s people?</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong> thanks for the information, but some of you seem to misunderstand, i am not looking to drop off the grid and make the nsa stop spying on me, i am trying to find ways that i can, as a single person, help to try to make it so that people don&#39;t have to drop off the grid to escape all the fuckulation that the government has become. It seem that the spread of information is my only real hope...</p>

<p>If you&#39;re no good at making titles, you can simply go to subs like TIL and do a keyword search for whatever topic. Copy/paste any titles which have over 500 or so upvotes, and resubmit the link with that title. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing about spreading this kind of info will usually get you downvoted to hell and back if its on other subreddits, Dunno how many posts ive done on other subs and gotten a SHITTON of downvotes and smack talk, even when im just trying to &#39;tell what we as a unit is thinking about the event&#39;, not &quot;you guys are sheep, wtf wake up!&quot;.</p>

<p>Its sad really, we&#39;re getting ostracized for not believing everything we hear and being critical about stuff. Conspiracy has become a foul word used by others to void ones opinion invalid... No longer is it tied to the watergate scandal, or the gulf of pigs event, or any other confirmed &quot;conspiracy&quot; that actually was true. No, its tied to ridicule and jokes, i&#39;ve even stopped calling myself a theorist cause i know that any and all discussion i enter on subjects will instantly become void with the words &quot;You&#39;re a conspiracy theorist, arent you?&quot;.</p>

<p>I just like information, and i like to think, i dont have much to do in my spare time so i read a lot, some of it useless info (like a cat purring might actually help itself heal from wounds or when its scared to comfort itself, which i find super cute for some reason).. But all of this info gathering and reading is just a joke to some.. And i hate that :/</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gotta resist. If you are complacent, it only makes things easier. Spread information, wake people up, drop hints here and there to friends and family to slowly ease the truth into them. You can&#39;t go full blast at people, it takes time. Being aware on your own is in itself a huge benefit because you are able to critically think about everything. Enlighten your fellow human, and they will keep doing the same to other people. This is how it starts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As an individual looking out for your own best interests in the face of Big Brother, you can only minimize your presence in the system -</p>

<ul>
<li>Ditch the cell phone</li>
<li>Ditch you car and take the bus</li>
<li>Ditch the mortgage and insurance industry; rent</li>
<li>Ditch the health care quagmire by staying out of their clutches with good health</li>
<li>Ditch the banking system and go with a credit union</li>
<li>Ditch your teevee</li>
<li>Pay cash for as many purposes as possible to prevent account tracking</li>

<p>That covers a lot of ground. In the US today, it&#39;s just about the best you can do to minimize your footprint. </p>

<p>If you wish to take an active part in protesting the system, that will only raise your profile in the surveillance index. Stay away from organized protest activities. It&#39;s too late now.</p>

<p>Know your neighbors, cultivate local relationships. Be a friend and deal with people familiar to you. Avoid corporations as much as possible.</p>

<p>Maintain a low profile, reduce your electronic trackability, transact in cash wherever possible.</p>

<p>This is how we live. Minimizing the footprint.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate the information you&#39;ve given me but i am on the grid, and plan to stay there. I understand the perks of minimizing your footprint as you said, but i am more concerned with what steps i could take to make America right. I am not naive, i am not suggesting that i could by myself topple the corporate oligarchy and all that jazz, but i can&#39;t believe that we are just doomed to this. </p>

<p>You opened your comment with &quot;As an individual looking out for your own best interests&quot; but the issue is, i don&#39;t really care that much about looking for my best interests. I am trying to find ways that i can make it (or help make it so) that people don&#39;t have to drop off the grid and look out for themselves... society works in theory at least, and i don&#39;t think it should be abandoned because the puppetmasters at the top are psycho, i just think maybe we should cut the strings.</p>

<p>Well I live in a semi-rural area and the closest bus stop is five miles away but fine, I&#39;ll get up two hours earlier and just walk there.</p>

<p>Oh, <em>ditch the mortgage</em>! Didn&#39;t realise that was an option! Let me call my bank on my mo... FUCK</p>

<p>So the solution to keeping in good health is... keeping in good health. Man, you give amazing advice!</p>

<p>Fair enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I picked that one thing you said because I smoke. I smoke RYOs exclusively. The fact is there is no research that suggests loose tobacco is in any way better for your health than pre-rolled cigarettes. </p>

<p>It does taste better, a pack does last longer, it is far more economical but if you think you&#39;re doing your health a favour by switching you&#39;re kidding yourself.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately for the (usually poorer) people who tend to smoke rollies, they are both less natural and more harmful. In factory-made cigarettes, the additives make up about half-a-per cent of the dry weight of the tobacco. But in the rollies, the additives are about 18 per cent of the dry weight. In other words, rollies have about 38 times more additives than factory-made ciggies.</p>

<p>These additives include sweeteners, such as honey, sugar or dextrose. Maybe it&#39;s just a coincidence that these sweeteners make rollies smoother for new smokers, such as children. But some of the other additives include chemicals with less-than-wholesome names such as propylene glycol, trans-benzaldehyde, phenylcarbinol and ethyl butyrate. Another factor in the health risk of rollies is that they are usually thinner, so that you have to suck harder, which increases how much tar lands in your airways.</p>

<p>We&#39;re not too sure why, but a Norwegian study of 26,000 smokers showed that rollies were associated with higher, not lower, risks of lung cancer. And other studies consistently show a two-to-three times increased risk of cancers of the oesophagus, mouth, pharynx and larynx directly linked to rollies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It all depends on the brand homie. Most RYO brands are pipe tobacco, which have additives (that&#39;s why it&#39;s so cheap! It&#39;s not labeled as cig tobacco). But you can find natural tobacco without preservatives and shit. You need to seek those brands. Smoking pipe tobacco via a cig is bad, but when you find the natural brand, it is far more healthy. Granted, smoking anything is bad for you, there are far less chemicals and additives in natural tobacco. It&#39;s hard, I suppose, because people may not live in the region. Smoking anything is bad, but smoking natural tobacco is healthier than say Camels or Newports. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It can be much healthier, actually. Look in to the cigarettes you smoke, the chemicals in the paper, the additives in the tobacco, or anything else you smoke or papers you buy. You can buy much healthier tobacco than the major brands offer you.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the oligarchy is usually a few steps ahead of the masses. We used to have the power of the vote, but that has been eliminated with campaign contributions. They&#39;ve also used QE and the &quot;free trade&quot; farce to significantly reduce the economic clout of the lower classes, while profiting from the process. The mass surveillance/police state that we see now exists for one reason only: To prevent any organized dissent. Add in the fact that employers can fire and blacklist you for any arrest, and anybody with something to lose is now terrified of any police interaction. </p>

<p>We are long past the point of an &quot;electoral revolution&quot; and the elite know this. This is why the US military is drilling for domestic unrest and the endless call for the revocation of the 2nd Amendment. Once they seize the guns, they will be free to dispense with the illusion of democracy. </p>

<p>You are 100% right.  No one agrees with 100% nor should they.  This is a board for open debate, discussion, and fact finding.  So welcome and enjoy! </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here&#39;s my question though: what can we do? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can band together, organize and arm ourselves, and remove the power elite peacefully, or (far more likely if they resist) by force.  Those in power stand absolutely no chance against even a fraction of the population if we are organized and willing to go all the way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What can I do personally as a single person? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Too that end there is a LOT we as individuals can do to help bring this about, but first a word of caution: don&#39;t expect to see change overnight or even in your lifetime.  The elite didn&#39;t take over in a day, or a month, or a year.  They do things slowly, over generations, because they learned long ago that if you do things quickly, you risk revolt.  That is one of their many, many forms of control.  So we will likely end up in the same boat, fighting an almost endless class war for a long time prior to seeing the desired results.  That is not to say it&#39;s hopeless or we might not see results, but that it is very likely to be a long uphill struggle. </p>

<p>Ok, with that out of the way here is what you can do.  Arm yourself, and train.  Be reasonably prepared (don&#39;t go prepper crazy, just be reasonable).  Get in shape, eat right, DON&#39;T put a single dollar into their hands if you can help it.  Educate yourself.  Start reading Zinn, Chomsky, Piketty, Dale Scott, and so on.</p>

<p>Most importantly, once the personal stuff is out of the way start to organize those around you.  Start with family and friends.  Don&#39;t be a pushy jerk or a zealot, just present your points when appropriate and try and get them to see the truth over time.  Join local groups, or start them.  Host movie nights for friends and coworkers to watch subversive films (9/11 the new pearl harbor, food inc, etc.) and discuss them.  Start a book club that meets once a month or something and read some of the authors above, and discuss them.  Take people to the local range and teach them to shoot, or sign up for Appleseed classes as a group.  As the group grows, consider linking up with larger groups and taking direct action. </p>

<p>Most young kids are naturally creative and full of imagination and I think encouraging them to stick with that would be better than trying to mold them into a grey box. At least locally, it seems parents favour kids learning Math and science so much that they&#39;re willing to sacrifice any create things schools teach. </p>
