<p>From the live footage:  <a href="http://i.imgur.com/VoPxdDZ.gif">On the right side of the screen here,</a> you will see little drops of a dark substance appear on the wooden planks.  Presumably, this is blood; specifically the cameraman&#39;s blood.</p>

<p>If this is &quot;fake,&quot; as you say, how was this accomplished?</p>

<p>So for one, both camera angles stay on or around Alison for maybe a second after the first shot is fired. Adam&#39;s angle drops quickly as does Vester&#39;s. </p>

<p>But in that second angle from Vester we can see most of the first shots are directed at Alison. So I&#39;m pretty sure Adam just dropped the camera or threw it off to run or possibly subdue the attacker. </p>

<p>What I think happens is this. He fires about ten rounds total. His first few are directed at Alison. That we can be sure of. She probably fell to the ground very shortly after and the gunman likely started firing at the third woman and Adam as quickly as possible. He very likely fired at Adam as soon as he dropped the camera. </p>

<p>I just can&#39;t believe you&#39;re pointing to a few drops of blood and saying &quot;explain this, steeple!&quot;</p>

<p>You think the conspirators would have invested a couple bucks in those Hollywood blood sprayer things, right? If this is a staged event it&#39;s a piss poor attempt, and I don&#39;t mean production. I&#39;m talking theme. Do you see the media blowing up over this? Is everyone talking about it at the water cooler? Are people demanding gun reform en masse? Not really. The response in those regards has been tepid. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to fake an event for the liberal media to use, you better get a bit more creative. Get some good makeup and make your actor look like Christopher Lloyd&#39;s character from Dennis The Menace, give him a few semi automatics, and have him mow down a couple dozen actors dressed as hippies in Starbucks with Bernie Sanders stickers on their MacBook pros. </p>

<p>No.  Not at all.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Correct.  My estimation is that Adam goes into the motions of putting his camera down a split second after the first shot is fired.</p>

<p>Vester is plainly incompetent with the handgun <em>while rolling his POV video with his cell phone</em>.  He misses the first shot entirely, likely the second.  When he realizes this (hypothesis, admittedly), he puts the phone down and by that time none of the videos show the rest of the situation.</p>

<p>Some people are claiming that this is &quot;fake&quot; in the sense that no one was really shot, i.e. blanks.  I am saying:  &quot;Here&#39;s the blood of someone who was really shot and you&#39;ve already seen it, though you may have tuned it out for whatever reason.&quot;</p>

<p>As for the rest of your post, I don&#39;t disagree, though I think you might be misunderstanding me.  My post has nothing to do with gun rights or media credibility, but has everything to do with how people that frequent this subreddit form their opinions on current events, which is generally knee-jerk reactions that assume that <em>every single</em> world event is some sort of NWO/Illuminati engineering feat.</p>

<p>No..not really a &quot;huge&quot; contingent. There maybe several that feel very strongly about it. It may be sad to you...but I am grateful there are people like this that will keep digging no matter what. Let them have at it. What is sad is the fact that there are people who gobble up the MSM tripe on a daily basis. What if everyone was like that? Nobody questions the source if it comes from the &quot;approved and official&quot; MSM TV sources? What&#39;s sad is a world like that would make some people very happy.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/tgcjez8.jpg">This photo</a> is what probably changed my mind from the staged mind set to an actual crazy dude with a gun mindset...for the most part.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The News last night said that the reporter and person being interviewed were both blinded by the bright light being shined on them and the killer stood in the light. I don&#39;t see any light stand set up. Also, the autopsy says both the cameraman and reporter died from headshots and the reporter was also shot in the chest. I guess it&#39;s possible to be shot in the chest and then run 10 yards fast and looking healthy out of adrenaline but the killer&#39;s video didn&#39;t appear to show any wounds to the reporter&#39;s chest. </p>

<p>Is anyone having similar thoughts? It&#39;s difficult even typing what I really see because it doesn&#39;t agree with the media&#39;s reporting and I think I might be crazy.</p>

<p>edit: How did the killer time it so perfectly? The segment was going to be 1 minute long I think and he walked up on them at the exact moment that they were live on air? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I responded to a comment saying that there was a light on top of the camera that was since deleted but I might as well respond anyway: I saw that too. However, the cameraman is turned away from the interview when the gunman walks up and initially points the gun. There was no light directed at the interview when the gunman first pointed the gun and stood there, the cameraman was filming the scenery to his right. The report that I saw was misleading. It set up a vertical umbrella with a blinding light as if it was a stationary light during the whole interview. The report by Jim Avila (ABC News) was obviously misleading and false. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do professional video work and use a much lower power led light than the cameraman used here, people tend to take quite some time to readjust and he likely had been pointing it and framing the shot/adjusting color etc before turning to start with the pan.</p>

<p>Your eyes take more than an instant to readjust, and you actually want to be in that condition so you don&#39;t squint when the light hits you out of the blue during the shot.</p>

<p>Handguns in real world use miss ~70% of the shots fired even at close range - we see two rounds fired is the killer&#39;s video before the camera is dropped in his pocket. He continues firing at least 9 rounds.</p>

<p>These stand ups are an ad buy 90% of the time. News and radio work on a pretty standard clock - most stations will have their commercial breaks at within 90 seconds of the exact same time every hour on the hour (e.g. Traffic on the 8s etc. usually set that way because ad blocks are set on the 10 minute mark and that gives you a perfect time to segue into them with your outro being a stay tuned for X pitch.&quot;</p>

<p>Anyone working in TV or Radio could have followed their giant truck with huge station logos all over it easily - and then just hung around until they were getting ready to shoot the segment.</p>

<p>Some people have better tools than just trying to slow down the video, if you walk frame by frame - as they clearly did to get the still, and they had access to the actual source from the camera, not a recompressed copy of a recompressed copy via youtube, it is clear it is in the video.</p>

<p>The fucking time stamp is because it is a photo of a different news agency that is showing the image.</p>

<p>Most likely in a different timezone. - are we supposed to ignore all the previous footage in this very video that shows the time is on the right hand side in the original footage - and in fact all of the stations graphics package?</p>

<p>Are we supposed to ignore that there is a completely different station identification over the CBS logo in the photo with the 6:00 time on screen?</p>

<p>Because you are not asking the key question: Has there ever been a single violent crime news story that made it to national news since this subreddit was founded, that did not have multiple, unfounded, biased posts make it to the front page of this sub calling it a government false flag?</p>

<p>Can you name a single one?</p>

<p>Maybe, just maybe, a bunch of fucking seed sellers and shitty investment hawks make a ton of money getting people to read their crap and listen to their radio by claiming every news story is a conspiracy.</p>

<p>Maybe, just maybe, it would be very helpful for a government that does conduct shady shit, to poison the well and make anyone that subscribes to forums discussing their shady shit look like idiots by constantly claiming that literally everything is a conspiracy.</p>

<p>And finally, maybe, just maybe, there really is a mental health problem among our population and some people really do think the only reason bad shit occurs is because a spooky government boogey man allowed or faked it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I can&#39;t speak for the other posters. I personally do not think every violent crime news story is a conspiracy. I believe that the recent France train shooting really happened. </p>

<p>The evidence I would like handed to me on a silver platter:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dash cam video of the chase (we will never see this)</li>
<li>A picture of him in the stretcher with his face not blurred (too many news stories stated he killed himself in his vehicle, while others stated he died in the hospital)</li>
<li>Surveillance video from the airport parking lot where the shooter supposedly switched from his car (ford mustang) to a rental car</li>
<li>Video taken by the BBC reporters that the VA cops forced them to delete (even though if they do recover it, it could of easily been edited by now)</li>
<li>Any photos of the surviving woman taken that day</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;m sorry that this gif isn&#39;t enough for me, but I&#39;m not buying the story. The hardest part for me to believe was the switch out at the airport from his car to the rental car. </p>

<p>They found his car in the parking lot - it had been there for weeks because he rented the rental car almost a month earlier. This is how they fucking knew to be looking for the other car which was found by a license plate scanner - he likely never went to the airport on the day of the shooting and if you had been listening to the VA Police Feed on Broadcastify like me and thousands of others, you would have heard them discuss that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what the news reported -
&quot;Around 11 a.m., authorities said they located Flanagan’s greyish-colored, 2009 Mustang at the Roanake Regional Airport. Flanagan fled the airport in another car — a Chevrolet Sonic, which officials said he rented earlier in the month.&quot; (<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2015/08/26/tv-camera-crew-caught-in-active-shooter-situation-in-southwest-virginia/">http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2015/08/26/tv-camera-crew-caught-in-active-shooter-situation-in-southwest-virginia/</a>)</p>

<p>&quot;In a news conference on Wednesday afternoon, Franklin County Sheriff Bill Overton said Flanagan left the scene of the crime and drove his 2009 Ford Mustang to the Roanoke Regional Airport. He then left the airport in a Chevrolet Sonic that he rented earlier in the month. The Mustang has been recovered as evidence.&quot; (<a href="http://wtkr.com/2015/08/26/suspected-active-shooter-investigation-involving-news-crew-underway-at-smith-mountain-lake/">http://wtkr.com/2015/08/26/suspected-active-shooter-investigation-involving-news-crew-underway-at-smith-mountain-lake/</a>)</p>

<p>Well, based on the scanner audio they reported they discovered he had rented the car after they found the mustang they were looking for based on the DMV records - no one saw him drive away etc. </p>

<p>The airport is like a 5 minute drive away from the location of the shooting, how does this debunk anything if he did OR did not drive there?</p>

<p>Maybe he left the car there 2 weeks ago and has been driving around in the rental all this time - doesn&#39;t change the narrative one bit except explain how it might have taken a bit longer for the rental&#39;s plates to be in the scanning system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you post the scanner audio so I can listen? I have not heard it. The airport is going to have surveillance cameras, it&#39;s an airport. I just want to see the surveillance video of the chase, or him switching out cars. They are reporting that he went there the day of the shooting, so if you are saying that the story that they are telling is the truth, wouldn&#39;t you say he went there the day of the shooting as well?
If you actually think that he did not stop at the airport to switch out cars, you are stating that they are lying about what happened, in which case.. I don&#39;t see why you aren&#39;t second guessing this yourself. 
So they found the mustang they were looking for based on DMV records, how did they know it was at the airport? They would only know this by a camera. That&#39;s how the license plate recognition works. There should be video/photo evidence of him at the airport if they are claiming they used license plate recognition. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say there is no video of - none at all - let&#39;s say, for the sake of argument, he never drove to the airport that morning - but around 10:30 AM investigators discovered he had recently rented a silver Chevy Sonic and put that information out on the APB and into their license scanning system: </p>

<p>What does that change about the event? </p>

<p>As for your questions: </p>

<p>So they found the mustang they were looking for based on DMV records, how did they know it was at the airport</p>

<p>Because they routinely patrol the airport parking lot with a license scanning equipped car - mostly to try to get additional funds from unpaid tickets by impounding vehicles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmph. I will have to find it somehow. I don&#39;t want to follow the theory that he never drove to the airport that morning.. mainly because that is what the news and county sheriff has stated as FACT. I am trying to find holes in their story - not holes in theories of what other people assume may or may not have happened. I hope you understand where I am coming from. Personally, I think it would of been better for them if they never stated that he went to the airport that day, because that was the first thing to make me question this whole thing. There would of been witnesses at the airport as well. Airport parking lots are pretty busy, especially in the morning. </p>

<p>I&#39;d even be a little bit happy if they released video of him renting the car a month prior at the airport. Sigh, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll get a lot of the evidence I want to see in this. I can understand how they could find the mustang at the airport with what you are saying, though. It makes sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Without picture/video of him at the crash scene, no, it&#39;s not. It&#39;s funny that we call this a crash scene, but there wasn&#39;t any &#39;crashing&#39; involved. The Chevy is pulled off into the side of the road, near a bush. Little to no damage appears to have been done to the car.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/zQohO">Odd how each of these would be referred to as a crash scene</a>? The entire front of the fucking car is the brush - how would you know what kind of damage is to the front - and since when does the level of damage equate to if we refer to someone driving into something a car crash?!</p>

<p>Looks like little to no damage to me. I just thought it was funny, because it doesn&#39;t look like much of a car accident.</p>
