       What's more likely a disgruntled employee shot co-workers, something that has happened many many times, or that the reporter and photographer have lived their entire lives as government agents just waiting to fake a shooting.

       There are no crime scene photos, photos of the victim, there are numerous reports of the tweets coming out before the alleged event, and we even have footage of the event where no one is injured and its pretty clear that blanks are fired

       Jesus.  The shooting was 13 hours ago, they're not going to release crime scene photos to the public and especially not in that timeframe.  There are no photos of the victim, just a fucking video showing shots on target.  I literally watched that mfer tweet multiple times and then the videos.  I love a good conspiracy like the next guy but you guys are nuckin futs if you think this was a fake.

       Yeah, along with half the internet.  His twitter profile was public. I didn't want to watch those POV vids he posted, but he actually posted them as I was on his page trying to decide if it was real or a fake twitter.  They autoplayed.

       But you said you literally watched as he posted the video. The first twitter mention I saw was of his twitter post of the video. So there you are, before he posted the video, watching his feed. How did you know who this guy was before he posted the video?

       I did exactly this. When CNN said his name, I thought "he must have twitter" so I searched and there it was. Seconds later the first 20 second video popped up, followed by a 25 second video both set to auto play.

       He had been tweeting for about 10 minutes before.  If you're really still in disbelief, go to the Reddit news thread and go back about 10,000 comments and read it chronologically.

       Seriously, I'm all for questioning things and embracing the conspiracy mindset and thinking critically and what have you, but you're making yourself look silly by TRYING to make this be fake when the overwhelming evidence points to real.

       Which part did I make up?  Which part can't you wrap your head around?  The tweets appeared on the internet in front of my eyes several hours after the shootings occurred.  The reporter's name was released publicly, his on-screen name was found, and his twitter was too.  This isn't hard to follow.

       Because it's not attached to his gun? Firing a weapon doesn't shake your entire body... and blanks would leave casings and cause recoil just the same as regular bullets would.

       Then you'll admit the video shows no one being hurt no indication the gun is firing actual ammo?  He shoots point blank multiple times and she's running away.  If he didn't hit her at 8 feet or whatever he's going to hit her at 20+ while she's moving?  It's total bullshit man

       Real life shootings don't look the same as they do on COD brother. Again, I know nothing of the authenticity of this video, but I have seen people get shot. This is absolutely a plausible video to me based on the actions and reactions of those on screen.

       Rule 2 - No accusations of rules violations in comments. Please report violations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comment removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the first place, none of those comments were reported.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the second place, even if they had been, there's not one single mention of "shill" in any of those posts.

       Thanks for getting me to waste my time with unfounded complaints.
      </p>
      <p>
       ... and in the third place, reading back through your comments I find that you've made a ton of personal attacks on other users. I'll now be removing all of them that violate our rules. Thanks for bringing yourself to my attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are aware that we have a no trolling rule too... right?

       Edit: Now that I've gone through a few and found so many rules violations, you may consider this your only warning. Any further violations will result in a ban.

       What is it with you people thinking that it's perfectly normal for "crime scene photos" to be released to the public? It never fucking happens! Especially less than 24 hours after the crime, when an investigation is still underway? You've gotta be fucking kidding me with this shit.

       Have you ever fired a hand gun? Killed anything? The gun moved exactly right and if you're not committed you will miss even at 8 feet. I shot a rabbit that had been chewing wires on my car, I missed just like this until the rabbit started running, I hit it on the run

       the tweets before the shooting were debunked as twitter putting west coast times on tweets for some reason.  this is referring only to the boyfriend's tweets, i didn't see any other tweets.  for some reason when i check his posts they show 630s as the time, but it's actually 930s.
      </p>
      <p>
       i confirmed this by making a tweet and it being off by 3 hours. (thinks I'm west coast when I am on the east coast, may be a vpn issue)

       All I can add to this is after watching the shooters video is that I just get an overwhelming  sense that the whole thing is contrived. The video is fucked up on so many levels I don't know where to begin.

      <p>
       The place is deserted except for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only three people there, reporter, interviewee and cameraman( though this is understandable ) act as if shooter doesn't exist. They don't acknowledge his presence in any way what so ever. He was right next to them for what seemed quite a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reporter didn't appear to actually be getting hit by bullets. Her body did not exhibit that jolt. Nor did she get knocked back in the slightest by the "bullets" hitting her.
      </p>
      <p>
       No blood mist from exiting bullets shot from point blank range and she can still stay on her feet and run away and film conveniently ends at critical moment like an ISIS beheading video. The real meat and potatoes is missing.
      </p>
      <p>
       How did shooter know to be there at that specific time? Any witnesses see him enter the facility?

       You've never seen someone get shot before have you. I don't know anything about the authenticity of the video, but I can assure you that the cases where someone is shot and crumple in that spot immediately (other than head shots) like you see on tv are rare.

       There are a few explanations: Local news stations regularly tweet what their reporters are doing. As a former employee he might known how to find where reporters are. He might have been driving by and saw the news van.

       Whoa nelly! I'm just asking questions.  If you are a news reporter as you say, maybe you can understand. However, you most likely being an MSM fluffernutters and bullshit reporter, you have NEVER asked any real controversial questions that would ruffle the feathers of an authority figure and anger your masters. You must stay with the narrative. You've probably only reported on the local town hall meetings and grandma's missing cat for all I know.

I'm sorting through all of the available information that I can get ahold of and make a decision on my own, not what some half wit news anchor is telling me to believe. Arriving to a decision is fluid...sometimes things look staged and then they don't. If that angers you, maybe you should wonder why you were taught to think that way...but I don't give a shit about what you think. People like you will never mold the way I think and learn.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what is worse in my book is an MSM news "reporter" whose job is not investigating and asking tough questions in order to bring truth to the public, but one that knowing or ignorantly goes with the establishment narrative to further political agendas. Either because of cowardice or apathy, lack of conscience or a plant...it's pathetic and extremely damaging to the quality of life for everyone who has no other capability to view the world by.

       So if those people weren't shot, where do they go now? You're presuming that they knew they were going to be fake-shot and removed from their significant others, families and friends. So they showed up to work that day, some guy shot blanks at them, a van whisked them away, and the first responders were all in on it too? Now they're essentially fugitives who can never see the light of day again, and they didn't try to tell anyone before it happened? Am I understanding this correctly?

       The two people are definitely real. I'm from VA and one of my friends used to be a TV reporter in Roanoke and knows the two personally. They are dead sadly. If the rest was fake...always possible but that would be ridiculous.

       How do you provide supporting evidence without providing personal information? That's the issue here. I was just providing anecdotal evidence. You don't have to believe me and I think if I provided evidence you would find some fault in it. I know these two people are real because I know my friend is real because I came to know him because he dated one of my roommates in college and went off and became a TV reporter and trained with her. If she was a crisis actor, then she played a long con and my friend is upset for no reason but if that's true he's very unaware.

       The problem with most "conspiracy theorists" is that they think TOO much. A shooting like this could very likely be a hoax, wherein the shooter is a government-hired assassin. Especially in cases where the assailant kills himself. This DOESN'T mean that the victims are ALSO actors. That's what I hate about the douchebag who claims that Sandy Hook never actually happened, offering 25k to the parents of dead kids for "proof". Well yes, it did happen. Children died. That doesn't, however, mean that it wasn't set up by the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like some of these people believe that TPTB are able and willing to fake the deaths of 100s of people to push an agenda, but arent willing to ACTUALLY KILL a few people in order to push an agenda. They think that the government will poison the vaccines that are being pushed into millions of people each year, but NOPE, no way they would kill a few people to push an agenda. Seriously...?

       Pushing what agenda? The 'coming for your guns' agenda? If Sandy Hook didn't manage to push the agenda with the deaths of all those kids, then this shooting of two nobodies (outside of their local viewing area, friends and family, RIP) is going to accomplish even less than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason that this might have any effect at all, is that it was caught on tape.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I can already tell you what's going to happen. Anyone not directly affected by this will forget about this story within two days. Local, and some national politicians will spout 'deep regret for this senseless tragedy' and the ones who are for some measure of gun control will rattle off a talking point or two to satisfy their constituents.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is a false flag operation to push an agenda, I would fire whoever was behind this asap.

       Hey man, you're barking up the wrong tree. I don't think this was faked at all. In any way. But when I post here, I usually try to stay away from taking a hard stance on anything that goes against the

       I agree. It's like people who believe there were CGI planes on 9/11. I find it much more believable that a nut shot these two, and if there's any conspiracy it would be that he was a government  agent or an MKULTRA victim.

       NOW you're thinking logically. A lot of hypocrisy on this sub for the most part. I tag those who think logically- there can be conspiracies, but most here try to dive waaaaay too deep, and that invalidates everything that we "logical conspiracy theorists" try to bring awareness to. Gives us a bad rep.

Saw about 20 police cars in the middle of I-66 E, the silver suspect car and what appeared to be a coffin.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a tweet from the BBC reporter who was forced to delete his footage by the VA police. We'll never be able to see his footage now since the VA police forced him to delete it. But if there was really a coffin there, that's a huge red flag. He supposedly died in the hospital. Why would they bring a coffin to the scene?

       Because the BBC reporter has been in warzones before and a temporary coffin for the military looks very similar to large waterproof cases used to carry medical supplies.

      <p>
       But nahh... they were stupid enough to bring a body to the scene when there was no need to. Like they couldn't have the guy lay on the gurney and play dead - that would be far too difficult.

       That's not the same thing. They don't just go out and hire suicide bombers. They groom them for it throughout religious indoctrination. Paying to take care of their family after their martyrdom is part of the  deal but people do suicide attacks for the supposed eternal reward, not the money.

       i agree with what you're saying.  and i just want to reiterate that i don't believe this was a conspiracy and they hired someone to kill himself.  but, people do keep families in mind and if they're already unstable and offered their family decent compensation for making  a sacrifice i really don't think it's much of a stretch to hire someone to kill and them kill themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       for instance, have you seen gangs of new york?  there's a scene where bill the butcher offers a guy whose about to be hung $0.50 cents for a locket. the locket had sentimental value for the dude because it had his mom on it but he took the deal and proceeded to get hung.  obviously a movie but like i said i don't think it's a stretch for someone to accept death as part of a deal.

       I also question who might be the "retard" in this conversation.

       While we're on that subject, you should check out

        this

       article.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can assure you that I'm not "trolling" you. I am who I am, and I'm gonna put my opinions out there, just like you are. Not everyone who disagrees with you is a "retard" or a "troll". Sometimes, you might just be wrong. Other times, you might be right, and everyone else is wrong. Other times, there is no "wrong and right"... These are called OPINIONS! But watch what you fucking say to other people, and what you call other people. You're a fucking bully. You need to resort to name-calling in order to validate your opinions. In that regard--- fuck you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe on your 13th birthday, you might realize that calling strangers on the internet "retards" when they disagree with you, gets you nowhere in life. Maybe... I HOPE!

       Is it only obvious to me that the OP image has much clearer color, contrast and definition? And this is "Allegedly" the unaltered news camera? Those cameras don't look this shitty on my tv, what about anyone else?  You guys see pretty clear images on your TVs from these local news stations?

       The one released by the cops was most likely directly from the camera doing the shooting and doesn't have compression artifacts like the others.

       I don't have any evidence, but I don't think in "absolutes", therefore, asking a parent of an "alleged" child victim for "proof" that their child is in fact dead is fucking sickening to me.

       Nono I didn't mean that. Evidence comes from many less sickening directions. Like the fact that there are no birth or death records for those children - birth in some cases, but no death certificates whatsoever. These documents are always recorded and publicly available, as a matter of census. There being no official record of somebody's life is very, very questionable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bit relatiatory to presume that I was in any way suggesting asking bereaved parents. That would do nobody any good, no matter what the outcome.

       Not offended, just wanted some clarification. There are plenty of people here who do have thoughts that consume them. It's a tough thing for a lot of us to deal with. At the end of the day, we all really want some answers.. thinking and speculating is all we have. &lt;3

       And that's perfectly fine. But there are certain people on this sub who go way too far, and suggest things that aren't logical in any sense of the word. And that affects all of us. Makes ALL OF US seem like assholes. That's why this sub is the laughing stock of Reddit most of the time. One sour apple spoils the whole bunch. It's sad though, because often times, these illogical morons get so many upvotes, which makes our sub even less credible.

       Yeah, it's very sad to experience that on a sub that touts "free speech" and all of that bullshit... The mods are good about not deleting opinions, but the mods can't save us from downvote brigades against logic. Just say what you wanna say, I guess that's the only advice I can give you. I always try to level (to an extent) with those who I'm trying to communicate with. I don't say "NO, you're fucking wrong." But I DO say "No, you're fucking wrong, and here's why...."
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get discouraged. A circle-jerk sub is a circle-jerk sub, no matter how you describe it. Logical discussion is a good thing. Keep at it! I have your back!

       Wait... so there's a guy saying I'll give you 25000 to show me proof that your child was killed in the Sandy Hook Massacre?  And he's a douchebag?  I'd take that motherfucker up in a heartbeat.  That's money no one would have to work for and if you changed his mind then it would probably effect the group of people who follow and know about him.

       THIS GUY SAYS HE KNOWS SOMEONE WHO DIED IN A NATIONAL TRAGEDY! TEXTBOOK GOVERNMENT SHILL! SHUT IT DOWN PEOPLE- THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A HUGE CONSPIRACY!
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the EXACT reason why "25k to any parent who provides me with proof that Sandy Hook happened" guy will never get any proof... because it doesn't matter what "proof" he gets-- it will always be "bullshit fake government-fabricated" proof to him. People who have half a brain realize that he's not worth the time. He's fighting a winning battle (in his mind). He can always say, "FAKE!" and nobody can refute that there is a POSSIBILITY that it is fake. As menial as the possibility may be, it is POSSIBLE (technically)...
      </p>
      <p>
       Name any "accepted" topic. Guess what? There is a theory out there that doubts that topic. This is the reason that we (as humanity) haven't accepted anything as "law" since the 1800s... everything is a "theory" these days. I'm pretty sure that we (as humanity) decided that the Earth is NOT flat... guess what? Here we are in 2015, and there are still people who are claiming that this "theory" is bullshit, and the Earth is ACTUALLY flat! What in the actual fuck? Sometimes I want to visit you people, and give you a nice slap across the face. But I can't, because this is the internet, and everyone has a voice. Even those who are clinically insane.

       I believe him. I've got friends in television news from the NC area who also knew the girl but I personally can't confirm anything other than what conversations I've had on facebook that were similar. 
I also believe it suspicious but not fake like we suspect.

       It's hearsay to me. I do not know an individual who knows them, I know an individual who told me he knows someone who knows them from the news station. And then you came and called me out and I called him out and he cannot do any better than hearsay. So at the least I'n guilty of hearsay, but lies? c'mon.  Read my history, I'm not a shill in the slightest. Infact I'm probably just a useful idiot of the NWO for seeking to question EVERYTHING.   Could you forgive that?

       This could very well be another scare pysop, with the intentions yet to be seen, those people are most probably dead, but in my opinion, this whole thing was organized.

       The whole thing could be a fake set up, but the action of shooting some one could be real, with a hidden narrative.

       There was about a 3 hour window between when he fled the scene to when he posted the video. From what I understand the video was shot on a smartphone, not a GoPro, so uploading it to Facebook would have taken seconds at most.

       Please do your research before posting. You can start by searching for more info on "crisis agents" (also called "crisis actors"). These are specialized agents who spend most of their lives "in character" thus not arousing suspicion. Look at the Newtown "parents" for a prime example. These are agents who continue to live in their communities playing the character they were assigned, sometimes deployed many years in advance of the event they were deployed to portray.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not surprising that crisis agents would be deployed in the media. Not surprising that they would deploy a crisis agent using the same name as another one "Parker".

       Seriously- thank you. It often becomes very difficult to find real theories with supporting evidence, because some people put forth that every event that catches large amounts of media attention must be a conspiracy. I don't think anything smells of conspiracy at all here.

       Well then I assert the theory it was all the plan of a flying spaghetti monster in order to incite more racial tension and violence, while at the same time generating fear from the pro-gunownership population that firearms will be harder to obtain. This will cause a spike in guns purchases and will allow that flying spaghetti monster to gain a quick profit from his interest in Smith and Wesson (a publicly traded company).

      <p>
       My point is that the majority of us read this sub for conspiracy theories that make sense, and this one doesn't really make sense. If someone pulls together some support to show otherwise, then that's a different story.

       have you seen people get shot at close range?  It doesn't work like in video games, in real life blood splatters and victims, especially small ladies drop like flies.

       watch this instead.  that guy got off a lucky shot and probably nailed him in the head.  this dude shoots the guy about 5 times in the gut and the guy takes off like a startled cat.

       What exactly about it looks fake to you? Thousands of people in the US are killed every year, why would anyone need to fabricate the handful that end up in the national spotlight? Why would you be surprised that this one ended up in the  media spotlight, what with it being about people who work for the media being targeted?

       I find it odd that no-one noticed him there before hand, she even looked at him for a second in his video. Not to mention the other lady who is facing him even more than Alison. I find her reaction to being shot at odd. She clutched her upper Right abdomen like she'd been shot but there's no blood on her hands or no mark that you see from the bullet. The blood should be flowing, other shootings I've scene are messed up with the amount of blood. Then runs away with no problem. I find it off that the women she was speaking with was in local government and was the only survivor. There's more but I don't think it matters, it just didn't seem right to me.

       And there are plenty of shootings that look like this.  Sometimes it takes more than a few seconds for the blood to start flowing, maybe the more fatal shots were after she was off camera.

       That's actually very common and realistic.  Many people who have been shot and survived report that many times they didn't even realize they had been shot for some time, often until they've actually noticed they're bleeding.  The whole reason we have Adrenaline running through our veins is specifically so we can run away from danger.  This is real life, not a movie.  People who are shot don't always just instantly fall down dead.

      <p>
       And if she was the only one killed you'd think that was "off".  Or if they all were killed that would be odd.  There is no combination of dead and alive people in this scenario that wouldn't seen odd.

      <p>
       That's because it's not right.  It was an extraordinary event.  If it seemed totally normal to you that would be weird.  But don't conflate your reaction to it being abnormal with the assumption that it is abnormal because someone is bullshitting you with a fake.

       Now I know this is r/conspiracy,  but you do know that EVERYTHING is not a conspiracy?  The horrific screams,  blood on the floor,  the camera man catching the shooter as he falls dead etc... all pretty much add up to an actual horrific event unfolding.  No conspiracy to see here gun nuts.  Carry on.

       That's not blood spray.  You can also see the same pattern in the wood on the shooters perspective before the shootings.  I thought it was blood at first also,  but no it's actually not.

       It's not patterns in the wood. There are several tiny dots that appear on the floor just before the station cuts from the live feed. Maybe the vid you watched isn't a high enough resolution to see it. The first one I saw this morning wasn't.

       This part especially.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the live footage (
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAH6SACn9lE&amp;amp;oref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DpAH6SACn9lE&amp;amp;has_verified=1">
        example here)
       </a>
       you can clearly see--in this case at the 13+ second mark, just before it cuts back to the anchor--specks of the cameraman's blood hitting the deck.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm leaning heavily toward:  This is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       a mock up; this is the real deal, imo.
      </p>
      <p>
       I admit that when I saw the first person footage from the shooter I was a little skeptical about its authenticity.  The most apparent observation that I made of this video is that the shooter seems incompetent with the gun.  The first shot seems to miss, probably the second and third as well... then he puts the camera down and we don't see the rest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reviewing the live footage and noticing the blood, which I had missed the first time, is what makes me think that this is not a fake event.

       I mean, what's more plausible.  The lighting made his hands appear a lighter shade, or the government accidentally hired a white dude to play the roll of a black guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       When your only evidence is conjecture, you have to consider these kind of simple, common sense explanations.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: as for the twitter time stamp, some googling will show the twitter time stamp is often not exact.  It has been an issue in the past, and I don't use twitter but I'd imagine it still occurs.  Considering the other logical option is the male news anchor is a government operative who has faked his entire life for this one operation, I again implore you to consider which is more likely.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT 2:  there is a far more satisfactory explanation of the twitter timestamp anomaly in the comments below.  Spoiler alert:  no, it's not because a covert government crisis actor screwed up the timing of his lines.

       First off, the woman being interviewd looks right at him as he holds the gun up. Second, you don't run away after being shot 4 times point blank range with a 40 caliber handgun. It just all looks far too fake to be real. Look up actual shooting videos.

      <p>
       The woman being interviewed doesn't look at the gunman.  She just doesn't.  I don't know what else to say to convince you otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       And your claim that "someone wouldn't just run away after getting shot" is your own personal opinion, not any kind of objective evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I've said again and again in this thread:  this stuff is amateurish and entirely unconvincing.  Come back with something more compelling.

       When he is walking towards them, she is looking in his direction. If you saw a masked man in a hoodie walking towards you, would you shrug it off? Each bullet has 425 ft-lbs of force, you don't run away from that. How would you sprint away when your hips are shattered from the impact? How about the fact that there is no air ripple in her clothes? No blood splatter on the surface behind her? The camera is placed down gently in just the right angle in order to get a brief glimpse of the masked gunman.

       To refute your first point... "Look at this picture of this guy in sunlight. Now look at him in a dim artificially-lit room. DIFFERENT! CONSPIRACY!" Not to mention, he is a mixed-race guy. Has one white parent.

      <p>
       To refute your last link... do you realize that the timestamps you see on Tweets are tailored to your timezone? The event happened at 6:46AM EST. His tweets started at 9:34AM EST. That screenshot is obviously from someone in the Pacific Time Zone.

 I'm as distrustful as the next person (who posts/lurks here), but this need to try and make every tragedy into a conspiracy based on such easily disproved 'evidence' just makes me sad. Sometimes real people do bad shit to other real people, ffs.

       I love discussing conspiracy possibilities and I love this sub for that reason. Some people here, however, belong in a mental institution. These are the people who say "Don't believe everything that you read!" And then 5 minutes later post some bullshit "conspiracy" evidence that they read about that can be debunked by a 4th grader in 20 seconds. Hypocrisy at its finest.

       Sunrise in Roanoke, VA today was at 6:45 AM. So yes, the sun was out. Not in full force, but it was present.

       That's beside the point. Natural lighting vs artificial lighting is a very big deal when it comes to photography.

       <strong>
        I

       The timestamp on the TV feed (which is only broadcast locally) is 6:42 AM. This is EST, seeing as Virginia is in the eastern time zone. The guy tweeted his condolences 3 hours later, at 9:36 AM EST. To someone in the Pacific Time Zone, that tweet would appear on their time line at 6:36 AM.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does that make sense?

       Haha gotta love when people read half your post! All I'm saying is that it is odd... I didn't say it was proof nor did I say that I was supporting this theory. Believing in no conspiracy theories is as dumb as believing in all of them. Mainly if you consider mainstream media as your primary news source. We will never know whether this whole thing is fake or not imo, but believing everything you see on TV is ridiculous.

       Do you not know how time zones work? He posted that at 9:31 am EST, 6:31 PST. Use some common fucking sense. I saw his tweet literally minutes after it was posted this morning. It was definitely hours after the shooting. Whoever screen capped that was on the west coast.

       The white balance is way off in that 2nd pic, so I wouldn't trust that.

       Could the event time zones be different? For example, the tweets could have been shown in a different time zone. Or, the news broadcast is showing one of multiple possible time zones.

       You're a fucking moron. Ever heard of color balance? Ever looked at two TV's in a retail store and noticed the colors were different? Your link

       Aw crap guys, our big conspiracy was foiled! Someone on the internet noticed that the stupid "boyfriend" posted his fake sad post too early, before our fake video had even been posted yet! Now all our plans are ruined. Brajpop - may I ask if you live anything resembling a normal life? Do you go outdoors? Do you have a social circle or a family?

       I subscribe to r/conspiracy because I truly believe our governments aren't always truthful with the populace and will sometimes do horrific things for any number of reasons to further a political agenda.

       But finding conspiracies in practically everything that takes place in this crazy fucked upped world with all its crazy fucked up people, can get a little out of hand here on this sub.

       does that fit your conspiracy better or worse? obviously better, so it begs the question, when are you ever wrong if both believable and not believable point to conspiracy?

       Ok so it went over your head, Ill explain. They stage these shootings and see people like us breaking videos down and pointing out why its bullshit, right? Then get this; they learn from their mistakes. Shocking, I know.

       Have you seen the video though??? Its not even believable, I spoke too soon. u/Demty is just a fear mongering dipshit. The fucking lady gets shot point blank 5 or 6 times... and runs away. You have to be fucking kidding me people.

       Correct. This is another example of a the media/authorities pushing a "narrative" alongside images which simply don't tally with that narrative. They are programming people to

       Nah Im as hardcore as we get but this guy has a well documented paper trail of fighting with coworkers and getting fired, judging by the relatively paper thin trails they left for lanza, oswald, the 9/11 hijackers, all your other patsies, this legitimately appears to me to be a crazy dude who was pissed he got fired.

       Yeah you may be right after looking at it a little more theres a definite possibility it was faked.  The gunshots don't look real at all, and that kind of obvious hole in the story is congruent with other false flags

       Why not arm drone swarms to sweep a neighborhood at 4:30am and the highways at morning rush hour? Not gonna be much resistance on the ground during gridlock or sleep. It's off-the-shelf technology, too. A teen with a budget could set it up with free software and tutorials downloaded from the information superhighway using an Xbox 360 controller.

       If the US military wanted it's citizens dead they would be dead.  End of story.  We don't need fluoride, vaccines, or to take your guns.  We have drones that can kill you from 13,000 ft in the air being controlled by some 19 year old in Colorado that could destroy you, your family, your house and everything you love in less than five seconds while you garden at your home in Florida.

       I'm in field artillery.  My unit fires the
       <a href="http://www.army-technology.com/projects/paladin/">
        M109A6 Paladin self propelled artillery
       </a>
       .  Just my
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery_battery">
        battery
       </a>
       -at 39 rounds of 155mm basic HE shells on 4-6 cannons- could completely level any small town in America.  And we could do it from 25 miles away. Now imagine my battery makes up a battalion, and that battalion makes up a brigade.  The US army has almost 20 artillery brigades and more then double that in regiments.

       Not to mention SCUD missiles, Cruise missiles, a single fighter or fighter bomber, or a single B-52 Stratofortress capable of carrying 70,000 pounds of ordinance, any special forces unit, hell I would bet you could take a unit of cooks (since we all receive the same basic training) and fair pretty well against an entire town of people who have NEVER received combat training...

       That's true, but if the US military were deployed to fight some revolutionary group of citizens rebelling against the government within the borders of the US they wouldn't just start leveling towns and indiscriminately droning houses amongst innocent people. Look at how careful we were in avoiding collateral damage in afghanistan and iraq. We'd be a million times more hesitant to use massive amounts of force if we were fighting within the US.

       you realise your friend dying has nothing to do with the false flag if it were indeed a false flag?
that blog picture above shows a white man holding a gun. the idea behind this false flag would be deceit and subversion so obviously a white agent in this case killing 2 people and framing the black man with this social media trail, just didn't plan on anyone capturing the real shooter.
in this scenario, your friend is simply collateral damage required to feed the narrative of the operation, unbeknownst to them.

       My point has never been any clearer, it is literally everywhere around us. If you can't see it then I am sorry but look again.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's fake. It's just simply not real. Even individual human interactions are subject to control nowadays. We all need to get the fuck off of our computers, stop caring about what happens on fake tv, and actually do something that is tangible. Whether that's creating a community that is separate from modern, "entertainment" and focus on people and relationships or simply turning off the news and not caring about what the government is screaming desperately for us to believe in, it isn't important.
      </p>
      <p>
       The world we live in is bull-shit. Entertainment is crap and only exists for advertisement, sports are the same. They're so good at it that they can not only distract you, but hold 100% of your attention
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       implant messages of "buy this" "believe this" into your mind at the same time. Companies gather money year-round with their designed, use-break-replace products from people who can't afford them in the first place. Why does this happen, and why are people so stupid that they buy items based on commercials and lies and not pure, true functionality? Is it because they've been conditioned from birth (by their parents fault, majorly) to associate television and commercials with comfort, safety, and food? How many people grow up with the couch, chips, and the tv as their only source of entertainment? I see it everywhere around me.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just fake, there's no deeper meaning. There's no reading into it. Whether it's completely fabricated, exaggerated, or an induced situation doesn't matter, it's still not real or random. We've been conditioned our entire lives to just believe it, to hope, because
       <em>
        the good guys always win
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I dare you to find me a non-obscure movie or show where the "bad" guy isn't stronger/more prepared than the "good" guy and the good guy doesn't prevail. They want us to think illogically, so that despite any measures taken against us, we should hope for the "right" thing and simply expect it to happen without doing anything ourselves because the good guys are out there...somewhere. Well when the good guys are all at  their (rent-controlled) homes watching sports or tv (on their disposable screens) and munching on whatever, and the bad guys are all in positions of power and wealth, the world becomes the antithesis of what we're supposed to think that it is.

       No, however the overwhelming fakeness is what he is talking about. Even real events partake of this fakeness in a way. For example, no one could deny that the police killing unarmed black people in America is not real, however it's undeniable that no one cared about it until the media started to make it a thing. Whether you think this is a good thing or not is irrelevant, it's a media generated outrage. They just as easily could have told people to focus on something else and they would have.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the way most people live their lives, just being directed by the media and doing what the media tells them to do, and thinking what the media tells them to think. It's quite disturbing in a way, but once I looked for it, I noticed most of my friends display the most extreme emotions I've ever seen then display ever while watching TV. Crying, hysterically laughing, anger, etc. all being shown directly to and at something that is fake. People that literally do not give a shit about their own real lives in any fashion will weep uncontrollably at the fictional character pretending to die on a flickering screen in front of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you have great friends, but when you are around people it's fun to play a little game where you wait for someone to bring up something that has nothing to do with the media. Often the media domination of the conversation is damn near 100%, people just discussing popular rappers, then a music feud, then sports stars, then a new TV show coming out, then a new movie they saw... all these things are fake to some extent, or at least less real than their "real life".
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope that makes sense. It's really difficult to discuss these things. I hope it doesn't seem like I'm rambling but I'm trying to show you what I mean. Fake is not the right word but it's close. If you're really interested you should check out Simulacra and Simulation (at least the first chapter, Procession of Simulacra) by Baudrillard or Society of the Spectacle by Guy Debroad. Sorry if you've read these already.

       More of the "you aren't grieving the way I demand you to - you must be a crisis actor" meme? People react to and grieve in completely insane looking ways if it were part of fiction when faced with real issues in their personal lives.

       Look up the stages of grief - it isn't as if we don't have close to 100 years of research on this. You are falling into the trap of people not reacting the way a screenwriter would expect them to - so they must be being coached by a script.

       I think you're reading what you want to see into my statements. For example here I'm talking about TV that is literally fake, like Dr. Who or Seinfeld for example. I was making the point that people seem to emote more heavily while watching these shows than when they are actually living their lives.

       Yes. That's why. It is difficult to undo or change one's conditioning though it is essential to recognize it as such and ditch destructive responses.

       Anyway, I agree with you completely. That's why I do not watch television at all. It is pure indoctrination.

       It is becoming harder for people to see through the hype these days. Human beings, for the most part, have completely lost touch with actuality. They live exclusively in the realm created by thought. This is why we can't have nice things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have the seen the movie "They Live" by Carpenter? It's a perfect illustration of what you're saying. It's a great movie. My favorite part is when the protagonist, who has figured out how to perceive the alien invaders with special sunglasses tries to convince his friend to try on the sunglasses and see for himself.

       What follows is one of the longest, most brutal fights in movie history. It is meant to symbolize how hard most of us fight to deny reality. How hard we cling to the shoddiest lies if they comfort us even a little. If you haven't seen it, watch it. It will help to explain the downvotes.

       the man's hand in the video from his own cell phone, which we can clearly see, is a white man's hand.  Vester Flanagan was black.  The reporter is also clearly not actually hit by gunfire.

       she's not unhurt. she was shot. you don't die right away if you get a torso or limb wound. and maybe he missed once or twice. the girl is dead and so is the cameraman. and the other woman was shot but survived. go to her hospital room and tell her she's faking it. tell her surgeons. fucking idiots.

       The main thing everyone who thinks this is fake is relying on is the shot of the shooter's hand from his video... they claim it's white, with a blue shirt. The alleged shooter is light skinned African American wearing a black shirt in the camera man's video. A friend of mine is about that skin color and he constantly jokes that his hands are white man hands. He compares them to his white friends' hands and we all joke that he had a hand transplant or some thing. And as for the shirt color? Photo shop is a hell of a program and fixes a multitude of sins. I do not believe this is a hoax. Its a tragedy, plain and simple.

       Gun violence is not and never has been a significant cause of death in America. Yes, let's waste years of policy change and money on legislation that will accomplish nothing at all. Get over it and focus on millions of lives lost, not thousands. Reducing cancer and heart disease would help everybody in the world, reducing gun violence only helps those who are a part of the insignificant statistic.

       There is a disproportionate level of gun violence in the US, and a lot of media attention/hype. It might be that the anti-gun sentiment is in response to the violence, rather than the violence being deliberately used to incite the sentiment.

       The two things that totally throw me off are at the 16 sec mark she clearly looks the shooter in the eye.. 
If she was having problems with this guy and was a previous disgruntled employee wouldn't she be like wtf? why are you here?

       We can agree to disagree....I try to look at everything objectively instead of just believing everything they report as fact..let's face it, there is an agenda which is being fed to us and we all have the ability to feed into it or think for ourselves. I use to watch the news and just believed everything they fed me until I realized they could give a shit about what's truth..it's all about keeping us from questioning their motives....it's funny that the second you think for yourself your a tin foil hat kook...the reality of it is You have no clue how corrupted this world is and were at a point where your going to be part of the change or your going to be fucked in the ass and have no idea what hit you in

       I'm not convinced it was a fake... also not convinced that Sandy Hook was real.  But in this case it appears to be valid.  Friends from back home knew the reporter and were aware of the altercation.  This one appears to be real.

       The only thing that got me suspicious was the fact both cameras just randomly stop at or near the same time. The cameraman dropped his. Makes sense. The other? WTF. It hadn't fallen. It just goes black and cuts out? WTF. Why?

       First of all, my heart goes out to all gun violence victims and their families everywhere.  It is an ongoing symptom of the much larger problems our society refuses to face on a daily, sometimes hourly basis.  However, this video raises more questions about the narrative we have been told today.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just watched the side by side version, from this link (
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfT5AfDErRo">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfT5AfDErRo
       </a>
       ) which has the videos slightly out of sync.  On YouTube, you can slow the footage down to 25% in the Video Settings.  You can also move the cursor back and forth while paused and almost go frame by frame.  I took a close look at this footage at normal speed, at 25%, and frame by frame.
      </p>
      <p>
       The gunman is firing what appears to be a 9mm semi-auto at point blank range.  Unless the first shot was a clean miss, not only should the victim have been knocked over immediately, but you should be able to see the impact of something in/on the victim's clothing, and certainly some sort of blood as the victim is running away, in both camera views.  How this played out after the victims are out of frame, I will await more information.  However, from this footage, I don't see anyone being shot, just shot at.  To me, he's either shooting blanks, or he just misses on the first shot, which is the only clear shot you see in both views.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the plaid sleeve, the news crew camera is shooting into a dark background when it hits the ground and the shooter comes into frame.  When paused, it appears to me that he is wearing dark clothing, that could be plaid, but the lighting is such that it appears different, especially when viewed at normal speed.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, this is not an embarrassment to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .  This is precisely why this community exists... to call into question the narrative that the media distributes regarding everything.  There is an agenda at work here, and really, with every breaking news story.  They are not informing us as much as they are inducing us to think the way they want us to.  Yes, this is a terrible tragedy, and again my heart goes out the victims and their families.  At the same time, something does not add up here.

       Isn't it more plausible that he simply missed the first shot? Have you ever fired a handgun?
      </p>

       Have you ever actually seen someone get shot? Do you honestly believe that she would "immediately collapse" upon being shot? Because you're sadly mistaken. Especially being a 9mm. Adrenaline is a helluva thing. You watch too many movies.

       Of course I have fired a handgun, many of them, and from 3 feet away I can certainly hit a target.  I was, in my youth, an avid hunter and know full well a deer can run 100 yards after a chest shot.  What I have clearly stated here, is that if you look at the footage slowed down, and frame by frame, you do not see an impact on her clothing in the first shot.  Certainly it is plausible he missed the first shot, just as it is equally plausible he was shooting blanks.

       I'm pretty sure that it's MORE plausible that he missed. It is LESS plausible that all 4 of them are in on a government conspiracy and are currently hiding in some remote bunker somewhere. But hey, I'm on

       Please do not attribute what others have said on this subject to me.  I took some time to look at the video "evidence" that has been presented to the public today, and have clearly stated what I see. From the footage, there is no proof of anything but someone firing a gun at a news crew during an interview.  I see someone being shot at, not shot.  Could this be a fake? Certainly.  Could he have missed the first shot and slayed these people in cold blood as the media narrative has directed us to believe... Absolutely.  All I am saying is that this footage is not conclusive, at least to me.  I question it, along with the narrative that we've been bombarded with today.

       I'm not attributing you to anything that anyone else said. Im simply arguing what your post implies. Is it possible that he was shooting blanks and it was all staged? Yep, it sure is possible. But if thats the case, then surely these 4 individuals (one being a local government official) didnt just continue their lives as normal. Even if they were actors, as insane as that is to believe, they literally could not be seen by ANYONE from now on. "Hey, aren't you that news anchor who got killed on live TV?" Their faces are EVERYWHERE right now. They would literally have to disappear in order for this to be a huge "everything was faked" conspiracy. Hence my "remote bunker in the middle of nowhere" comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       But which scenario is more plausible? According to you, they are equally plausible... and that's just plain fucking wrong.

       First of all, there is no need to infuse language into this discussion.  If you can't have a cogent discussion without throwing words around unnecessarily, don't reply.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, you are absolutely attributing to me the theory that they are hiding in a bunker somewhere, and even said that it's "just plain f'ing wrong".  And, why the hostility?
      </p>
      <p>
       What is wrong, is that the one clear shot that is shown in both videos does not show an impact.  This video at the :40 mark
       <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=f2b_1433676159">
        http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=f2b_1433676159
       </a>
       shows what a 9 mm impact looks like.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no way that in today's footage, this victim has been shot.  What happened after that, as she's running away and out of frame, neither you or I, or anyone but the Police Forensic unit has any clue of.  Since the shooter took his own life, there will be no public trial, thus, no evidence presented in a court of law.  You also do not know if these victims are laying in a morgue, or in a bunker somewhere.  As far as the "government official" that was being interviewed and who was also allegedly shot, she has been reported as recovering from her wounds.  I am certain we will hear her story in the near future.
      </p>
      <p>
       I stand behind what I have said here.  I have not made any irrational assumptions, as you obviously have.  I have merely stated that from this footage, there is no conclusive proof that anyone was shot... just shot at.

       I drop one f-bomb, and you dedicate two paragraphs of your reply to telling me that I shouldn't use foul language. On the internet. On Reddit. Ok.
      </p>

       I've made irrational assumptions? Haha. Ok. Most people would call my assumption "logical". Most would call your "questions" (assumptions masked as questions) insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess the difference is that I see one filmed shot that doesn't make impact, and assume it was a miss, with a number of the 10 or so succeeding shots (which we don't see) hitting the target.  You see one filmed shot, and assume it was a blank, and the succeeding 10 or so shots must also be blanks.

       Well, it adds nothing to the discussion, tbh.  And yes, with an absence of any evidence to the contrary, we can only go by the assumptions given to us by the media.  This video is the centerpiece of that narrative.  Until I slowed down the footage and looked at it closely, did I realize that the victim was not hit in the first shot.  The rest of the footage is jittery.  So yes, absolutely, I question what is going on here.

       And your keywords here are "(which we don't see)".  We don't see the other 10 shots, but we do see the first shot from point blank range and it is a clean miss, or there are no bullets in the shells he is firing.

       But you do realize that your line of thinking isn't "logical", right? You, yourself, admitted that you're a hunter and have seen a deer run for 100 yards after being shot. Adrenaline, brother. You should know that her running away after being shot (presumably in the shoulder or arm, based on the video, assuming the first shot DID hit) by a 9mm doesn't provide any evidence to your claim. If the first shot DIDN'T hit, then her running away makes even MORE sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, you're just as guilty of jumping to conclusions as I am.

        <p>
         You're immediately questioning if the bullets were blanks. Based on that question, you're ultimately immediately questioning whether or not the whole incident was faked. Therefore, the final 10 shots were also blanks. All of these "crisis actors" are now in hiding, and have a lifelong secret that they can never tell a single soul, no matter what.

         I'm immediately questioning whether or not the first shot hit or missed. I assume that some of the next 10 shots (not on film) hit their targets.

       How am I guilty of making assumptions?  I merely stated the fact that it does not appear that the victim is hit in the footage that has been presented today.  Both points of view, when slowed down an examined carefully, do not show a hit.  What happens off frame is all assumption and conjecture.  My only statement, which I guess you could call an assumption, is that from 3 feet away, he's either a very poor shot, or he does not have bullets in the shells he is firing.  It's kind of an either or situation, and if you want to call it an assumption, so be it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have not, in any of my statements, said anything about crisis actors, hoaxes, bunkers, or any of the drivel you are trying to attribute to me.  I have only commented at what is seen in the footage, and from that footage, I do not see anyone getting hit by bullets.  There is no impact, no blood, nothing to PROVE that the victim was shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happens when the footage goes jiggly and blurry, when the camera goes dark, who knows.  Anything anyone says at that point is pure conjecture.  The true assumption is that yes, he shot 3 people, killed two of them, then later killed himself because that is the media narrative.  But in this footage, there is no proof!

       What doesn't add up to me is that the shooter claims to use hollow point bullets.  Even if he missed the first time, the impact of a HP bullet is designed to fuck someone up . When the hollowpoint bullet strikes a semi-solid object (such as a human body), the dimple allows the bullet to expand, opening up almost like an umbrella or a parachute does. Some hollowpoint bullets are also designed to fragment as they expand.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if this shooter used HP bullets like he says he did, then the whole argument over whether or not the bullets would "stop her in her tracks" is nullified.  She would have been stopped the second she got hit.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could argue that he missed her on all three shots, though.

       Also not true. I don't care what kind of bullet you use.... nobody is going to "immediately collapse" upon being struck by a 9mm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you're just taking his word as gospel on the fact that he used hollow points? I don't trust a single thing that he has said.

       We're talking about a 110lb woman, not an able bodied man.  If they didn't collapse, there would be bloodshed.  Like I said, a HP impact would cause something akin to this:

       And that makes no sense, so I can't trust this guy's "manifesto" but I can believe the story the media is selling me?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the whole thing is fake.  I think his manifesto is fake.  But what I'm saying is, is that if that's the narrative, it doesn't add up then.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if that's NOT the narrative, and his manifesto is fabricated, how are any of the other details even remotely relevant or plausible?

       1. Why would the cameraman have been filming the ocean during the interview. I'm not involved in the "news" business in any way but shouldn't they have done that kind of shot before the interview and already had the shot ready for the producers to mix in.

       Quick question.
If he filmed this himself (the shooter) how the fuck did this video get on the net?
Surely he didn't just shot them, then calmly upload the video to the internet.
If the police see. the video on his phone (go pro I have also heard) there not going to release it are they.

       Everyone speaking of this will obviously get downvoted to hell, but yeah I think it was fake. I saw the video where he's walking from the end of the walkway and comes very close to them, then when he pulls the gun out her head slightly looks right. Then he holds it 2 feet from 3 people and NOBODY even noticed that this big black man that they used to work with and be close to was standing next to them? Then there's no blood anywhere, when he shoots at her the first three times her shirt doesn't move and there's no blood spatter. No shell casings are seen or heard when he shoots, even blanks use shells. Idk man if three people got shot and two of them died, I would expect to see at least a little blood, if not pools of it.
      </p>

       And yeah there's no evidence that it was fake, but there's also little evidence that it was real. Yeah the actors may have done a good job and their pr team hyped up the fact that two twenty somethings just got murdered who were in love with their fiances and all that stuff Americans like, but there's no crime scene photos or evidence being shown to prove this happened. But if you question it, you're an asshole.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's sandy hook all over again, in a year it will be forgotten and people who question it will be mocked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I'm all for believing it happened, just show me some fucking evidence.

       just look for evidence that it did happen not that it didn't.  you can always say something didn't happen because you'll rationalize every piece of evidence with minor counterpoint and justify that it's  a hoax.

       2-3 ft away is bs.  he was more like 10ft away with a zoomed camera.  notice there is a camera man between him and the reporter.
      </p>
      <p>
       you're not going to see any shell casings because every single shot he took on camera the ejection port was off camera.  look for yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       have you considered he possibly missed the first few shots?  she was at a side profile and he was holding a gun with 1 hand.  hardly any easy shot from even 10ft away.  i assume you've gone shooting and you'd be able to verify this.  even with a rifle and a scope i've missed non-moving targets 40yds away.
      </p>
      <p>
       you saw about 2-3 seconds of action.  of course you're not going to see blood splatter even if he did happen to hit her during those shots.  have you ever cut yourself by accident, knowing you just got cut, yet it takes a few seconds to bleed?  it happens with sharp knives all the time.  as another poster said the bullets also tend to be very hot at entry and do cauterize the wound temporarily.

       I would like to see these things.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Dash cam video of the chase
       </li>
       <li>
        A picture of him in the stretcher with his face not blurred (too many news stories stated he killed himself in his vehicle, while others stated he died in the hospital)
       </li>
       <li>
        Surveillance video from the airport parking lot where he supposedly switched from his car to a rental car (obvious switch out right here)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       If anyone could slow the video down and look down to the end of the hallway where the female reporter was running to... There's a black moving shadow (I know this sounds ridiculous, but I saw it).
      </p>
      <p>
       I think he flew out at the airport.. why would he go there? Why would his rental car be parked there? Wouldn't that be an obvious place where he would get caught by the cops after shooting someone?
      </p>
      <p>
       Very very fishy story... It does not all add up to me. The weird boyfriend tweets, you wouldn't be tweeting and doing interviews immediately after someone you loved died. The fact that he sent 7 tweets and uploaded videos while driving, the length of the time it actually took for them to find him while the news was reporting that they were tracking his calls.. if they were tracking his calls, couldn't they find his exact location? Forgive me if I am wrong here.

       So either those 2 videos were shot at different times (presumably the shooter's version would be the rehearsal filmed in advance) and the shooter was wearing different clothes for each filming, or it was all in one take and someone else was there with him.

       I think something is suspicious.  We need to find out where the image from this blog was pulled.  The still is clearer than any of the news video footage I've been able to find and this image CLEARLY shows a WHITE MAN's HEAD. I even went as far in photoshop of lining up this image with a still image with the black man's head and the only change when lowering opacity was the head area...

       To finally answer your question, OP-- NO, you aren't the only one who thinks that. But you're all acting extremely hypocritically in jumping to conclusions based on what evidence has been released in LESS THAN 24 HOURS AFTER THE INCIDENT OCCURRED!!
      </p>
      <p>
       You (and others in these comments) are the reason why conspiracy theorists have a bad rap and always get laughed at in other subs. To respond to another commenter here who says, "No, this is not an embarrassment to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       "... yes, it absolutely fucking is. Logic CAN exist in this sub. It seems, however, that a majority of participants here are schizophrenic sociopaths who feel the need to always jump the gun and declare EVERY tragedy as a conspiracy. That, in itself, is a tragedy.

       Time stamps don't make sense. At 6:10am EST WDBJ tweets: "We love you Alison and Adam." at 6:34am EST Chris Hurst tweets. "She was the most radiant woman I ever met. And for some reason she loved me back. She loved her family, her parents and her brother." The shooting doesn't occur until 6:46 am.

       You don't see much, or any flare from the front of the gun. I'm not saying I've shot a gun before, but I would assume to see a few flares from the nose or barrel. Also, no shells are heard falling on the floor or seen ejecting from the side of the chamber.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alison gets shot about three times before she decides to run, and I don't know about you, but getting shot three times in the torso would bring me down to my knees or to the ground. Alison manages to run away a couple of feet before the camera pans away to the "killer" as it falls to the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       Her screams of pain and terror seem to stay consistent and do not change pitch or alter in resonance as she is being stricken by the supposed rounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now to Bryce Williams GoPro: It goes black right after Alison starts running away. They say how disgusting of him to wait for the camera to pan over to her before he starts shooting, but it just so happens that his GoPro doesn't catch any of it, and the news just so happens to show enough before cutting out. Something smells fishy.

       Let us not forget that Hillary Clinton has been advocating gun control throughout her campaign. Virginia just lost gun control not too long ago.

       Does nobody know that Obama and Hillary have the exact same political mentor?

       You play too many video games. There is no flash from a handgun like this. They were on a wooden walkway you wouldn't hear spent casings falling. I believe he missed with the first few shots, it's not like a game, an actual gun and killing someone is completely different. He paused, he was obviously second guessing his decision and that transferred into not shooting well. He isn't using a go pro, it's his cell phone, it goes black because he drops it camera down, thus the audio still going. All them Democrats are advocating for gun control, what does a mentor have to do with anything? I don't know about the time line, I haven't looked.

       Why wouldn't a Glock 19 have muzzle flash? It shoots a 9mm... you can see it very easily outdoors. A 22 will show flash outdoors as well. Also, a spent casing almost sounds like a coin dropping on wood, on concrete it is a bit different. Do you really even know what you're talking about? The only reason he paused was to get the camera man to have focus on the the lady doing the interview.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, I'm not sure how I feel on this as a conspiracy or not.

       I've shot mine from my deck, which is pine, I'm sure just like what they were on and there is no way you hear it. After the percussion of the shot still ringing, no way would you hear the casing on wood like that. I do agree that he paused to wait for the camera man to be back on the interview, I hadn't thought of that but watching again I think you're right.

       Watch the video from the shooter and think they all act like it's part of the show but from the media version it appears a crazed killed rushed up on them. Blanks were used obviously and it happened at 6:19 not 6:45 like some have said. But anyway fiance tweets 11 mins after. It's a hoax!!!

       They had 90% support for a federal universal background check after Sandy hook but didn't pass the bill... Why? If their plan is to get our guns why didn't they start when they had 90% support for a federal law?  Maybe because they don't actually want our guns.. They just want there to be a debate about gun laws so they can fundraise off of the idea.  It works like this every time.  Everyone starts writing checks to the NRA and stocking up on guns and ammo and then no federal laws are passed.  The politicians are all bought.  It doesn't matter if 90% of America is begging for a law, the NRA pays over 50% of congress to make sure it doesn't happen.

       Yeah but it's just another example of our politicians being scumbags who don't work for the people.. They work for whoever has money.  It's good when it's guns but it's shitty when they are taking Monsanto's money and blocking bills making labeling of all chemical ingredients mandatory.  This isn't a representative democracy.

       Right, because CNN has something to gain by faking reporters getting shot. Btw, I'll say this now before you tell me it's to encourage gun control: If the citizens of the United States won't employ new gun control after Sandy Hook then I doubt anybody at the station thought that two reporters being shot would make the difference.

       Okay and that's fine, everything makes sense up until the point where he stops documenting it. Okay I shot them, I guess I'll just point my camera away from their dead bodies...wouldn't want people on the news to see...even though I waited for them to....

       Sometimes it's that simple. Have you ever met a really crazy person? Somebody who has literally hurt people for no discernible reason? I have. These people are not the types of people who think logically once the act has been committed. Here's something that I actually witnessed: A teenager beating the shit out of a kid until his cheek caved in, the second it happened he stopped and couldn't look in the kids direction. It's the shock of having actually done something like that that drives somebody to not go in for a close up with their camera. I'm not saying 100% that this holds true for this individual too, but I am saying it's possible.

       You are 100% wrong about everything.  Major news has been running everything by intelligence agencies, at least major stories, since the 70s at least.  Intel agencies also contribute stories directly.

      <p>
       And this is exactly how social engineering is done.  It's not just one big event, is little events every so often.  Notice how everyone that is promoting this story will be focusing on the emotional aspects and not the evidence.

       Right. Of course, I'm wrong. I was just wondering, since you're so confident of how wrong I am, what exactly would focusing on the emotional aspects of THIS story accomplish if it was made up? What's there to gain with this one? Because I just finished talking about this specific story and you decided to spew one of the most breathtaking non sequiturs of all time. Also, if you think this is social engineering for the gun control cause that I just finished refuting, then please explain how 2 people is more emotionally charged than Sandy Hook. Tell me why they wouldn't fake something bigger.

       If they failed at implementing gun control after Sandy Hoax, why would they stop trying?? All of these 'shootings' are adding up in the public's eye. Theyre piling them up so that we are more willing to hand them over. Thats why there are so many shootings lately. Its really not that hard to comprehend. Dont be such a retard.

       So you think it's more likely that they faked two reporters being shot instead of putting together another "sandy hoax" as you put it? Don't be such a retard, because if they could do it on such a grand scale then there'd be no reason to "pile them up", they could achieve the same results in 3 big shootings instead of 6 tiny ones. It's really not that hard to comprehend that if you can pull of a massive hoax then you wouldn't pull a tiny hoax to try and achieve the same goal that was intended to be achieved by the first larger hoax.

       Please stop. I'm losing IQ every minute I respond to you. BUT I'll grant you one last reply, if only because I can't help but expose your mental deficiencies. In case you hadn't noticed the video doesn't get a great angle because the cameraman got shot... You can't see blood if the camera isn't looking at it you dolt. I had no idea you were such an expert on gunshot wounds and video analysis; it comes as a shock because you don't seem capable of intelligent debate. So, Cletus, I'll leave you with this... The government doesn't have to take away our guns to kill us all very easily, so why the hell would they wait and try to take our guns away first? Answer: they wouldn't.

       It just happened to be a news station right? The buffer between us and them that has access to our televisions the nation over. I guess schools werent working well enough. Like I said, its a collective thing not a big event thatll bring about gun control. This is just another W for them. A few more wins ought to do it. Then the real show begins.

Edit: Lol, " Youre offended by my username. Must be jewish. Makes sense that you keep trying to limpdickedly convince people this bullshit was real. Of course you want gun control." Okay you anti-semitic moron, did you ever consider that sentence might be the reason why nobody takes you seriously? Did you consider it might have also been the reason your parents said, "hey cletus, why don't you leave the house already? You're 27 and all I ever see you talk about is Roswell and the "moneygrubbing jews""

       My friend pointed out that in the POV video, around the 0:16 mark, when the cameraman is facing away from the scene, you can actually see the anchorwoman turn her head and look at the shooter for a brief split second, then turn and face the interviewee again like nothing ever happened. I watched the video frame-by-frame, myself, and, what do you know, it's plain as day. It happened. Go look.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's crazy is that there's absolutely no reason in the world for her to have committed that action except for the specific purpose of leaving a little hint that the event was faked. It made me think, even in the live footage, there's no fucking reason in the world for the cameraman to just be aimlessly filming the water when there's a live interview taking place right next to him. It's like the only explanation for him even filming that way is to conceal the shooter on the video and explain why nobody saw him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's something deeper for those of you who aren't sleeping. I was thinking how freakin' crazy it is that not only did the shooting take place on live TV, but the shooter also came out with his own first-person video of the event, on top of that. I realized: the two separate videos of the event are a clear occult calling card. The live news is the object version and the POV is the subject version. It's a reference to the coalescence of subject and object, or the opening of the third eye, or illumination. There's a lot more to it, but I'll let you guys figure it out depending on where your heads are.

       Well, my local news would definitely do the same thing and pan to show the place they are promoting. I don't think a turn was necessary to avoid seeing the shooter approach.
      </p>
      <p>
       All that being said...the first-person video is still suspicious to me. Should have been impossible for the interviewee to not ever look at the guy.

       I agree establishing shots are common, I'm more just scoffing at the dude because I don't think such low-hanging fruit is sufficient reason to dismiss my post. Like, okay, the chick turned and looked right at the shooter like the shit was theater, but I guess all of that is just hogwash because you saw an establishing shot on your local news once. And I'm sure Oswald's bullets did loop-de-loops, too. Whatever, bitch. Keep it pushin'.

       I re-watched the video and did notice her hair suddenly turning to and then from, it's rough footage but clear she did, even though it may have been blurred.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think that this some sort of proof, though...she's trying to do a live on-air broadcast and does seem slightly unnerved as she asks her next question. I'm still waiting for more to come out before making any decisions. Suspicious though.

       If this is true, and the video was indeed edited, then we have a really interesting twist on this that may open up another rabbit hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the general quality of the video itself should also raise suspicions. Cameras on most phones are HD now, and we could have gotten a much wider, higher-quality view. Instead, it's a vertical video.
       <strong>
        If
       </strong>
       it has been edited, then it's feasible that the original video was widescreen and they tightened it up to make sure we only saw what they wanted us to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it's "crazy" for me to still question this, but damnit, we just never see any hard proof. If you had no clue about the video, and I told you some guy walked up to a reporter and fired a bunch of blanks at her, you would not be able to tell the difference.

       I understand why you might write off a little turn of the head as an insignificant thing, but I think it's completely ridiculous when I consider the implications. The implications are that she turned her head, saw someone standing there who not only wasn't supposed to be there, who not only wasn't there a second ago, but who also had a relationship with the anchorwoman according to the official story, and who also had a gun out according to the video. Then she just goes back to doing her job like the shit was completely normal. You're telling me that's not

       What do you mean, 'wasn't supposed to be there'? The video was shot at the Chamber of Commerce. A quick top-down view on google maps clearly shows that this is a wide open public spot with multiple access points that they were standing in. So are you maybe suggesting that a local two person news team has security teams that block off access points when they do a puff piece for the city?

       Either way, the fact that she glanced at a person who appeared from around the corner is something you, me and everyone else does every day.

       Do you think that he was in hiding, or met them there, like, hey guys, do you mind if i record you doing this newscast? Explains why she wasnt startled when he was there, and also whh a foreign object in his hands wasnt suspicious to her.

       I think no other explanation makes sense at all except that the event was orchestrated. The shooter supposedly had an estranged, bad relationship with the anchorwoman; it makes no sense for any of these things to have occurred legitimately in light of that information. The shooter's motivation is also said to have been personal; it had nothing to do with the media. What that means is it's extraordinarily bizarre that he decided to commit this act in broad daylight at a specific time when the victim was doing a live news broadcast - especially considering he also drove the point home even further by filming it himself in first-person. Not to mention that it's rather suspicious in itself that he just happened to have been able to locate her while she was in the middle of shooting a completely meaningless story, on location, that likely wouldn't have even taken an hour from setup to cleanup. What are the odds?

       I can't help but stand with you on some of your points. I'm not sure about this whole relationship thing...I thought he was gay and in his 40's? His time at WDBJ didn't even overlap with hers, except possibly during an intern gig she had there in 2012. So that part doesn't make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole thing still reeks to me. While the shooting was in public, they knew it would be rather empty at that time of the morning, and as we've seen in previous false flags, they always do this in a secluded area they can quickly rope off.
      </p>
      <p>
       The POV video is what actually raised my suspicions for the first time. I had no reason to think "false flag" until that came up. Here we have a guy who we never see and never talks (whispers only), and has an oddly white hand. Then he draws on two women with apparently NO peripheral vision whatsoever, and then fires the gun directly in line with the camera and not his eyesight. How do we know it was him posting to Twitter this whole time? How do we know he's the one who faxed in the manifesto? We don't. Period. If it were a video confessional, ok, I can be swayed. But again, the possibility of this guy being murdered and framed is real. As is the possibility of deaths being faked.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you knew nothing about the video and I told you some person walked up to a reporter and fired a bunch of blanks at her, you would not be able to tell the difference.

      <p>
       Why??
      </p>
      <p>
       •  Because the gunman's hand is steady as a rock -- not nervous in the slightest.
      </p>
      <p>
       •  Because the gunman pulls out a gun, points it at a reporter, doesn't shoot.  Keeps filming.  No one says anything.  And then finally decides to point the gun AGAIN... finally pulling the trigger ??  (Not all that "stealthy".)
      </p>
      <p>
       •  Because I see no blood bursting from the reporter as she was shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Because the reporter appears to have been shot at least twice, and yet she starts running.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Because the both the gunman and the reporter are "white".  Had either been "black", it would have turned into some race thing... and "they" want the focus to stay on Gun Control™.

       Nah, mate. You're not the only one ;)

       You'll know it's fake if the reporter survives, and they start wheeling her out onto the field of football games like a celebrity.  Wait for it.... "I was pro gun rights, but now that 1 person out of 250 million snapped, and used a gun instead of a knife, NOOOOW I see the light!!" ;) ;)

       You're a retard if you think that when you shoot a living thing it just falls over immediately and dies.  I have hunted since I was very young, have shot at least 50 deer as well as a bear and hundreds of varmints (coyotes, groundhogs, etc) and turkeys.  Only a handful of times have I shot a deer with a high powered rifle and had it drop where it was standing.  Unless the bullet hits the spinal cord or the brain then the victim has to bleed out from the trauma, which can take anywhere from a few seconds to several hours.  People get shot by handguns all the time and survive.

       OK kid, you obviously have no clue what you are talking about.   No a 9mm will not knock an adult down from pure force.  This is not Hollywood where the bad guy gets shot and flies backwards.   The fbi developed the .40sw because the 9mm didn't have enough energy to consistently penetrate if the target was wearing multiple layers of clothing.

Edit: Lol, " Youre offended by my username. Must be jewish. Makes sense that you keep trying to limpdickedly convince people this bullshit was real. Of course you want gun control." Okay you anti-semitic moron, did you ever consider that sentence might be the reason why nobody takes you seriously? Did you consider it might have also been the reason your parents said, "hey cletus, why don't you leave the house already? You're 27 and all I ever see you talk about is Roswell and the "moneygrubbing jews""

       Have you ever fired a hand gun? Killed anything? The gun moved exactly right and if you're not committed you will miss even at 8 feet. I shot a rabbit that had been chewing wires on my car, I missed just like this until the rabbit started running, I hit it on the run

       I think no other explanation makes sense at all except that the event was orchestrated. The shooter supposedly had an estranged, bad relationship with the anchorwoman; it makes no sense for any of these things to have occurred legitimately in light of that information. The shooter's motivation is also said to have been personal; it had nothing to do with the media. What that means is it's extraordinarily bizarre that he decided to commit this act in broad daylight at a specific time when the victim was doing a live news broadcast - especially considering he also drove the point home even further by filming it himself in first-person. Not to mention that it's rather suspicious in itself that he just happened to have been able to locate her while she was in the middle of shooting a completely meaningless story, on location, that likely wouldn't have even taken an hour from setup to cleanup. What are the odds?

       NOW you're thinking logically. A lot of hypocrisy on this sub for the most part. I tag those who think logically- there can be conspiracies, but most here try to dive waaaaay too deep, and that invalidates everything that we "logical conspiracy theorists" try to bring awareness to. Gives us a bad rep.

       This is the EXACT reason why "25k to any parent who provides me with proof that Sandy Hook happened" guy will never get any proof... because it doesn't matter what "proof" he gets-- it will always be "bullshit fake government-fabricated" proof to him. People who have half a brain realize that he's not worth the time. He's fighting a winning battle (in his mind). He can always say, "FAKE!" and nobody can refute that there is a POSSIBILITY that it is fake. As menial as the possibility may be, it is POSSIBLE (technically)...
      </p>
      <p>
       Name any "accepted" topic. Guess what? There is a theory out there that doubts that topic. This is the reason that we (as humanity) haven't accepted anything as "law" since the 1800s... everything is a "theory" these days. I'm pretty sure that we (as humanity) decided that the Earth is NOT flat... guess what? Here we are in 2015, and there are still people who are claiming that this "theory" is bullshit, and the Earth is ACTUALLY flat! What in the actual fuck? Sometimes I want to visit you people, and give you a nice slap across the face. But I can't, because this is the internet, and everyone has a voice. Even those who are clinically insane.

       How do you provide supporting evidence without providing personal information? That's the issue here. I was just providing anecdotal evidence. You don't have to believe me and I think if I provided evidence you would find some fault in it. I know these two people are real because I know my friend is real because I came to know him because he dated one of my roommates in college and went off and became a TV reporter and trained with her. If she was a crisis actor, then she played a long con and my friend is upset for no reason but if that's true he's very unaware.
