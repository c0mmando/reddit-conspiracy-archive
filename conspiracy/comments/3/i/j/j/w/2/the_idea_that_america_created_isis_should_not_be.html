       If we will not recognize the need to owe it to ourselves and the rest of the world we live in to discover the uncomfortable truth surrounding ISIS, we at least owe as much to the memory of previous American revolutionary generations who were willing to boldly demand liberty or death to the face of a tyrant much less menacing than the electoral monarchy we live under today.

       (a fake ISIS video identical to the James Foley/Sotloff one.)
Contrary to popular debate, I don't think this video should be brushed off as merely anti-American Russian propaganda. The actions of the group behind the leak, Cyber Berkut, apparently specialize in hacking NATO and leaking Western acknowledged state secrets. Why break protocol and falsify intelligence they seem to have easy enough access to unaltered already? For reference, please refer to the wiki article on Cyber Berkut. They're a Ukrainian hacktivist group. Not necessarily Russian KGB. Even if this leak is of Russian intelligence origin, who is to say it isn't legitimately aimed against Russia's top geopolitical threat to the Russian Federation's very existence? I am open for explanations on this one.

       Ukrainian hacktivist group Cyber Berkut claims to have hacked their ISIS beheading video not from a NATO server, but from either a John McCain staffer or from the senator's laptop himself, while he and his staff were travelling through Kiev Airport in June.

       People already are very aware they do not need the government. But the since the government needs the people, and they have more power, they simply refuse to sacrifice themselves for the greater good. Alas, we are stuck with it, its not like the government can creating laws that will remove guns to protect itself, or raise taxes to preserve itself. Or spy on people in their homes searching for blackmail as they rise within its governmental ranks to either remove them or make them act in the governments best interest.

       its just not practical to live without a government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who is going to be there to keep companies in line, to check whether they meet criteria for safety or treating workers properly? Who would create those regulations?
      </p>
      <p>
       Who would control the armed forces and defenses of the country? Who would be responsible for missile launches? If you put someone in charge, you have effectively just recreated the government but with less people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am sure people in small groups can live perfectly well without the need for a government, small communities can just work that way. Take millions of people in a compact area and tell them to look after and regulate themselves, there would be chaos. There are always going to be people looking to exploit others, removing a barrier (even one which itself is in some ways corrupt) just makes it easier.

       You can deny it as much as you want, but there is significant evidence that the government does keep companies in line, even big ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just by implementing and maintaining regulations they are doing a big job. Pay equality laws, workplace safety etc are all commonly followed by businesses. I am not going to say that government is all good and never does anything wrong, because that is simply not true. It should be noted that governments do work to help people sometimes, just look at Europe and all the laws which regulate safety of products and food.

       except that Governments are co-opted by giant coporations, and make laws specifically for them.

       what you think is a regulation, was probably written to allow seedy businesses to continue to operate within the context of "the law"

       so mandatory holidays, sick leave, maternity pay and maximum working hours are all designed to benefit the businesses? Give me a fucking break..
      </p>
      <p>
       When you give someone breaks, these laws are not written to help the company. These directly benefit the employees.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regulations concerning safe working conditions do not help companies, they actively cost them money. If government wanted to help businesses to operate they would simply remove all these regulations to make it cheaper and easier to hire employees.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are not making any sense here, its just the typical circlejerking.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are of course cases where laws are manipulated to help companies, but the majority of laws are not. Workers protections are one example.

       You are exactly correct.  That's a pet peeve of mine as well though.  Unregulated society?  No thanks.  It's a recipe for debauchery and trouble.   Just look at the problems people cause now
       <em>
        with
       </em>
       laws and regulations.

       You sound like a person who has been stigmatized so heavily by laws and regulations you don't even know what rights or freedom are any more.

       Dogs and cats don't run huge companies producing good and providing services. They are completely different in terms of their intelligence and abilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       A horse can't mass manufacture poisoned food that could be consumed by millions of people. Dogs don't live in huge cities with tall buildings that could fall over and cause serious loss of life if not built correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, I am sure small community orientated communities can survive just fine, dogs, cats etc don't live in huge cities and countries, they tend to keep to their own packs. Humans are simply not like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even in the animal world their is significant chaos. Its not like all the animals in Africa are chilling out at the pond peacefully sharing it are they? They kill each other for those resources..

       The difference is we supposedly DO live in a civilized way. Unfortunately it seems that is a farce.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason animals are in chaos is because their habitats have been destroyed by humanity. If you want to talk killing each other for food, that's far less malicious than killing each other for watches, jewelry, status, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point you seem to miss is that, people are the way they are because of their ENVIRONMENT, which already exists with plenty of rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prohibition doesn't work. Stop prohibiting people from doing things, and they won't feel so frustrated and aggressive. This is how defense budgets justify themselves. We need to exist to make these laws! What if someone gets hurt!??

       (carpets bombs a million people like it's nothing***)

       To continue the point. The law applies to some and not others. Hillary Clinton just committed a felony. Why is she not in prison? IT'S THE LAW.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Which can be argued, because its a bunch of arbitrary rules and perception of reality. Law is opinion.)

       people can barely vote with their wallets today, when there are organisations dedicated to putting this information out into the open.

       Do you believe companies are going to voluntarily let people come in and see some potentially illegal stuff? They don't have any legal power so they could just hide everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are basically saying that instead of a system we have now, where evidence is presented and analysed, we should instead violently protest and cause damage based on an accusation? How do you know it wasn't another company trying to damage their competitors?
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at some of the rape cases where people get accused and the public goes crazy and tries to enact their own justice, even when the court finds they were innocent. People cannot be trusted to properly evaluate evidence and punish criminals. Who do you hold accountable when you find out they are innocent and you just burned down some guys entire livelihood?
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem to have this idea that everyone is moral and everyone will do what is right. This is simply absurd.

       Our modern day culture is evidence that people cannot be trusted to properly regulate companies. We still buy shit from companies who basically run human slave camps.

       That might happen a bit, but sooner or later, your deeds always catch up with you. If you have a business and all of your competitors businesses burn down - yours being the only one that didn't - you might have a nice temporary monopoly.  The hand of the free market though draws in competitors as they see plenty of demand. Having become accustomed to the monopoly, you decided to burn down your new competitors businesses. Yours is the only one spared, again. This time someone remarks about how its odd that all the ___________ businesses burned down except this one twice now. People start thinking about it, put 2+2 together, and the 'problem' is taken care of.  As there is no authority to ask for help, people take matters into their own hands.
      </p>

       No one is held accountable unless the guy holds them accountable. In the 1800's, where I live, people dueled over being insulted. This kept everyone acting honest.

       No, I have the opinion that there is no 'right'. I can't help but think you are misusing the word moral - maybe you don't comprehend that your morals might not be the 'right' ones.

       Once again the words on paper or laws as you call them are a large part of the problem. If people weren't reliant on them - they would protect themselves.

       If nothing is illegal, how do you stop bad things from happening?
      </p>
      <p>
       What is to stop someone from getting a rifle and going on a huge killing spree in a town, or planting bombs around a city? People acting in their own interests doesn't keep balance, it pushes people towards decisions that will cause conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
       A companies best interest is to make money, if they can get away with using more dangerous ingredients that are cheaper, who is going to stop them? If its not illegal they can just cover up the evidence, no one will be able to see if they are lying because they have no authority. People can't vote with their wallets if they don't have access to the information, you can't get that information without some kind of legal system in place.
      </p>
      <p>
       How is your 'burning competitors' any better than the current situation, where people have legal protections from violent sabotage? I would rather businesses battled by lowering prices instead of setting fire to their buildings, there is a lot of damage that could happen. Imagine setting fire to a shop and then the whole street catches on fire.. that's another thing, who would run the fire engines? Are you just going to leave houses to burn..?
      </p>
      <p>
       What happens when every business is burn't down? People don't have endless money to reconstruct and start up new businesses. If a business burns down it could be months before a whole region has access to those services, it simply is a ridiculous idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are living in a dream world where no one is immoral and everyone is honest. This is just laughable. When there are no rules to confine people it just gives them more incentives to break the 'laws'. If companies do bad things now, imagine what they would do if they could do anything without repercussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am referring to morals as in the majority view. The majority of people believe murder is wrong, the majority of people believe that stealing is wrong, etc. This is outlined in the laws we have. Murder is illegal because most people believe it is wrong. Laws are based on our collective morals and what is best for everyone (in most cases)
      </p>
      <p>
       If these companies don't exist, how do you get these products? Some things take significant investment, a single person isn't going to be able to do this alone. Imagine a single person trying to start up a large water cleaning system, you need groups of people to do this and no one is going to do it for free.

       If people were not reliant on laws they would have nothing to constrain them. There are many laws that people follow simply because there are punishments, without these punishments people would not follow these ideals.
      </p>
      <p>
       A world where anyone can do anything is not a safe world. You are complaining that laws can be used to oppress people, so therefore we should remove all protections and allow anything to happen... that is idiotic. Look at lawless countries and see what happens, terrorists organisations, mass killings and brutality. Maybe you want this? I don't..

       You on a subreddit dedicated to discussing the wrongdoings and illegal actions of the the elite and big businesses.. whilst calling for the abolition of all protections from those same people?
      </p>
      <p>
       that makes no sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       The facts are that there are many dangers in this world and it is for the good of the people to have services to protect them. I enjoy having police and firefighters that I can call, I enjoy having free healthcare. I enjoy having protections when I go to school or work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would I want to remove all these barriers and open myself up to any sick thing the human mind can think of? I don't live in Iraq because it is a shit hole where people can run wild doing whatever, I am much happier in a country with protections and a healthy environment.

       I'm realistic. I know that anarchy will allow some 'bad' stuff to happen. But so does the current state of affairs. Without laws, everyone is aware of the fact that there is no oversight; rather than wait and rely upon others to 'right' the situation the individual must, always - every time. The ignorance I speak of is akin to dependence. You're happy now being dependent upon these words on paper and services to protect you. The funny thing is that they don't. If someone wants to kill you, they are going to do it - yet you feel safe and protected because there are words forbidding it and people to respond to the scene and write a report after the fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Delving further into the idea of ignorance is the idea that your lifestyle is built upon manipulation, even enslavement of other people. Maybe you aren't ignorant of this, maybe you just don't care. Regardless, you're parroting the status quo because it is working for you. Understandable. Short sighted - but understandable.

       Bad things happen now, more bad would happen without anything to stop it. Police stop crime, emergency medical services save lifes, firefighters put out fires, there is no doubt that this is true. Without even basic services like this there would be a lot more death.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets say someone breaks into your house and steals your stuff, what are you going to do?
      </p>
      <p>
       In the current culture specialized individuals who have had years of training can investigate the scene, potentially find the criminal and return the stolen items, whilst obtaining legitimate evidence and making sure that this person does not commit more crimes. This is a more effective way to protect people.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can say that police are pointless because you would already be dead but this is very shortsighted. A criminal not caught is a criminal on the loose. If police can find the criminal (which they often do) they can make sure that he does not commit another crime, far from pointless. SWAT can ensure that hostages get out safe from violent situations as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't say that I am enslaving others, they are no more enslaved than I am. A job is a choice, if someone chooses to be a cop they choose to paramedic they choose to be responsible for my safety, I am not forcing them to. If I get a job I am not being enslaved, I am choosing to provide my services for payment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I parrot the 'status quo' to an extent because it has proven to be effective. There are problem, there always will be, but society has shown that it is capable of maintaining a relatively peaceful and safe environment with the current situation.

       That wasn't name calling, its an observation. I said it all at once because that's the only point to make. Based on what you have written, you live your life in complete fear. The only thing 'saving' you is the intricate web of 'support' you depend on from the government.

       If you say so. Everything you wrote implies the opposite. Your whole idea is that without words on paper to stop them, people are going to murder, rape, and steal. That is the idea of a very scared person.  Its weird though, I can't come up with any reason that you would think that. Its not like you've lived in such a society or can point at one that happened in. It seems more likely you are basing it upon post-apocalyptic movies.

       It's not just words on paper though, its active enforcement of punishments. No one would listen if you said "don't drive 5 mph over the speed limit when no ones around" if you didn't have a punishment and speed cameras watching out for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actively seeking out criminals and stopping them is what deters people from committing crimes. Most people don't want to risk their comfortable lives with the threat of jail. If there were no consequences to their actions there would be a lot more rule breaking. Just look at how students act when they have supply teachers compared to when they have their normal teacher.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happens when we have riots? People abuse the lack of police to try and get away with stealing and damaging property.
      </p>
      <p>
       The facts are, anarchy has been proven not to work.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have provided examples. Look at the middle east, a lack of proper enforcement and stable government has led to incredible violence. In Africa warlords have child soldiers and are incredibly brutal. Look what happened during the Russian conflict. There is a vast amount of evidence proving that people simply do not act peacefully when they have no constraints.

       This appears to be true.  Also, even many communists and socialists despise the idea of anarchy, which is an interesting twist.  And liberalism has almost completely lost touch with the idea, which is even more interesting since the whole idea of "left" politics arose from the anarchists sitting to the left of the French king.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of nature, its spectacular beauty and organization, its tremendous utilization of resources, and its efficiency is entirely anarchic.  For humans, we are anarchic by nature and government is always imposed by external force.  Even the American government.

       The initial conquest happens because the hapless victims cannot adequately defend themselves.  Modern firearms may change this but we haven't yet seen a good experiment.  America and Switzerland are the only countries in the world with widespread civilian marksmanship and firearms training, and nobody has tried to conquer or overthrow those territories since gaining widespread civilian armament.

       See, I've been from one side of the country to the other my friend over the course of the past decade. I have to say that the best parts I have lived in are crown jewels of Western civilization. Its worst aspects, on the other hand, might as well be a part of some Third World regime not unlike 20th Century Latin American despots like Pinochet, Straussner, and Argentina's Juan Peron.

       I live in no geographic bubble. If you do, do yourself a favor and pop it for good. Don't bother blowing it back up when its convenient. That is how tyranny wins when those of good conscience feel they can do nothing.

       It's not just geography either. I mean, I hope for all our sake you're right. But my experience is even people who identify as mad at the government, still defend it to the point of fist fights if you dig into their philosophy enough.

       yeah.  I live out in the country, and I can't remember the last time I needed the government, for anything.  I don't even call the cops when I have a problem, I handle it myself.  They won't do anything anyway, my car was stolen and they didn't even look for it.  I eventually found it myself.  Then my van was stolen a few years later, and when it turned up, the cops had it towed and I had to pay to get it out of impound.  When I asked why I had to pay to get my own stolen car back, they said 'the towing company we used does not have a contract with the city'.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have also had my house broken into, but I handled that myself.  The less said about that, the better.  The government is nothing but a parasite on the community.

       It's not an idea.  It's what actually happened.  It's actually been pretty clear from the beginning, when we started funding and training and arming those "rebels" in Syria.   Hello.
      </p>
      <p>
       We also imported plenty of them, and a ton of arms, from Libya, after we butt-raped Quadaffi.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're a class act, the good old US.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and anybody remember the "Highway of Death" from the first Gulf War?   All those vehicles of the Iraq military trying to get back to Baghdad, driving through the open desert, and we obliterated them.  To the point where the pilots were refusing to slaughter any more, because it was fish in a barrel?   It was a fucking massacre, and the highway ended up being burned and blown-up vehicles as far as you could see?
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember that?
      </p>
      <p>
       ISIS drives through the vast open desert in Toyota pickup trucks.   Something tells me we're letting them do that.  Otherwise there would be lots of smaller "Highways of Death" littered with blown-up Toyota PU trucks.
      </p>
      <p>
       ISIS is a proxy force of the United States.   It is funded by Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the US and is supplied directly by Turkey.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is a statement of fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US isn't going to take out its own proxy force.  This is all about getting Russia out of Syria.   By taking down Syria.

       ISIS doesn't JUST drive through the vast open desert in Toyota pickup trucks, they also drive in 2300 US Humvees, towing Howizter cannons, which were left laying around. And they also somehow keep getting resupplies of ammo for all their weapons. Weird.

       I have this mental image of Isis rolling in to this huge parking lot of Humvees, Howitzers, etc. all of which are mysteriously fully armed, fueled, and have the keys already in the ignition...  Technically/legally we can always later claim we never actually supplied them.

       This isn't about fighting an enemy.   This is about wealth transfer.  It's about suctioning vast sums of your tax dollars out of the federal treasury and into the private sector.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's another undercurrent that's worth exploring.   The role that suppressed, unconscious rage plays in the brutality of it all.

       The current Israeli strategy surrounding ISIS, whether it directly created the group or not, seems to be to take advantage of regional chaos relating to the Sunni v. Shiite split that destabilizes Israel's feuding rivals.

       And to add to your post, this is all nothing new. Since the end of the Second World War the US has been arming, funding, training, and providing resources and intel to radical Sunnis. In large part this was due to their rejection of the inherent secularism of Socialism, which at one point threatened to spread throughout most of the Middle East.

       It's a fucked up thing isn't it. The only reason I can think for them to do this is to get a firm hold on oil production after Israel takes over the area. Satellite nation or otherwise. They have to take Iran, they have to fuck with Russia (heroin and I'm sure other ways too) but I just don't see the endgame other than ww3 with Russia/ China/ maybe NK. Is the dollar so fucked that this shit must be done? I don't know enough, these are just gut feelings from what I do know.

       Why, because we're supposed to believe they are all 'savage Muslim barbarians' over there while the rest of us here in America are supposed to be 'good ol' Christian saints' who would never believe any b.s. conspiracies??? That is the definition of political propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking of crazy conspiracy theories, you seem to forget that there are some forty percent of Americans who believe that dinosaurs never walked the earth and that our planet is less than 10,000 years old.

       Also, in the case of the Iraqi people's perceptions, there happens to be video evidence to validate their claims on this topic pertaining to ISIS.

       Well, considering how you all just marched in and occupied the place for almost a decade, destabilizing their whole country in the process, who can really blame the Iraqi people for seeing Terminators patrol their streets while the rest of us stateside saw 'heroes' on TV who we were told could commit absolutely no wrong whatsoever...
      </p>

       I must add that I am sorry you were misled to go over there my friend. It would be unfair to hold what happened there against you personally. I am sure that you and your brothers in arms arrived over there with the absolute best of intentions.

       Based on how I perceived your initial commentary, I took you at first to be one of those rabidly anti-Arab xenophobic American veterans Americans like to pretend don't exist. As much as I'd like to believe otherwise, I have met too many who have served who disgrace their oath and uniform stateside with this poisonous casual attitude that has it that Americans must be over there to bring freedom and civilization to what those types I've come across term the 'heathen' Arab 'Sand N*****' world :(

       Awkward outdoor camera angles maybe (glare, weather, etc., other factors that can't be controlled)? Maybe it's because government central planning schemes like false flag terror attacks are always destined to miserably fail?

       Regardless, those videos were all clearly shot in a studio, whether it was somewhere in Riyyadh, Dubai, or Malibu, California. There is no way in hell that 10 foot tall jihadis beheaded Coptic Christians in the middle of a raging war zone on some beach outside of Tripoli without being observed by a single outside party.

       You have really opened my eyes here, sirs. I look forward to monitoring this thread for a while to keep on learning. I really need to keep up with current events more, all I knew about ISIS until now was that they were the new al-Qaeda and that their name was the same as Archer's intelligence organization, heh. Will really be watching the news from today forward, this is all too likely.

       Hey, this world we all live in is too important to let go to shit. The least anyone of us should be able to do is call attention to its many inconvenient truths. Knowledge is power, after all.
      </p>
      <p>
       As one who has followed current events since early childhood, however, I cannot stress enough how much you really ought to do yourself a favor if you must watch mass media, and tune into what often passes as news with a grain of salt.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is often all mysteriously hypnotizing lately. Its content and commentary, however accurate, reflects an appeal to  mass emotional reactions over solid evidence and objectivity.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're looking for proper context to current events news always spins out of proportion, it is best to start right at the beginning. In this case, here was ISIS', almost half a century ago, as Turkey's clandestine, radical NATO stay-behind operation which would have been used against the occupying Red Army in the event of a Turkish Soviet invasion.

       It's more closer to fact at this point. There is so much evidence to support the idea that the US government created, funded and supports ISIS.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe ISIS is Obama's private little army to keep IRAN in check. As soon as ISIS get's outside the lines they are bombed. ISIS is being used to take out ASSAD which is an ally with IRAN and Russia. ISIS is being used in the proxy wars.

       |I believe ISIS is Obama's private little army to keep IRAN in check. As soon as ISIS get's outside the lines they are bombed.|
      </p>
      <p>
       That's really the big question isn't it; what role does Barack Obama play in all of this? Is he directly calling the shots behind ISIS as a regional proxy against Russia and Iran, or is ISIS a personal army of the old Bush regime, with which to regain political power in the United States? The ongoing ISIS crisis has won them at least one midterm election so far, after all. They clearly have no intentions to stop seeking public office anytime soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tend to believe in a certain degree of truth between both explanations. They are not inconsistent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider ISIS, like the high seas privateers (state sanctioned pirates) of old. They could perhaps comprise instead of a series of multiple organizations simultaneously played by multiple state and shadow state actors, each with competing goals for ideal visions of regional hegemony.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama obviously inherited ISIS from his predecessor, although that fact is no excuse for his actions he has taken since he was sworn in. He has evidently made himself a political pawn of the neocons for doing nothing to reign in his own intelligence apparatus, perhaps personally trying to make the best of a totalitarian situation he seems incompetent to find a way out of (ex: using ISIS as leverage against Iran in exchange for a lasting nuclear agreement and a thawing of historically cold relations between Iran and the U.S.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The most rabid neocons today obviously do not want that. Their game with ISIS is therefore fundamentally different from Obama's more restrained mass murderous approach by comparison.

       When I was in Iraq in 2013/2014, most of the Kurds actually believed the US and Israel were behind the entire thing. That was even before all this press about the US funding the rebels. When you're actually in the area, you realize things usually don't just turn that shitty that fast, and that's by Iraqi standards.

       That's super interesting you were in Iraq from 2013/2014. Were you serving as a U.S. military advisor there by chance?
      </p>
      <p>
       On a very related note to your situation, I too know a Pentagon personnel with some level of security clearance I was recently told by a mutual friend was serving as an advisor in Iraq not too long ago. There, they apparently helped train and armed Kurdish militias and also what's left of the official Iraqi army. A Benghazi investigator of some kind, this person, we reached the same conclusions on Islamist Syrian and Libyan rebel groups last time we had the chance to touch base in a six hour car ride. It was just half a year prior to ISIS being the Mid East menace it is today, so the general name that was floated around at the time to refer to these 'moderate' rebels turned Islamist radicals who have since become IS was usually Al Nusra Front.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, when I asked them in conversation what their thoughts on an obscure European press report I noticed detailing the jihadi arms ratline they uncovered that existed from Benghazi, Libya to Syria, and how that marked the real Benghazi cover up, as there were 30 CIA agents in Benghazi delivering Libyan arms to Syrian rebels 'coincidentally' at the time of the consulate attack, their usual calm and cool tone immediately changed as they very directly informed me the explanation, in all seriousness, "might not be too far off" from what happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, this was roughly half a year before Mt. Sinjar in 2014 and the 'collapse' that shook the world of the Iraqi army in Mosul that first put ISIS on the map to more people.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we're now seeing unfold now has been in the making for a very long time.

       I was actually doing aquatic insect sampling in the Kurdistan region of Iraq with money paid for from a grant. I originally am a Kurd from northern Iraq. My parent migrated here in the mid-90's when I was only a couple months old.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing that is different in what the media tell you verse what goes on is a bit different.
      </p>
      <p>
       People normally want to live in safety and security, which makes peace a much more viable option. The Kurds held the most stable provinces in the country, so you'd always see Arabs (Sunni and Shiite) coming to the region for weekends of holidays. Some even tried to buy property there so they could stay in that region, but couldn't do it due to laws saying only Kurds and people who reside in the region permanently could actually own property.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the Kurds still have a grudge against the Arabs for the presection and mistreatment caused by them. The Arabs always had this arrogance to them to, which even I got tired of after a couple weeks there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The weird thing I find is that people don't want to get along and it makes
       <em>
        very, very
       </em>
       , little sense if you ask anyone you see. Everyone wants to just get along, and they try very hard to. Particularly the Kurds. This Sunni/Shiite dilemma exploded after the US invasion. I'd talk to older folks in their 70's, 80's and 90's and they would say they never say violence on this scale while they've been alive. That's even before Saddam. The groups do dislike each other, but not enough to destroy the peace.

       Not arguing with you on this but the idea behind the start of ISIS and ISIL being due to America is incorrect. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has been in the working for a few centuries.

       The idea of an Islamic caliphate spanning the Arab world has obviously been with the region since the time of the Prophet Muhammed. The forces behind ISIS today are obviously privy to the Middle East's history. They are using it as a propaganda weapon.

       If you are suggesting that ISIS simply just appeared one day out of widespread Arab world hatred, that also some misleadingly try arguing also just appeared one day, toward an American 'Great Satan' culture they do not understand, that does not discount the mountain of evidence to suggest that ISIS militants, however fundamentally totalitarian in their stated religious beliefs, have been receiving a lot of help from the United States government all along. Remember all those 'moderate' Syrian and Libyan rebel groups? That's where the modern incarnation of an Islamic State directly originates from in the first place.

       Awkward outdoor camera angles maybe (glare, weather, etc., other factors that can't be controlled)? Maybe it's because government central planning schemes like false flag terror attacks are always destined to miserably fail?

       Regardless, those videos were all clearly shot in a studio, whether it was somewhere in Riyyadh, Dubai, or Malibu, California. There is no way in hell that 10 foot tall jihadis beheaded Coptic Christians in the middle of a raging war zone on some beach outside of Tripoli without being observed by a single outside party.

       yeah because they are secretly safe inside their little bubble of a reality, which is really just a cult that calls itself a government, that has judges that wear fruity capes and hats, and throw people in cells for doing the same things they are going to do when they go home that evening.

       except that Governments are co-opted by giant coporations, and make laws specifically for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       what you think is a regulation, was probably written to allow seedy businesses to continue to operate within the context of "the law"

       yeah.  I live out in the country, and I can't remember the last time I needed the government, for anything.  I don't even call the cops when I have a problem, I handle it myself.  They won't do anything anyway, my car was stolen and they didn't even look for it.  I eventually found it myself.  Then my van was stolen a few years later, and when it turned up, the cops had it towed and I had to pay to get it out of impound.  When I asked why I had to pay to get my own stolen car back, they said 'the towing company we used does not have a contract with the city'.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have also had my house broken into, but I handled that myself.  The less said about that, the better.  The government is nothing but a parasite on the community.

       ignorance of what?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see with your own eyes what happens when laws are not enforced, it never ends well.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are the one being willfully ignorant here. You are pretending that you are in a fantasy land where people can live happily in a world without laws, where companies won't exist and the people will assert their will.
      </p>
      <p>
       The scary truth is that people can be evil. Look at Hitler or Stalin, when there was nothing to stop them they had no reason to not do what they wanted.

       Sorry, I would just rather have police that I can call and a medical service instead of being stabbed and being left to die in the streets with no justice.. I must be fucking crazy right?

       If you say so. Everything you wrote implies the opposite. Your whole idea is that without words on paper to stop them, people are going to murder, rape, and steal. That is the idea of a very scared person.  Its weird though, I can't come up with any reason that you would think that. Its not like you've lived in such a society or can point at one that happened in. It seems more likely you are basing it upon post-apocalyptic movies.
