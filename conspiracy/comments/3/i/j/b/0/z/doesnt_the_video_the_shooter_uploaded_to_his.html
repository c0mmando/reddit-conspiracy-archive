<p>I don&#39;t really understand how people didn&#39;t see him holding a gun up and then dropping it back down. However, the motions looked exactly like other pistols I&#39;ve shot. The shock on the reporter&#39;s face is absolutely real. And it&#39;s not uncommon for people to get fatally shot and try to run away, their body unaware that it is actually dying incredibly fast (especially with a torso shot, which is where he hit the woman).  After the initial shots, he seems to put the phone in his pocket (or tries to), which lines up with the stills captured off the cameraman&#39;s camera. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, shots from overhead from a helicopter shows the scene fairly well. I&#39;m on my mobile so it&#39;d be difficult for me to find a link right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am normally all for conspiracies, and I&#39;m not disproving anything. However, I&#39;ve never shot a handgun, nor a person. I have shot a rifle, and a wild boar (only once) though and the video was nothing like I imagined it to be. I thought it would be bloody and gory. You know, like when I shot the boar I could instantly see the gun wound, and blood was pouring from it. The woman (Alison) didn&#39;t even seem to be wounded by the initial shot(s). Maybe I watched the wrong video, but it all seemed weird to me. The camera angle and everything. But then again, I&#39;ve never shot a handgun, nor a person. Crazy and stupid people though. (<em>PSS: I understand clothes are covering up wounds, and shock can do incredible things, but that&#39;s just not what I expected someone who got shot from almost point blank range to do once shot</em>)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok after watching the video and looking at everyone&#39;s comments I have to say. 
1) you can get shot and walk away. Especially if it was a 9mm. Ones your adrenaline kicks in your body wouldn&#39;t really know. Because you&#39;re in your fight or flight. 
2) blood doesn&#39;t shoot out of someone&#39;s body when they get shot like its a fucking action movie. 
3) how did he shoot the video with his hand by his side? We can see it when the camera man drops his camera. Well almost every cell phone made now a days has a arm band you can buy. He could have had one on in order to get that view. 
4) with a elbow by you&#39;re side and jerking in the trigger of the gun you can throw off your aim by a lot. Just a half inch to one side or the other from a jerking your finger in the trigger can throw it off by feet even that close. </p>

<p>This is just my thought about the whole thing. And as for the cops wanting the BBC footage deleted... I mean common. How many other videos have you watched where coos wanted the same thing done. Even though they legally can&#39;t make you do it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, it is definitely real.  People don&#39;t explode in a poof of red when they get shot with pistol calibers.  They don&#39;t get turned off like a light switch from a couple torso shots, either.  I was skeptical at first too - but I don&#39;t think this one is fake.  The part that fucks with me is that I&#39;m so used to the media being manufactured to drive narratives that when something like this actually happens, it immediately triggers the &#39;bullshit&#39; part of my brain and I jump to looking for reasons to prove it rather than disprove it.  Seems backwards</p>

The time has come when the government is going to FUCK us all and use tyranny to rule the planet. Plenty of YouTube videos bring to light what the NWO has been doing the last few decades. This fake shooting is just what they need to enslave us all. If you haven&#39;t already, consider purchasing a survival kit and fill it with TONS of ammo and pretty much find a decent spot in the wilderness and hold up. I&#39;ll let you guys know how things go in the next few days, I&#39;m in SoCal at the moment and shits kicking off as we speak.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That pic, like the others of him are severely whitewashed.  Also if you look at one video of him, (not shooter video)  you can plainly see the black/white line surrounding his hands/palms.  The contrast between his palm and back of hand is very high, so I would think his back-hand and skin is very dark yet it shows up very light anyway.  Anyway, I find it suspicious that his &quot;other&quot; pics have all been heavily faded.</p>

<p>Notice she has some stride in her step. If he didnt get her the first time being that close, he definitely did not get her at that distance.

<p>Right.</p>

<p>This video got me thinking about another video I saw because of the distance and the type of gun used (a Glock). Here is a video of a police shooting an unarmed man in Utah with a Glock and further away. Granted he was a cop and had better aim, but this video demonstrates the stopping power of a Glock.

    <div class="md"><p>The link you posted with the 2 side by side videos works. However the video is not synched properly. Not proving or disproving anything, just something I noticed. Probably just crappy editing by the OP of the video. If I knew how to post a picture as a comment I would post the screenshot I took with the 2 videos not matching up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good observation. Yet another aspect of the video that suggests it may be staged. Maybe the shooter got there to soon and that why he&#39;s there not being noticed for what is actually a long time. He raised the gun 1st time...oops to soon wait for camera... Ok shoot.</p>
