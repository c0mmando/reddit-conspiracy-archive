<p>Please stop thinking both sides aren&#39;t the same, rule of thumb, if you find that a million whites will move to one candidate and a million blacks will move to the other, there is clear difference and opposition from the two.</p>

<p>What would be your plan if goverment suddenly started giving 0 zero phucks? How would you function? Would you even be able to function? What about the reality barrier? Would you be able to handle a new reality where if shit hits the fan it&#39;s up to you to fix it?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen the anarchy scenario and let me tell you, while mobs look like the cool thing to do on those 3rd world country videos, I&#39;m assuring it&#39;s not. We shouldn&#39;t be trying to destroy goverment, it has existed for 1000&#39;s of years, we should be trying to fix it. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not what I mean but wait, what? Anarchy is chaos.... do you understand how an anarchy system works? It&#39;s not pleasant and at anytime people can make the rules to deem whether your life is important or not. It would be a step backwards into a more primitive time of reality.</p>

<p>Yes, now imagine a world where no organization matters and people naturally feel they can group together and be like the CIA. You have this positive vibe mentality that people will stop being human somehow if goverment just suddenly disappear. My advice to you is think about some of the stuff you are asking, anarchy cannot be achieved without the radical side either.</p>

<p>people can band together and sing campfire songs.
people can band together and rape and pillage.</p>

<p>Yes, but a world goverment stops them from doing that with bombs and nukes. Think of a world where our goverment had to answer to nobody, that sounds crazy.</p>

<p>This is why you don&#39;t make sense, Anarchy ultimately leads to goverment. One group gets big enough to push ideas on the masses and bam, you have goverment. There is no escaping goverment because it is a logical thing for humans to use, it&#39;s a system and we do well with those. Making an efficient goverment system should be our goal, not breaking down society to the stone age and starting all over again.</p>

<p>It is only the European German Jew (whites) that wish to control anything, no other race goes out of their way to do so. Why is it all of a sudden anarchy is a option on the table, nobody was talking like this fifteen years ago. Nah, 15 years ago it was patriotism to bomb brown skin Muslims across the world. Now today it&#39;s &quot;Oh let&#39;s save Palestine&quot;, but those same people won&#39;t even admit the republicans they placed in office, have been doing the same shit right here in America. Fuck yall selective racism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Saying &quot;Fuck Israel&quot; is like saying &quot;Fuck America&quot;. Both our governments are lying to us and making otherwise decent people fall in line with the most deplorable activities... but if we have to take score, compare Israel&#39;s evils with what we did in Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Bolivia, Cuba, etcetera.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not American Policy or Israeli Policy any more... it is Goldman Sachs policy.</p>

<p>I would say it&#39;s more than a token, especially with the Zionist &quot;<a href="http://www.jrmi.org/wp-content/uploads/images/greater-israel-pitn-upclose.jpg">Greater Israel</a>&quot; Plan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Israel could go on for another 100 years if they just let up and made some deep concessions right now. The aggressive drive toward this Zionist goal is falling apart... and methinks a shrewd geo-strategist would ease off on the Settlements and the Boo-Hiss-Iran talk until public opinion stabilizes.</p>

<p>It seems a little dumb to press this hard, right now, unless whoever is pressing is willing to sacrifice Israel for a greater goal. Those at the top in Israel are thinking, &quot;Yeah... we&#39;re gonna get this &#39;Greater Israel&#39; thing done, now!&quot;... but those REALLY at the top, who would call themselves Jewish, Catholic or Atheist is it suited them... they are just trying to manipulate the Jewish people into getting themselves killed.</p>

<p>If WW3 REALLY starts, the nukes are headed to Tel Aviv. Those at the top must see this, and if WW3 is really on the plate, then they&#39;re willing to kill all the Jews to get their way... whether or not they are Jews themselves. It is fucking sick.</p>
