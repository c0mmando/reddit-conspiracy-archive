    <div class="md"><p>look into jay wiedner. he proposes we went to the moon but most of what we saw was faked.  he is convinced that NASA hired Stanley Kubrick to do the sets and the filming. because of some of his astounding camera work... he says the guy died of a very fast moving cancer shortly after 2001 space odyssey (murdered) because in the film he embedded clues too exactly that fact. and the powers that be figured it out and was scared he was going to blow the whistle.</p>

<p>Best proof is around minutes 34-40.  Actual footage of them in low Earth orbit faking the half-way-to-the-moon shot.  Watch the whole thing if you&#39;re actually interested.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The first sign they never went is how defensive and offended they get when you suggest otherwise.<br/>
This is a sign of guilt.  For example, let&#39;s say you wake up after a sleepover with a bunch of people, and find your wallet is missing.  You ask a guy who was sleeping next to you, &quot;did you steal my wallet?&quot;  An innocent person will, statistically, be confused and concerned.  A guilty person, statistically, will get aggressive and accuse you of being &quot;stupid&quot;, &quot;crazy&quot;, and will feign great offense in your accusation.  So far NASA is looking guilty.</p></li>
<li><p>They &quot;lost&quot; all the recordings.
The greatest achievement of mankind was held by the greatest minds, and they lost it all.  All of it.  It&#39;s gone.  These people were able to send a man to the moon, but they just can&#39;t keep track of stuff.</p></li>
<li><p>We&#39;ve never been to the moon since.
It&#39;s been 50 years and just recently it was proposed to travel back to the moon because, and I quote, &quot;if we can get to the moon, we can get to Mars&quot;.  Uh...didn&#39;t we already get to the moon?</p></li>
<li><p>Good luck spotting the flag on the moon.
There&#39;s a flag there, right?  Telescopes are pretty powerful now, right?  We should know exactly where that flag is, right?  Good luck.</p></li>
<li><p>We didn&#39;t care about going to moon as much as we cared about the Russians thinking we did.
We were losing the Space Race badly, and we all of a sudden jump and win the gold.  Wow.  How ever could this have happened?</p></li>
<li><p>Radiation belts.
We;ve recently discovered belts of radiation that could potentially fry any living thing passing though them, and they lay between us and the moon.  If we sent people there, why are they still alive and happily claiming to have been to the moon?  (while making lots of money on that very statement)</p></li>
<li><p>The moon doesn&#39;t make any natural sense.
It really shouldn&#39;t be there.  It&#39;s way larger than it should be.  It perfectly eclipses the sun.  We only see one face of it.</p></li>
<li><p>A lot of money could be made from faking it.
The two rovers alone cost a few million each, and if it was fake, they would have costed them a thousand at the most.</p></li>
<li><p>Quite a number of high people resigned right before the launch.
Why would they leave right before their dreams came true?</p></li>
<li><p>Buzz Aldren&#39;s mother committed suicide.
What exactly was she ashamed of?</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>This is good stuff. Thank you. I knew a lot of this, from Dave McGowan&#39;s &quot;Wagging the Moondoggie,&quot; but there&#39;s good new stuff here, too. </p>

<p>The one that really got me was all the high level people resigning right before the launch. I did a Google, couldn&#39;t find anything on that. Can you steer me to some info on that?</p>

<p>Your #7 point is right-on, too. There is more to the moon than we have been told. The fact that, according to dating of moon rocks, the moon is actually hundreds of millions of years OLDER than the earth is super weird. And the fact how it perfectly eclipses the sun, also weird.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries.  Honestly, these are just &quot;facts&quot; I picked up from years of conspiracy research.  Personally, I believe we went to the moon, but these were some of the things that stuck with me.</p>

<p>To give you a reference would mean lots of digging for me, and I&#39;m lazy.  Sorry.  I can promise it&#39;s out there though.</p>

<p>The only thing I can&#39;t tell you is if it&#39;s true.  &quot;Truth&quot; is relative.  Consider a bear.  One person will say, &quot;that bear is a gentle beast of nature&quot;, while another will say, &quot;that bear is a horrible carnivore&quot;.  The only &quot;truth&quot; is the bear.  The bear is.</p>

<p>The only real advice I can give is to question everything.  Especially if your questions piss people off.</p>

<p>So obviously you haven&#39;t done even a tiny bit of research into what you are promoting as a fact, right? Even worse, you&#39;re telling someone else they are wrong (and stupid), even though what you are saying is literally 100% false in the most basic sense. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a Reuters headline for you: <strong>&quot;Moon landing tapes got erased, NASA admits&quot;</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/07/20/us-nasa-tapes-idUSTRE56F5MK20090720">http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/07/20/us-nasa-tapes-idUSTRE56F5MK20090720</a></p>

<p>So obviously you&#39;re just here to feel smug and superior about things you actually know nothing about? How could you dismiss his statement as a lie when the first thing that comes up on google for anything close to &quot;erased moon landing tapes&quot; is multiple mainstream media sources confirming that exact fact? Or do you just dismiss things as crazy because the TV has told you to do so?</p>

<p>Yes. good. Let me repeat that for you</p>

<p>&quot;Moon landing tapes got erased, NASA admits&quot;</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a link to an article that describes it:</p>

<p>About how they were broadcast live to several <em>hundred million</em> homes?</p>

<p>Because it&#39;s patent disinfo. A vague, unqualified statement meant to wow people into thinking it&#39;s significant.</p>

<p>&quot;That special lunar camera recorded in an odd format that was incompatible with the format used for broadcast TV. So when the footage was received on Earth back in July of 1969, it had to be converted for the live television broadcast.</p>

<p>The conversion degraded the images, and hundreds of millions of TV viewers saw dark, murky pictures. [...]</p>

<p>Those pictures were still thrilling — after all, it was &quot;Live from the Moon!&quot; and a human was walking on another celestial body for the very first time — but some experts knew that the lunar camera was capable of doing better.</p>

<p>&quot;It was better. We knew it was better,&quot; says Stan Lebar, who worked at the Westinghouse Electric Corporation and led the team that designed and built the lunar camera.&quot;</p>

<p>Please read :</p>

<p>Is what was said. Pay attention:</p>

<p>Saying &quot;They lost all the recordings. The greatest achievement of mankind was held by the greatest minds, and they lost it all. All of it. It&#39;s gone.&quot;</p>

<p>Is disinfo. It&#39;s false. The recordings were broadcast to 500 million televisions.</p>

<p>That&#39;s how television broadcasting was done and would be done for some time. </p>

<p>As I&#39;ve shown numerous times, is false and misleading.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is pointless. You seem to think that the fact that they broadcast them out at a lower quality negates the fact that they lost them. </p>

<p>If we had a high quality copy of a record, and then played that record on the radio, and then lost it. It would still be lost. We would have still lost the record. I don&#39;t see why you&#39;re so dead set on disputing this (probably because conspiracy theorists are dumb hurr hurr) but I&#39;ll let everyone who bothered to read this far make up their mind about who actually has a point here.</p>

<p>All the original recordings are gone forever, they are lost. Forever, gone, period. It is not misleading to say this.</p>

<p>well of course, making a comment like &quot;it&#39;s <em>all gone</em> all of it! those dummies at nasa sure bungled that one!!&quot; is a really reasonable and accurate thing to say.</p>
