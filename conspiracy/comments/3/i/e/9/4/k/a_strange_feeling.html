       So much war and death, yet, no Apocolypse? That's how it's always been. "The end is coming!" Maybe they're right. I mean 70 generations isn't that long. I personally think something else is abrew. Some kind of celestial event; perhaps we cause it (CERN) perhaps not (aliens). Perhaps we peak into they're world and let something in. Perhaps we want to, perhaps we don't; perhaps we don't care. Either way, this is happening. I'm not claiming to have an answer but whatever it is, we will know soon enough. The people in charge of CERN are the same people who created the Internet. They have the most advanced technology known to man and they are using it, despite whatever ramifications there are. The Large Hadron Collider will reach full power on Swptember 23rd,  2015. Let's hope they're not ready to do what they intend on doing with that machine.

       That's just what I've heard. They started the machine in March/April and it takes about six months to reach full power. I'm not claiming to know what it's going to DO, but I think technology this powerful is bound to do something big. (Maybe it's not malevolent, but I doubt it)

       nothing is going to happen ... you mean like they will fuck it up and blow up the world or something? that probably can't even happen or rather the probability of happening is sooooo low it's not even worth discussing. even if they made a black hole, which some people are afraid of, they explained, this black whole would be so small it would literally vaporize in milliseconds ... there is no threat.

       Korean war 33k dead, Vietnam 45k dead, Dubya's Iraq and Afghanistan wars 7k dead !

      <p>
       This not to mention that crime in America is still at historic lows.
      </p>
      <p>
       Famine deaths is decreasing rapidly (now much more worrying is malnutrition).
      </p>
      <p>
       Not even the immediate post-Cold War was "peaceful" with civil wars erupting in most ex-Soviet republics, along with CIA-Yugoslav regime change.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course Dubya helped the comeback of the MICC to center stage, and Washington (and allies) policies aren't making the world any safer.

      <p>
       Then we consider the reckoning that awaits us for the economy, and rising inequality

       Then you are blind. Thousands killed in Palestine by Israel; Operation Protective Esge; supported by the Obama Regime. War in Ukraine, thousands dead; funded by the Obama Regime. Whatever you wanna call them. It's not just the the Republicans; that's a small minded approach to the situation. Obama is just as warmongering if not worse. We have attacked multiple countries, are deploying troops all over Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and South Korea. Don't even get me started on our tension with Russia, or the Chinese currency issue. Also, the split in Congress on whether or not we should continue to support Israel's neo-nazi-esque killing of Palestinians. I'd say the world is heading towards chaos. Now, it's up to you to decide whether or not you think these things are all "authentic" or in other words more or les accidental/random events; or you can believe that they are an orchestrated facade to scare everyone and create a United World Government. Either way, we're definitely in a lot of war right now. Seriously; Libya, Iraq, Syria, Ukraine, Yemen, North Korea, all of Africa, all involved in conflict right now. All proxies for larger interests abroad.

       there's another side to the equation for those wars you're missing there buddy...
      </p>
      <p>
       "A study, published in prestigious medical journal The Lancet, estimated that over 600,000 Iraqis had been killed as a result of the invasion as of July 2006. Iraqis have continued to be killed since then. The death counter provides a rough daily update of this number based on a rate of increase derived from the Iraq Body Count.
      </p>
      <p>
       The estimate that over a million Iraqis have died received independent confirmation from a prestigious British polling agency in January 2008. Opinion Research Business estimated that the death toll between March 2003 and August 2007 was 1,033,000."

       Well the Korean war lasted 2 years and with 600k combatant deaths (civilian probably twice as much). Vietnam had some 2.5 million deaths (combatants and civilians).
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention Rwanda genocide (800k), Congo wars (1 million). All these happened last century. And of course I'm not even considering WWI/II.

       While I agree that we are seeing an escalation in violence and conflicts, sadly they are still

       Haha well I mean the experience might be subjective to the person. We all have "inner demons". We may experience a lot of things simultaneously. It's like, all the sudden everyones senses are changed. Maybe we become aware of other actors/agents in reality. Maybe they're more prepared for the interaction.

       I think what we will experience is something along the lines of everyone's imaginations coming to life; that's a scary thought in our current state.
