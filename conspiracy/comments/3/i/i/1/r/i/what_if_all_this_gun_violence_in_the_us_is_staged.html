    <div class="md"><p>Well, nobody said they were going to be successful in getting us to surrender our weapons. One thing I want people to keep in mind, however, is that it took 12 years for us to find out what the NSA was up to after 9/11. Sandy Hook occurred less than 3 years ago, and we already see a strong anti-gun sentiment among the populace, and many directives regarding mental health and gun possession have been signed into law. So in 2024, will we have seen a gun-grabbing effort by then? Seems like a good chance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.  The US gov will not ban guns anytime in our lifetime.  With the view to ban guns to work, the gov will have to get majority of people to not want guns.  Just about every male in the south has a gun for protection.  If they tried to take our guns in 10 years, there would be another civil war.  These shootings aren&#39;t changing anyone&#39;s mind.  The only reason this shooting got in the media was because they were filming during it.  That combined with the guy who did it filming it too.  Murder suicides happen very often and frequently.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that a gun grab would not be successful anytime soon. It would have to be a very long process to actually change people&#39;s minds, or an even longer process to recruit enough people willing to fight gun owners.
All that being said, it doesn&#39;t mean nobody&#39;s working on a gun grab. It certainly seems at the very least that there&#39;s an effort to add more and more restrictions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well of course there is.  It is a barbaric tool used by our ancestors.  We are suppose to be above this kind of brute force.  We aren&#39;t, but we should be.  Just as we look back on our ancestors and see how terrible they were, so will our descendants.  If you ask other countries about gun control, they don&#39;t want guns.  They don&#39;t see any one good thing coming from them.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There will always be guns. Everybody owning a gun keeps everybody else in check. When only some people own guns, the rest become vulnerable.</p>

<p>Even if we&#39;re all wrong and there are currently no gun-grab attempts occurring, then we&#39;d still be silly to ignore all of human history and assume no future power-hungry madman will never come to power ever again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you really object to stronger curbs on mentally unhinged people from owning guns? I&#39;m in England, and the idea that everyone living around will have a gun is very scary. There are some insane people around here.

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my thought on it. If it were something simple - let&#39;s say, for example, more than half of people with diabetes have committed a gun crime since their diagnosis. Well then we can say, sure, find all the diabetics and prevent them from buying guns, maybe even taking the ones they have.</p>

<p>Mental illness, however, is not a black-and-white disease and instead must be defined as a collection of various diagnoses. Every year, there&#39;s several new types of mental illness being added. By saying people with a mental illness can&#39;t own a gun is doing two things: a) putting the decision of gun ownership eligibility in the hands of the government and b) preventing people from seeking help for true mental illness due to fear of being ostracized and having their firearm and ability to protect themselves taken away.</p>

<p>The law in America states that no convicted felon is allowed to be in possession of a firearm. Does this prevent convicted felons from owning weapons? Of course not. By far, most murders (and murder victims) have many prior convictions, usually including a felony.</p>

<p>We have all sorts of dangerous people here, and a gun law isn&#39;t going to stop a determined person from obtaining and using one. Period. Why might we feel any different about a mentally ill person? A background check won&#39;t do anything to stop mass shootings because many mass shooters have no criminal background history.</p>

<p>Several years ago, I was diagnosed with bi-polar. However, in no way do I share a propensity for violence as some crazies who were similarly diagnosed have displayed, nor have I ever done anything violent. So should I be supporting legislature that would rid me of my right to own a firearm and protect myself just because someone who was also arbitrarily diagnosed with the same disorder, from a completely different doctor a thousand miles away, gets upset at someone and loses his shit? No thank you.</p>

<p>So I hope you see where we&#39;re coming from. I believe unarmed countries should be supporting gun ownership in other nations. Once all the other nations lose their guns, that&#39;s when our oh-so-loving world government can show themselves and you may suddenly see the need for a weapon.</p>

<p>The staged events and the laws or threat there of are just a ruse to get people further armed. This in combination with the mainstream popularization of zombies will make us more more prone to kill each other in a collapse situation.</p>

<p>When they pull the switch we will kill each other instead of banding together. While they sit in compounds and wait we do the dirty work for them. </p>
