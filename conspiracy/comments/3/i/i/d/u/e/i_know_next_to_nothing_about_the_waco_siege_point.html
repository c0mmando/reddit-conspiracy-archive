       Good documentary, except it leaves out something very critical.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was watching CNN with my father shortly after noon on April 19, 1993.  There was a tank that busted down the door, and as it backed out, there were flames blasting from the barrel of the tank.  My father and I watched in shock, and CNN quickly cut away.
      </p>
      <p>
       I watched all afternoon waiting for a replay, and finally on the 5pm news, CNN showed the video again.  I called my mom in to show her...except the video had by this time been doctored.  The tank backed out of the door, and instead of flames, there was a white mist coming from the barrel.  CNN was claiming the Davidians started the fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bill Hicks mentioned it in a stand-up bit, which our illustrious moderator mr_dong has posted here in a comment.  Video of the event is hard to find, and shaky, because news crews were ordered to stay far from the location, so they were using long-range lenses.  (A slight breeze, or even trucks on the road nearby, would cause the cameras to vibrate.)
      </p>

        This is what my father and I saw that day.

       Fwiw, the sheriff at the time said that he had visited the compound, knew of the guns, and had even gone shooting with Koresh. Koresh could've been apprehended away from the compound, but for whatever reason, TPTB wanted everyone there dead. The truth was bulldozed over.

       They murdered 76 men, women, and children.  And there's this

       If have to disagree about the lack of regard for life. I mean they waited 51 days to do much of anything and began the assault with tear gas. They could have easily went in and shot everyone the first day of they'd wanted to. I'm also curious as to why you think it was illegal?

       Easily?  After the BATF started the firefight three of their agents were killed attempting to breach a second story window.  They did not expect the Branch Davidians to shoot back and they were forced to retreat.

       Okay maybe not easily, but they didn't have to wait 51 days and the fact that they used tear gas shows they at least had some regard for the people in the compound. The point is

       The fires were started by the FBI during the armored assault with CS gas and then they shot anyone who attempted to leave condemning everyone there to a horrible death.  Burning to death is the most excruciating way to go imaginable.  People don't do that to themselves.  They just don't.

       First of all, the Davidians certainly started the fire. There is little doubt of this.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Although several of the surviving Branch Davidians insist that they did not start the fire, a panel of arson investigators concluded that the Davidians were responsible for igniting it, simultaneously, in at least three different areas of the compound. Unless they were deliberatley set, the probability of the three fires starting almost simultaneously was highly unlikely, according to fire experts. Furthermore, the videotapes show the use of accelerants that strongly increased the spread of the fire. Although one Branch Davidian stated that a FBI tank had tipped over a lantern, videotapes show that the tank had struck the building a minute and a half before the fire began. Also some of the surviving Davidians' clothing showed evidence of lighter fluid and other accelerants. In addition, FBI listening devices seemed to establish that the Davidians were overheard making statements such as, "Spread the fuel," some six hours before the fires began. (Joint Hearing of the Crime Subcommittee July 1995.)

       I assume you are referring to the alleged shots fired by the FBI on the final day of the siege. While it isn't entirely clear if they did fire, there is evidence to suggest they did, but I could find no evidence they were doing so to keep people from leaving the compound, and I could find to record of them shooting someone who was attempting to leave. There was however gunfire also coming from the Davidians on the final day of the siege and whatever fire came from law enforcement was certainly in response to that gunfire, not a response to people leaving the compound. If you have a source that contradicts this, I would be very happy to see it.

       Tear Gas actually contains a highly flammable solvent, and when it burns it actually produces a deadly cyanide gas... which was specifically used to kill those left alive inside the compound.  MULTIPLE bodies found inside the WACO Compound after the fire showed undisputed signs of death via Cyanide gas inhalation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI specifically flooded the entire compound with a know flammable substance, opened the ground floor up to create turn the compound into a vented fireplace... and light it on fire with the people inside.    The FBI also refused to allow the Fire Department even near the compound as it burned.

       From what I have found, while were amounts of cyanide found in the bodies, it was not conclusively found to be the cause of death. It also isn't clear at all if the levels of tear gas were lethal.

       It is however, clear that the branch davidians started the fire. Audio recordings confirm that cultists poured gas around the compund on the orders of Koresh. This also explains how the fire erupted at multiple locations at the same time.

       Maybe I missed something, but I only heard 1 mention of cyanide at waco, and it was in the context of one eight year old victim who had died, and it was by the narrator, not any expert. The only other mention of cyanide was in the context of capital punishment, which has nothing to do with waco at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have time to watch the entire documentary right now, but from a quick glance online, it came out in 1997, which was I believe was before the audio tapes confirming the origin of the fire were released. I think this is an important point, because the documentary is therefore missing an important piece of evidence.

        According to medical examiners who performed the autopsies, CS gas did not directly kill any of the more than 80 Branch Davidians, including 22 children, who died in the fire on April 19. Nor did anyone perish from inhalation of CS gas--or its byproduct from a fire, cyanide--the medical examiners told FRONTLINE.

       I think you misunderstand. I did watch the section you told me to watch, I just don't have time to watch the entire documentary. Again if I missed something tell me, but in that section from 2:06 onward, there were two mentions of cyanide, one in the context of capital punishment and one in the context of a single victim at waco. However that mention came with no expert testimony and seemingly no evidence to back it up.
      </p>

       It is also telling that you accuse me of being a shill.

       From what I know, it was a siege on a compound of the Brand Davidians, which is (was) a fringe religious group. They had an ass load of weapons, and the ATF attempted to confiscate them, or something. The initial raid failed, and there was a siege that lasted for 51 days, until a massive fire engulfed the compound, and something like 80 people died.

       That's the story on the surface, anyway. I'm wanting to know what other aspects there are.

I've never heard it referred to as the "Waco Siege" though, everyone around Waco just refers to it as "The crazy cult shooting" I think the whole thing was this guy Koresh lead them in a religious belief that the end time was coming and they needed a cleanse or something.
