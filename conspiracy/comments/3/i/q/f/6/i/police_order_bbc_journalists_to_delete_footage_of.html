    <div class="md"><p>A Virginia State Police officer <a href="https://twitter.com/franzstrasser/status/636688489074003968">reportedly</a> censored two BBC journalists following Wednesday’s tragic shooting that took the lives of Alison Parker and Adam Ward. After Vester Lee Flanagan (AKA Bryce Williams) <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/27/us/wdbj7-virginia-journalists-shot-during-live-broadcast.html?_r=1">opened fire</a> at a local shopping center, killing the 24-year-old local reporter and the 27-year-old cameraman, he led police on a pursuit before he ran his vehicle off the highway and crashed. Police found him suffering from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Flanagan was transported to a nearby hospital, where he later died.</p>

<p>BBC journalists Franz Strasser and Tara McKelvey were <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/vester-flanagan-chase-bbc-journalists-covering-wdbj-shooting-threatened-by-virginia-police-10474038.html">reporting</a> from the scene of the crash when one of the officers approached the pair and ordered them to delete their footage. “Just at the scene of the suspects [sic] shooting on I-66. Police told me to delete footage or lose camera,” Strasser tweeted. “Reason for confiscating camera was that it was evidence. Threatened to tow the car because it was illegally parked,” he said in a follow-up tweet about an hour later.</p>

<p>Beyond the officer’s reliance on petty parking regulations to threaten the journalists, Strasser’s claims — if true — suggest an inherent contradiction in his demands. If the camera needed to be confiscated because it contained evidence, why would the officers insist that exact same evidence be deleted?</p>

<p>In another tweet, Strasser <a href="https://twitter.com/franzstrasser/status/636580666432425984">said</a> the only footage left was unusable iPhone evidence. Still, he said they “…were able to recover photos from the moment police asked us to delete crime scene footage.” “We are working on recovering the video file. Haven’t touched SD card so there’s a small chance,” he added. The reporter also clarified in a picture tweet that of the multiple officers present, there was only one who insisted they destroy their footage.</p>

<p>“One officer in particular (not pictured in any of these images) closed the trunk when I tried to put my camera bag in and said our car would be towed for being illegally parked and my camera seized for containing evidence. He then reversed course and wanted to watch me delete the footage I had gotten,” Strasser posted on his Facebook, along with pictures of the incident.</p>

<p>It is unclear why police would take issue with documentation of their investigation of the scene, however, there has been similar police censorship in the state in the past. Last year, Norfolk police <a href="http://wtvr.com/2014/06/13/petersburg-and-norfolk-police-investigate-altercations-involving-cell-phones-and-officers/">reportedly</a> assaulted a 19-year-old man for filming their interaction with his friend. </p>

<p>The ACLU of Virginia has said that filming police is entirely legal as long as the person recording does not interfere with officer duties. The ACLU’s Virginia chapter also <a href="https://acluva.org/7724/smile-youre-the-police-on-candid-camera/">says</a> that in the state, “…wiretapping law does not require all-party consent when recording another person or persons. Also videotaping is only illegal if done in a place where the person being filmed has a reasonable expectation of privacy.” Virginia’s ACLU <a href="https://acluva.org/7724/smile-youre-the-police-on-candid-camera/">claims</a>  there have been instances of police censorship in the state, nonetheless.</p>

<p>The National Press Photographer’s Association has <a href="http://wunc.org/post/virginia-police-order-bbc-journalists-delete-footage-suspected-shooters-crash#stream/0">requested a formal investigation</a> of the Wednesday incident. Corrine Geller, a representative for the Virginia State Police, says it is investigating the incident. In a tweet to Strasser, she <a href="https://twitter.com/franzstrasser/status/636701875044225024">said</a>, “VSP is aware of this incident and we are looking into it, as such actions violate VSP policy.” In a separate Tweet, Strasser <a href="https://twitter.com/franzstrasser/status/636583928137183233">wrote</a>, “But why they are then okay with deleting ‘evidence’ makes one question their reasoning,” highlighting a vital concern in the VSP officer’s attitude and actions against the journalists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work in television post production - I can promise you the chance is a lot less than 100%.</p>

<p>I know of high budget productions that have lost footage because of human error (clips deleted by mistake) and been unable to recover it even after contracting professional data recovery experts.</p>

<p>Video files are very large, the file structure it&#39;s often complex. It&#39;s not nearly as well suited to recovery as smaller documents and photos.</p>

<p>Although it&#39;s not impossible either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think any such cameras exist. Far more often it would be desirable to delete footage to allow shooting more than under any sort of duress. A not-really-deleted delete would impact the primary use negatively. </p>

<p>However some cameras allow duplicate recording to multiple cards, so in that situation you might be able to delete from one card only, or pop out the second card undetected before deleting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes,  that is correct.  I&#39;m not entirely sure how one recovers a file from an SD card,  but I imagine you&#39;d have to rename the file. </p>

<p>I still don&#39;t believe this reporter is going to risk his career by exposing the VSP criminality.  He&#39;s a White House correspondent,  he&#39;s an insider.  He&#39;s not going to risk his career with BBC and show people what he saw.  If he does,  I&#39;ll be very suspicious of it. </p>

Fascinating he also covered Boston Bombing, Sandy Hook and Mike Brown.  He is a White House correspondent full time. </p>

<hr/>

<p>BBC journalist Franz Strasser has filmed through rubber bullets and tear gas in Rio de Janeiro and has at times been told by police to stop filming while on assignment.</p>

<p>But he had never been ordered to delete footage until Wednesday, after he and a fellow journalist came upon the scene on Interstate 66 where Vester Lee Flanagan crashed a car following a pursuit by Virginia State Police.</p>

<p>A trooper told Strasser that police would need to seize his camera because his footage could be evidence, but then ordered him to delete the footage. The trooper watched as the journalist deleted it, Strasser said in an interview Friday.</p>

<p>Strasser tweeted about the incident on Wednesday. Corinne Geller, the State Police spokeswoman, tweeted back that police would look into it because such actions would violate police policy. Geller had not yet responded to requests for comment as of Friday afternoon.</p>

<p>Strasser has worked as a video journalist for BBC in Washington, D.C., for six years, covering features and breaking news across the United States. He reported on the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, covered the fatal shootings of children and adults in 2012 in Newtown, Conn., and flew to Ferguson, Mo., numerous times to cover of the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown last year.</p>

<p>After the fatal shooting of Roanoke TV journalists Alison Parker and Adam Ward on Wednesday, Strasser and BBC White House reporter Tara McKelvey began driving to Roanoke in a rental car.</p>

<p>They heard police were in pursuit of the shooter but decided they should continue to Roanoke. As they drove on I-66 west, Strasser noticed no oncoming traffic and then saw about a dozen police cars and a silver car in the ditch on the other side of the interstate.</p>

<p>He knew what they had stumbled onto.</p>

<p>“Police were just standing around … so it didn’t seem like an active situation,” he said. “There was no commotion.”</p>

<p>He later realized they had arrived after Flanagan shot himself but before an ambulance had arrived. Flanagan later died.</p>

<p>Strasser stopped the car about 200 yards away, grabbed his camera and began filming as he walked through brush in the median to get to the other side.</p>

<p>He filmed the silver vehicle from 200 yards away. About six police officers then began running toward him, shouting, “Get back to your car!”</p>

<p>Strasser retreated to his car, where he opened the trunk to put his camera inside. An officer, presumably a state trooper, came up and closed the trunk.</p>

<p>“You’re not going anywhere. Your car is being towed,” the officer told him. “You’re parked illegally.”</p>

<p>The officer then asked about the footage: “What’s on that camera? That could be evidence. We need to seize that.”</p>

<p>The officer took the camera and fiddled with it for a few seconds. Strasser said he needed it to go to Roanoke. The trooper then told Strasser he’d need to first delete the video footage.</p>

<p>“He couldn’t figure out how to delete it,” Strasser said. “He gave it back to me and said, ‘I’ll watch you delete it.’”</p>

<p>As Strasser pulled up a prompt to delete the footage the officer said, “Now push it,” watching every step of the process.</p>

<p>The officer allowed Strasser to keep his camera and the journalists left for Roanoke. Strasser removed the video card, hoping he could later retrieve the deleted footage.</p>

<p>He tweeted about the incident but was more concerned about preparing mentally for the reporting they’d be doing.</p>

<p>“You kind of go a little bit on auto pilot when you go to a scene like this because you have to talk to people, you have a job to do,” he said.</p>

<p>He said the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown were the worse tragedy he’s covered, but “this one hits really close to home as a fellow journalist.” State Police are doing an internal investigation of the incident over Strasser’s footage following a complaint by BBC.</p>

<p>Mickey Osterreicher, general counsel for the National Press Photographers Association, has trained police in Dallas, Los Angeles, Washington and other cities in how to avoid overstepping their authority.</p>

<p>He said reporters and citizens taking pictures or video are interfered with, threatened or harassed on a daily basis by police.</p>

<p>There are narrow circumstances in which police could ask for video footage or obtain it with a search warrant, he said. For instance, if a serious crime was committed and police believe that if they didn’t seize a camera, evidence would be lost or destroyed, they can ask for consent to view the images or get a search warrant, he said.</p>

<p>In this case, the trooper violated the reporter’s First Amendment right to free speech, his Fourth Amendment right to be free of unreasonable seizure and his 14th Amendment right not to be deprived of property without due process, Osterreicher said.</p>

<p>“It would seem from that conversation that the trooper was very interested that whatever images (Strasser) had never see the light of day,” he said.</p>

<p>He wrote a letter to State Police about the association’s concerns.</p>
