      <p>
       After viewing the synced video of both the live camera and Flanagan's, I am losing my suspicion that the shooting video itself could have been faked or edited.
      </p>
      <p>
       My first question:
      </p>
      <p>
       -What's with the "fianc√©"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Before the words "hoax" or "false-flag" even entered my mind, I was chilled by Chris Hurst's Twitter posts. My immediate impression was that he seemed to be overplaying his relationship with the reporter (now that she's gone, who's to say different?) and that, to me, he appeared to be using this tragedy as a PR event for himself. He's with her, deeply in love, living together, and not a single soul knew? Even at first glance of the photo of them on Twitter, his mannerisms from the way he is openly placing his hand on her back to their facial expressions, I immediately thought that this guy looks like a person who has stalked and attempted to court a nice young lady. A lady who is too polite to turn him down.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for his interviews:
No tears shed. Multiple interviews directly after the loss of "the love of his life", all of which he brought his prop photo album to show off. He even has trouble answering the simplest of questions.. like "how did you find out?". It would be normal to expect someone would be tongue-tied and distraught after such a devastating event, but his lack of response seemed to be more that his script didn't include those questions, not that his mind was at a loss.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another interesting inconsistency is regarding the timing of his Twitter posts. Apologies if this has been debunked, but I have not seen any definitive answer regarding this. Chris Hurst posted about the tragedy at 6:31AM. The shooting occurred 15 minutes later, at around 6:46AM. My first guess was that I was viewing the modified time zone (I'm in PST, if I'm viewing a tweet he posted at 6:46AM my time, that would be 9:46AM EST. This would make sense)
      </p>
      <p>
       My question is: 
Can someone confirm what the exact time Chris Hurst posted his Twitter updates at?
      </p>
      <p>
       Please keep an open mind when responding to this, I am new to this sub and am not trying to be insensitive, or to insult anyone. A great tragedy happened, and I do not aim to discount this. I am merely another interested CT. Let me know what you think!

       i have a question or two,  WHERE IS HER MOTHER, the media never talks about the presence of her, has she passed away, divorced, etc. but no mention of her at all. where are all her (Alison) friends, we have yet to hear from her friends, or are they considering her followers her friends? Also, In his ( Bryce's) video, he shows us a security camera at the very beginning, is this a way of him telling us that there is more evidence that the media hasn't reported?  I just find the whole thing extremely fishy. Some things i found interesting: -her father said that she just turned 24 a week ago, but he could barely remember when it was, 
-the boyfriend seems like a really lousy guy just by the way he talks and holds himself, not a big thing but a girl like her would have a better bf.

       I really wouldn't expect much to come out of it. Considering how "they" are trying to patch together a believable story I can't imagine such a big loose end would be left. as of now, she's going to make it but my guess is either she takes a "turn for the worse" or she has absolutely nothing of value to add to the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       I found a comment that pointed out her reaction to the shooting as planned. rather than jumping and running when she heard the first shot, she simply cringed as if the noise she was hearing was louder than planned.

       Someone posted this in another thread, but the reporter who was shot actually looks at the gunman.

       You have to pause multiple times between 15-19 seconds to really see.

       it just doesn't add up. looks like the bf was a stalker coworker of hers, who she was just too nice to disassociate herself with (and they work together, obviously). every photo of them together looks like it's at a news site or company gathering, which is what the photo album is a compilation of. You could probably find similar photos of her with any other member of her news team. Not to mention just at face value she was way out of his league, I understand that doesn't prove anything, though. A bit creepy, was this paraphrased line:
"The last thing she said to me was 'good night sweet boy'"....
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom line how do you lose the "love of your life" and remain calm, composed, and present?

       That is the pic you are talking about. I was told it was photoshopped with no supporting evidence.

       For me there are just too many questions that just cant be answered satisfactorily.

      <p>
       The hand and the 2 images of the supposed killer, when placed side bearIng no physical resemblence.

       there is just to many inconsistencies for me to say, yeah, that guy was just fucked in the head.

       yeah I think the timing issue boiled down to the fact that Twitter shows posts by default in PST.
      </p>
      <p>
       there are still a lot of inconsistencies and at that, an ex-employee would be the perfect scapegoat especially considering this employee's past. then the manifesto was faxed in, weird they didn't find it on him or in his possession at all.

       the whole thing is shaky. the suspect is giving very specific and incriminating evidence to point the story in a certain direction. the fianc√© is developing another story to continue weaving the web. this to me appears to be a man made web, rather than one you'd find in nature

       found a thread that someone was able to articulate better what I mean:
      </p>
      <p>
       Does this sound like something a shooter might document in advance or more like laying the groundwork of "evidence" against a patsy?:
      </p>
      <p>
       ‚ÄúWhy did I do it? I put down a deposit for a gun on 6/19/15. The Church shooting in Charleston happened on 6/17/15...
      </p>
      <p>
       ‚ÄúWhat sent me over the top was the church shooting. And my hollow point bullets have the victims‚Äô initials on them."

       Could be shopped, maybe its not.
      </p>
      <p>
       but thats the footage that was released.
      </p>
      <p>
       So unless you want do super dective word and get a video editor yourself and get all the raw footage yourself, thats what there is to go on.

       It definitely looks like it could be consistent with the story.. his shirt looks blue in the photo you provided but you can't make out whether or not it's the plaid that you see in the POV video.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interesting note too, not that it implies anything other than imperfection on behalf of the editing staff, but if you watch the synced up video of the POV and live shooting on you can see they are slightly off. This may be a pointless observation, nevertheless it interested me and made me wonder how the sound clips would match up.

       IPhones aren't especially accurate with their frame rate. Often fractions of a second of the intended frame rate. Depending how the footage has subsequently been handled that could adjust the speed and timing slightly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really want to watch that POV video again though, so I've no idea what sort of sync drift you're talking about and I'm definitely not going to try to sync them myself.

       The twitter time has been debunked. That was due to different time zones, it was posted at 9:31 AM EST. Anyone on the west coast will see 6:31AM PST.

       Where is the dashcam video of the chase, or video from the airport of him switching cars, or a picture of him in the stretcher with his face not blurred. That's what I want to see.
