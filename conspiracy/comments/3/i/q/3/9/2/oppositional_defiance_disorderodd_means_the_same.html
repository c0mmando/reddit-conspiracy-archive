        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Whilst looking for reasons that ADHD is diagnosed three times more often in boys than girls, I read about &quot;oppositional defiance disorder&quot; i.e. a child who challenges authority. </p>

<p>I suspect the reason for more boys being diagnosed with ADHD than girls is to do with boys having a natural tendency to challenge authority. Its evolutionary. Some boys have an evolutionary instinct to challenge the leader of the tribe. In this way, a mechanism has evolved to ensure that the leader of the tribe tends to be the strongest possible candidate. This gives the leader more of a chance to pass on his strong genes, and therefore benefits survival chances of future generations. These behaviours can be observed in apes as well as many other mammals.</p>

<p>Seeing as evolution has ensured that there will always be defiant members of a society, in order to keep that society fresh, and protect against institutionalised weakness, I would say you should expect some children to show this tendency, and it shouldn&#39;t be seen as a failing and diagnosed as &quot;oppositional defiance disorder&quot;  but rather a crucial trait that has allowed human civilisation to reach the position it has.</p>

<p>I suppose members of &quot;La Resistance&quot; were severely suffering from &quot;Oppositional Defiance Disorder&quot; </p>

Females aren&#39;t just &#39;flowery dress wearing&#39;, pretty humans, they have just as much feeling for injustice and intelligence as males.

    <div class="md"><p>Boys don&#39;t have this trait more. It just SEEMS like it because males confront authority with banging their chests and shouting [or fighting or war]. </p>

<p>Women also confront authority but it&#39;s not as visible and often guys are not as interested in what women are up to, so it may often be over looked. I mean who cares about suffragettes or some girls in a Russian punk band, who cares about those ladies killed in the middle east during the Arab spring or the muslim girl that keeps fighting for female rights even though she was shot in the head?</p>

<p>They all cared, they all suffered. The rest would like to do the same but are bound by children who need their mums. 
It&#39;s not for lack of anger but for putting important aspects first.
We still have the &#39;trait&#39; though only we HAVE to think more to implement it.</p>

<p>This is very important from an evolutionary point of view. Us women must be vigilant and confront authority more if we want our offspring to have a good, safe life. Don&#39;t ever mess with mama bear! That&#39;s not just a saying.</p>

<p>If you really think that women are less concerned with injustice and would less often confront some authority, because we are female and put up with more [because we are all lovely, pretty ladies and like shiny things], then you are a patronising git who doesn&#39;t know about women, nor evolution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My older brother is ODD, while growing up he used to be the crap out of me and has taken a knife to family members. He was forced to stay at a mental hospital for kids when he was a teen because he couldn&#39;t control his behavior. It&#39;s not just &quot;challenging authority&quot; it is hurting people when you don&#39;t get what you want, or to just be spiteful. He went on to be a boxer. So not to ruin your thunder, but ODD is a real thing. It affects certain people with certain personalities. It&#39;s not just telling your parents &quot;no&quot; every once in a while. </p>

<p>its a category of certain personalities but I take your point. Every brain is unique, labels are helpful to some regard but these disorders are groups of symptoms under umbrella labels rather than actual diseases or processes causing the symptoms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ODD is the same as a &quot;rebellious child&quot; the same way depression is the same as a sad child. The same way not being hungry occasionally is the same as anorexia. </p>

<p>Being sad is normal. Being so sad you cannot leave the house and haven&#39;t for months is not normal. Not overeating is great. Starving yourself is very bad! Rebelliousness is a great trait. Arguing with your teacher every day for months, picking fights with your classmates and siblings, seeking revenge on a weekly basis and blaming all this on others, might be a problem!</p>

<p>And, for those of you who think this is just the drug companies - there are exactly zero drugs approved for treating ODD. It&#39;s treated with parent training, parent/child interaction therapy, individual and family therapy, cognitive problem solving training and social skills training. And, one of the more effective of these, the first line treatment, parent training. Helping parents provide more positive parenting, like support and consistency in discipline and supervision while de-emphasizing overly harsh punishments. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a case vignette from a training about ODD:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Get out of my face. Give me my toy train; I’m not putting it away. My mommy sent it with me and it’s mine” eight-year-old Jason angrily yelled at his teacher. “It’s not my fault it’s at school, but it’s mine and you can’t touch it anyway,” he continues. Within the first moments of the day Jason, now in the final weeks of his year in 2nd grade, flagrantly defies the routines of the classroom, engages his classmates in inappropriate and often antisocial behavior, and finds at least half a dozen students to pester before even considering taking off his jacket each morning. As his teacher continues what has become a daily battle for nearly seven months, Jason contends, “Stop talking to me. I am not your child. I’m not doing your morning work, or listening to your stupid rules. Look over there at Michael and James,” Jason gestures to two children working at their desks—“they always get me in trouble and you never tell them to stop.” As tears well in his eyes, and his teacher begins to engage in a behavior modification plan that became ineffective months ago, Jason clenches his jaw, creates fists with his small yet forceful hands, and has each member of his class off-balance in a highly negative way. “Stoooop—leave me alone,” he finally screams as a chair is overturned. As has become customary, his teacher heads for the phone to call the school counselor into action.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The training warns that even though Jason&#39;s behavior might fit the definition, more facts need to be uncovered first. It also warns that even severe outbursts for days or weeks won&#39;t count, nor will only a few symptoms. It&#39;s almost like they don&#39;t want to diagnose kids who are merely rebellious!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My problem with it is not what it is in theory, but how it sets up a framework that would make it possible for authority figures to dismiss legitimate unrest as ODD. Maybe kids aren&#39;t wrong to question why they&#39;re in school. </p>

<p>This kid Jason sounds similar to the young ape who dismisses the silverback&#39;s attempts to dominate him. But he also just sounds like the only authority he wants to accept are his parents. I guess it could be seen as being in that young apes interest if some other ape gave him some behavioral therapy to &quot;teach&quot; him his inferiority compared to the silverback. </p>

<p>My main point was about celebrating rebelliousness rather than attempting to stamp it out, and the evolutionary theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, authorities couldn&#39;t use any other diagnosis. Marie Antoinette couldn&#39;t say, &quot;Oh, the poor are just anorexic, they don&#39;t need bread, or cake.&quot; Or, this legitimate unrest is just dementia - a disordered cognitive process. </p>

<p>A silverback? Apes? How many miles are you willing to walk to rationalize your beliefs here? There&#39;s nothing to suggest that the behavioral therapy is to teach Jason his inferiority. </p>

<p>They listened to psychiatrist who offed a way to absolve them of their sins. They claimed to have a quick fix for every emotional need. No more hugs just drugs. </p>

<p>Never mind the drugs they had at the time where little more then glorified sedatives. Never mind that psychiatry was was mistrusted in the past for so many reasons, too many to list quickly.</p>

<p>Society had be devastated by mob rule. Our most respected president in recent history was from a mob family. His name was Kennedy. It&#39;s common knowledge that his father made his money from bootlegging liqueur. </p>

<p>We have presidential blood lines today. If you know the history of America you know our founding fathers would be ashamed of that fact. Say what you want about them but they knew better then to allow any family to rule the white house from two consecutive generations.</p>

<p>There are no drugs for this disorder. The first-line treatment is actually training the parents to be more supportive and consistent, de-emphasizing overly-harsh punishments in favor of smaller, but predictable punishments for bad behavior, and predictable praise and support for good behavior. </p>

<p>That sounds horrible!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree with your whole evolution argument. I really don&#39;t like when people write things off or justify them because &quot;they&#39;re just human nature&quot; or they&#39;re &quot;ensured by evolution&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a cop-out from taking responsibility for our beliefs &amp; our actions. How you interpret your life experiences and the culture around you is up to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are not apes or lions. Are you really suggesting we are equal in consciousness and self-awareness to felines?</p>

<p>Now regarding evolutionary instincts; humans must be taught how to eat, how to speak, how to wash, and even how to <em>reproduce</em>. Yet you think we&#39;re pre-programmed to &quot;challenge the alpha male&quot;?</p>

<p>We don&#39;t come out of the womb and start puckering at our mother&#39;s titties. She teaches us that&#39;s where the food is.</p>

<p>Yes we are animals. But are you trying to suggest there are no differences between us and the rest of the species on this planet?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It actually has to be unjustified rebellion or unbridled contradictive behavior. For instance, not just questioning authority but always going against it even when it&#39;s against your own self-interest (to the point of it being a mental disorder). It&#39;s similar to a persecution complex, really. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>fair enough, I didn&#39;t really read that deeply into it. But Is anyone going to believe a 10 year old who thinks his rebellion is justified? You could argue that any rebellion is actually against ones own self interest, seeing as no child is actually successfully going to overthrow his teacher!</p>

<p>Members of &quot;La Resistance&quot; were acting very much against their own self-interest, they could have just stayed quiet, got on with their lives, and bowed to the German authority, instead many of them gave their lives to resist it. </p>
