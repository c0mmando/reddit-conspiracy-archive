    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m very curious about this as well, along with the stock market crashing too. There was a theory on here the other day about us possibly testing a kinetic energy weapon that caused the explosions, but I don&#39;t think there was any evidence. Another person, or maybe it was the same article, suggested we were trying to knock out their supercomputers to get back at all the hacking going on. These theories run wild and it&#39;s so far away that good sources are scarce. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is still <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_bombardment">no hard evidence</a>, but know that these <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US7669802">kinetic energy weapons seem to be very real</a> (patent filed in <em>2005</em>). Both the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/10/magazine/10section3a.t-9.html">New York Times</a> and <a href="http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2004-06/rods-god">Popular Science</a> put out articles musing about them around 10 years ago. <a href="http://www.academia.edu/8568057/K-BOMB_Analysis_of_G_LEO_Kinetic_Bombardment_and_Application_to_National_Security_Strategies_for_Full-Spectrum_Military_Interoperability">Here&#39;s an academic paper</a> from 2014 regarding kinetic bombardment. The project in the paper is named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polemos">Polemos</a>, who is the Greek mythological personification of <em>war</em>. I couldn&#39;t find much on the author, Rammah M. Elbasheer, and who he is associated with...search results returned the same paper and the <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a>, which seems benign enough. <em>shrugs</em></p>

<p>Also, take a look at <a href="https://youtu.be/SuiQLnZrXXE">this video</a>. I understand that it is made with a distinctly speculative focus (we have no proof, so speculation is the only option at this point). However, pay attention to what seems to be predictive programming coming from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Ghosts#Story">Call of Duty: Ghosts</a> regarding these kinetic energy weapons (<a href="http://callofduty.wikia.com/wiki/ODIN_Space_Station">ODIN Space Station</a>). Note that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin">Odin</a> is the Norse god &quot;associated with healing, death, royalty, the gallows, knowledge, battle, sorcery, poetry, frenzy, and the runic alphabet.&quot; Rods from God indeed.</p>

<p>Edit: Also, take note that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_bombardment#Real_life_concepts_and_theories">the Wikipedia article</a> makes mention of a Project <em>Thor</em> (in Norse mythology, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor">he is Odin&#39;s son</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Project Thor is an idea for a weapons system that launches kinetic projectiles from Earth&#39;s orbit to damage targets on the ground. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Pournelle">Jerry Pournelle</a> originated the concept <em>while working in operations research at</em> <strong>Boeing</strong> <em>in the 1950s before becoming a science-fiction writer</em>.</p>

<p>The system most often described is &quot;an orbiting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tungsten">tungsten</a> telephone pole with small fins and a computer in the back for guidance&quot;. The system described in the 2003 United States Air Force report was that of 20-foot-long (6.1 m), 1-foot-diameter (0.30 m) tungsten rods, that are satellite controlled, and have global strike capability, with impact speeds of Mach 10.</p>

<p>The time between deorbit and impact would only be a few minutes, and depending on the orbits and positions in the orbits, the system would have a world-wide range. There would be no need to deploy missiles, aircraft or other vehicles. Although the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Arms_Limitation_Talks#SALT_II">SALT II</a> (1979) prohibited the deployment of orbital weapons of mass destruction, it did not prohibit the deployment of conventional weapons. The system is not prohibited by either the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Space_Treaty">Outer Space Treaty</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Ballistic_Missile_Treaty">Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post, my friend. I learned a lot. I find the CoD tie in particularly interesting and since I&#39;ve quit playing most video games (except Mario Kart 64) I didn&#39;t even know about it. 
What&#39;s really the point of predictive programming? Is it to associate these highly realistic ideas with pure fiction like a video game so people automatically dismiss it? This would make sense with the recent conspiracy related TV shows. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say that you are very correct in assuming that if people have seen it in a video game/cartoon/sitcom/conspiracy movie or show/etc., they will more than likely dismiss the notion (whatever it may be) as ludicrous, laughable, and ultimately not worth their time. From <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_mediacontrol66.htm">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Predictive programming is a subtle form of psychological conditioning provided by the media to acquaint the public with planned societal changes to be implemented by TPTB.</p>

<p>If and when these changes are put through, the public will already be familiarized with them and will accept them as &#39;natural progressions&#39;, as Alan Watt (*) calls it; thus lessening any possible public resistance and commotion.</p>

<p>Predictive programming therefore may be considered as a veiled form of preemptive mass manipulation or mind control, courtesy of our puppet masters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want to get into the more esoteric meaning of <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Predictive_programming">predictive programming</a>, it&#39;s a known Satanist/Luciferian tactic to let the audience (the victims) know ahead of time what the plan for the future reality is, but to disguise the plan as something benign. This is usually done through symbolism, numerology, ritualistic behaviors/acts/events, etc...basically, they create more esoteric layers to keep the truth from their victims. Because it was presented as a joke, a gaffe, a fantasy (like in films and music), and sometimes even an impossibility, the victims will accept the plan for the future without knowing it. The perpetrators can then feel justified in their evil deeds, believing they received the proper &quot;consent&quot; from their victims and are now washed clean of guilt and may proceed. You can see this kind of behavior plainly with victims of sexual abuse, especially children, who were unwittingly beguiled into sexual acts with a predator (this is known as &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_grooming">child grooming</a>&quot;). It&#39;s all about normalizing the absurd and the abnormal, in general. Here is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X289sq1pLk">a video</a> on predictive programming involving the Boston Marathon bombing and Robin Williams&#39; death. Again, keep in mind that this is all speculative, but if it really is what it seems, it is truly a form of mind control. Admitting guilt to perpetrating acts like this would draw too much ire, and the people in power putting this mind control over the masses into the mainstream are certainly not going to outwardly admit their participation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that the incidents in China can be explained easily enough by old and failing equipment combined with poor safety practices. The fact that China is experiencing an economic downturn contributes to this idea, because safety seems like something that a lot Chinese companies would skimp out on when crunching numbers. We already know that explosives were being illegally stored at Tianjin , so it’s not hard to imagine that what little safety equipment that was on site was pretty old and beat up. </p>

<p>As for what happened in Japan, that&#39;s a bit more mysterious. Since the last explosions happened at a military base, they could have been related to the current North Korea crisis. It&#39;s almost reasonable to assume that with all the equipment be checked, double checked, and mobilized, that an accident could happen. However, it&#39;s also possible that this was a terrorist attack, and we haven&#39;t been told that because of various reasons.</p>

<p>I used to work outside a provincial capital in China where there were a lot of factories and chemical facilities. There was a huge explosion one night that shook my apartment. Coverups followed. </p>

<p>No enforced regulations and no common sense in factory stewardship make for these kinds of incidents in China, which happen pretty often. Tianjin was remarkably larger than average though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say that you are very correct in assuming that if people have seen it in a video game/cartoon/sitcom/conspiracy movie or show/etc., they will more than likely dismiss the notion (whatever it may be) as ludicrous, laughable, and ultimately not worth their time. From <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_mediacontrol66.htm">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Predictive programming is a subtle form of psychological conditioning provided by the media to acquaint the public with planned societal changes to be implemented by TPTB.</p>

<p>If and when these changes are put through, the public will already be familiarized with them and will accept them as &#39;natural progressions&#39;, as Alan Watt (*) calls it; thus lessening any possible public resistance and commotion.</p>

<p>Predictive programming therefore may be considered as a veiled form of preemptive mass manipulation or mind control, courtesy of our puppet masters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want to get into the more esoteric meaning of <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Predictive_programming">predictive programming</a>, it&#39;s a known Satanist/Luciferian tactic to let the audience (the victims) know ahead of time what the plan for the future reality is, but to disguise the plan as something benign. This is usually done through symbolism, numerology, ritualistic behaviors/acts/events, etc...basically, they create more esoteric layers to keep the truth from their victims. Because it was presented as a joke, a gaffe, a fantasy (like in films and music), and sometimes even an impossibility, the victims will accept the plan for the future without knowing it. The perpetrators can then feel justified in their evil deeds, believing they received the proper &quot;consent&quot; from their victims and are now washed clean of guilt and may proceed. You can see this kind of behavior plainly with victims of sexual abuse, especially children, who were unwittingly beguiled into sexual acts with a predator (this is known as &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_grooming">child grooming</a>&quot;). It&#39;s all about normalizing the absurd and the abnormal, in general. Here is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X289sq1pLk">a video</a> on predictive programming involving the Boston Marathon bombing and Robin Williams&#39; death. Again, keep in mind that this is all speculative, but if it really is what it seems, it is truly a form of mind control. Admitting guilt to perpetrating acts like this would draw too much ire, and the people in power putting this mind control over the masses into the mainstream are certainly not going to outwardly admit their participation.</p>
