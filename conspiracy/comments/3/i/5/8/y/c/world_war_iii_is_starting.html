    <div class="md"><p>FWIW, a lot of people say WW3 started on 9/11. I&#39;m inclined to agree -- we don&#39;t see most of it on western media, but half the Middle East has been fucking squashed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;ve been wondering how many countries have to be involved/simultaneously at war before it counts as a world war and not a regional war or just plain war. Is it only a World War if Western Europe is being attacked? If US civilians feel threatened? If a nuclear bomb gets dropped? Mass casualties and atrocities? What&#39;s the definition?</p>

<p>We have a perception that World War III is everyone dropping nuclear bombs on each other and everyone dies. That&#39;s the version of World War III everyone&#39;s afraid of and wants to make sure doesn&#39;t happen. So unless that&#39;s what&#39;s happening, people don&#39;t want to call it World War III. Or worry about it. &quot;Well, the US invading the Middle East is ok because it&#39;s not a <em>World</em> War.&quot;</p>

<p>Maybe we should be more concerned about &quot;The War We Won&#39;t Call World War III&quot;? Give it a different name rather than trying to get people to redefine their perceptions of what a &quot;World War III&quot; is?</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of cyber war/fighting going on concurrently with all the physical wars, anyway. And that&#39;s certainly not part of the popular culture concept of what a World War III is.</p>

<p>There is no German/American empire, and further, both states were against each other in WWII. Yes, some Americans helped/funded Nazis: That doesn&#39;t mean <em>America did</em>. </p>

<p>The three-page, closely typed report, marked &#39;Secret&#39;, copied to British officials and sent by air pouch to Cordell Hull, the US Secretary of State, detailed how the industrialists were to work with the Nazi Party to rebuild Germany&#39;s economy by sending money through Switzerland.
They would set up a network of secret front companies abroad. They would wait until conditions were right. And then they would take over Germany again.
The industrialists included representatives of Volkswagen, Krupp and Messerschmitt. Officials from the Navy and Ministry of Armaments were also at the meeting and, with incredible foresight, they decided together that the Fourth German Reich, unlike its predecessor, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1179902/Revealed-The-secret-report-shows-Nazis-planned-Fourth-Reich--EU.html">would be an economic rather than a military empire - but not just German.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Business Plot was planned too. Plans were put forth. Money changed hands. Documents drawn up. </p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t mean that it actually happened. There was no militant coup by American vets to usurp the US Government.</p>

<p>Just because people wrote down ideas doesn&#39;t mean it happened. Nazis planned on moon bases too. Are you about to tell me that succeeded to?</p>

<p>Further, your article discounts one of your main points: A German/<em>American</em> empire, not one that exists in the EU, not one that exists as was planned <em>by Nazis alone</em>, as this article purports. </p>

<p>Further, if the Third Reich moved on to the Fourth, it&#39;d stand to reason they&#39;d want protection no? Explain Nuremberg then. Why&#39;d we go hang a bunch of the Third Reich if they never lost the war?</p>

<p>Further, the use of the word &#39;Reich&#39; is <em>distinctly German</em>. It is a nationalistic word referencing the Ottoman and the Holy Roman Empires (the Second and First Reichs, respectively). Stating a Fourth Reich an &quot;American/German Empire&quot; is at least that much insulting to Germany: The &quot;Third Reich&quot; called itself a Reich to start with because it contributed to Nationalistic fervor, by associating past empires to the current one. Common trick, sure, but it also discounts heavily the notion that Americans would consider any empire of theirs a &#39;Fourth Reich&#39;. </p>

<p>If anything, they&#39;d call it the Columbian Empire - if only there wasn&#39;t a Columbia already. Cincinnatia wouldn&#39;t be a bad name either, given American roots. Or we could get real esoteric and call it the New Atlantis. But no, not the Fourth Reich. Makes no sense.</p>

<p><em>And finally</em>: An economic empire <em>is not a military empire</em>. Period. You could just as well liken Jay-Z and Beyonce to Hitler and Goering if it were so. </p>

<p>You sound like one of the many &#39;but but, 1%!!!&quot; protesters. You don&#39;t have much to say other than &#39;money bad! money nazi!&#39;.  </p>

<p>The people behind those plans are all dead. They are absolutely <em>not</em> still in charge. I invite you to find one person still living mentioned by <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1179902/Revealed-The-secret-report-shows-Nazis-planned-Fourth-Reich--EU.html">the article you posted.</a> </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s where we don&#39;t disagree: I know that American industrialists backed the Nazis. I know that American bankers did too. That doesn&#39;t mean the American people or American government was in on it. In fact, American Nazi assets <em>were seized</em> during WWII. Again: Look at the Business Plot. Wouldn&#39;t that have been successful if these people were as all-powerful as you&#39;re purporting?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Explain Operation Paperclip then</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simple: Those scientists were going to be scooped up by <em>someone</em>. Would you rather the US have let Russia have them? In war and real geopolitics, sometimes the right decision isn&#39;t the most desirable thing. And we used WMDs on Japan to solidify America as, and I&#39;m paraphrasing, &quot;nuttin&#39; to fuck wit&#39;&quot;. Seems to me it worked.</p>

<p>Did I ever say there was no American Military Empire? There is. This is not equivalent of an &quot;American/German Empire spawned by the Nazis&quot;. </p>

<p>Prescott Bush was a Nazi supporter. No question. That&#39;s the last time a Bush was linked to the Nazis. Three generations ago. My Italian grandmother worked in an Austrian machine shop, repairing fabrics for the Nazis. She was not a Nazi (hated them, and Mussolini). But she was forced to work for them. She immigrated to the US in 1958. Am I too, a Nazi, because my ancestors made some money off them?</p>

<p>Also, if S&amp;B was oh-so-powerful... why aren&#39;t more Presidents from there? They&#39;ve got three; Taft, Bush HW and Bush W. If any secret group was to be pointed at I&#39;d think we ought to look at Freemasons (they have 14 ex-presidents). After all, the first S&amp;P/US President was WH Taft, who was <em>also</em> a  Freemason. Note this is not my saying &#39;It&#39;s the Freemasons, not S&amp;B&#39;, but rather that your logic ought to point elsewhere.</p>

<p>Edit: Also, goalposts. GWB and John Kerry weren&#39;t in power during WWII. You claimed, quote:</p>

<p>&quot;Although the people behind these plans and coups are still in charge&quot;</p>

<p>Which is provably false.</p>

<p>Sure, but that&#39;s not what I mean. Don&#39;t tell me what I mean, I will let you know what I mean, thanks. I have never suggested that the Bushes agreed ideologically with the Nazis, only that they were funding them in order to advance their business interests.</p>

<p>All of the Bushes have been linked to Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co. which was the specific company linked to funding the Nazis.</p>

<p>What would you think if Hitler&#39;s grandson became the chancellor of Germany? Do you really think that the Bush family have pursued an independent foreign policy and that there is no relationship between father and son? Or that they gave up power?</p>

<p>The CIA, which has been implicated in despicable war crimes since WW2 ended was built out of ex-Nazi intelligence agents who had their pasts whitewashed, and is now headquartered in the George Bush center for intelligence.</p>

<p>Why are you defending families of war criminals? Why do you keep insisting that I am saying Bush was a Nazi instead of that their family financed Nazis and other extremists with the goal of fomenting war?</p>

<p>BTW America is literally arming and training Nazis in Ukraine as we speak.</p>

<p>Because we don&#39;t choose our families; just being related to a war criminal <em>does not</em> make you a war criminal. </p>

<p>Besides that point, W. Bush is a war criminal in his own right; he doesn&#39;t need the Nazi association to make that case at all. </p>

<p>Regarding the CIA, while I understand and admit they&#39;ve A) been around the coup-starting block and B) they have had ex-Nazis in their ranks in the past, you&#39;re making the mistake that many Conspiracy theorists make: Seeing them in every revolution since WWII, and seeing Nazis still in the CIA despite no evidence to that effect. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do you keep insisting that I am saying Bush was a Nazi </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the links you offered as your arguments asserted that very fact. This is why I told you to use your own words: You didn&#39;t notice that in your own references. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>BTW America is literally arming and training Nazis in Ukraine as we speak.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hearsay. Every civil war in the world since WWII has had one side or the other claim the CIA was involved and America was involved and <em>thats</em> why they&#39;re losing. Just because everyone claims it doesn&#39;t make it so every time. </p>

<p>Show me evidence of these assertions: A) There are Nazis in Ukraine right now (swastikas, genetic-superiority-beliefs and all - I&#39;m not just talking about fascism: you said <em>Nazis</em>) and B) that the US is arming them with the knowledge that they are said-Nazis. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>German ZDF television observed Azov battalion fighters wearing helmets with swastikas and &quot;the &#39;SS runes&#39; of Hitler&#39;s infamous black-uniformed elite corps&quot;, and on other occasions some of the soldiers have been reported to have SS tattoos.[14][15][16] Spokesmen and other members of the Azov Battalion and government officials have denied that the organization has any neo-Nazi or white supremacist beliefs; although a spokesman did state that &quot;10% to 20% of the group&#39;s members are Nazis&quot;.[10][17][nb 2][nb 3] The regiment&#39;s commander and founder is Andriy Biletsky who in the past made statements about &quot;crusade&quot; of &quot;White races&quot; against &quot;Semitic Untermenschen&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The U.S. Congress has banned providing support to this group, but I don&#39;t see how we are auditing funds provided to Ukraine to ensure that none are spent on this one battalion of their army. Additionally the CIA doesn&#39;t give a shit about congress.</p>

<p>I am not sure why you are focusing on Nazis. The CIA (Bush family and friends) have been funding all kinds of violent extremists for decades.</p>

<p>My point is that the U.S. military industrial complex creates wars overseas to earn profits for American companies. The same few families have been doing it for decades.</p>

<p>So your claims that the &quot;US is arming Nazis in the Ukraine&quot; are unfounded, by your very own words. You&#39;re aware that the US is aware of them, and has said not to help them, but you don&#39;t care because you&#39;ve got your bogeyman the CIA to blame. Again, with no evidence.</p>

<p>I&#39;m focusing on Nazis because you sir, asserted that there was an &quot;American/German Empire&quot; or &quot;The Fourth Reich&quot; (based again, on the link you provided when you couldn&#39;t be bothered to speak your mind with your own words). You&#39;ve been focusing on calling a bunch of people Nazis. I&#39;m just dismantling your arguments and asking for evidence. Seems you&#39;re backing off the Nazi angle because it&#39;s become apparent that it&#39;s not as widely-spread as you previously asserted.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t actually have a lot to disagree on. I&#39;m simply trying to promote a certain accuracy in words and argument. Godwin&#39;s Law and all that: Nazi comparisons are rife and mostly unnecessary and uncalled for. </p>

<p>There&#39;s another point to that too: Nazi comparisons only serve to keep the &quot;Nazi&quot; image as the end-all-be-all of &quot;evil empires&quot;. They aren&#39;t. The Nazis were puppets of the bankers. The bankers were the evil behind the throne of the Nazis. That isn&#39;t to say that the Bankers <em>are</em> Nazis though or that all bankers are evil.

    <div class="md"><p>I can elaborate a bit more: Those bankers can, have and will use any means of government to achieve their ends. Fascist, socialist, communist - it doesn&#39;t matter. These are petty, cheap words. The bankers installed Mao, for christ&#39;s sake, they initiated the Bolshevik revolution. They also did the same for Hitler and Mussolini and the rest of the fascists. And surely they&#39;re all over capitalists. </p>

<p>They&#39;re not -ists of any kind. They&#39;re oligarchs. &quot;Masters&quot;. They don&#39;t answer to a government, therefor the style of government they&#39;re associated with at any given moment is irrelevant.</p>

<p>All this to say that simply looking at &#39;fascism&#39;, or &#39;communism&#39;, or &#39;capitalism&#39; as &#39;that thing which we should be steadfast against&#39; is wrong headed. That&#39;s buying into the banker&#39;s goals: You&#39;re simply dividing yourself to let them conquer. </p>

<p>Like I said, we basically agree here. And I admit to being a bit of a pedant above. But it&#39;s not just for the sake of pedantry; I feel these are important distinctions and considerations when analyzing all this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the most part, at least from the West&#39;s view, both world wars were continent spanning wars that utilized the entire resources of almost, if not every, then equivalent to the first world nations.</p>

<p>Essentially it wasn&#39;t a world war just because of where it was fought (mostly Europe, Asia became big in WW2, parts of Africa next to Europe).  It&#39;s because each consumed near the world&#39;s resources.  A good chunk of a generation was thrown into a meat grinder.</p>

<p>If you go by a geographic definition there has been a near constant shifting world war since at least the American-Indian Wars.  If viewed in terms of resources, were aren&#39;t there yet.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s a lot of cyber war/fighting going on concurrently with all the physical wars, anyway</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This hits the nail right on the head. Wars, and the ways they are fought, continually evolve. Nukes are part of war. So are bombers and tanks and machine guns. </p>

<p>But there&#39;s a lot of other ways for one nation (or a group of nations) to go against someone else in a hostile way. Disinformation campaigns and diplomatic measures. There&#39;s also economic warfare that can come in a number of forms such as economic sanctions or currency manipulation. As you mentioned, cyberwarfare is yet another way to attack someone without firing a single shot.</p>

<p>And now I shall get a fair bit more speculative. Think about those two huge chemical plant explosions in China. One could have been an accident. But two arouses my suspicions. For those who care to hear my theory about what might have happened, here it is.</p>

<p>No aircraft were used. It wasn&#39;t a micro-nuke either. If you&#39;ve seen any pictures of the &quot;accident site&quot; you&#39;ll notice that a large area was subjected to incredibly intense heat for a sustained period of time. I say this because there were cars with burned paint and melted engine blocks. It looked like thousands of cars that appeared to have been uniformly heated to a very high temperature. But there was also a noticeable absence of the kind of damage you&#39;d expect from a shockwave.</p>

<p>So maybe there was just a lot of heat from the fire. Or maybe those cars were subjected to another heat source. Maybe it was that same external heat source that caused the chemicals to overheat and explode... at <em>both</em> locations.</p>

<p>Maybe someone has some kind of space-based  weapon that can focus a huge amount of heat at surface targets. Maybe someone is letting the Chinese know not to keep on pushing with territorial claims, alternative currencies, cyberattacks and industrial espionage.</p>

<p>If this is the case, it&#39;s the perfect weapon. No visual or radar trace, no chemical signature or radioactivity... and no warning. Used once, and then again shortly afterwards to let the other side know it&#39;s neither an accident nor a gimmick. Kind of like what happened to Japan 70 years ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is 2% of the estimated deaths caused by WWII <em>on the very lowest end</em>. At the highest WWII estimates, it&#39;d be 1.25%. We&#39;re talking about 50-million to 80-million dead. </p>

<p>Again, 3% of the world population at that time (~2.3 billion) was killed in WWII. </p>

<p>Translate that to today&#39;s numbers. We have approx. 7 billion people on this planet now. If 3% died, that&#39;d be 210 million dead. </p>

<p>A world war won&#39;t be caused by a couple pawns moving on the board. North Korea, ISIS, Syria, Iraq - these are pawns. </p>

<p>World Wars are fought by players. Russia, US, China. These are the three military powers that need to be fighting. You might note that these are the three powers who want to fight the <em>least</em> right now. North Korea is just sabre-rattling, as usual, and if they step out of line China is going to install their own Kim Jong Nam as a puppet dictator, keeping their buffer zone between SK/US forces and China. </p>

<p>That&#39;s where the real money is. Re-building Europe after WWII created an economic boom for a long time and some got extremely rich on it. Then came the end of the cold-war and we got to re-build eastern Europe. Now that&#39;s about done and it&#39;s time to destroy so we can build again. There&#39;s more economic interests in destruction than peace.</p>

<p>The only good thing to come out of a war is the complete purge of SJWs and other idiots. They&#39;ll wake up to the cold reality of things.</p>

<p>That&#39;s one possible option. Another possible option is that &#39;BankerCoin&#39; (e.g. CitiCoin) becomes the default. They spend millions advertising and promoting it. Everyone who has a Citi account automatically gets crypto currency. It&#39;s promoted by Governments and Central Banks around the world. It becomes super popular and everyone starts using it. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bitcoin drops to a few cents and fades into obscurity. It&#39;s a nice footnote in financial history but, not relevant in a world run by central banks.</p>

<p>The strategies of war have simply changed. They want to keep the consumers uninformed so that they carry on with their lives. Drafts are no longer needed because insurgence groups can be created in third world countries, and private security forces/mercenaries can also be created too.</p>

<p>Not to mention cyber warfare. All the hacks during the last decade, the leaks... really seem like they&#39;re part of the war too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not on board with the proxy part, but it is interesting to note that that particular situation was what demanded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Marcinko#SEAL_Team_Six">Richard Marcinko</a> develop SEAL Team 6 and us having a 24/7/365 response group for terrorism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During the Iran hostage crisis in 1979, Marcinko was one of two Navy representatives for a Joint Chiefs of Staff task force known as the TAT (Terrorist Action Team). The purpose of the TAT was to develop a plan to free the American hostages held in Iran which culminated in Operation Eagle Claw. In the wake of the debacle, the Navy saw the need for a full-time dedicated counter-terrorist team and tasked Marcinko with its design and development.</p>

<p>Marcinko was the first commanding officer of this new unit. At the time, the Navy had only two SEAL teams. Marcinko purportedly named the unit SEAL Team Six in order to confuse other nations, specifically the Soviet Union, into believing that the United States had three other SEAL teams that they were unaware of. He personally selected the unit&#39;s members from across the U.S. Navy&#39;s special operations community, including a special counter-terrorist tactics section of SEAL Team Two, codenamed MOB-6. SEAL Team Six would be the Navy&#39;s premier counter-terrorist unit, like its Army counterpart Delta Force. While typically a two-year command in the Navy at the time, Marcinko commanded SEAL Team Six for three years, from August 1980 to July 1983.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they were to support North Korea, they wouldn&#39;t necessarily have to fight - one option would be to cut off all shipments of goods to the US. So much of our stuff gets manufactured there. Not sure how much is useless trinkets and how much is stuff we actually need, but shoes at least would be one thing we&#39;d be missing out on. What do we sell to China besides debt? They don&#39;t sell us things because they need to, they do it to make us at least somewhat dependent on them. </p>

<p>Besides that, China could tell the US to not get involved and let North and South Korea fight amongst themselves. Everyone assumes that North Korea won&#39;t attack South Korea because the US would wipe North Korea off the map. But what about if the US <em>doesn&#39;t</em> get involved? </p>

<p>North Korea is China&#39;s &quot;pet&quot;, so they might not take kindly to the US invading. Does the US want a war with China? Will they risk it if China tells the US to back off? I&#39;m thinking the troops at North Korea&#39;s border might be to defend North Korea rather than as defense against North Korea. If the US stays out, then they won&#39;t cross that line.</p>

China can and will try to pressure the US in the case of a Korean war, but considering their current economic situation, they&#39;re not going to risk an economic collapse just to maintain a buffer zone, that nowadays, almost causes more problems than it prevents.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>We don&#39;t sell stuff to China. We buy stuff</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, that&#39;s what I was saying. </p>

<p>The only thing China &quot;buys&quot; from us is I.O.U.s (debt). I&#39;m saying means of production is far more valuable than paper; China could cut us off if they wanted to. They already build &quot;ghost cities&quot;, it&#39;s not like they can&#39;t find something else for their factory workers to do, or create a stockpile of goods for themselves or for future use in trade with others.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an option. The more meaningful options you have available, the better you can tailor your response to the particular situation. If they wanted to support North Korea, they could.</p>

<p>They also have the option of ignoring North Korea and letting the US do whatever. So, North Korea couldn&#39;t just do whatever and count on China&#39;s support regardless.</p>

<p>I wonder if North Korea or China got ahold of some classified documents which pointed to a threat that might be worth going to war for?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Financial - shares are dropping because China has produced very poor manufacturing figures (it&#39;s the world&#39;s second largest economy). It&#39;s stock market has been over-inflated for awhile now, but financially it&#39;s not good.</p>

<p>N Korea - Kim Jong Un ramps up regional tensions in order to receive concessions (NK is suffering another potential famine at the moment). Obviously it always have to be taken seriously - but it&#39;s how they do &quot;business&quot; with the world, and is quite common</p>

    <div class="md"><p>pardon me for being ignorant on this, i&#39;m not an economic major by any means, but if China is producing poor manufacturing figures, and we buy most of our stuff from China, does that mean growth, or should I say, spending power, as a global figure is down? To me, this would say that it&#39;s not just China feeling it, but rather everyone with any sort of income just can&#39;t stretch the $ as far as we used to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The actual manufacturing of goods (a slowing of growth) doesn&#39;t affect us so much</p>

<p>It&#39;s the fact that it&#39;s affecting confidence in the Chinese stock market, which is suffering some very big drops - and that is spreading to other markets</p>

<p>That directly affects pensions - and in the long run affects us economically</p>

<p>China is catching up to the rest of the developed countries, and as such will go through a painful readjustment phase - looks like that phase is happening now</p>

<p>china will NOT make any real aggressive moves against the US because we buy too much from them.  it would be like owning your own store and telling the guy that is responsible for 30% of your income to go shop somewhere else.  at a time when their economy lost the GDP of france, they just cannot afford it.  of course, none of this will stop them from really giving the US the shakedown in cyberspace, as they are constantly doing, even as you are reading this.</p>

<p>Russia is just waiting for another global power to take on the US because they are tired of being the big country that is always getting pushed around.  they cant do it on their own, so they need someone with a better economy and more respect on geopolitical level to start it, then they will jump right in.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>China doesnt back up NK; China secures its border to NK, most likely against refugees (if a war starts). China has nothing to gain in joining NK in that war. The only thing they have in common is communism and shared border. It is unlikely that China would intervene unless the U.S. would attack first. That might be a reason for China to pull their army into NK territory but is very unlikely to happen.</p>

<p>Best thing that could happen (in my opinion) is that China invades and liberates NK&#39;s ppl and/or installs Kim Jong Nam as the new leader.</p>

<p>But if that happens you can expect WW3 next. Not because of NK/SK but because it&#39;s the first big theatre move.</p>

<p>Then there was the Houston chemical plant explosion. </p>

<p>Then Shandong. </p>

<p>Now the US army base in Japan. </p>

<p>This tit-for-tat is getting out of hand... </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Some people are saying this started when China devalued the Yuan, and the US was angry by this move, so they did a covert ops on Tianjin just to &quot;teach them a lesson&quot;. Also, the timing of the DPRK vs South Korea is also more than coincidence. Something or someone is orchestrating a conflict between these two giants (the US vs China). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is just my two cents, but I believe we are gearing up for a war within the next ten years. Russia and China are both expending their borders, and I believe all of these cyber attacks are attempts by both countries trying to prod our defenses for our cyber security. ISIS is flaming up paranoia in both America and Europe. Also, many of the U.S. population is stock piling weapons and ammunition due to all of these recent mass shootings we&#39;ve had, and lord only knows what Iran is actually using their nucelar research for, also their military leaders have been meeting with Russia pretty often lately which I think is a little odd. Dont think a war is going on right now, but I could see one coming in the next decade, and it&#39;ll be very bad when it does. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes!   yes i am!!  especially the older model subs!  this is a stupid plan.  the only ones they wont be able to detect are the ones that sink on the way because sailing subs around the world is waaay  harder than it sounds.  i know the kim family is all magical and powered by rainbows and fake unicorns and all, but this is beyond their meager sphere of control.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Why are you defending families of war criminals</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because we don&#39;t choose our families; just being related to a war criminal <em>does not</em> make you a war criminal. </p>

<p>Besides that point, W. Bush is a war criminal in his own right; he doesn&#39;t need the Nazi association to make that case at all. </p>

<p>Regarding the CIA, while I understand and admit they&#39;ve A) been around the coup-starting block and B) they have had ex-Nazis in their ranks in the past, you&#39;re making the mistake that many Conspiracy theorists make: Seeing them in every revolution since WWII, and seeing Nazis still in the CIA despite no evidence to that effect. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do you keep insisting that I am saying Bush was a Nazi </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the links you offered as your arguments asserted that very fact. This is why I told you to use your own words: You didn&#39;t notice that in your own references. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>BTW America is literally arming and training Nazis in Ukraine as we speak.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hearsay. Every civil war in the world since WWII has had one side or the other claim the CIA was involved and America was involved and <em>thats</em> why they&#39;re losing. Just because everyone claims it doesn&#39;t make it so every time. </p>

<p>Show me evidence of these assertions: A) There are Nazis in Ukraine right now (swastikas, genetic-superiority-beliefs and all - I&#39;m not just talking about fascism: you said <em>Nazis</em>) and B) that the US is arming them with the knowledge that they are said-Nazis. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, why not? I&#39;m totally okay with admitting the CIA has funded and supported awful, awful regimes in the past and likely will into the future. I&#39;m a big fan of JFK&#39;s idea that it should be shattered into a thousand pieces and cast to the winds. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t actually have a lot to disagree on. I&#39;m simply trying to promote a certain accuracy in words and argument. Godwin&#39;s Law and all that: Nazi comparisons are rife and mostly unnecessary and uncalled for. </p>

<p>There&#39;s another point to that too: Nazi comparisons only serve to keep the &quot;Nazi&quot; image as the end-all-be-all of &quot;evil empires&quot;. They aren&#39;t. The Nazis were puppets of the bankers. The bankers were the evil behind the throne of the Nazis. That isn&#39;t to say that the Bankers <em>are</em> Nazis though or that all bankers are evil. I am talking about a certain group of central banks which operate internationally, not the manager of the bank down the street. </p>

<p>Would you disagree?</p>
