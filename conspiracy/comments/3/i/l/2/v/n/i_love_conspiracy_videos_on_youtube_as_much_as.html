       Conspiracy theories isn't some movement with an agenda. We don't all agree on what conspiracy theories are true or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people who judge all conspiracy theories based off of one or a few due to credibility aren't the people you want to waste your time convincing anyways.

       There are three certainties in life: Death, taxes, and a bunch of people on this sub claiming every new event is a hoax of some sort.

       It's obviously fake, please examine the evidence before making posts like this.  The reporter obviously runs away unhurt, blanks are fired, and the man who lifts the gun up is obviously white (you can see him lift the gun) and the alleged suspect is a black man.

       One thing we noticed in the war in Iraq was that when soldiers got shot the fight or flight reflex takes over and the body doesn't register it was shot until they have calmed down. She might have been in an adrenaline rush and her flight reflex took over.

       I think you're talking out your arse. Lets wait for some facts to come out before you make a judgement on it. For starters, adrenaline and the fight-or-flight reaction counts for a lot. You don't know where she was hit, how many times, how far she made it etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's downright obnoxious to jump to such a conclusion based on what has been seen. This is the shit OP is talking about.

       Edit: the shooter was maybe part African but he certainly wasn't 'black'. There's a photo of him in this article

       I've never seen a shooting up close was blood suppose to splatter the camera like a video game? The camera was on her for 2 seconds, then there were like 5 more gun shots not captured.
      </p>
      <p>
       She was also a 24 year old reporter who was making a name for herself and had a long career ahead of her, where the hell would she go for the rest of her life?

       Me too man. I have no fucking idea what is going on. But when you see real footage of people being shot, and you see this, something is up. Idk what the fuck is going on. Could it be real? Yes. Could it be fake? Yes. But then where did these people go, that's the question. Protective custody rings a bell. If you were aproached with a few hundred million would you leave your family (especially if you cut ties)? Some people may.

       most LEO use a .40 or .45 with hollow points.. the glock used looks like a 9mm and most likely regular ammunition, which would travel right through you. there's a lot more to ballistics out there depending on the caliber and ammunition used.

       interesting video. however i don't see a stationary target with a gunman 4 ft away who has about 10 seconds of aiming who then fires off at least 2 shots before the intended target realizes what is going on.

       is it the same caliber and gun ?  (honest question, it looks like a pistol) did he actually get hit in the torso ?  did he take two successive rounds ?  i'm sticking with this point till someone explains to me that hitting a pretty large, stationary target from 4 feet, with time to aim is actually harder than intuition would seem, or that this gun is known to have its bullets travel in nonlinear paths

       You can also see a pretty stark contrast between the palm of his hand and the back of his hand.  Which is very common in darker skinned people.

       actually I'm sure there were many that weren't fake. It's hard to say, but looking at the evidence in each situation is more important than guesiing. Why's that such a big deal? Just look, does it look real? Are people really upset or smiling on set? etc...so many of them have strange story lines they're really hard to believe. And of course there is an anti-gun agenda, and there are many trying to disarm americans. So it wouldn't surprise me either if a great deal of these are fake, as was 911, the golf of Tonkin and many others...

       Then my follow-up question is how did you determine the ones that weren't fake from this one? What evidence did they have that this one doesn't? It's a fucking open and shut case, what more do you want?

       you look at the evidence...? Got a better idea? You look and look and look, and if it means a lot to you look more, do a video, think it though, ask others. But WHATEVER YOU DO, don't believe the government, don't believe official sources.

       No sorry I'm going to side step your questions and a basic waste of time. Not that it's a dumb question because it isn't, but I don't have time to get into a long drawn out debate. However, I will concede I have no problems seeing all sides of the debate. However, the government are a bunch of mass killing lunatics who lie and murder all the time, so not much faith there...and the country is filled with guns and many use them for violence (the worst violence is always from the government though) I will state that violent people are the problem. Not guns. I know many gun owners and not one of them has ever hurt a fly. Thank you for engaging me however, I'm not trying to be an ass for backing down just pretty sure we'll both waste our time. So I bow out...

       When people make fun of this sub, it will prompt others to check this place out to see for themselves what this sub is like, if they find a front page of factual, reasonable posts then that person's mind about this sub will be good.

      <p>
       If this sub consistently sticks to quality content and not ridiculous stereotypes and shitposts, then that'll bring in more quality users.

       interesting video. however i don't see a stationary target with a gunman 4 ft away who has about 10 seconds of aiming who then fires off at least 2 shots before the intended target realizes what is going on.
