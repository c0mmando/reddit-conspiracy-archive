<p>It&#39;s obviously fake, please examine the evidence before making posts like this.  The reporter obviously runs away unhurt, blanks are fired, and the man who lifts the gun up is obviously white (you can see him lift the gun) and the alleged suspect is a black man.</p>

<p>Me too man. I have no fucking idea what is going on. But when you see real footage of people being shot, and you see this, something is up. Idk what the fuck is going on. Could it be real? Yes. Could it be fake? Yes. But then where did these people go, that&#39;s the question. Protective custody rings a bell. If you were aproached with a few hundred million would you leave your family (especially if you cut ties)? Some people may.</p>

If you&#39;d like to make a post on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> that addresses me or my post history or opinions, feel free.  I don&#39;t know why you&#39;ve got a hardon for me, but I find it suspicious.</p>

<p>You can also see a pretty stark contrast between the palm of his hand and the back of his hand.  Which is very common in darker skinned people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>actually I&#39;m sure there were many that weren&#39;t fake. It&#39;s hard to say, but looking at the evidence in each situation is more important than guesiing. Why&#39;s that such a big deal? Just look, does it look real? Are people really upset or smiling on set? etc...so many of them have strange story lines they&#39;re really hard to believe. And of course there is an anti-gun agenda, and there are many trying to disarm americans. So it wouldn&#39;t surprise me either if a great deal of these are fake, as was 911, the golf of Tonkin and many others...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then my follow-up question is how did you determine the ones that weren&#39;t fake from this one? What evidence did they have that this one doesn&#39;t? It&#39;s a fucking open and shut case, what more do you want?</p>

<p>you look at the evidence...? Got a better idea? You look and look and look, and if it means a lot to you look more, do a video, think it though, ask others. But WHATEVER YOU DO, don&#39;t believe the government, don&#39;t believe official sources. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, so what evidence is missing from this case that you want? And what made you believe those other shootings happened but made you doubt this one?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No sorry I&#39;m going to side step your questions and a basic waste of time. Not that it&#39;s a dumb question because it isn&#39;t, but I don&#39;t have time to get into a long drawn out debate. However, I will concede I have no problems seeing all sides of the debate. However, the government are a bunch of mass killing lunatics who lie and murder all the time, so not much faith there...and the country is filled with guns and many use them for violence (the worst violence is always from the government though) I will state that violent people are the problem. Not guns. I know many gun owners and not one of them has ever hurt a fly. Thank you for engaging me however, I&#39;m not trying to be an ass for backing down just pretty sure we&#39;ll both waste our time. So I bow out...</p>
