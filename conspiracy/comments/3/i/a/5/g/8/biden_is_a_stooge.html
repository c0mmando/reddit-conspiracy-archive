        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Biden is a stooge. He has no intention of winning. He&#39;s there to allow Hillary to portray herself as running &quot;against&quot; the Obama administration. The Democrats are organized, and Biden and Hillary are two of the top people in that organization. They know what they&#39;re doing. They know how the media will characterize things. They know Obama isn&#39;t popular, and they want Hillary to be able to distance herself from him. They&#39;ve been leaking little stories about Biden possibly running, to gauge the reaction from the public. That&#39;s a general rule. If a story isn&#39;t actually about an actual event that happened, then its not journalism but rather a test of the people who see it. If you don&#39;t understand this by now, God help you. Biden will run and lose on purpose to make Hillary look better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or Trump could just be an egocentric moron with no agenda other than his delusional belief that he could be electable. I think people are giving him far too much credit. </p>

<p>I&#39;m an independent that leans a bit toward the D side, though I did vote for Ron Paul in the last primary. I don&#39;t think I could bring myself to vote for any of the candidates on the R side currently. Rand certainly isn&#39;t his dad, though many seem to wish he was. </p>

<p>That being said, there&#39;s also no way in hell I&#39;d vote for Clinton. If it came down to Clinton vs whoever in the general election, I&#39;d probably find a third party candidate worth backing. </p>

<p>In the primary, I&#39;m leaning toward Sanders at the moment, but I&#39;m curious to hear what Biden has to say, how he&#39;d differentiate himself from Obama. I really wish Warren was running though, I&#39;d vote for her in a heartbeat. </p>

<p>But no way would I vote for Clinton. And I know many other D-leaning people who feel the same way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clinton&#39;s a crook. Powerful, but maybe too provably crooked to be an inevitability now.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a registered R, so I have no idea who I&#39;d choose in the primary. I&#39;d probably vote for Sanders in the D primary, though.</p>

<p>On the Ron Paul tip, I am <em>extremely</em> disappointed in him. Been a supporter for years and years (and in the primary last go-round, ultimately voted Gary Johnson). Was visiting the folks for whom Fox News is background noise, always running. Dr. Ron comes on, I perk up, excited...and it&#39;s a commercial...for a financial snake oil company that shills newsletters. A real Ovaltine moment for me, I am so bummed about this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is there anyone you&#39;d recommend I check out on the R side? I&#39;m pretty much only familiar with the &quot;big&quot; names at this point, and haven&#39;t done a whole lot of digging into some of the other folks who are running.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a registered Independent, so I can vote in the R or D primary if I wish. I&#39;m not 100% committed to Sanders (I disagree with him on some stuff, agree on others, and like the fact that he doesn&#39;t seem to be a mindless parrot), so maybe there&#39;s an R out there that I&#39;d like?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dunno. I watched the debates and while I liked a few of their answers, none of them speak to me and it feels like they&#39;re focusing on all the wrong issues. Cruz is a huge no for me due to his associations with folks like Alan Dershowitz. He&#39;s very inauthentic--always railing against elites...while he is one.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;ve gotten the same vibe from Cruz as from Christie, Huckabee, and Walker -- too many ties, personal and financial, to sketchy people.  Paul... I want to like him, but he&#39;s not his dad. Though his dad isn&#39;t his dad anymore either I guess. Don&#39;t know much about the other 3 you mentioned so maybe I&#39;ll see what they&#39;re about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it has a lot to do with the Democratic party trying to shift the media&#39;s focus from Hillary&#39;s email ordeal to something that is, as you stated, essentially irrelevant. </p>

<p>On the other hand, Biden could be a backup plan to a Clinton nomination. The Democratic party sees Hillary as a volatile candidate with a lot of skeletons in her closet that could wreck her campaign. And they don&#39;t want Bernie Sanders to be the only other viable candidate should this happen for obvious reasons (he isn&#39;t subservient to their big donors, for starters). </p>

<p>Either way, this is a ploy the party has been holding in their back pocket for the right time, which they obviously think is now. </p>
