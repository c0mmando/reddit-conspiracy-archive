       Biden is a stooge. He has no intention of winning. He's there to allow Hillary to portray herself as running "against" the Obama administration. The Democrats are organized, and Biden and Hillary are two of the top people in that organization. They know what they're doing. They know how the media will characterize things. They know Obama isn't popular, and they want Hillary to be able to distance herself from him. They've been leaking little stories about Biden possibly running, to gauge the reaction from the public. That's a general rule. If a story isn't actually about an actual event that happened, then its not journalism but rather a test of the people who see it. If you don't understand this by now, God help you. Biden will run and lose on purpose to make Hillary look better.

       Biden is entering the race because the establishment is scared shitless about Bernie Sanders and they know no one likes Hillary.

       Biden is not what he seems, that's for sure. If we found out he was part of the pedophile crew, it wouldn't surprise me much. He sure sold Anita Hill down the river and did all he could behind the scenes to get Clarence Thomas to SCOTUS. Fuck him.

       He has "played ball" upon occasion. And I don't hold out a huge amount of hope about the guy. But the country moves upon its foundation depending upon its leadership, and under Sanders the country would move closer to economic equality, I do believe.

       Then we differ politically. Sure seems to me he's at least SAYING the right things, and trying to talk about issues. Even if you don't agree with his positions on those issues, the mere fact that he's trying to run a sober and issue-focused campaign should resonate with you.

       Actually, I believe the opposite. I initially thought Trump was a Clinton plant to throw the GOP into disarray, and he is definitely achieving that, BUT...doesn't Trump make Biden suddenly look electable? Especially with Warren at his side?

       Or Trump could just be an egocentric moron with no agenda other than his delusional belief that he could be electable. I think people are giving him far too much credit.

       I'm an independent that leans a bit toward the D side, though I did vote for Ron Paul in the last primary. I don't think I could bring myself to vote for any of the candidates on the R side currently. Rand certainly isn't his dad, though many seem to wish he was.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, there's also no way in hell I'd vote for Clinton. If it came down to Clinton vs whoever in the general election, I'd probably find a third party candidate worth backing.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the primary, I'm leaning toward Sanders at the moment, but I'm curious to hear what Biden has to say, how he'd differentiate himself from Obama. I really wish Warren was running though, I'd vote for her in a heartbeat.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no way would I vote for Clinton. And I know many other D-leaning people who feel the same way.

       Clinton's a crook. Powerful, but maybe too provably crooked to be an inevitability now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a registered R, so I have no idea who I'd choose in the primary. I'd probably vote for Sanders in the D primary, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the Ron Paul tip, I am
       <em>
        extremely
       </em>
       disappointed in him. Been a supporter for years and years (and in the primary last go-round, ultimately voted Gary Johnson). Was visiting the folks for whom Fox News is background noise, always running. Dr. Ron comes on, I perk up, excited...and it's a commercial...for a financial snake oil company that shills newsletters. A real Ovaltine moment for me, I am so bummed about this.

       Is there anyone you'd recommend I check out on the R side? I'm pretty much only familiar with the "big" names at this point, and haven't done a whole lot of digging into some of the other folks who are running.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a registered Independent, so I can vote in the R or D primary if I wish. I'm not 100% committed to Sanders (I disagree with him on some stuff, agree on others, and like the fact that he doesn't seem to be a mindless parrot), so maybe there's an R out there that I'd like?

       I dunno. I watched the debates and while I liked a few of their answers, none of them speak to me and it feels like they're focusing on all the wrong issues. Cruz is a huge no for me due to his associations with folks like Alan Dershowitz. He's very inauthentic--always railing against elites...while he is one. I didn't hate Rubio, Paul, Kasich, or Carson.

       Yeah, I've gotten the same vibe from Cruz as from Christie, Huckabee, and Walker -- too many ties, personal and financial, to sketchy people.  Paul... I want to like him, but he's not his dad. Though his dad isn't his dad anymore either I guess. Don't know much about the other 3 you mentioned so maybe I'll see what they're about.

       I think it has a lot to do with the Democratic party trying to shift the media's focus from Hillary's email ordeal to something that is, as you stated, essentially irrelevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, Biden could be a backup plan to a Clinton nomination. The Democratic party sees Hillary as a volatile candidate with a lot of skeletons in her closet that could wreck her campaign. And they don't want Bernie Sanders to be the only other viable candidate should this happen for obvious reasons (he isn't subservient to their big donors, for starters).
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, this is a ploy the party has been holding in their back pocket for the right time, which they obviously think is now.

       Yeah. Today that story came out that Biden "received Obama's blessing." WTF? That doesn't happen. You don't need that. They're trying to create a close of a connection as possible between Obama and Biden in the public's eyes. They know what they're doing. And the sad part is that a lot of people will probably fall for it.

       Biden is not a stooge. He actually wrote the Patriot Act. Biden and Warren will win the presidency with Bilderberg blessing.

       Of course she is. It's simple. Doesn't matter who wins. Jeb Bush is as well. No need to rig an election if anyone who wins is already controlled. We are on the same page here. Not sure why you are angry.

       He has "played ball" upon occasion. And I don't hold out a huge amount of hope about the guy. But the country moves upon its foundation depending upon its leadership, and under Sanders the country would move closer to economic equality, I do believe.
