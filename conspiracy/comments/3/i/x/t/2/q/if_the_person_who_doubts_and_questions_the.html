       Since they were so good at putting a negative association around the word "truth", let's see if they can put a positive one on a pack of lies.  So when you are called a truther (a term I have never liked), it appears you have won the argument.  Who would you believe?  A truther?  Or a liar?

       Exactly. Moreover you have to be brain dead to see the towers exploding and still not believe it was a controlled demo. How dumb can people be, that they don't believe what they see with their own eyes but rather believe what authority tells them to believe.

       "Truther", the media name given for members of the 9/11 truth movement, was meant as derogatory, and was conceived of about the same time as "birther", the term given to people questioning BO's birth cert.  The media owners thought it was clever, and  didn't realize they had shit in their Wheaties at first.
      </p>
      <p>
       The online shills realized the problem with this term a few years back, and changed their attack name to the sarcastic "twoofer".  But the genie is out of the bottle.

       I wouldn't be surprised if the "truther" term was coined by a truther themselves. They'd have been dubbed a "9/11 conspiracy theorist" which sounds much less reputable than "truther". Great rebranding effort!

       How about doubter instead of truther because it implies anyone who is not a doubter is a believer and believer is a word with very strong faith-based connotations. This may help those on the fence about this to ask themselves, "am I really a believer?"

       No. The term 'truther' arose after people subscribing to a sizeable number of alternative and mutually exclusive conspiracy theories other than the official one used the worth "truth" so much and made the claim that they were in the sole possession of the truth rather than others, that it became a convenient way for people debunking their claims to refer to them.

       Maybe some 'truthers' have asserted that they were in sole possession of the truth, but that is a much more common characteristic of the official cover up story defenders, whom I do refer to as "liars" since they are supporting a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see truthers as the sole possessors of the truth, so much as the people who are actively seeking it, so it is an unfair assertion to make about them. Something we have come to expect from our opposition. The liars are obviously trying to cover up the truth, making them our opposites on the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Truthers can and do disagree and have heated arguments over those disagreements. That does not make them liars, only the people defending the official cover up stories deserve that label.

       Supported, maybe. That poll was taken almost a decade ago. Safe to use the past tense now.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case I'm all for a new investigation too, even though I consider such an undertaking to be a waste of time and money. The drama bomb that would erupt amongst the 9/11 Truth community if it reached an identical conclusion to the old one would be just delicious.

       I'm with you, would love to see a dozen different investigations (as long it doesn't cost me a dime of my own money). They'd all come to the same conclusion, it would be high comedy.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I always wonder is, who would the truth community be ok with investigating the collapse? I'm sure they would immediately want to disqualify anyone who has ever had any involvement with NIST, or any members of the American Institute of Architects or the American Society of Civil Engineers or the American Institute of Steel Construction (since all of them contributed to and endorsed the NIST investigations) or any scientist who makes a living working on government contracts. Who does that leave you with?

       At this point the academic community is
       <em>
        bored to death
       </em>
       with 9/11. A couple truthers spoke to MIT professors on the topic a year ago, and they said themselves that the profs could barely contain their
       <em>
        withering contempt
       </em>
       for the topic. Chomsky says so himself on any number of occasions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, even the subs here that are populated with engineers are bored to tears with the topic.

       I'm sure the American academic community would be absolutely
       <em>
        teeming
       </em>
       with truthers if they weren't being "censored". I mean, look at the
       <em>
        overwhelming support
       </em>
       you guys have built up among the academic communities of other first world countries like England, France, Canada or Australia.
      </p>
      <p>
       ...oh wait...none of them support you either. I guess the academic community of
       <em>
        every single first world country
       </em>
       is being "censored" by...someone.
      </p>
      <p>
       What about the engineering communities of other first world countries? I mean, we already know the American engineering community thinks you're laughable, but surely with all the truth on your side, the engineers in other places have come out in wide support of the movement...right?
      </p>
      <p>
       No?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, I guess they're being "censored" as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Surely the Architectural communities of other first world countries have come out in support of the truth movement, right? I mean, the AIA just voted overwhelmingly in the "truthers are full of shit" category, but you
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       have some support from the architectural community in other countries...
      </p>
      <p>
       ...whoops...swing and a miss. Must be that pesky "censorship".
      </p>
      <p>
       DEMOLITION EXPERTS! Certainly the demolitions experts have come out in your favor, right? I mean, the trade towers and WTC 7 were
       <em>
        undeniably
       </em>
       demolition jobs, right? Even a
       <em>
        blind fool
       </em>
       can see that! Certainly you MUST have wide support from an array of demolitions experts, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nope, they think you're laughable too.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know, when experts from every single relevant field think you're full of shit, chances are you're full of shit.

       So if the professionals in the field are censored why are you bothering to call for a new investigation? If you don't trust the experts in the field of structural engineering, who exactly would you put in charge of it? Pharmacists? Meteorologists? Or are they in on it too?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or will your new investigation only be stacked with that tiny groupuscule of engineers who have made clear they've already fallen for your pet conspiracy theory?
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I'm all for a new investigation and have outlined exactly who I think should staff it above. So give us a straight answer:
       <em>
        who
       </em>
       would be doing the investigation you're calling for?
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty simple.

       I propose the top 15 most-cited structural engineers culled from the top engineering faculties worldwide, as ranked by the

       . Even happy to exclude Americans. Seems the most objective way to get a credible team of investigators who know their shit, no?

      <p>
       Of course, I imagine truthers would come up with all kinds of tenuous "connections" to the CIA or Mossad or whatever to cover their asses - like you said, they tend to be deliberately vague about the composition of their "independent" investigation.

       The dictionary is useful to resolve misunderstandings.
