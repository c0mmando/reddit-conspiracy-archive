        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;hyperreality is an inability of consciousness to distinguish reality from a simulation of reality, especially in technologically advanced postmodern societies.&quot; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreality">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreality</a></p>

<p>In the wake of sketchy &quot;tragedies&quot; like WDBJ, the Boston Marathon Bombings, Sandy Hook, Aurora, 9/11 and more, it&#39;s becoming increasingly clear that media and social media are using crisis actors and other means of deceit to fool the masses into believing false narratives about the world. </p>

<p>Even though each of the events listed above have serious questions and discrepancies about them, the emotional atmosphere generated by them prevents people from viewing them objectively. Anyone who questions the official narratives is lambasted for being insensitive and crazy, and thus untrustworthy.</p>

<p>We all know this already. So my question for you all: how do we, the watchful, expose hyperreality for what it is? How do we bridge the gap to reach the masses?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>pretty much ever since radio broadcasts were popularized, there have been great strides made in utilizing these new technologies to influence the consumers&#39; behavior and cognition.  Once TV was introduced, they knew they had us.  Entire generations of humans live their lives in imitation of what they see on tv and listen to for entertainment.  And now we have interactive games, and soon &#39;virtual reality&#39; will be commonplace in households.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t even know where I am going with this, I am on pain medication right now heh.  I believe that a lot of mental illnesses are at least exacerbated, by the jarring effects of some of these &#39;alternate realities&#39; that our minds tend to dwell in.  I may type more later.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I use to think this too, but I&#39;ve got some hesitations about it now.</p>

<p>Humans create culture themselves. Even before television-  art, theater, music, dance, and other forms of human expression shaped societies. We saw it during the enlightenment period and the renaissance period. Hell, even the Egyptians had culture.</p>

<p>The only difference now is that TV exposes humans to various cultural behaviors and expressions. It may seem like humans are too dumb to think for themselves, which at times may be the case, and therefore emulate what they see, but that&#39;s existed for centuries; just look at religion. Humans adopted it, shaped their lives based on words, and spread it all around the world.</p>

<p>TV is a tool, but our willingness to find something on it that resonates in us is the culprit.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not debating the use of propaganda and the negative effect that has on us. That shit is evil. But we willfully eat it up rather than shun it.</p>

<p>I remember reading about &quot;Project Blue Beam&quot;, a supposed plot to simulate an alien invasion or something of the like..similar to the ending of Watchmen. Perhaps what we&#39;re seeing these days IS this Project Blue Beam, but more in the form of death by a thousand paper cuts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t reach the masses.</p>

<p>What you can do is keep asking questions. Ask for explanations. Distance yourself from the term &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; because the government is selling some theories too, they are playing both sides, to make anyone questioning the original narrative out to be a crazy tin foil hat wearing theoririst.</p>

<p>If you keep asking questions, and keep questioning these &quot;official stories&quot; that have more holes in them then swiss cheese, others might start to question them too.</p>

<p>The answers are out there, but the general public is not ready to ask the question.</p>

<p>You cannot prepare them for the answers. You can only guide them to asking the questions for themselves, so that they seek out the answers for themselves. </p>

<p>This is how revolutions start.</p>

<p>I ask you, <em>&quot;what is the sound of one hand clapping&quot;</em> </p>

<p>You may not care to know the answer. But If I keep asking you, eventually, something in your brain will click.</p>

<p><em>What is the sound of one hand clapping</em></p>

<p>Only when you decide you need to know for yourself will the answer really matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed - life exists on a broad spectrum, from Real to Simulated. </p>

<p>Real, for me, means the very essence of what it means to be alive. It&#39;s the stuff you are in tune with as a child: love, growth, meaning, connection with nature, meaningful relationships, self-actualization, creativity, family, adventure, and the courage to try new things and push back against evil (or unconsciousness.)  </p>

<p>As we grow up, however, a bunch of crap happens and our awareness starts to narrow. We don&#39;t have the courage or energy to follow our path with a heart, and thus write off many of the concepts listed above as &#39;unrealistic.&#39; This seems rational, but it&#39;s really just fear. We still <em>need</em> love, connection, meaning, etc. but don&#39;t know how to go about getting it, so we turn to <em>simulations</em> of these essential parts of life. </p>

<p>Instead of forming deeply meaningful relationships, we watch <em>Friends</em> on television. </p>

<p>We watch action/adventure movies instead of going on adventures in real life. </p>

<p>Instead of becoming archetypal warriors and entering the arena of Good vs. Evil for real, we watch simulated combat called sports. </p>

<p>Instead of making learning a life-long quest that is different for every body, we point at our college diploma and declare we are now &#39;educated.&#39; </p>

<p>The masses do not <em>act.</em> They are passive; they watch. They sit down at work, sit down at sporting events, and sit down to watch television. They are spectators who watch other people do things. </p>

<p>They satisfy their drives with simulations that are one-step removed from reality. Getting girls is hard, so we watch porn. Going to war (either literally or in the realm of ideas, etc.) is scary so we watch sports. Living life to the fullest in your 20s is difficult so we watch <em>Friends.</em> Finding a purpose in life is challenging so we make careers a surrogate purpose. I could go on forever. </p>

<p>The point is, you ultimately lose if you base your life on simulations. You are being fake, and deep down you know this. You lose vitality and passion. Life becomes dull.</p>

<p>Just look around. Everyone is on the spectrum from Real to less Real. Some people spend this life as warriors, defending their people and values to the death (read about Sitting Bull, for instance), while others watch reality television, eat shit food, and complain about their jobs for <em>decades.</em> </p>

<p>Be real. Be Tupac Shakur. Or Theodore Roosevelt. Or Bob Marley. Stop watching and start <em>acting.</em> Make your own rules and your own values. Create your own empire. </p>
