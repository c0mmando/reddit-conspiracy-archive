    <div class="md"><p>Lying is an art, you have to make it believable. The language C wasn&#39;t even around in 1969. If you told them you had a super computer, people would have asked what language it ran on. Then they would have asked the speed, specs etc. It had to be believable. This was the best they came up with at the time. I cannot speak much for what they could have said. Its such an open ended hypothetical question. What I do know is that they went to the moon 6 times in a span of 3 years with far far inferior technology than we have today. It should be a piece of cake to go to the moon today given the leaps and bounds we have advanced technologically. But no, they say its way too expensive!</p>

<p>Leaving all that aside, take a look at this:</p>

<p>If, for some reason, our government decided <em>tomorrow</em> that we needed to go back to the moon, we could. We haven&#39;t gone back in a while because . . . we don&#39;t need to. There are already rovers on lunar soil and satellites in lunar orbit, with extremely high-quality scientific instruments. In this age, they provide much, much more information about what we&#39;re studying than an extremely expensive manned mission to the moon would. We also don&#39;t have the benefit of a budget supercharged by the Cold War and the incentive of a space race.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand your confusion. There was foil between the descent and the ascent stages. When taking off, the ascent stage separated from the descent stage and the flame from the former scoured the surface of the latter. Obviously that didn&#39;t happen during landing, because during landing, the ascent stage was not active. The keen observer might note that the <em>descent</em> stage was active while the module <em>descended</em>, while the <em>ascent</em> stage activated only while it <em>ascended</em>. It&#39;s really cool how language works like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, say the lies over and over again, won&#39;t magically turn into truth. Every rocket launch except the lunar module has produced smoke on lift off, even worse on the lunar video, there is no displacement of the lunar sand! Any fool can see that the lunar module video is fake. The same unassisted launch cannot be reproduced on earth. The craft isn&#39;t even aerodynamic, with little to no protection from radiation that should be plenty on the moon since it has no atmosphere. You also missed the part where the computer on the craft is little more than a simple calculator. Its such a sad and embarrassing joke. Few years from now, we will see you for the lying scum that you are.</p>

<p>Most rocket launches don&#39;t involve hypergolic fuels. You&#39;re deliberately comparing apples to oranges and hoping that nobody notices.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The craft isn&#39;t even aerodynamic, with little to no protection from radiation that should be plenty on the moon since it has no atmosphere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re answering your own question here. They don&#39;t need an aerodynamic craft because <em>there&#39;s no atmosphere.</em> As for radiation, they&#39;re in a craft covered in thick metal plates.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You also missed the part where the computer on the craft is little more than a simple calculator.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The full code of that &quot;simple calculator&quot; is viewable in your own source that <em>you</em> posted. Go ahead and verify it yourself — no one&#39;s stopping you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry I came across as a dick in my previous comments. I shouldn&#39;t get into arguments at 3 a.m.</p>

<p>That said, I&#39;m not throwing up anything. In a propulsion systems course I took a long time ago, we did a full analysis of the entire Apollo mission, stage by stage. It took a long fucking time. The lunar module is small, but 2.6 tons of fuel is also pretty small. Spread out over two separate fuel tanks, which is how hypergolics work, and you&#39;re looking at tanks the size of trashcans. Compared to the full module, that&#39;s nothing. <a href="http://alaingayot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/lunar-module.jpg">The craft is a lot bigger than it looks in that video.</a> I&#39;m not making this up, nor am I inflating my language to seem better informed. Anyone who has taken a propulsion course has probably done a similar analysis, because it makes for a good project.</p>
