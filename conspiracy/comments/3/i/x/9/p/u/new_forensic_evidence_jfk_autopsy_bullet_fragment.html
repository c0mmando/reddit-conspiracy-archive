       It has been a long while since I read JFK material but wasn't a bullet picked up in the hospital that was suppose to be the magic bullet, still whole, that had shot two men killing one?
      </p>
      <p>
       How could there also be a fragment?   The Warren Report did talk three bullets, but I understand they couldn't explain how there could be three shots from one gun in the time sequence or something along those lines.  I don't want to look at it again.

       The fragment in question is from the head shot, not the supposed "magic" bullet which was found on a stretcher at Parkland Hospital. Large parts of the head shot bullet were recovered from the limousine and smaller fragments were left in JFK's brain.

       What also reeks of a set up it the alleged murder weapon.  Why would anyone use a highly identifiable piece of crap rifle?  Why not use a common high powered inexpensive rifle that could not be easily tied to you?  The only thing I can think of is if the person wanted to get caught, or someone wanted to set them up to be tied to it.  What better way to get away with murder than to have someone take the rap for you.

      <p>
       And who the fuck was in charge of the prisoner transfer anyway?

      <p>
       A character from the Saturday morning cartoons?   How the fuck does that happen?

       How did that go down?

      <p>
       Eh hey boss, the guy that runs the titty bar is here, he's got a  gun, should we let him in??   Yes, lets bring him right in.....
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously??
      </p>
      <p>
       .....  Who was in charge that day, Barney Fife?  Why wasn't the Dallas PD sued by Oswalds family for that move?
      </p>
      <p>
       That is a conspiracy in it self.

      <p>
       For the record I think Oswald did it, and did it alone. Ruby too.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, very interesting question. Surely a case could be made for negligence here - the Dallas PD had a clear duty of care toward Oswald, who was their detainee and dependent upon them for protection.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, it was reasonable foreseeable, given the anger directed at Oswald across the country and that people were basically begging to lynch him at his arrest that he was at risk of being harmed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the only explanation I have for the Dallas PD not being sued is the Oswald family and Marina just didn't want the increased publicity and exposure such a case would bring. Either that or they didn't think any judge or jury in Texas would find the police liable for the death of the killer of the president.

       Nope. It's likely Bobby Kennedy disposed of it. That's what the HSCA concluded anyway.
