       I figure this might be the best place to post this rather than a GMO related subreddit given the odds its inundated with fanatics on either side.
      </p>
      <p>
       So,like the title says: Why do you think GMOs are a bad thing and should be banned? Ideally, with great reputable source material on the whys would be appreciated.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really am asking this as this is a subject that gets posted here fairly often i think,well rather about the worlds reactions to GMOs, but I must say myself am in the dark about why people are in some cases vehemently against GMOs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hear from some people that GMOs are nothing but good solving vitamin deficiency problems in places where like vitamin A isn't readily available and how it can be remedied through golden rice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then on the flip side I hear people saying it might cause this or that disease or have some kind of huge ecological impact in the years to come.
      </p>
      <p>
       So,I am willfully admitting my ignorance on GMOs here and hope that some of you can give me an idea for either case, either PRO-GMO or ANTI-GMO. Again, with reputable sources where possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I brought this up due to a video on
       <a href="/r/videos">
        /r/videos
       </a>
       about golden rice and greenpeace and the guy went so far as to say people who aren't pro-gmo are anti-science. I recall hearing or reading about this thing groups do in order to enforce a bad connotation against their opponents or give themselves a positive connotation. i.e. Pro-life instead of Anti-choice and in the case of the video Anti-science in regards to people who are against GMOs. A fancy word game to enforce this notion of "My team is good,theirs is bad."

       To see the GMO fraud let's focus on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <em>
         The Food Additive Amendment of the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act institutes
a precautionary approach and requires that new additives to food must be
demonstrated safe before they are marketed.
        </em>
        (21 U.S.C. Sec. 321)
An official Senate report described the intent of the amendment as follows:
        <em>
         “While Congress did not want to unnecessarily stifle technological advances, it
nevertheless intended that additives created through new technologies be proven
safe before they go to market.
        </em>
        (S. Rep. 2422, 1958 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5301- 2
(emphasis added))
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       **
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Although the FDA admits that the various genetic materials implanted in bioengineered organisms are within the amendment’s purview, it claims they are
exempt from testing because they are generally recognized as safe (GRAS).
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         However
        </strong>
        ,
        <strong>
         the FDA’s regulations state that substances added to food that were
not in use prior to 1958 cannot qualify as GRAS unless they meet two
requirements.
        </strong>
        <strong>
         Not only must they be acknowledged as safe by an overwhelming
consensus of experts, but this consensus must be based on “scientific
procedures” – which ordinarily entails studies published in peer-reviewed
journals.
        </strong>
        (21 CFR Sec. 170.30 (a-b) )

         Source
        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The FDA violated its own rule and unleashed a Frankenstein's monster on an unwitting public. 
The big concern starts when we go digging for mention of safety in the original documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take the first GMO product
       <em>
        Flavr savr
       </em>
       for example the company that produced this states that rat tests show it's safe. The FDA rules say "overwhelming consensus" in the form of peer reviewed papers is needed (independent papers too) for approval. What passes for approval in the linked PDF's is the company refuting a hand full of comments at a "open comment" event.
       <a href="http://www.aphis.usda.gov/biotechnology/petitions_table_pending.shtml">
        USDA APHIS permits and documentation
       </a>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        FDA regulations further stipulate that
        <em>
         these scientific procedures must
provide a demonstration of safety and that GRAS substances “…require the same
quantity and quality of scientific evidence as is required to obtain approval of
the substance as a food additive.”
        </em>
        (21 CFR Sec. 170.30(b)) Thus, it’s clear that
the GRAS exemption is not supposed to reduce the degree of testing but rather to
relieve a producer from performing new tests for substances already known to be
safe on the basis of previous ones.
       </p>
       <hr/>

      <p>
       The FDA wants "overwhelming consensus" but we find not even a "consensus" exists.

         Statement: No scientific consensus on GMO safety
        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         As scientists, physicians, academics, and experts from disciplines relevant to the scientific, legal, social and safety assessment aspects of genetically modified organisms (GMOs),[1] we strongly reject claims by GM seed developers and some scientists, commentators, and journalists that there is a “scientific consensus” on GMO safety[2] [3] [4] and that the debate on this topic is “over”.[5]
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         We feel compelled to issue this statement because the claimed consensus on GMO safety does not exist. *
        </em>
        The claim that it does exist is misleading and misrepresents the currently available scientific evidence and the broad diversity of opinion among scientists on this issue.** Moreover, the claim encourages a climate of complacency that could lead to a lack of regulatory and scientific rigour and appropriate caution, potentially endangering the health of humans, animals, and the environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         Science and society do not proceed on the basis of a constructed consensus, as current knowledge is always open to well-founded challenge and disagreement...

      <p>
       We can see the public started consuming GMO's long before achieving "overwhelming consensus" by "peer reviewed papers". The FDA let us down probably due to underfunding,  r policy changes helped along by George H. Bush, industry pressure and industry being the only ones capable of testing in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can be comforted by the fact countries are

        banning (blue) and forcing GMO's to label
       </a>
       which Monsanto called a "scull and crossbones" for its gmo products. Apparently the "Dark Act bill" to not allow the public gmo information only stands a 30% of passing in the Senate and with at least 13 states introducing labeling bills, Campbells moving toward gmo labeling (after spending millions to defeat label efforts) and the public waking up to the fraud we can see the end in sight.
       <strong>
        The European Union recently
        <em>
         released
        </em>
        member countries to decide if they want GMO's.
       </strong>
       That's a huge deal and we'll see what bans continue and if the coveted "green status" is worth losing by entertaining risky GMO's.

       Hell of a post. I'd be against GMOs if for nothing else than the skirting FDA additive testing requirements. It can be perfectly fine to humans but it should be held to every regulation and requirement every other additive has to.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a similar vein,I always get a shock when i tell people that I was against the passing of the gay marriage thing a little while back but only on the grounds of how it passed. 5 of 9 unelected people interpreted law and forced it on states that may have not agreed,which can potentially lead to other 'interpretations' that will lead to more insidious things,ie gun control,similar to the worries about lax future regulation on additives for foods.

       And this is the most vital part of the claim. Without a citation for this, the whole thing kind of falls apart because it becomes more of an interpretation of a layman (that they should not be considered GRAS by the rules) rather than the FDA openly flaunting the fact that they are ignoring their own rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FDA does not require every new hybridization or cross-breeding to immediately be put something in the non-GRAS category. The evidence suggests that we should be treating GMOs the same way, which is why these don't also necessarily fall into the non-GRAS category.

       The thing that made me be against them was realizing that the genetic modification to roundup ready crops meant that the crop lived with a huge amount of roundup poison in the crop and you subsequently ATE all that Roundup poison when you ate the crop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then scientists learned about jumping genes which showed that crops that get the modification can actually have those genes jump to other crops and animals that they dont reproduce with. Thst was in no way anticipated. Jumping genes are bizarre but now proven. Genes can naturally  jump across species without any sexual reproduction. (of course we have always known you can cause genes to be insetted into any living thing by simple phyiscal action. Genes guns are used to do this all the tile. It just hsd never been observed naturally before.)
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also the argument that having a concentration of any single crop breed leaves the whole system open  to rapid collapse if their is a sudden vulnerability in the crop.

       The amount and timing of glyphosate application is regulated by law. For example, it is
       <a href="http://ipcm.wisc.edu/blog/2012/09/a-review-of-glyphosate-use-for-preharvest-weed-control/">
        illegal to apply glyphosate on soy after R2
       </a>
       , to avoid being absorbed by the developing beans. The standard application rate is 22 oz per acre, a far cry from "huge amount". With respect to "roundup poison", glyphosate is by far the safest herbicides, especially the ones it replaces.
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of all of this, there are non-GMO herbicide resistant crops as well. In particular BASF's Clearfield rice, wheat and sunflowers are conventionally bred to be resistant to the herbicide

        imazamox
       </a>
       . The whole "I don't like GMOs because of herbicide resistant" is just silly. A prime example of this is Chipotle bashing GMOs for being herbicide resistant, then switching from GMO glyphosate resistant soy to BASF's imazamox resistant non-GMO sunflower.

       This is a common misperception. In reality a genetically engineered trait is developed, then crossed (by conventional breeding means) into all the usual varieties. They are not clones of each other. Open an corn or soy seed catalog and you'll find hundreds of varieties, each with and without the various genetically engineered traits.

       I understand both sides. It would make sense that any advancing culture would eventually come to the point where they can manipulate genes to produce more and larger foods for a growing population, almost an evolution of our species to do so. That makes sense to me, but I also understand that science isn't the end all be all. Just because we don't see any correlation in say breast cancer, doesn't mean that we ABLE to find the correlation at this point in science. We aren't at the point yet where we can cure cancer and maybe not at the point where we can see every aspect of causation. That's my two cents.. still on the fence with the GMOs.

       It depends if you listen to the evidence or not.

      <p>
       There is zero evidence showing harm. There are thousands of studies showing zero harm from GMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a wide scientific consensus on GM safety.

       I can understand getting behind percieved safety conclusions however i'd rather see it go through the proper law everything else would have to. Also, I always thought most farmers would rather not be subject to monsanto in regards to saving seed and not being sued for doing so.

       Farmers choose glyphosate resistance and Bt traits with the non-seed saving restriction because it works. The savings in inputs and labor far exceeds the cost of new seeds every season. On top of this, farmers haven't saved seeds since the advent of hybrids (because hybrids' offspring doesn't breed true to their parents). This applies to corn (hence you find a corn seed saving lawsuit) but not soy (modern soy are not hybrids).

       They do go through the same laws everyone else has to. Non-GMO seeds are also patented too. In fact, nearly all commercial seeds are patented, so despite the widespread misconception, GMOs aren't the only ones to be covered by a patent.

       You can take issue with a general lack of regulation, but it's not true to say that every other type of seed technology gets harsh and difficult safety standards to meet and GMO gets the green light. They all have the same standards to pass. Hybrids didn't need X-years of testing, it was just released following basic initial testing despite the fact that hybridisation means changing lots of genes randomly in the hope a specific trait becomes predominant.

       Hybridization is the natural cross breeding of different plant species, you can do it at home, in you garden. You do not need to test the resulting produce except maybe for taste. When the desired traits do not occur, or if undesirable traits like  flavor, fuzzy fruit, excessive fiber occur then a different species cross is made. This is similar to natural selection. It is not seed technology. It is plant breeding.

       Well done for completely missing the point entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that you can do hybridisation in your own garden doesn't magically make it safer, or more dangerous. The fact that transgenic modification can only really happen in a lab doesn't make it safer, or more dangerous. The big difference is with transgenic modification, you are changing one single gene while leaving the rest untouched. With hybridisation, you are changing dozens of gene sequences at random.
      </p>
      <p>
       For some reason that you've not explained at all, you've decided that one doesn't need any safety testing at all, whereas the other needs decades of safety testing without any explanation as to what the mechanism of harm might even be.

       You seem to have completely arbitrarily decided that anything that doesn't happen in a lab is not "technology". This makes no sense, and completely ignores the fact that transgenics don't always need a lab to happen.

       So why do you make this bizarre definition? And why do you think messing with genes is safe (hybridisation) but messing with genes is dangerous (genetic engineering)? Your position is wildly inconsistent.

       Do you understand how hybridisation works? Taking two distinct plants and cross-breeding them to get a specific trait to become prominent is
       <em>
        literally

       messing with the genes. It's trying to get the genes that express that trait to become more pronounced, plus also mixing a random assortment of other genes to boot.

       That's because that is literally what it is. It's a way of manipulating the seed to get a specific outcome. I'm not sure why you've seemingly made a completely arbitrary view that anything not in a lab doesn't count as a technology, but that doesn't make it so.

Transgenesis is not something that humans made up, it is something that happens in nature that we've taken advantage of in order to get the desired traits out of plants that we want.

       So either both are natural or neither is.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is that, by definition, neither is natural. They are both involve the interference of humans in the natural evolutionary course of an organism to get them to express the desired traits.

       Understood. If they were the same thing, they would likely be called the same thing. The fact that they are different things means they have differences. The question is whether or not these differences are applicable to the current claim.

       Incorrect. As I pointed out to you, sweet potatoes are the example of naturally occurring transgenesis that has stuck around. Again, if you've ever eaten a sweet potato, you've a plant that was result of natural transgenesis. And this is all that we
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       about, we haven't fully decoded and studied the DNA of most organisms on the planet. It may be very common. In fact, it happens naturally quite frequently, it's just that usually the genetic change is not passed on to the offspring.

       Well actually you might want to. Brassicas (kale, cabbage, cauliflower, etc) all produce compounds that are known to inhibit thyroid function and there
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       new varieties of these plants that produce enough of these chemicals to cause rather severe diseases in the people who eat them.

       Natural cross breeding is anything but perfectly safe.

       I believe that you have been mislead to believe that there are a lot of people who think that GMOs are bad. The debate is constantly being pushed to be polarized, when it really isn't that black and white. Each GMO has the potential to be bad, but simply being a GMO doesn't make it bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       One concern is that good science and studies aren't being done to make certain that all GMO's are good or better. The attacks on and silencing of critics and experts who find anything negative isn't right either. Another concern is the very aggressive attempts to make it so that the distinction between GMO and non-GMO are hidden from the public. The last concern is the obvious astroturfing going on by users who misinform, manipulate, and deceive anyone on the net who aren't all gungho about giving the agri-companies everything that they want and who don't buy into every word that they say.
