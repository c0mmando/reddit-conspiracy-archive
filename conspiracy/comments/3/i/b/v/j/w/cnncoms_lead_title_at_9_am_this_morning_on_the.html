       It's not even a conspiracy, just messed up.  This recent economic crash hasn't hurt any wealthy individuals...  Rather, it has hurt the common man.... The average joe has no idea how to short, time trades, understand technical analysis, or collude and insider trade.

       I challenge you to come up with a country which can be evidenced to be of equal or higher educational capacity than America, which has also succumbed to a CIA-sponsored coup. By all means: prove it, don't just assert it.

       It's not 'exceptionalism' to admit that the US is the biggest super power in the globe is it? Why not? Because it's evidenced to be true. The same is so for this. Edit: Note I'm not claiming we're

       What bearing does that have on whether or not public opinion and action can be manipulated? Are you honestly trying to imply that because you can submit to authority, and complete a higher education course, that you automatically cannot be coerced? Education has very little to do with being able to critically evaluate the information you're given, look at how many educated members of society believe in claims made by presidential campaigns. Like it or not, the american people are very gullible as a whole, no matter how much education they've received

       Again, what does that matter? All you're saying is that our economic output is greater than other countries. That would be expected of a populace who can knuckle down and work for another person's profit when demanded to.
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes more business sense to keep the american machine running as usual. There is much more profit to be had continuing as usual to justify gambling your time in order to consolidate the power structure a little bit more. It has nothing to do with how educated our populace is, because on average, we aren't a smart group of people.

      <p>
       I'm not moving any goalposts. You're making the mistake of assuming that a revolutionary movement would be a widespread phenomenon. In all likelihood it would consist of the futile attempts of disparate sects of people who have had their organizations infiltrated and sterilized. Which is exactly what united states intelligence agencies have done on our own soil.

       There isn't though. COINTELPRO did co-opt and put an end to revolutionary movements, like Martin Luther King Jr's later initiative to reform america's economic system

       You honestly believe education equates to a 'submission to authority'. That's the best thing that TPTB could convince you of to keep their status quo. This is a fundamental difference between you and I: You think education is bad. I do not.

      <p>
       I never mentioned economic output, you're correlating that to education. I admit the correlation is there, obviously, but no, that's not 'all [I'm] saying': it's not even at all what I said. The economic output isn't relevant to this discussion. I'm saying that the average American won't be swayed by the same tricks that have worked elsewhere for the CIA before, not because they're wealthier or make more money, but because they're more educated in nearly every way possible.

       Oh really, compared to who?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just rhetoric: On average, we are an averagely-intelligent group of people: That's what
       <em>
        an average is
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       When someone says 'the average IQ is 110' they're wrong: The average IQ is 100; that's what 100 represents. The average. When the whole world gets smarter, the worldwide IQ levels
       <em>
        go down
       </em>
       . That's how the Intelligence Quotient works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, I didn't say "the average American is smart". I said "the average American is smarter than the average [Indonesian/Columbian/Guatamalan/etc]", which is again, provably true.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

        I'm not moving any goalposts. You're making the mistake of assuming that a revolutionary movement would be a widespread phenomenon. In all likelihood it would consist of the futile attempts of disparate sects of people who have had their organizations infiltrated and sterilized. Which is exactly what united states intelligence agencies have done on our own soil.
       </p>

      <p>
       Fair enough.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There isn't though. COINTELPRO did co-opt and put an end to revolutionary movements, like Martin Luther King Jr's later initiative to reform america's economic system
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You'd think if they were so powerful they'd have stopped his first initiative, that whole 'civil rights' thing. Again: COINTELPRO never had the reach or ambition that the CIA has had in other countries. Even in the one instance I can point to where a coup was attempted in America - the Business Plot - they failed miserably because of stupid, stupid, stupid mistakes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you're making the mistake of believing these intelligence agencies are incapable of mistakes because they're oh-so-smart. Cuba would like a word with you.

      <p>
       Funny right? How literate do you consider
       <em>
        yourself
       </em>
       ? Try reading what the fuck I wrote.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, "Educated" isn't the first thing that springs to mind when I think 'Guatemala' or 'Iraq' or 'Iran' either. I'm not comparing America to every country in the world: I'm comparing Americans to the citizens of countries where the CIA has sponsored or backed a coup.
      </p>
      <p>
       And second, I'm not saying all Americans are fucking
       <em>
        smart
       </em>
       . I'm saying
       <em>
        the average
       </em>
       American is a sight more
       <em>
        educated
       </em>
       than the average Iranian. Please note the use of averages, and please note the fucking difference between 'smart' and 'educated' as well - I feel it incredibly ironic that I have to point this out to you, considering your comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       A well educated person can still be incredibly stupid. I can give you plenty of examples of this if you require. Further, many people regarded as "smart" people are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       very well educated: again, I can give you plenty of examples as you require.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Educated" is the descriptor of someone who's been subject to
       <em>
        education
       </em>
       , as in schools and teachers. America has one of the highest rates of education in world history. Leaps and bounds ahead of anyone the CIA has brought a coup against (just to reiterate my point).
      </p>
      <p>
       "Smart" is the word a person applies to someone when they feel they've made an intelligent thought or comment. "Smart" is subjective to the speaker. We can argue about who or what is and is not 'smart', and neither of us could
       <em>
        prove it
       </em>
       . Republicans and Democrats argue about what the 'smart move' is all day long. "Smart" is not a very useful word, except for manipulative purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still laughing?

       Oh this is rich. You mention the anti-vax movement. Hah. Awesome. Let me educate you about that.

      <p>
       It stemmed from
       <em>

       , a journal based in Amsterdam.
      </p>

       The fact that Americans picked it up is irrelevant: We didn't

Instilling fear in those left as they go.

       This is the way it has always been.  When you study history,  it is (almost) always the history of the 1%.  We are a herd animal - it's in our nature. The grievance is not that there is a 1%, but that they have unfairly and unethically hijacked governance to favor and enrich themselves.  Government should exist for the people's benefits - the wealthy have their own wealth to protect them - the common man only has his unity and recognition of common cause with his fellow man.  We despair at the inequity but what is there to do about it?  Vote, volunteer, Government is only for the people when it is by the people.  Educate yourself about your own representatives and hold them accountable.  And if you don't like your choices become a representative yourself. It's the only democratic solution.

       I meant this statement to be seen from a larger perspective.  Throughout Human History there has always been a "1%" with a disproportionate percentage of the wealth (Kings, Pharaohs and Emperors etc.). That is the part that is human nature . What is so shocking to us today is that the proportion of wealth controlled by the 1% seems to be returning to pre-democratic levels.  That is bad for Democracy and unhealthy for civilized society.

       Well, as compared to the historical outlier of the 1950-1960s yeah, as compared to most of history, were on track.  Historically the wealth of the rich capitalist grows 4x times faster than the average salary.

       If you sold stocks yesterday, then you should consider learning more about the market or just get out of it completely.  This isn't the end of anything, it's just a small correction.  Have you looked at the markets today?

       Also, let's use % when talking about the market, not points.  Wake me when we are back at 2011 market levels.  I know this sub is mostly doom and gloom, but we are going to be FINE.  If you were smart you picked up some netflix yesterday, as there was no reason for that stock, amongst a ton of others, do be down yesterday.

       It's time to wage war against the elite, but we first have to get law enforcement on our side. They are the insulation for the ruling elite, and that's why the federal government has engineered a schism between law enforcement, and the public. If they don't do everything they can to drive us apart, law enforcement will naturally gravitate towards the public good.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why police departments across the nation discriminate against highly intelligent individuals. Awareness of this issue is happening faster than the government can counter.
