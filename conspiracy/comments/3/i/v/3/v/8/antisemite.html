    <div class="md"><p>Google Karaim Jews or no all conventional sources are manipulated so you can&#39;t trust anything? Well then I can&#39;t proove anything sorry. </p>

<p>Either way what I read often is that the rabbinic tradition did corrupt Judaism and brought them away from the true faith (Christianity). So if this is true and Judaism is corrupted by the rabbinic tradition with their Talmud, then you guys should actually hope the Khazards did undermine the Jews, because as I said the Karaim, the modern descendents of the Khazars, do reject the rabbinic tradition and the Talmud.</p>

<p>Did you understand it? These two conspiracies do cancel each other out. Either Jews are undermined by talmudic rabbies who put themself above the word of God (Bible, Jesus etc) or the Jews are undermined by Khazars. </p>

<p>Another addition, Wikipedia says that the Karaim do consider themselves to be the true descendents of the Khazars, while many scientists from various fields reject this notion and claim that the Khazars were indeed rabbinic (other factors are that the language of the Karaim is not very closely related to that of the Khazars and that the ancestors of the Karaim came much later into the area, when the Khazars were already conquered.) 
So, but wikipedia is most untrustworthy of course in such matters. So if you believe Judaism is undermined by the rabbinic tradition you&#39;d have to give the Karaim credit and thus believe them that they are the descedents of the Khazars, while the information against the Karaim is just put there to discredit them as they oppose the rabbinic order.  </p>

<p>The original guys have been dead for long, the Romans have murdered them all. So anyone that converted to that religion is not a member of God&#39;s Chosen People, and has no biblical right to the land of Palestine. To me that&#39;s enough to get Israel dissolved.</p>

<p>Just because Karaites are descendants of the Khazars, it doesn&#39;t mean that they are the only descendants. Take a look at the Ashkenazis.</p>

<p>I see you didn&#39;t. The Ashkenazis, who are also descendants of the Khazars have undermined both the rabbis and their belief. Even the average Jewish chump is nothing more than a pawn in this game.</p>

<p>Claiming wikipedia is shit is &quot;you don&#39;t say&quot;, but you should check the sources attached. Also, just because sg is on the wiki it doesn&#39;t automatically mean it&#39;s falsehood. And if you think about it, it doesn&#39;t matter if the Karaites are Khazars or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, you don&#39;t know shit either. The Jews were not collectively killed by the Romans. They weren&#39;t liked by the romans either, but for example they were among the first foreigners that were granted roman citizenship, by Caesar btw. The reason he did this? To appease Jews and anger his opponents. 
When the Jews were expulsed from Palestine by the romans they spread all around the SPQR, not being diminished.</p>

<p>Just as preffix, I am also an Antizionist and think the state of Israel should be dissolved.
But not because of the reason you cite. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So anyone that converted to that religion is not a member of God&#39;s Chosen People</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So modern Jews are not genetically identical to ancient hebrews, well I am not genetically identical to ancient germanics and still call myself a german, I am also just an imposter or is it that people for a long time didn&#39;t give a fuck about racial purity. </p>

<p>Just to be a bit douchy. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Take a look at the Ashkenazis.
I see you didn&#39;t</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You didn&#39;t either because the correct plural is Ashkenazim. Also Ashkenazim are from modern day western Germany. 
The Ashkenazim began to settle in Eastern Europe (on the invitation of the King of Poland) since the 14th century. The Khazars fell in the eleventh century. </p>

<p>Another factors that separates the Ashkenazim from the Khazars is language. The Khazars did speak a turkic language as well as the Karaim. The Ashkenazim speak/spoke Yiddish, which is closely related to german, with many slavic and hebrew influences, would former Khazar Jews have a large influx in the Ashkenazim population, you&#39;d see also a huge turkic influence. </p>

<p>It does matter whether the Karaim are related to the Khazars because the two conspiracy theories do contradict each other. </p>

<p>My Grandfather got an Ariernachweiss (Proof of Aryan Ancestry), just sayin. Also I didn&#39;t mean citizenship, but nationality. Of course every Arab can become german citizen, but I did mean ethnicity. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The Magyars migrated into central Europe before the Ottomans did. So technically Hungary or at least the ancestors to ethnical Hungarians existed already. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You just conveniently &quot;forgot&quot; the 3 centuries between Khazaria and the Ashkenazis. They reinvented themselves as entirely new people. The rest is history.</p>

<p>And you conveniently didn&#39;t read my comment. To quote myself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Ashkenazim began to settle in Eastern Europe (on the invitation of the King of Poland) since the 14th century. The Khazars fell in the eleventh century. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Ashkenazis or how you want to call them existed since the early middle ages. They didn&#39;t live in Eastern Europe untill after the crusades, at that time Khazaria already wasn&#39;t anymore. They didn&#39;t reinvent themself they just moved into another area. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Those who survived have mixed with the Romans and their linage slowly vanished.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So after your logic since their lineage is diluted the modern Ashkenazis aren&#39;t semite anymore, because they are genetically closer to europeans than ethnical semites like Arabs and ancient Hebrews.
So you are Hungarian. I have bad news for you. After your own logic you have no right to call yourself a Magyar or Hungarian, because modern Hungarians are closer to neighboring slavs than their next linguistic brethen, the Chanti and Mansi people. 
Same goes for Turks btws. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then why aren&#39;t you ethnic German?</p>

<p><em>Thanks</em> for taking that out of context. Mid 16th century Hungary was split into 3 territories: one under Ottoman rule, one under Habsburg rule and Transilvania. After 1.5 centuries the Habsburg occupied all of them.</p>

<p>So, where did they come from? Probably not from the other hemisphere. Do you have a &quot;guess&quot;? <a href="http://www.darkmoon.me/2013/top-israeli-scientist-says-ashkenazi-jews-came-from-khazaria-not-palestine/">I do</a>.</p>

<p>Sure, the amount of Romans per Israelite were the same as the amount of Turks per Hungarian. Suuuuure. And even if that was true, they only had one third of our lands, and the other two didn&#39;t suffer from the rapes, murders and abductions that the Ottoman occupied one did. So yep, another straw man.</p>

<p>Language? Really? Cause no group of people have <em>ever</em> ditched their language for another one, <em>riiight</em>? Lots of linguistics have been questioning the whole Finno-Ugric or Uralic lineage of our language. The origins of this language have never been actually found. And as we know, correlation does not equal causality.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Uhm, I am. I was just saying that my genetics aren&#39;t the same as germanic tribes in 100 A.D. For all I know my ancestors could be poles or french or whatever, but I don&#39;t know and I don&#39;t care because I can&#39;t know and it doesn&#39;t make any difference. Ethnicity is very much culture. Do you understand what I mean? It doesn&#39;t make a difference how genetically pure you are because ethnicity is very much culture. In before &quot;Then every newly immigrated arab can call himself ethnic german&quot;, no he can&#39;t, he can call himself German citizen, but he can&#39;t unmake his upbringing and neither can his kids. Thats why in my opinion Turk-Germans are a good example for this, are they more turkish or more german? With each generation the boundaries between different groups blurr into each other. </p>

<p>Uhm no, I wasn&#39;t talking about the Ottoman reign over Hungary, I was talking about Hungarians themself.
The Pannonian Basin wasn&#39;t unpopulated at the time the Magyars arrived. Before you bring up the Huns, to my knowledge the exact origin of the Huns isn&#39;t really known, they could be anything from Uralic like the Magyars, to Caucasian or even Yenisseian, but even before the Huns arrived the Pannonian Basin was settled. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Language? Really? Cause no group of people have ever ditched their language for another one, riiight?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was my point, languages change much faster than genetics. Magyars came and conquered the area, it became favourable to speak Hungarian. The same goes for Anatolia. Ancient Anatolia was mainly settled by Indo-European (Aryan for you) peoples. Then the ottomans came along (okay before the ottomans also other groups came along, but the ottomans dominated in the end). It is hard to kill hundreds of thousands if not millions of people. With the fall of Byzantine the ruling class became turkic, so it was favored to speak turkish than the previous IE languages. Genetically the Anatolian turks are closer to Greeks, Kurds and Armenians (all IE) than to central Asian turkics.  </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Uhm to my knowledge the Uralic Language family is pretty much well established and accepted.</p>

<p>Also what you are totally ignoring are Non-European Jews. When the Jews were expulsed from Israel they didn&#39;t just move to europe and got assimilitated there as you claim, but also to Africa, Yemen, Babylon and India (and even a few to China). Of course in these regions they intermingled with the local populace and are now more genetically similar to the surrounding populations than ancient hebrews (or at least they were, because Israel decided to ship them all in) What do you think about them? Are they all also just imposters? 
Isn&#39;t it more likely that yes after the expulsion Jews mixed with all other population, but they kept their traditions and became all the different jewish ethnicities?</p>

<p>I just follow your own logic, if modern Jews are just imposters because they are more genetically similar to the surrounding peoples than to ancient hebrews, than you would not be hungarian.
But you are, as much as Ashkenazim are Jews and guess why? Because genetics doesn&#39;t matter the way you think they matter, it ain&#39;t static and ethnicity is cultural not racial.
Therefore I am german, you are hungarian and Jews are Jews. </p>

<p>she is no a antisemite or a &quot;self-hating jew&quot;... she lives in the US and therefore does not understand the context of the Middle East. </p>

<p>The best way to put it is by asking that Why if the US is the most powerful nation on the world with the most advance military it completely destroyed Iraq without achieve peace and now it can win over the Taliban and?...the answer is context but living 6000 miles away that context does not exist.</p>

<p>The middle east act on a different set of rules that western people does not understand anymore, the Hama Rules created by Hafez al-Assad in the 80s </p>

<p>Just take it as my opinion.  I do not believe in bigotry based beliefs, and this.</p>

<p>It is about belief and identity and how well you understand what and why you believe what you believe and why act as you act.  I can&#39;t know that about you and it isn&#39;t important, what you and I think about what you and I think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t get it. </p>

<p>The original guys have been dead for long, the Romans have murdered them all. So anyone that converted to that religion is not a member of God&#39;s Chosen People, and has no biblical right to the land of Palestine. To me that&#39;s enough to get Israel dissolved.</p>

<p>Just because Karaites are descendants of the Khazars, it doesn&#39;t mean that they are the only descendants. Take a look at the Ashkenazis.</p>

<p>I see you didn&#39;t. The Ashkenazis, who are also descendants of the Khazars have undermined both the rabbis and their belief. Even the average Jewish chump is nothing more than a pawn in this game.</p>

<p>Claiming wikipedia is shit is &quot;you don&#39;t say&quot;, but you should check the sources attached. Also, just because sg is on the wiki it doesn&#39;t automatically mean it&#39;s falsehood. And if you think about it, it doesn&#39;t matter if the Karaites are Khazars or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those who survived have mixed with the Romans and their linage slowly vanished.</p>

<p>Straw man, as identical is a pretty strong word. Also, you might be officially German but genetically something entirely different (eg. an nth gen arab).</p>

<p>No, I simply refuse to pluralize it the <em>kike way</em>. Also, there&#39;s a huge difference between a kingdom falling and the extermination of its people. Hungary didn&#39;t exist on its own for centuries (from the Ottoman times till the end of WW1), we&#39;re still alive and kicking.</p>

<p>You just conveniently &quot;forgot&quot; the 3 centuries between Khazaria and the Ashkenazis. They reinvented themselves as entirely new people. The rest is history.</p>

<p>Now they own and control the whole world.</p>
