<p>That certain parties are determined that these posts don&#39;t get visibility or traction seems clear. I&#39;ve also observed that many good comments attached to these posts also get aggressively downvoted to near invisibility. If you want to participate and/or follow discussion of the incident, most of the posts wind up in &quot;Controversial&quot;. Also, clicking heavily downvoted comments to these posts can be revealing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure they are being downvoted because the posts rely on misinformation, lies, and absolutely ridiculous claims. </p>

<p>Shitty posts will always be downvoted, more at 11. </p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>I went through the posts that are suppsoedbly being downvoted by a government downvote squad. Here&#39;s what I found:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A post that claims because the United States legalized psy-ops against the American people in the NDAA, Roanoke must have been a psy-op. (Original claim is actually fabricated: All the NDAA did was remove restrictions preventing state-run media like Voice of America from being viewed in America). </p></li>
<li><p>A post that claims that because the reporter asked softball questions, the whole thing must have been staged. </p></li>
<li><p>A post claiming that because Obama attended a UN Arms Trade Treaty Conference on International Gun Control sometime before the shooting, the shooting itself must be a false-flag. (that treaty has nothing to do with guns <em>within the United States</em> and is mainly about international exports, plus the notion itself is logically invalid). </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p><strong>This post has been downvoted!</strong> Guess the powers-that-be are censoring it. From 2 to -1 in 2 minutes... gosh downvote brigade stop being so obvious!</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say that. I simply said you&#39;re a sheep and put &quot;fake&quot; after every major news story. You don&#39;t wait for evidence. You don&#39;t wait for it to fully play out. It is immediately fake to you. Even when evidence is presented to you it is fake. You don&#39;t think. You&#39;re a sheep on the skeptical side.

<p>Is it the specific use of the word shill? Or does &quot;You are a disinfo agent&quot; count? Does &quot;your TLA underwear is showing&quot; count?</p>

<p>A list of 15 well known and documented techniques used by the disinfo agents to attack our sub and our members is provided.  You falsely claim that I use these same methods to disrupt <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> &quot;* in exactly the same ways sir.*&quot;  When called out to provide evidence to support your baseless personal attack, you can only mention one thing - identification of shills.</p>

<p>This truly shows exactly what your largest concern is.  As has already been seen on this very sub many times over, the ONLY people who act overly concerned about shill identification here are the very same blatant disinfo fools who should be worried about being called out.  Those who brigade us.  Those who spend countless hours selectively screenshotting and logging the discussions that take place here, in an attept to falsely label us as racists or &quot;top minds.&quot; </p>

<p>Never <del>been</del> contributed* to that sub, nor have I screenshotted conversations here. I find that to be pretty droll. I&#39;ve actually been featured on <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a> from my main account, but that&#39;s a different story. *Edit: Oh I see, this has been stickied on that sub. I don&#39;t approve; I feel that is brigading on its face. And I didn&#39;t come here from there, again: I&#39;m a regular on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and came to this post completely organically. Deal with it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The shit couldn&#39;t be any more transparent</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By all means; show how I fulfill all those &#39;documented techniques&#39;. I&#39;ll give you the list, summarized. You&#39;ve got the full one if I missed anything.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Divide an conquer. Push emotional buttons. Use absolutes. Call the author names, appeal to prejudice. Put the author on the defensive.</strong></p>

<p>Every time you call someone a &#39;disinfo agent&#39; you&#39;re doing this. You&#39;re trying to get everyone to not trust their message, based solely on your say so that they are a &#39;disinfo agent&#39;. You do this every four or five posts (see your history). </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pretend it’s hopeless because we’ll be squashed if we try. Encourage apathy. &quot;We don&#39;t have a chance&quot;.</strong></p>

<p>You never offer any solutions. You only talk about how bad things are: your words follow. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Try never. Ever since 2008 (and sadly prior, but not on quite this level) the markets have NOT changed for the better. The only gains we&#39;ve seen were due to pumping endless amounts of zero percent interest fiat right into the corrupt to the core markets. Look into durable goods and precious metals as stored of wealth. Not worthless ledgers on the constant verge of complete and total implosion.
These fraudulent markets will never see so much as a copper and nickel &quot;dime&quot; from me ever again.</p>

<p>Yeah, the elite are laughing as they are push another worthless fiat &quot;currency&quot; on you that isn&#39;t even worth the electrons used to generate it. All so you don&#39;t transfer your soon to collapse ponzi scheme wealth into actual stores of wealth - precious metals and durable goods.
Remember: as soon as the power drops, all of your worthless BTCs disappear. And who has time to wait hours for your BiTchChump* blockchain transaction to authenticate? A to-cash withdrawal takes even longer. Days...
(Ed. emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Demand complete, fool-proof and guaranteed solutions to the problems being discussed.</strong> </p>

<p>You tend not to discuss solutions to problems being discussed at all, but rather just push how afraid people should be of them.</p>

<p>In most conspiracies I <em>do</em> believe, I&#39;d suggest we start with dismantling the CIA. That&#39;s just me though.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Suggest extreme, over-the-top, counter-productive solutions which will hurt more than help, or which are wholly disproportionate to what is being discussed.</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a very BAD sign. I hope my friends here are prepared. Food, water, shelter, protection, and tangible/tradeable durable goods. Plus precious metals and fiat cash, if* you&#39;re so inclined.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As has been documented time and time again, &#39;stocking up&#39; and &#39;preppers&#39; in general are just wasting their time money and stress. It&#39;s over-the-top, disproportionate, and counterproductive. See the 2012 apocalypse scare. Get back to me in a month when 9/23 falls through too. Edit: I am nearly certain, as well, that you yourself are not &#39;stocking up in preparation&#39;, and likely own zero precious metals in any form other than some jewelry. I&#39;d welcome your evidence of anything otherwise. Fact is it&#39;s easy to tell people to prep: this is part of fear mongering. Most who tell people to, don&#39;t do it <em>at all</em>. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pretend that alternative media – such as blogs written by the top experts in their fields, without any middleman – are untrustworthy or are motivated solely by money (for example, use the derogatory term “blogspam” for any blog posting, pretending that there is no original or insightful reporting, but that the person is simply doing it for ad revenue).</strong></p>

<p>I have a problem with this rule: It implies that the alternative media are never untrustworthy, and that the MSM is always untrustworthy. I&#39;d reference the rule against absolutes in #1, and a general distaste for absolutes. MSM doesn&#39;t tell the truth 100% of the time, I agree, but it&#39;s not 0% of the time either. Further, alternative media has been suspect much more often to me than not. I won&#39;t bother looking for your breaking these rules (I&#39;m sure it&#39;d just take finding one comment where you discount a blog because it is one), because again: I don&#39;t think this rule is fairly stated. The fact is that there <em>are</em> a lot of ad-revenue &#39;clickbait&#39; websites, and this rule pretends there are none. Bit of disinfo on the part of the author, in my opinion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Coordinate with a couple of others to “shout down” reasonable comments.</strong>  </p>

<p>If I could prove you do this, you&#39;d already be banned. </p>

<p>Same goes for you proving I do it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use an army of sock puppets.</strong> </p>

<p>See response to #6 above. Edit: Worth noting how many upvotes you get <em>almost immediately</em> while I get downvoted to -1 <em>almost immediately</em>. I&#39;ve admitted this is an alt; I referenced my &#39;main&#39; account earlier. I don&#39;t let the two participate in the same threads, and I try to keep them out of the same subreddits. They don&#39;t vote each other. You can report that to the admins and have them confirm it if you so choose. </p>

<p>You on the other hand, just ask us to take your word for it that you&#39;re not doing this yourself. Again, I&#39;m not accusing you, nor do I have evidence. I&#39;m simply pointing out my stance is a bit more open to questioning and evidencing than yours is.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Censor social media, so that the hardest-hitting information is buried. If you can’t censor it, set up “free speech zones” to push dissent into dank, dark corners where no one will see it.</strong></p>

<p>Irrelevant; we&#39;re not mods or admins and neither of us can censor anything here.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>When the powers-that-be cut corners and take criminally reckless gambles with our lives and our livelihoods, protect them by pretending that the inevitable result - nuclear accidents, financial crises,  terrorist attacks or other disasters – were “unforeseeable” and that “no could have known”.</strong></p>

<p>I don&#39;t do this and neither do you.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Protect the rich and powerful by labeling any allegations of criminal activity as being a “conspiracy theory”.</strong></p>

<p>I don&#39;t do this and neither do you. We both understand that conspiracy theory is not an inherently bad thing, and we both acknowledge that at least some &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; are likely true. Again, see my history for evidence of this. Also worth noting the rule as stated is quite the absolute again: It implies that anything calling itself a &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; is inherently true, which is again, not the case.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Become incredulous and indignant. Avoid discussing key issues and instead focus on side issues which can be used show the topic as being critical of some otherwise sacrosanct group or theme. This is also known as the “How dare you!” gambit.</strong></p>

<p>You do this. Every time you call responses &quot;transparent attempts&quot;. See this thread.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use a straw man. Find or create a seeming element of your opponent’s argument which you can easily knock down to make yourself look good and the opponent to look bad.</strong></p>

<p>When you refer to disagreement with the theory you&#39;re presenting as &#39;disinfo&#39;, this is the strawman being created. Suddenly I have to defend my motives, just for simply disagreeing with you. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hit and Run. In any public forum, make a brief attack of your opponent or the opponent position and then scamper off before an answer can be fielded, or simply ignore any answer.</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m going to reserve judgement here. *edit: You&#39;ve yet to respond. It&#39;s been approximately 2 hours since I&#39;ve posted this, and you&#39;ve responded elsewhere, and this has been downvoted at least once. </p>

<p>Still reserving judgement: afterall, this <em>is</em> a long post to counter. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Question motives. Twist or amplify any fact which could so taken to imply that the opponent operates out of a hidden personal agenda or other bias. This avoids discussing issues and forces the accuser on the defensive.</strong></p>

<p>You assert I&#39;m a shill and &#39;disinfo agent&#39;. This is exactly &quot;questioning motives&quot;. <em>Transparent</em>, even.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Associate opponent charges with old news. A derivative of the straw man usually, in any large-scale matter of high visibility, someone will make charges early on which can be or were already easily dealt with. Where it can be foreseen, have your own side raise a straw man issue and have it dealt with early on as part of the initial contingency plans.</strong> </p>

<p>You don&#39;t do this to my knowledge.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Okay. Now I&#39;ve shown how you are guilty of many (though not all) of these &#39;tactics&#39;. </p>

<p>Now evidence my own. I think it&#39;s fair that I ask, since you&#39;re here accusing me of doing these things. Go through my history, point it out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just more evidence in support of the lowlife tactics you feel the need to sink to.  Just to push your false narrative that we&#39;re crazy and conspiracies don&#39;t exist.  It&#39;s beautiful to see though that most of the members of this sub can see through it.</p>

<p>Where I come from, having a superior argument and providing more credible evidence is what it takes to win hearts and minds.  Petty insults and personal attacks are irrelevant to facts.  Truth never fears the bright light of scrutiny.</p>
