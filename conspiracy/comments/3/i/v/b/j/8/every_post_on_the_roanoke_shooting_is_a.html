       There is currently
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3iu4h5/revealing_roanoke_shooting_video_scrubbed_from/">
        one post
       </a>
       on the front page concerning the shooting and it's about 6 hours old and being aggressively downvoted but is holding up.
      </p>
      <p>
       That certain parties are determined that these posts don't get visibility or traction seems clear. I've also observed that many good comments attached to these posts also get aggressively downvoted to near invisibility. If you want to participate and/or follow discussion of the incident, most of the posts wind up in "Controversial". Also, clicking heavily downvoted comments to these posts can be revealing.

       I'm pretty sure they are being downvoted because the posts rely on misinformation, lies, and absolutely ridiculous claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shitty posts will always be downvoted, more at 11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:
      </p>
      <p>
       I went through the posts that are suppsoedbly being downvoted by a government downvote squad. Here's what I found:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         A post that claims because the United States legalized psy-ops against the American people in the NDAA, Roanoke must have been a psy-op. (Original claim is actually fabricated: All the NDAA did was remove restrictions preventing state-run media like Voice of America from being viewed in America).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A post that claims that because the reporter asked softball questions, the whole thing must have been staged.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A post claiming that because Obama attended a UN Arms Trade Treaty Conference on International Gun Control sometime before the shooting, the shooting itself must be a false-flag. (that treaty has nothing to do with guns
         <em>
          within the United States
         </em>
         and is mainly about international exports, plus the notion itself is logically invalid).
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Edit:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        This post has been downvoted!
       </strong>
       Guess the powers-that-be are censoring it. From 2 to -1 in 2 minutes... gosh downvote brigade stop being so obvious!

       Nah, it's just yet again another coincidence that ALL claimed staged terror attacks all share the same issues with those (allegedly) affected not behaving as normal, grieving people behave.  Smiles and laughs all around when your Mother, Brother, or Child perished violently a few hours ago.  It's just another coincidence.

       They aren't acting the way you think they should act, so it must be fake then. That's your best evidence? Good work detective.

       I didn't say that. I simply said you're a sheep and put "fake" after every major news story. You don't wait for evidence. You don't wait for it to fully play out. It is immediately fake to you. Even when evidence is presented to you it is fake. You don't think. You're a sheep on the skeptical side. As soon as the first YouTuber or blogger calls it fake you're right there circlejerking with them.

       Just like those who spend all their free time watching, reading, consuming, and researching everything related to One Direction.  Just so they can further waste even more time brigading the One Direction sub, telling the members there how idiotic they are, and how shitty One Direction's music is.

       As stated, transparent as fuck. It's fun to spot the low-IQ and entirely tactless entry level users who try to convince others that this stalkng/brigsding SJW behavior is somehow acceptable.

       at 2000+ points all day. So yeah: I think I sometimes overcome expectations by the general populace here. The mods can be asked directly about me if you like: I'm certain they have negative things to say, but the overall message will be that I'm a valuable part of this community. Trust me: they all know me by now. I've been reported and have reported plenty of times for them to know me, and I've engaged directly with at least two of them with regards to disagreeing theories.
      </p>

       I still never call someone who disagrees with me a shill. That's your default reaction though. Again: Look at your history, and just ask if you want me to summarize it for you and everyone here.

       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       "* in exactly the same ways sir.*"  When called out to provide evidence to support your baseless personal attack, you can only mention one thing - identification of shills.

       This truly shows exactly what your largest concern is.

         As has been documented time and time again, 'stocking up' and 'preppers' in general are just wasting their time money and stress. It's over-the-top, disproportionate, and counterproductive. See the 2012 apocalypse scare. Get back to me in a month when 9/23 falls through too. Edit: I am nearly certain, as well, that you yourself are not 'stocking up in preparation', and likely own zero precious metals in any form other than some jewelry. I'd welcome your evidence of anything otherwise. Fact is it's easy to tell people to prep: this is part of fear mongering. Most who tell people to, don't do it

          Pretend that alternative media – such as blogs written by the top experts in their fields, without any middleman – are untrustworthy or are motivated solely by money (for example, use the derogatory term “blogspam” for any blog posting, pretending that there is no original or insightful reporting, but that the person is simply doing it for ad revenue).

        </p>
        <p>
         I have a problem with this rule: It implies that the alternative media are never untrustworthy, and that the MSM is always untrustworthy. I'd reference the rule against absolutes in #1, and a general distaste for absolutes. MSM doesn't tell the truth 100% of the time, I agree, but it's not 0% of the time either. Further, alternative media has been suspect much more often to me than not. I won't bother looking for your breaking these rules (I'm sure it'd just take finding one comment where you discount a blog because it is one), because again: I don't think this rule is fairly stated. The fact is that there
         <em>
          are
         </em>
         a lot of ad-revenue 'clickbait' websites, and this rule pretends there are none. Bit of disinfo on the part of the author, in my opinion.

       Just more evidence in support of the lowlife tactics you feel the need to sink to.  Just to push your false narrative that we're crazy and conspiracies don't exist.  It's beautiful to see though that most of the members of this sub can see through it.

       Where I come from, having a superior argument and providing more credible evidence is what it takes to win hearts and minds.  Petty insults and personal attacks are irrelevant to facts.  Truth never fears the bright light of scrutiny.

       That''s incomprehensible. First, I suppose by "fools" you mean anyone that posts some story about the event. OK, got that.  Second, I fail to see how we "fools" made a celebrity out of "this disgusting murderer". How does that follow? I thought he pretty much did that on his own.
