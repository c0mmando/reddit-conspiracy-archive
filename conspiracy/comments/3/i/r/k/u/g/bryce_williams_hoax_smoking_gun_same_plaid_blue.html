        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>At 0:24-0:25 in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB5-7352MnI">this video</a> you can see the cameraman is wearing a plaid blue shirt. This is the same shirt that Bryce Williams is <a href="http://static3.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2338847.1440673328!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_400/bridgewater28n-4-web.jpg">wearing</a> when he is filming himself doing the shooting. </p>

<p>This same video is at the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3211529/WDBJ7-reporter-Alison-Parker-Adam-Ward-shot-live-TV-Moneta-gunman.html">daily mail</a> titled &quot;Virginia gunman Vester Flanagan in July road rage incident&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying this shooting is a hoax unless there is some reason in the official narrative that these people would wear the same shirt. Did Bryce Williams kill this guy, take his shirt, and then wear his shirt when doing the shooting? Or maybe this is just a sloppy fake news story? What are the chances the daily mail would happen to even have a video of Bryce Williams who talked to this guy in a plaid blue shirt back in July?</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t try to argue against this by saying something like. &quot;If they were going to fake it, they wouldn&#39;t make this mistake.&quot; By that logic, no amount of evidence would ever be satisfactory, any mistakes the perpetrators of a false flag or hoax make could be brushed off just by saying &quot;they&#39;re competent&quot; when in fact, they&#39;re not.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t merely a coincidence. I challenge you to look up plaid blue shirts and see if you can find this particular one. It is not a common shirt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m suggesting this is a staged media event. In a staged media event, you would have some of the same actors(possibly wearing the same wardrobe) staging things to build up a story line. Here, Bryce is seen following a guy in a &quot;July road rage incident&quot;. The cameraman is wearing the same shirt as &quot;Bryce&quot; when he does the shooting.</p>

<p>I would be willing to think that they could have shared a wardrobe if they were friends, but the title &quot;July road rage incident&quot; suggests to me that Bryce was following some random guy, and that the two are not supposed to know each other.</p>

<p>If anyone has any information about who filmed this and their relation to Bryce, that would be really helpful.</p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to understand here... When you say these people are actors, are you saying they once had different identities, and were hired to leave their lives behind and play the characters of news reporters and a camera man for years? What happens if their &quot;old&quot; family, friends or SOs were to see them on TV? Were they once reported missing?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have all the details, about what goes on in these events. Or how they recruit people.</p>

<p>B Foster&#39;s you tube account(and video) could have been made for this event and he may not even be a real person.</p>

<p>Bryce Williams could have been a patsy. They made BBC reporters delete videos of his crash. The videos may have proven that Bryce Williams didn&#39;t take his own life. Maybe he was entirely set up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;crisis actor&quot; theory is the exact opposite of witness protection. With crisis actors, you have people who live one life, disappear from that life to play a role as another for years, then are thrust into the public spotlight. They then continue to live the character&#39;s life (eg. Sandy Hook parents and extended families) or are fake-killed and <em>then</em> go into hiding. It&#39;s a very different concept than witness protection, and defies imagination on how anyone would think it would work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can agree with that.  </p>

<p>As far as Bryce Williams was concerned, he was at the end of his career.  So for him to disappear doesn&#39;t seem too far fetched.  </p>

<p>And in terms of the Parker and Ward, I&#39;m sure there is a price that they can be bought out at.   The Charleston families were paid $27 million in shut up money, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a price tag.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate how when there is an incident such as this shooting, within minutes this sub blows up with &quot;It&#39;s a conspiracy,  here&#39;s the (shitty) proof. We all know here that the government has done some false flag operations. That being said,  it doesn&#39;t mean every single disaster is one. It would be nice if before the sub was filled up with accusations there was some sort of actual evidence to support it.

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, that&#39;s not my type of thinking is at all.  I watch videos without prejudice, but when you title a report as Cold Blooded: Reporter Dies on Live Broadcast and that&#39;s not what happens, it&#39;s going to raise questions.  </p>

<p>The issue is no one died on camera, yeah there&#39;s deaths every single day with no burden of proof, but we&#39;re talking about a high profile killing that is going to possibly affect legislature. </p>

<p>The fact that an active shooter training drill was taking place less than 4 hours away should raise concern.  You know, the same one conveniently like the Charleston shooting.</p>

<p>If anything, I want to ask the questions no ones asking before it&#39;s too late.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The shirt deal is pretty weak. I live in SF and I have a shirt that has Albert Einstein smoking a pipe, and the smoke coming off the pipe is made to look like a galaxy. One day I shit you not, I ran into 2 different people wearing the same shirt that I was wearing that day. 
So the whole shirtgate is pretty weak.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say if you want to look at this for a conspiracy get your rocks off point of view, then you should focus on the Rental car.</p>

<ol>
<li>Who the fuck rents a car for a whole month?</li>
<li>He&#39;s got a rental car, and his own car, was the plan to drive what would eventually be reported as a stolen rental car?</li>
</ol>

<p>That part seems weird, but may not be conspiracy worthy. It may just be irrational thinking on the part oh a psychotic gay black man ready to murder people.</p>

<p>The people that are saying this is a hoax, also say that Sandy Hook is a hoax. Why would you have the brains/resources/abilities to pull off a hoax, but not enough sense to think that multiple children being murdered at school is going to move things a lot more than two dead reporters?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recently purchased a car, and the car dealer and I were wearing the same unusual Ben Sherman shirt. That brings my whole car purchase into question. Was the sale a hoax? Do the car dealer and I have a Narnia-like two-sided closet that opens into each other&#39;s houses? Am <em>I</em> a car?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The color is the same, but the plaid looks different. It&#39;s a pretty distinctive shirt though. What do you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We don&#39;t know for sure until somebody matches this to a known shirt design. If there was a shirt that matched both the sleeves and the chest area, then it would indicate that this could be the same shirt.</p>

<p>It&#39;s surprisingly difficult to find any shirt for sale online that looks similar to either of these.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not that it makes any difference, because I still can&#39;t imagine how two guys having similar shirts means anything, but those are two different patterns. One is a straight up windowpane plaid, and the other is more tartan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The patterns are different, but they are similar enough that they could come from the same shirt. Plenty of plaid shirts have slightly different patterns on the arms than the chest. It would help if someone could find something matching at least one of these shirts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It <em>doesn&#39;t</em> happen around the world daily. Obama said at the Charleston Church shooting “At some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries,”.</p>

<p>Of course, other countries don&#39;t have organizations like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Activities_Division">special activities division</a> of the CIA which wages  &quot;covert political influence, psychological operations and economic warfare&quot;. I&#39;m sure you know this already though.</p>

<p>Also, why would I want this to be a false flag?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say mass shootings happen every day, I said innocent people are murdered by kooks every day.</p>

<p>And you want it to be a false flag because you self-identify as a conspiracist. If you admit this one is real... maybe they all are? But if you keep asking questions about a shirt maybe, just maybe, you can push that inevitable realisation off.</p>

<p>Better not to think about that. Just keep assuming it&#39;s fake.:)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;crisis actor&quot; theory is the exact opposite of witness protection. With crisis actors, you have people who live one life, disappear from that life to play a role as another for years, then are thrust into the public spotlight. They then continue to live the character&#39;s life (eg. Sandy Hook parents and extended families) or are fake-killed and <em>then</em> go into hiding. It&#39;s a very different concept than witness protection, and defies imagination on how anyone would think it would work.</p>
