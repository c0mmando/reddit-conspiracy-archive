         says a lucky design choice saved lives. Most buildings would have come down immediately, but the towers remained upright for nearly an hour. Eventually raging fires melted the supporting steel struts, but the time delay allowed hundreds of people to escape. It's a good thing they didn't fall over. [

         circulates first drafts of a simple analysis of the likely scenario. Assuming a collapse time of ~9s, with the stated aim to prove that the towers must have collapsed and do so in the way seen, approximates that under most optimistic assumptions, the towers were doomed because the percentage of the kinetic energy dissipated plastically is of the order of 1%. The reason is the dynamic consequence of the prolonged heating of the steel columns to very high temperature. The heating caused creep buckling of the columns of the framed tube along the perimeter of the structure, which transmits the vertical load to the ground. Since the plastically dissipated energy W[p] is, optimistically, of the order of 0.5 GN m, and the total release of
gravitational potential energy is W[g] = mg 2h = 4.2 GN m, even under the most optimistic assumptions by far, the plastic
deformation can dissipate only a small part of the kinetic energy acquired by the upper part of building. ::

         , professor of civil and environmental engineering, saying the buildings were strong enough to survive the impact of the airplanes but collapsed as a result of the ensuing fire. The buildings were designed using a tube-in-tube structural arrangement, creating a system that is very stiff and strong and able to resist lateral loads such as wind or an earthquake. The towers survived the initial impact. But the large amount of jet fuel delivered to the towers followed by explosions and subsequent fire weakened the floor systems and the columns. He suspects the fire created temperatures higher than what is normally experienced in office building fires caused by burning furniture or rugs or paper. The building still had to carry the massive loads of higher floors above the plane crash location. The structural columns could no longer carry the gravity loads of the floors above the fire. In addition, the heat could have weakened the floor systems above, as well as the floor-to-column connections. This combination caused the top-down collapse, producing a domino effect. The exterior columns that formed the outside tube of the World Trade Center buildings guided the self-contained collapse within these buildings. It looked like a designed and time-delayed implosion that took only a few seconds to bring each tower down. If there had been no fire, potentially the buildings could have survived. [

         says that the World Trade Center was probably one of the more resistant tall building structures. The buildings displayed a tremendous capacity to stand there despite the damage to a major portion of the gravity system. The lateral truss systems redistributed the load when other critical members were lost. It's a testament to the system that they lasted so long. According to him, the planes hit at just the right place. The truck bomb attack showed that the explosion at the bottom had little effect and that it's much easier to collapse a building from the top than the bottom. If they had hit the very top of the building, the fire damage wouldn't have had such a catastrophic effect. At the bottom, the columns are much heavier and stronger and so they would have taken a much larger load. ::
         <em>
          Eduardo Kausel
         </em>
         , M.I.T. professor of civil and environmental engineering, says the World Trade Center was never designed for the massive explosions nor the intense jet fuel fires that came next — a key design omission. Kausel says the towers performed admirably; they stood long enough for the majority of the people to be successfully evacuated. He approximates that about 30 percent of the collapse energy was expended rupturing the materials of the building, while the rest was converted into the kinetic energy of the falling mass, concluding that the the largest share of the kinetic energy was converted to heat, material rupture and deformation of the ground below. He goes on to explain that the intense heat softened or melted the structural elements—floor trusses and columns—so that they became like chewing gum, and that was enough to trigger the collapse. The floor trusses are likely to have been the first to sag and fail. As soon as the upper floors became unsupported, debris from the failed floor systems rained down onto the floors below, which eventually gave way, starting an unstoppable sequence. The dynamic forces are so large that the downward motion becomes unstoppable. He determines that the fall of the upper building portion down onto a single floor must have caused dynamic forces exceeding the buildings’ design loads by at least an order of magnitude and performed computer simulations indicating the building material fell almost unrestricted at nearly the speed of free-falling objects. According to his hypothesis, the towers' resistive systems played no role. Otherwise the elapsed time of the fall would have been extended. Asked why the top did not tip over, he answers: "A tree is solid, whereas building is mostly air or empty space; only about 10 percent is solid material. Since there is no solid stump underneath to force it to the side, the building cannot tip over. It could only collapse upon itself." :: Unnamed, but well-informed correspondents are quoted with the suggestion that the aviation fuel fires burned sufficiently hot to melt and ignite the airliners' aluminum airframe structures. Aluminum, a pyrophoric metal, could have added to the conflagrations. Hot molten aluminum could have seeped down into the floor systems, doing significant damage.  [

Dr. Astaneh-Asl’s presentation includes a movie of a simulated crash of a passenger aircraft onto a generic steel structure created with MSC.Dytran and MSC.Marc Nonlinear Software. While the impact of the crash substantially weakened the structure, "the remaining steel beams and columns melted because of the extreme temperatures. Also buckling in the trusses was possible, especially after the damaged crossbeams were unable to provide lateral support. As a result, the load could no longer be distributed and the building collapsed." [

         publishes the "World Trade Center Building Performance Study" and finds that the structure was able to successfully redistribute the building weight after the plane impacts to the remaining elements and to maintain a stable condition, and that  the structure may have been able to remain standing in this weakened condition for an indefinite period. However, fires heated floor framing and slabs, causing expansion, which developed additional large stresses in some members. As the temperature of column steel increased, the yield strength and modulus of elasticity degraded and the critical buckling strength of the columns decreased and initiated buckling, a significant effect in the failure of the interior core columns. Once collapse initiated, much of the potential energy was rapidly converted into kinetic energy. As the large mass of the collapsing floors above accelerated and impacted on the floors below, it caused an immediate progressive series of floor failures, punching each in turn onto the floor below, accelerating as the sequence progressed in a pancake-type collapse of successive floors.

Structural damage from this impact, and the searing heat of blazing aviation fuel, then combined to bring down the top 20 floors. The accumulating weight caused both buildings to collapse, floor by floor, faster and faster. If they had struck right at the top of the tower that would have had a greater effect on the foundations, but the fire would have been more contained. However, they struck in both cases at an extremely vulnerable point. ::

         in "World Trade Center Collapse, Field Investigations and Analyses" opines that the highly redundant exterior tube of the World Trade Center with many closely spaced columns was able to tolerate the loss of many columns and support the gravity while almost all occupants who could use a stairway escaped to safety. The collapse of the towers was most likely due to the intense fire initiated by the jet fuel of the planes and continued due to burning of the building contents. It is also the opinion of the author that had there been better fireproofing installed to delay the steel structure, specially the light weight truss joists and exterior columns from reaching high temperature until the content of the buildings burned out, probably the collapse could be avoided and the victims above the impact area rescued.

         explains that the airplane fuel and the fire-suppression system caused the building to collapse. The fire-suppression system blocks off five-floor blocks so the fire can’t go up or down. The steel in that five-floor area melts. All the tonnage above the five-floor area comes straight down when the steel melts. That broke all the connections, and that caused the building to collapse.

         :: With the specific objective (p. xxxix) to determine why and how WTC 1 and WTC 2 collapsed following the initial impacts of the aircraft,
         <em>
          NIST
         </em>
         in the "Federal Building and Fire Safety Investigation of the World Trade Center Disaster: Final Report of the National Construction Safety Team on the Collapses of the World Trade Center Tower" examine more than 170 areas on 16 perimeter column panels, but only three columns have evidence that the steel reached temperatures above 250ºC. Only two core column specimens have sufficient paint remaining to make such an analysis, and their temperatures did not reach 250 ºC. Using metallographic analysis, NIST determine that there was no evidence that any of the samples had reached temperatures above 600 ºC (pp. 176-177). In state-of-the-art computer simulations, none of the columns with intact insulation reached temperatures over 300 °C. Only a few isolated truss members with intact insulation were heated to temperatures over 400 °C in the WTC 1 simulations and to temperatures over 500 °C in the WTC 2 simulations. In WTC 1, if the fires had been allowed to continue past the time of building collapse, complete burnout would likely have occurred within a short time since the fires had already traversed around the entire floor, and most of the combustibles would already have been consumed. In WTC 2, if the fire simulation were extended for 2 hours past the time of building collapse with all windows broken, the temperatures in the truss steel on the west side of the building (where the insulation was undamaged) would likely have increased for about 40 min before falling off rapidly as the combustibles were consumed. Temperatures of 700 °C to 760 °C were reached over approximately 15 percent of the west floor area for less than 10 min. Approximately 60 percent of the floor steel had temperatures between 600 °C and 700 °C for about 15 min. Approximately 70 percent of the floor steel had temperatures that exceeded 500 °C for about 45 min. At these temperatures, the floors would be expected to sag and then recover a portion of the sag as the steel began to cool. The temperatures of the insulated exterior and core columns would not have increased to the point where they would have experienced significant loss of strength or stiffness. (p. 184) NIST finds the towers withstood the impacts and would have remained standing were it not for the dislodged insulation and the subsequent multi-floor fires. (p. 174). The focus of the investigation however is on the sequence of events from the instant of aircraft impact to the initiation of collapse for each tower. For brevity in the report, this sequence is referred to as the ‘probable collapse sequence,’ although it (includes little analysis of | does not actually include) the structural behaviour of the tower after the conditions for collapse initiation were reached and collapse became inevitable.

and Applied Mechanics, Boulder, Colorado, present "Mechanics of Progressive Collapse: Learning from World Trade Center and Building Demolitions". The destruction of the Towers was not only the largest mass murder in U.S. history, but also a big surprise for the structural engineering profession. No experienced structural engineer watching the attack expected the WTC towers to collapse. No skyscraper has ever before collapsed due to fire. The fact that the WTC towers did, beckons deep examination. Further calculations beyond the 2002 "Simple Analysis" are found superfluous, but a theory describing the progressive collapse dynamics beyond the initial trigger, with the WTC as a paradigm, could still be very useful for other purposes, especially for learning from demolitions. They go on to show that progressive collapse will be triggered if the total (internal) energy loss during the crushing of one story (equal to the energy dissipated by the complete crushing and compaction of one story, minus the loss of gravity potential during the crushing of that story) exceeds the kinetic energy impacted to that story. Regardless of the load capacity of the columns, there is no way to deny the inevitability of progressive collapse driven by gravity alone. Also, some critics are addressed, who have been under the mistaken impression that collapse cannot occur if (because of safety factors used in design) the weight
         <em>
          mg
         </em>
         of the upper part is less than the load capacity
         <em>
          F[0]
         </em>
         of the floor, which led them to postulate various strange ideas (such as “fracture wave” and planted explosives). However, since the energy loss up to the point at which the load-deflection diagram intersects the line
         <em>
          F=mg(z)
         </em>
         is smaller than the kinetic energy of the impacting mass
         <em>
          m(z)
         </em>
         (Fig. 3), it is clear that this impression is erroneous. What matters is energy, not strength, nor stiffness. ::

It is shown that the observed size range (0.01 mm—0.1 mm) of the dust particles of pulverized concrete is consistent with the theory of comminution caused by impact, and that less than 10% of the total gravitational energy, converted to kinetic energy, sufficed to produce this dust — whereas more than 150 tons of TNT per tower would have to be installed to produce the same pulverization. Also, initial speculation that very high temperatures were necessary to explain collapse are revised based on NISTs findings, since steel temperature ≥150°C sufficed to trigger the viscoplastic buckling of columns. To get convinced of the inevitability of gravity driven progressive collapse, further analysis is, for a structural engineer, superfluous, but nevertheless needed to dispel false myths. It is no surprise at all that the towers collapsed essentially on their
footprint. Gravity alone must have caused just that. [

         state that the WTC towers collapsed because: (1) the impact of the planes severed and damaged support columns, dislodged fireproofing insulation coating the steel floor trusses and steel columns, and widely dispersed jet fuel over multiple floors; and (2) the subsequent unusually large number of jet-fuel ignited multi-floor fires (which reached temperatures as high as 1,000 degrees Celsius) significantly weakened the floors and columns with dislodged fireproofing to the point where floors sagged and pulled inward on the perimeter columns. This led to the inward bowing of the perimeter columns and failure of the south face of WTC 1 and the east face of WTC 2, initiating the collapse of each of the towers. Both photographic and video evidence — as well as accounts from the New York City Police Department aviation unit during a half-hour period prior to collapse — support this sequence for each tower. NIST’s findings do not support the “pancake theory” of collapse, which is premised on a progressive failure of the floor systems in the WTC towers. Instead, the NIST investigation showed conclusively that the failure of the inwardly bowed perimeter columns initiated collapse and that the occurrence of this inward bowing required the sagging floors to remain connected to the columns and pull the columns inwards. Thus, the floors did not fail progressively to cause a pancaking phenomenon. [

          NIST FAQ
         </em>
         for WTC 7 clarify that progressive collapse did NOT occur in the WTC towers. First, the collapse of each tower was not triggered by local damage or a single initiating event. Second, the structures were able to redistribute loads from the impact and fire-damaged structural components and subsystems to undamaged components and to keep the building standing until a sudden, global collapse occurred. Had a hat truss that connected the core columns to the exterior frame not been installed to support a TV antenna atop each WTC tower after the structure had been fully designed, it is likely that the core of the WTC towers would have collapsed sooner, triggering a global collapse. Such a collapse would have some features similar to that of a progressive collapse. The Twins were brought on by multiple factors, including structural damage caused by the aircraft impact, extensive dislodgement of the sprayed fire-resistive materials or fireproofing in the impacted region, and a weakening of the steel structures created by the fires.

         explains that progressive collapse can't be stopped because, even though the lower undamaged structure was designed to be able to handle the upper damaged 18 stories, this is only true in a static sense. Once the loads became dynamic (due to gravity), the dynamic loads had already far exceeded the structural design limit and the failure had to propagate until all the energy is dissipated. This is true for nearly every structure in existence, and certainly true for every skyscraper: once progressive collapse begins, it can't be stopped because the supporting structure below cannot handle the many multiplications of the load it was designed to support. It's erroneous to think of a skyscraper as a solid column of material that's able to stop falling objects. In reality a skyscraper is more like a skeletal structure with thousands of interconnected supporting members. The loss of too many members/supports will cause failure. A giant mass falling through the center of the skeleton will only knock more of the structure away, further propagating the collapse. [

       Depends on the expert you ask, and when you ask, and on your interpretation of "melt", obviously. But yes, steel temperatures ≥150°C suffice to trigger viscoplastic buckling of columns. See source 19.

       Ranting about AE911 like it's the truth movement or something. "If I can drive this nail in it'll put an end to this nonsense" Think leaky dam and AE911 as one of the fist sized holes.
