    <div class="md"><p>I never really visit r/conspiracy, and there is a lot of BS out there regardless. Though you&#39;re wrong about one thing and that&#39;s that there are a lot of submission/comments that I saw the past 10 minutes of looking in the sub asking serious questions about the shooting that raise genuinely good points, and they were downvoted like crazy.</p>

<p>I personally do believe it was staged, but I&#39;m not questioning the fact that she ran away or the shirt or the paleness of his hands because that can be logically explained.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, I want to say I&#39;m not discrediting those who brought up those &quot;primary talking points&quot;. They&#39;re normal logical questions to ask. A lot of people don&#39;t know about videography/white balancing. Or that people can run after getting shot. And that a knee brace can be confused for a mike holster. (isn&#39;t main point but i keep seeing it) </p>

<p>That said, I personally believe it is fake based on these details:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The father and boyfriend of the reporter have not shed a single tear nor are they grieving in any humanly natural way. That by itself isn&#39;t definitive though it&#39;s definitely a red flag. But it is taken a step further by both father and boyfriend pushing agendas <em>very</em> strongly (enough so that forethought was put into preemptive objections, saying very similar lines, etc) just hours after she was murdered. On top of this is their unnatural way of speaking and microexpressions indicative of acting. Not quite as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTSpvuXfn2A">blatant as this</a>, but still bizarre. True everyone grieves differently, but it&#39;s funny how all the staged events have similar tearless, odd behavior with agendas.</p></li>
<li><p>The gun is typical for hollywood, live Glock blank with muzzle flash. Recoil is easy to imitate, though there actually is some recoil with muzzle flash prop guns.</p></li>
<li><p>I originally was taken back by the lack of blood, though it <em>is</em> possible there were no exit wounds or grazings which may show little blood. Still odd that there is not a pool of blood anywhere after the shooting took place.</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of peripheral vision. Sure there is a <em>very</em> slim chance they were so focused they didn&#39;t see him 4 ft next to them, or the gun waving in front of them, but there is no excuse for the point where the reporter looks directly at the gunman while he&#39;s holding the gun in front of him.</p></li>
<li><p>Cops intimidated bbc reporters into deleting footage at the car scene. Why would they do this?</p></li>
<li><p>Typical manifesto and tieback to previous staged shootings.</p></li>
<li><p>The gunman used a GoPro and was zooming in and out, which is not something you can do with a GoPro.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>A few other things that I will update later.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to offer some counter points </p>

<p>How do you know this was a gopro?  The only place I&#39;ve seen that mentioned are in about 2 points where people always mention blanks as well. No where else have I even seen gopro being mentioned. </p>

<p>Have you ever had a family member die? Do* you sob for days 24/7 or do you have a few fits if crying and mourn the rest of the time?  When I&#39;ve heard bad news I have cried in front of loved ones. But guess what? When I have to go somewhere I wipe the tears away and I stop crying. No one knows that I&#39;ve just heard some awful news or have been crying 10 mins ago. The parents were on TV and maintained a level of composure. </p>

<p>There are plenty of videos on the Internet that show people getting shot and yet no visible entry wounds, blood splatter or pooling. You can review my comments if you&#39;d like. I posted a few yesterday to try to prove to debunkers that these things do happen.  </p>

<p>There are also pictures floating around where there is blood pooled on the deck below. Albeit after the shooting and not while it was going on but the pictures are there. I can dig it up if you haven&#39;t seen them yet. </p>

<p>Also you&#39;ll never see the video of the reporter looking at him with a gun waving. She did look off to the side and may have saw him but he was not waving a gun around at that point. And if he was I just ask that you screen cap it for us please. It&#39;s simply not true. </p>

<p>Police recovered the GoPro from the car. It&#39;s in a ton of articles in major news sources (I even read it on CNN), you simply need to google it.</p>

<p>And yes, I have had a family member die. And yes it is unnatural to show little to no signs of grieving less than 24 hours after their death. That tied in with their bizzare microexpressions, manner of speaking <em>and</em> their agenda pushing. Yes, it is altogether very bizarre, and a huge red flag. If you say this is how you&#39;d act the day someone you love died at the hand of a murderer then I would also find that extremely unnatural.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I never said he was waiving it while she was looking. (the waving I was referring to was while he held it up next to them waving it before he shot). The gun was right in front of him (not held out though) when she did look. Even if you take the gun out of the equation it&#39;s extremely unlikely for someone to not be alarmed by the presence of that type of threatening person known from their past showing up unexpectedly less than 4 feet from them. Remember, this is the same man that she knew made threats in the past and was fired for unstable conduct as well as being police escorted out of their building.</p>

<p>No I haven&#39;t seen photos of pooled blood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>here&#39;s a pic of the pooled blood btw.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/g6Ejg6t.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/g6Ejg6t.jpg</a></p>

<p>as far as the gopro.  ok maybe police recovered one from the car.  i&#39;m sure they found some old mcdonalds fries and some paper work as well.  it really doesn&#39;t mean anything.  the dude posted the video to his social media accounts.  it takes seconds.  the only somewhat reputable site i&#39;ve been able to see anything about a gorpo is slate where they say they found a gopro like device. i wasn&#39;t able to find it on cnn.</p>

<p>as far as their family goes you saw them for about 10 minutes max.  you have no clue how they grieved before or after.  some of my experiences have even taken a few hours/days to settle in before i&#39;m truly impacted by any mourning. </p>

<p>i&#39;d also like evidence that he really was 4 feet away.  in the videos you see him zoom in and out and partially back in.  i was under the impression that you can&#39;t do that with a gopro but rather in the editting software.  i don&#39;t have one so i don&#39;t really know.  but which is it?  i know i can zoom with my camera phone but the whole gopro thing sounds ridiculous.  he wasn&#39;t 4ft awawy.  the camera man was probably 4ft away from the reporter/interviewee while the shooter was a few feet behind him.  </p>

<p>have you ever been startled by someone who is right in front of you?  they&#39;re in your periphery but you just don&#39;t notice them.  then all of a sudden you pay more attention and you jump.  just because he was around really doesn&#39;t mean they noticed who he was.  not to mention is was during a live interview and she had to stay professional. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe after shootings that make the national news they could arrange for a public display of the dead, that way people can examine the corpses to verify they really are, in fact, dead. That might be helpful. Just set up the corpses for a day or two in a public library or at a fairground so people can come see them.</p>

<p>Though in that case, what&#39;s to stop them from using someone <em>else&#39;s</em> body and just changing the face with plastic surgery?</p>

<p>We&#39;d at least need to see an autopsy to know for sure they weren&#39;t using drugs to put them in a death-like state.</p>

<p>It may seem like video of a shooting and grieving colleagues and families and all the rest would be good proof that someone actually died, but unless they start broadcasting autopsies you have to question everything you see.</p>

<p>Of course, with makeup and special effects we should probably question the autopsies, too. They are probably very easy to fake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because most of the &quot;evidence&quot; for it being a hoax is nothing more than few thickheads complaining that the real shooting doesn&#39;t look anything like what they saw in Pulp Fiction or Expendables. </p>

<p>It&#39;s good to question authority and MSM.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not good when the questioning and &quot;evidence&quot; boils down to noticing some minor inconsistencies or noticing differences in reality and your Holywood-created expectations. </p>

<p>When you hear hoofbeats, don&#39;t think zebras. When you notice some inconsistencies, don&#39;t think conspiracy. More likely explanation is that you don&#39;t have all the info, that you don&#39;t have the knowledge and the experience to adequately evaluate the evidence you have, or that you are just simply too stupid to figure it out. Those are much more likely explanations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it&#39;s obviously a hoax.  I&#39;ve been suffering mass downvotes while addressing this and have lost easily over 100 karma.  Also been getting spammed by people telling me I&#39;m crazy etc.  One guy even told me I&#39;m so batshit that he thinks I&#39;m likely to go kill people - all because I was looking at facts and pictures and video.  People actually come to conspiracy looking for information on things like this when they happen, so the shills come out and muddy the waters and disrupt conversations to make it seem like there&#39;s no consensus that&#39;s been reached.  But this one was too obviously fake.  Remember, they&#39;re not out convince us, they&#39;re out to discredit us and to make these issues seem ridiculous.  When you start to get targetted, you know you&#39;re on point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely agree - I actually broke one of my own rules and posted about this on my facebook (because it seemed so cut and dry) and was met with absolute horror.  WHAT ABOUT THE FAMILIES etc.  I&#39;ve managed to convinced a bunch of people just by asking them to look at the pictures and video, but you&#39;re not going to get through to everyone.  Even the people that think you&#39;re a little wacko for bringing it up might not listen to you on this one, but next time something suspicious happens they might be more likely to look into it.  It&#39;s a long process, trying to get people to think for themselves and trust their senses - and all you can do is be patient and supportive and stick to the evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah pretty much any person i&#39;ve offered counter points to on how this is real never even bothered responding.  just went to another thread to scream more about how there isn&#39;t any blood splatter or shell casings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, I want to say I&#39;m not discrediting those who brought up those &quot;primary talking points&quot;. They&#39;re normal logical questions to ask. A lot of people don&#39;t know about videography/white balancing. Or that people can run after getting shot. And that a knee brace can be confused for a mike holster. (isn&#39;t main point but i keep seeing it) </p>

<p>That said, I personally believe it is fake based on these details:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The father and boyfriend of the reporter have not shed a single tear nor are they grieving in any humanly natural way. That by itself isn&#39;t definitive though it&#39;s definitely a red flag. But it is taken a step further by both father and boyfriend pushing agendas <em>very</em> strongly (enough so that forethought was put into preemptive objections, saying very similar lines, etc) just hours after she was murdered. On top of this is their unnatural way of speaking and microexpressions indicative of acting. Not quite as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTSpvuXfn2A">blatant as this</a>, but still bizarre. True everyone grieves differently, but it&#39;s funny how all the staged events have similar tearless, odd behavior with agendas.</p></li>
<li><p>The gun is typical for hollywood, live Glock blank with muzzle flash. Recoil is easy to imitate, though there actually is some recoil with muzzle flash prop guns.</p></li>
<li><p>I originally was taken back by the lack of blood, though it <em>is</em> possible there were no exit wounds or grazings which may show little blood. Still odd that there is not a pool of blood anywhere after the shooting took place.</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of peripheral vision. Sure there is a <em>very</em> slim chance they were so focused they didn&#39;t see him 4 ft next to them, or the gun waving in front of them, but there is no excuse for the point where the reporter looks directly at the gunman while he&#39;s holding the gun in front of him.</p></li>
<li><p>Cops intimidated bbc reporters into deleting footage at the car scene. Why would they do this?</p></li>
<li><p>Typical manifesto and tieback to previous staged shootings.</p></li>
<li><p>The gunman used a GoPro and was zooming in and out, which is not something you can do with a GoPro.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>A few other things that I will update later.</p>
