       It doesn't matter because that's not the point. I bet none of them believe in lizard people or flat earth but they let the post stay because someone does.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some do have personal views and they comment on some threads. That's important for them to do so. To call their integrity into question which is what you are doing in a round about way is baiting.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are fair for the most part. I say it like that cause some have been accused of things that I haven't investigated myself. So always a change they are dicks. I haven't seen it.

       No,

      <p>
       I think 9-11 was a Saudi Arabian job, they may have had a few insiders well connected to the oil industry or the bush family but there wasn't an official government operation to take out the twin towers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope this answers your question sufficiently, if there are any other theories you would like to ask me about I would be happy to share my personal opinions of those theories as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think its important that we differentiate
       <a href="/r/911truth">
        /r/911truth
       </a>
       from
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .  For example there are some very vocal members of /911truth who think that Judy Woods is some sort of disinformation agent, which she may or may not be, and they have adopted official positions on which 911 theories are allowed and which ones (like judy woods) are not allowed.
      </p>
      <p>
       /conspiracy doesn't take any official position on any theories, that's for our individual users to do for themselves.  Judy woods theories are welcome here as well as the no plane theories and well as the controlled demolition theories and what ever other theories people want to speculate about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody here, including the mods, are required to pass any hocus pocus litmus tests to make sure they are in alignment with some official conspiracy theorist manifesto that doesn't actually exist.  We are all individuals and as long as you can follow the rules here than you are welcome to post.

       That was a joke, right?

      <p>
       NIST proves you're wrong (read: cover story for controlled demolitions of 3 buildings hit with 2 planes).
      </p>
      <p>
       The video evidence of explosions down both twin towers, not to mention Newton's laws of motion ceased to exist for one day.

      <p>
       So does the BBC reporter (read: media foreknowledge).

      <p>
       So does the stand down of the secret service in Florida (read: government foreknowledge)

       There's many more reasons why everyone in this sub is uncomfortable with you (as a vocal user in this sub without knowledge of conspiracy events, not as a mod).

       Your answer to the question of 911 is my main reason.

       Simple question; were WTC1, WTC2, and WTC7 brought down by unique controlled demolition, as opposed to any official theories? it seems you're confusing the "who made it happen" with the "what happened."

        a mod decides to put on an AMA

       with the most notable 911 truth advocate in existence

        (Richard Gage of AE911Truth)
       </a>
       , they better well know their subject's subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise it's just another disinformation campaign against the 911 truth movement.
      </p>

       How about asking

        /u/dishonestcartooNIST

       and I to vet the next 911 advocate? What, most advocates won't touch reddit.com anymore? Huh, someone's mission was accomplished.

       So, please answer the question I've asked twice, as you seem to hate answering any questions, although you'd make a 3 hour video answering questions, right?

       Someone I know spoke with Richard Gage, Abby Martin, and Ben Swann.  They
       <em>
        specifically
       </em>
       mentioned the fake AMA as the reason that they will never associate with the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       Subreddit or even Reddit in general. The worst part is, it is not just because of this irresponsible moderator behavior of the course of the last year or two, but equally because of the suspicious behavior in regards to the same mods always involved with Hitler/Holocaust debacles.
      </p>
      <p>
       This Subreddit lost all credibility and every moderator should be replaced.

       So people who know intimately that disinformation and trolls run rampant around these subject have the lack of foresight to consider that /conspiracy may have also been the victim of a clever imposter, which is what actually happened, so they refuse to have anything to do with reddit because we got trolled.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's fucking retarded and if they are that snooty than I don't even want them to do an AMA here. I have had enough of snooty people claiming ultimate authority over information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here they have a chance to set the record straight, but instead they are going act like children. They could do an AMA and own the day but... nope they are going to abstain because some people here want to talk about the Holocaust.
      </p>
      <p>
       They can go to hell for all I care.  Who fucking cares.  /conspiracy fucking swarmed Ben swann with views and support (myself included) so now if he wants to disown us then that's his fucking problem.  I'll uninstall his app and he can sit on a fucking hand grenade for all I care.
