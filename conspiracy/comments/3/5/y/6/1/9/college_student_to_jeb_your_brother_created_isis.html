        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>RENO, Nev. — “Your brother created ISIS,” the young woman told Jeb Bush. And with that, Ivy Ziedrich, a 19-year-old college student, created the kind of confrontational moment here on Wednesday morning that presidential candidates dread.</p>

<p>Mr. Bush, the former governor of Florida, had just concluded a town-hall-style meeting when Ms. Ziedrich demanded to be heard. “Governor Bush,” she shouted as audience members asked him for his autograph. “Would you take a student question?”</p>

<p>Mr. Bush whirled around and looked at Ms. Ziedrich, who identified herself as a political science major and a college Democrat at the University of Nevada.</p>

<p>She had heard Mr. Bush argue, a few moments before, that America’s retreat from the Middle East under President Obama had contributed to the growing power of the Islamic State. She told the former governor that he was wrong, and made the case that blame lay with the decision by the administration of his brother George W. Bush to disband the Iraqi Army.</p>

<p>“It was when 30,000 individuals who were part of the Iraqi military were forced out — they had no employment, they had no income, and they were left with access to all of the same arms and weapons,” Ms. Ziedrich said.</p>

<p>She added: “Your brother created ISIS.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bush interjected. “All right. Is that a question?”</p>

<p>Ms. Ziedrich was not finished. “You don’t need to be pedantic to me, sir.”</p>

<p>“Pedantic? Wow,” Mr. Bush replied.</p>

<p>Then Ms. Ziedrich asked: “Why are you saying that ISIS was created by us not having a presence in the Middle East when it’s pointless wars where we send young American men to die for the idea of American exceptionalism? Why are you spouting nationalist rhetoric to get us involved in more wars?”</p>

<p>Mr. Bush replied: “We respectfully disagree. We have a disagreement. When we left Iraq, security had been arranged, Al Qaeda had been taken out. There was a fragile system that could have been brought up to eliminate the sectarian violence.”</p>

<p>He added: “And we had an agreement that the president could have signed that would have kept 10,000 troops, less than we have in Korea, could have created the stability that would have allowed for Iraq to progress. The result was the opposite occurred. Immediately, that void was filled.”</p>

<p>He concluded: “Look, you can rewrite history all you want. But the simple fact is that we are in a much more unstable place because American pulled back.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bush turned away. The conversation was over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s actually a pretty ignorant statement. Hillary actually helped create ISIS. His brother might have helped create the conditions for the rise of ISIS, but the United States, Israel, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia, openly support and arm ISIS. ISIS pretty much came out of Libya, and they&#39;ve become a snowballing power since they got a hold of thousands of anti-aircraft missiles there during Benghazi.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>In 2003, when the United States went and bombed Iraq in the &quot;shock and awe&quot; campaign, it opened the door for various al-Qaeda people to come in and join the insurgency, including Mr. al-Zarqawi, who came from Jordan, formed al-Qaeda of Iraq, created mayhem, introduced a very virulent form of sectarianism, and of course beheadings and suchlike. And it&#39;s out of al-Qaeda of Iraq that the Islamic State of Iraq was born. When the conflict opened up in Syria, they expanded their name to the Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria. So this organization is a product of the Iraq War.</p>

<p>Interesting but that doesn&#39;t mean the technology exists. </p>

<p>You link to William Cohen giving a statement about the anthrax attack in Washington, which turned out not to be anthrax. He mentions an acclaimed futurologist and quotes him. I managed to find the actual quote from Tofflers&#39; &quot;War and Anti-War&quot;. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>These acts [Saddam Hussein burning oil fields] are primitive compared with some of the imaginable (and imagined) possibilites of sophisticated ecological weaponry. For example, triggering earthquakes or volcano eruptions at a distance by generating certain electromagnetic waves; deflecting wind currents; sending in a vector of genetically altered insects to devastate a selected crop; using lasers to cut a custom-tailored hole in the ozone layer over an adversary&#39;s land; and even modifying weather.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now to me, you have a defense Secretary talking about false threats, and even the fear of terrorism being a danger and he quotes examples of imagined fears as listed by Toffler. It sounds to me like Mr Cohen was just looking after his budget. Perhaps you could expand on what you believe? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While it was once fun to see these psychos &quot;gotcha&#39;d,&quot; there&#39;s nothing in it, ultimately, but distraction.</p>

<p>She doesn&#39;t know what pedantic means, allowing him to show that he doesn&#39;t either. The rest is somewhat facile and seems based in false premises.</p>
