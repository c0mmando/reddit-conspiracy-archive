       I work 55 to 60 hours a week, ten hours a day, and i barely make 19,000 a year before taxes, not to mention bills. I'm tired of being a slave to a society that is blind to the truths. We're all robots. Born to follow orders, and rely on the government to put food on the table. We live in a day where not only is the slave trade alive and well in our country, but also thriving. Our youth gets arrested and criminalized for petty reasons. Sometimes without a crime committed. The fact that our government killed thousands of innocent people on our own soil should be the boiling point. Yet nobody cares. So I ask all of you. How do you cope? I'm yet to even hit 20, and every day is a struggle to survive to the next. I'm tired of waking up, and working like a dog, only to be beaten (not literally) for my mistakes. It makes me sick to live in such a hate filled world. This isn't how we make progress as a race of humans. Living this way is how we regress into the monsters we once were. Sorry for the rant. I've just had it with sitting idly by, and having no way to fight back.

       You're partially wrong. Almost every entry level job has older people. A tacobell down the street has 3-4 people who are in their 50-60's. Times have changed. Look around dude, open your eyes. The economy is nothing but bullshit service jobs. I drive down the street all I see is gas station,target,walmart,Grocery stores, a million retail stores,Fast food and any other pointless service you can think of. My uncle walked into a fire department in the 90's asked if they were hiring and they hired him on the spot. His last year he made 300k with overtime because the city would rather them work over time than hire someone new. Four years that same department got 10k+ applications for 1 opening. That is the state of the economic system we live in.

       Nope. OP is nineteen years old. His situation is
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       called 'being a teenager in an entry level job.' Nothing "partially wrong" about the answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scroll through some of the other comments in this thread. You will find ample opportunity to call folks out for being "partially wrong", and even 'completely wrong'.

       I'm a teenager working an entry level job. It actually would be pretty easy for me to move up, if I wasn't going to college within a year I could very easily become an assistant manager. Or, I could jump ship and get a job as an electrician, or plumber. It's not very hard to get a job that pays more than minimum wage.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's not exactly the state of the economy now. I see almost everyone who gets hired or interviewed for the place I work at. Almost everyone working except for three people are under 21, we hire about three or four new high school kids every month and usually they all leave once they decide they don't like the job, or don't even show up to their interview, or don't show up to work even after they've been hired.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want to get paid more? Go to community college and work part time. You could knock out a light load of classes over three semesters a year, do that for two years and you'll have lots of more job opportunities. Community college isn't hard, and it isn't expensive. Some loans from the government, banks and family can easily pay for your education, from there you can work a job making twice minimum wage easily. If you want to start a family build up some cash, go to a cheap university and get a job that pays even better than that. Simple really, you just have to make sacrificed at the right time to get the right pay off in the future. Work hard now and don't have any spending money and a decade from now you'll be working a job you don't hate, making money you like and being able to do whatever you want.

       Well that's just the thing though isn't it? Here we have a kid that's either still in, or just finished high school, who, based on a glance at his profile, spends a good part of his free time smoking weed and playing a 4/10 zombie game, has no college education, and yet still has a job and can at least scrape together enough to cover his bills. This is a job market where his minimum wage job is being sought after by people with degrees and skills. But still, here he is already bemoaning his lot in life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not a fan of "pull yourself up by your bootstraps," but the OP really needs to do it. This isn't a thirty year old person who keeps getting fucked by the system. This is a kid who is lucky enough to be employed yet isn't satisfied. The lack of satisfaction is fine, that should motivate one to work towards having a better life, but from the sounds of it, OP seems to be fine with just hating the system and not taking risks or opportunities to make his life better. Because nothing here indicates that he's making any real effort to change his status quo.

       You are not wrong. You are an asshole for judging him based off his profile. I would have done the same thing in fact I kinda did.
      </p>
      <p>
       I stopped thou and deleted what I was going to say because it wasn't what he needed to hear. Its not going to motivate him any further by picking thru his user history.

       Explain your life experiences and offer advise like I did. Change his mind show him that so what you were there and made it much like he can if he pulls himself up by his boot straps.

       He should be in college subsidized by society.
      </p>
      <p>
       German students for instance do not pay for higher education. The fact that you think he should be wasting his life at fast food restaurants and not studying hard to contribute in some more meaningful way to society shows the depth of your own conditioning by this society.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I had to do it" is no excuse. Imagine yourself being told that by every male who went through insane and barbaric rite of passage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bad habits of smoking weed and playing video games can be overcome, but teenagers turn to weed and video games for very specific reasons. Mostly it is depression and existential angst, brought on by a confusing and contradictory system of values being forced upon them that does this. For instance, why are no practical, engaging and useful skills being taught in American high schools? Why are English classes basically the same class repeated year after year? Why is it a law in some states that students must complete 4 years of high school, regardless of whether or not they can test out? Why are we not looking at replacing the final two years of high school with 2 years of junior college, seeing as how they are comprised of much of the same courses and materials? Why do we continue to fund a broken education system which, in the case of my city, has fewer accredited high schools than you can count on one hand?
      </p>
      <p>
       Teenagers have youth and passion. They do not spend all day in doors smoking weed and playing video games because they want to. Those things are escapes from a society which is broken and not working in many ways. You are essentially banned from work until you are 16 or have a connection of some sort, due to overcrowding of entry level jobs, and are thus completely dependent on your parents until you are 15. The idea that 15 year olds cannot be independent is completely false. 15 years old was the age one was kicked out of one's house in the 17th century. Given the chance, I think many 15 year old's could be independent. But there is no work for a 15 year old available, and even if there was, it would not pay enough for him or her to be able to support himself. And there is compulsory education he has to complete as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Society is set up to make everybody before the age of 22 almost complete dependent on their parents or a corporation or a government. This is a problem. We should be striving towards more independence for people. Escapism like weed and video games are just about the only entertaining thing they can do with their time. And one is illegal while the other is a social stigma.

       I can attest to the law preventing testing out of high school. In 10th grade I could have easily passed a GED test and gone straight to college, but in Pennsylvania, a person is not allowed to take a GED test until their class graduates.
      </p>
      <p>
       I went to community college for two years, received an A.A., 3.81 GPA. Had zero financial aid. The colleges I applied to for transfer weren't offering me any either. I ended up having to go to work to pay off debts, as well as a hold on my record (that was not my fault, nor made known to me until after I had graduated) that prevented me access to my transcripts. Fast forward 8 years. I still haven't gone back to college.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this system is bullshit. The only job I found that paid decently was a union job for a petroleum refinery. If you're willing to accept the petroleum industry rapes the end user (no matter what they tell you) and pumps the oceans and atmosphere and earth full of toxins, then it's the industry for you. I left three months ago. I don't want to ever work in that industry again.
      </p>
      <p>
       No idea what to do now. The uneducated employment world is terrible, and education (even merely technical schools) are incredibly expensive. Trade unions are affordable (usually free training plus work wages) but they involve insane amounts of travel and very little time to sleep/recuperate when you are an apprentice.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm incredibly disillusioned with this world today.

       That was my first reaction too. If you're not going to play the game and go to school you need to develop some skills that are worth something to society.

       I feel for this guy if he really is struggling to find meaningful work but unless you can offer something to someone you're not going to get paid much as an unskilled worker.

       Such a cop out. Goes ask 10 random people what's up. Sure you can get degrees and find a decent or good paying job, but you will still be working for some one, furthering a companies agendas and profits and working 60 hour work weeks or more and still end up depressed and sick of the cubicle slavery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people hate their jobs (called a rat race for a reason), and no one has time for their own kids, let alone to see friends and family. There's not enough time for anyone to break free of the system because they have to spend the majority of the prime of their lives working for paper rectangles used to to pay bills for comfort, so you can rest and eat in order to return to the rat race the next day.
      </p>
      <p>
       All you're doing is justifying the slavery (work), by saying make more money and be comfortable. It's utter bullcrap.
      </p>
      <p>
       Check this out, the #2 biggest regret of people who are dying:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <ol>
        <li>
         I wish I hadn’t worked so hard.
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        “This came from every male patient that I nursed. They missed their children’s youth and their partner’s companionship. Women also spoke of this regret, but as most were from an older generation, many of the female patients had not been breadwinners. All of the men I nursed deeply regretted spending so much of their lives on the treadmill of a work existence.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       It's just a different form of slavery, and you bust your ass your whole lief so you can enjoy some possible future retirement scenario which isn't guaranteed, and by that point, the body is old, decrepit, basically just waiting to die at that point and too tired to do what you always wanted to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       F0ck all that. Save money and get off the grid, build a cob house with no mortgage, get an older model truck with no computers in it that you can easily learn to fix, start a 1 acre garden, and have people join you in this community while everything else around us falls apart.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you will step out as a phoenix from the ashes one day

       Unless you yourself have been living in an off the grid community your entire life, then you should still understand the value of working the system and making the best of it regardless of whether you agree with it or not. At least until you are in a position to leave it.

       Outright rejecting it when you still don't have your ducks in a row is a one way ticket to misery and poverty.

       I went to culinary school. So yeah. I'm working to improve every day. For some people, hard work isn't enough. For example. I'm saving every spare penny I can to move across the country at the end of this year. I'm doing this for my dream job I more than likely won't get until I'm well connected at the place I plan to go. In the culinary industry. School doesn't mean anything to most employers. They assume that students are arrogant because of the education they got. The only reason I got my current job, was because I openly admitted that I'm not perfect, and that I don't know everything. My education helped of course, but it doesn't offer much other than a piece of paper.

       It sucks yes.  But you are responsible for yourself.  If you dont like your job find another one.  Or find another way to make money.  I went through the same thing when i was younger.  My advise:  Stay away from any debt.  I know you need some debt to make payments on to 'build credit'.  Keep those to a minimum.  Get rid of everything in your life that you dont need.  Get rid of your tv, or cable at least.  This frees up some cash and time for you to look for a better job/focus on other ways to make money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at life as more of a game.  You are playing sim city or some shit.  Get rid of your expenses and play the game within the rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       I almost fell into the trap of having a new nice car with payments... An apartment with too high of rent.  Buying shit that i dont need.  I stopped it all.  Sold my car and bought a 90 chevy van.  Bought a dirt cheap house where the mortgage is 1/2 of what my rent used to be.  I started a small business while still working my full time job.  Now I am about to quit the full time job and work exclusively on my small business.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to find something you like to do.  Then figure out how to make money at it.  Its not hard at all to start your own business.  It can take as little as one day to get enough set up to be legal with fed and state governments.  It surprisingly simple.  Working for someone else is just that.  Your a cog in their machine that produces cheap labor.  You need to start your own machine.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is kind of long winded and rambly, but the best way to 'fight back' is to get out of the system as much as you can.  You will respect yourself much better when you are making your own money by your own rules...

       Its the typical bullshit here. Everyone likes to claim theyre freethinkers and they see the problems/conspiracies but they still are infected with the mentality they claim to fight against. Eager to claim that the government and corporations are working against us, they point out all the flaws that cause people to have unhappy lives, all the money related schemes and scams corporations use to drive their profits climbing while trying to keep us earning as little as possible.  But as soon as someone comes in and feels they shouldnt be wasting their lives just to afford a roof over their heads, these same people feel the need to inform them theyre entitled, that back in my day we'd work twice as much as you and get paid 8 times more you lazy bum, how it's just the way the system is and you gotta deal with it. Its very disconcerting and is one of the obstacles blocking actual change. Weak people still feel the need to be better than someone else and they will cling to whatever safety net they can, even a rotting corpse from a sinking ship, rather than swim to shore. Is it really too much to ask that someone at age 19 should be able to find a job that supports at least housing and food? How are we going to sustain ourselves when you guys stay with the mentality that we have perfected our economy and capitalism and it's only broken when it affects YOU negatively.

       The shallow replies in here really illustrate the higher level thinking you can expect from majority of people.
"go to college so you can get a better job."
"work your way up from the bottom to a great career." 
That shit is deep. Thanks for the profound advice.
Work your way up? To fucking where?
He or she doesn't want to be stuck the rest of their life in the bullshit system. They want out.
Work the rest of your life as a slave to a rigged economy and corrupt government? A government that you must work for half of the year, in the form of "income tax". sounds great.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about, maybe if we want to grow up, finally, and move into a higher consciousness we need to drop the whole money thing entirely. There are many things better than a system that is built upon exploitation and greed.

       I understand what they're saying. I don't think they mean it to be rude, and I'm taking everything they say with a grain of salt. Some of these things I needed to hear, and I'm glad I'm being told what I am.  Like one comment said that I'm being entitled. I don't expect anything handed to me, yet I can understand how it seems that way. I'm thankful that these people have taken time out of their day to share how they feel. I may not agree with it all, but it does give insight as to better myself. So let them say what they want.

       That was me that said the entitled thing. From your post it seemed as if you were acting it. If not then I am sorry. I am right thou that you need to find something you enjoy doing. Money won't matter then cause you will love it.

       You have no reason to apologize. You gave insight based on what you know, and saw in my post. For that, I'm greatful. I am in a field I am very passionate about. I'm currently saving every penny I scrape together to move across the country for my dream job. Will I get it? Probably not. Do I plan on trying my best to get there. Fuck yes I do. That's beside the point. You can be in a field of work you love, but a job can easily be ruined by toxic leadership. For example. My place of work is on the third executive chef in less than six months. All simply because the ones they have hired are either horrible to the employees, or worse to the guests. And those who want to tell me to find another job. If it were that easy, I'd have done it ages ago. Thanks for the second response. Good vibes to you, brother.

       You seem passionate enough to get it. Don't have the idea you won't get what you want. It will show I promise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do or do not there is no try. Shitty use of the quote but you get what I mean. I won't accept no for an answer. I have others that can verify this within reddit if you don't belive me. Most people are not used to someone that's assertive. It throws them off.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to realize people what to be subjugated on some level. Its a responsibility thing. The job I have now I waited for years to get. Called them every fucking chance and reminded them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its about fortitude in life. You see something you want you get it. By whatever means you deem reasonable. I say that cause I am a bit more assertive then you know. Lol.

       You do have ways to fight back. Some of them depend on how far you're willing to go. The majority of them have to do with what you
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to do. Having a perspective distant from your own individual struggles helps. You can achieve that with meditation, walking outside, possibly psychedelics, reading the right philosophy or metaphysics, finding a group of likeminded people etc. A lot of the time it is more about doing what you know is right and doing what you know will make you feel better whether or not it is going to do anything to slow the onslaught. If you can recognize how pointless the job treadmill is, you've been shown that because you're ready for it. So now you have a real job to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's pretty shitty, you're right. All of us here have been born into a prison with some terrible momentums behind it, but nothing lasts forever. Recognize that tons of people feel the way you do even if they don't show it or even know it themselves. I wish I had been lucid about this stuff when I was 20. It took me until my mid or late 20s to really get situated with the predicament(s) and start to draft an escape map.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have time to figure it out. Make sure to give yourself time and space for respite, good things, answers etc to make themselves available. I lied. You
       <em>
        don't
       </em>
       have time to figure it out! It has been happening since before we were born and every day we further forge our realities with what we spend out energy on. But we die anyway no matter what, so what do we do about it? I hope this helps.

       That is the advice I have just given a nephew who was faced with 6 figures of debt for a college degree or going it alone.

       It actually does work. I know a number of people who pull down high five figures or low six figures in low cost areas this way.

       I don't expect high pay. Money isn't what life is about. I'm tired of being a slave to a society that doesn't care about the working class. Simple as that. We work, sleep, and die. Then another body fills the gap. Yet the rich make more money in a week than some make in a lifetime. That's my issue. I'm all for capitalism.  Just not when it's tainted by large companies with selfish interests. It might not have been made very clear in my post, and I'm sorry for that. I'm trying to reply to everyone,  but I have things to do. Thank you for the reply. Enjoy your day.

       Go work on a farm. There's an organization called WWOOF that you can locate and contact organic farmers/homesteaders and go live with them whilst working for pay and/or knowledge, goods etc. you ain't gonna get rich doing this (but you said that doesn't matter) but you will be supporting a system that is sustainable all the while building strong communal relationships. Some people spend their lives traveling from one farm to the next. Typing this up I'm thinking, 'Hell why am I not doing this!'

       Guess what man... welcome to the real world. I am 24 in the U.S. Army and this is just how the way the world works, also alot of these massive companies offer you alot of money. For example, A assembler at a Ford manufacturing plant makes upward of 15.66 an hour, hell GM employers pay even more you can make upward of 60 to 80k a year and thats with benefits, health,life, and dental insurance thats impressive for a beginning paycheck and with a union you can only go up from here. Your always gonna end up like this, unless you find a job you truly enjoy. I am in the military and i honestly absolutely love it! Best job i have ever had, you just need to get out there and find some skills you enjoy and use it to your advantage. While i spend time in the army i go to school from criminal justice. Life it what ever you make it, so make it a good one!

       ~says the Stormtrooper.  Sounds like you took the easy way out by making yourself a gear to the machine of death and chaos.  You're supposed to lay yourself upon the gears of this society so that it ceases to function.  You are supporting what is wrong with the world, sorry.

       The correct advice, imo, is save up some money from shit jobs (or if you're lucky, a decent job that doesn't compromise your morals/spirit) while you work on your passions.  Transition from that shit-job that helped fund your passions and hopefully make money from that (music, art, carpentry, mechanic etc).  In the meanwhile, find a nice cheap property (in a safe area, away from nuclear power plants, faults, coastlines, huge cities, hydro-fracking etc) and become self-sustainable.  Grow your own food (organic food is in high demand and there is not enough supply - can make lots of money from that alone), learn about aquaponics and try out solar (buy a panel every few months to add on).  Learn how to defend yourself and your property.  Stop buying clothes made from slave-labor.  Move your money out of the big banks to a credit union.
       <strong>
        Do not buy (see: support) any of the huge corporations destroying our world and you will be doing a very important, small, part
       </strong>
       .  Keep reading, discover what is meant for you to discover in this life along your path.

       I am 32, getting paid 18/hour delivery driving.  On the side, I do a radio show, draw, read, write and plant new gardens every year to expand my operation.  I would love to one day do a morning radio show and get paid, maybe make music or produce enough fruit &amp; veg to make a living off that too.. until then I just keep at it.  It's been about seven years for me now since I started putting in a lot of effort to become self-sufficient (trees first, gardens, chickens etc) and I can really see my goals coming to fruition now.. many doors are opening.

       Defensive aggression is perfectly fine.  Think of a mother bear defending her cubs.  All other forms of aggression exhibit the immaturity of our leaders to find solutions through peaceful means... except OH WAIT ~ We create, train and arm factions that we turn into enemies.  We subjugate foreign countries through force, economic means, sanctions (Confessions of an Economic Hitman: read it) or just assassinate them out right.  This country makes billions off war and disease and will continue to do so as long as people like

       On the subject of carpet bombing, did you know the cluster munitions used in Laos has caused over 20,000 injuries/deaths of innocent civilians decades after the war has ended.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <strong>
         At least 20,000 people have been killed or injured
        </strong>
        by unexploded ordnance in Laos since the Vietnam War-era bombings ended.
       </li>
       <li>
        About one third of the land in Laos is contaminated with unexploded ordnance.
       </li>
       <li>
        Many cluster bomblets became buried in the earth – waiting for an unsuspecting farmer to place a shovel in the earth or the monsoon rains to uncover them.
       </li>
       <li>
        Many farmers in Laos know their land is contaminated but can’t afford another plot. They simply have no choice but to cultivate their land.
       </li>
       <li>
        The most common injuries victims sustain from a UXO explosion include loss of a limb, blindness, hearing loss, shrapnel wounds, and internal shock wave injuries.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Over the past four decades, only 500,000 of the estimated 80 million cluster munitions that failed to detonate have been cleared.
        </strong>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       It will take more than a century to finish the job.  This is the legacy that this war machine leaves in it's wake.  This is but the tip of the iceberg.

       Also I don't care about those people. I just don't. I care about american problems on American soil. That your problem you are willing to shed some tears over people you have no ties to. Why don't you care about the returning veteran that lost a limb fighting for his country?

       I don't expect you or anyone to fully agree with what I'm about to say, but I think you should seriously consider the implications.
      </p>
      <p>
       We, as humans, could in fact feed, clothe, medicate, hydrate, and shelter every single human in a safe, peaceful world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reasons we don't are actually very simple. All human actions will have an ultimate motivation of being in service to self, or in service to others. Some humans feel they have
       <em>
        dominion
       </em>
       over others and when they accept that the motivations for this is service to self, they realize that ultimately it will not serve others. That is why you feel that "shit is fucked up" for a lack of a better term. And shit is indeed, quite fucked up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The solution is simple, just convince everyone in the world of those two things.

       Well if it's money you're concerned about, I know how you feel. You have to play the game though. Look into the Pell Grant and look at a community college near you. Take some online classes, they are usually really fucking easy. Use your researching skills to find the appropriate associates degree that can start making you some more money and then in the future you can get your BS. If that's not your thing, there are plenty of trades to be learned. Sometimes I see jobs in my area that are willing to hire someone with no experience as an apprentice and put them through school at night, while they work during the day. There are also technical schools that can teach you how to be a welder or dental assistant or emt... The list goes on. If all else fails there is also the military route. Join the Air Force for IT or something and come out with some good experience. I know it's all contributing to the system, but until you can afford to avoid the system you still have to play the game. Anyways I hope that helps, keep your head up and be proud that you are able to start making serious plans at such a young age.

       Here's my advice, worth very little.  Spend time thinking about what you enjoy doing instead of what you make.  Dive into that and become as knowledgeable and capable as you possibly can.  Even if it takes you ten years you will be better of doing something you love for a living, maybe just a modest living, in your thirties.

       Having children now will almost certainly lock you in to your current, crappy situation.  Do not have kids until you have found a way to happily make a living.

       I just read a book called Possum Living. Some girl describes how her and her dad live on barely any money a year by not working and just being somewhat self sufficient. Society tricks us into thinking we need to consume so much to be a part of society. These people don't live out in the sticks, they are just super frugal and practical. I live quite well, have worked 10hrs/week, and make less than you in Chicago.

       Maybe you'll find this useful, maybe not. But I recently had a bit of a break through.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've always felt different. I don't understand the system and hate the 9 to 5 (usually longer!) grind. I hate the vapid entertainment and mindless consumerism that pervades our society. And yet, I remained stuck for years with seemingly no way out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then it hit me: my internal and external lives were totally incongruous. I spent all this time railing against the system, and yet I made decisions that virtually ensured I stayed apart of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I worked a 9 to 5 job. I watched the NFL every Sunday and usually ate shit food. I wore Nike shoes and socks. My idea of a good time was drinking and standing in crowded bars trying to be funny. In short, I was the
       <em>
        epitome
       </em>
       of the system that I so despised. How's that for a mind fuck?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We're all robots. Born to follow orders, and rely on the government to put food on the table.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       what the establishment wants you to think. Stop giving away your power. You could start a small business that sells non-GMO food. Or write a blog about alternative lifestyles. Or work at a retreat/meditation center. Or create a podcast about government corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       The system relies on you being fearful and in a mind set of scarcity. That's how it entraps people. Open up to new possibilities and have the courage to eat, dress, talk, think, and live differently. Then you'll start reclaiming your power and will easily avoid traps like unfulfilling jobs, debt, etc.

       Hey, I did that when I was your age!
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I said fuck it, joined the military, volunteered to go to every shit country that they wanted to send me to.  Wrote all of that experience down in a resume that took me all over the world as a civilian.  I can't tell you how many times that I have gotten to the top of my game, just to quit and start all over at the bottom in a completely different field(Radio Maintenance to carpentry to heavy equipment repair to IT to real estate, etc...).
      </p>
      <p>
       All I ever wanted was life experience, and enough different skill sets to allow me to get some kind of job wherever I went in the world.

       My advice, hit the road.  Maybe not the military, but look for contracts in places like Antarctica, Africa or the South Pacific.  Jobs like that make it easy to save up money.  Then start a business and never, ever, fucking ever work for someone else again.

       I was working 12 hours a day 5 days a week now I'm doing 8 hours a day 7 days a week, on third shift. I feel like nothing but a slave to the system and I'm just working my life away everyday. I barely get time with my own son or anyone for that matter. I love the fact I can provide for him don't get me wrong but this shouldn't be the way we have to live our only life we have.

       You can't live happily if you don't live with hope. The fact that you're here, and we're all able to discuss this means there's hope and that you're not alone.

       Ideas like the Free State project in New Hampshire can be a way forward. A secession from the
       <em>
        United States
       </em>
       may be the first step to getting out of this slave trade. I think that is risky, but more risky would be trying to get freedom loving people into a pocket somewhere and declaring sovereignty, this criminal government would probably come in and try to do a WACO/Ruby Ridge; but I think this time at least if you get the word out (keep the internet free) we'd have massive militia and support from all over to counter this like we did at Bundy Ranch where the Feds stood down. Just can't tell if the overall outcome would be good or bad; it's a chess game.

       You have this notion you are supposed to get better. That's called entitlement and its horseshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was working my first job in 1996 at sonic. I did that shit for 2 fucking years. While in highschool too. So I could buy my first car because I wanted it and my father said then you buy it and get your first 6 months of premiums for insurance and then you can drive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Took me two years cause I wanted that car. So after I got it I found a better job then a better one. Then I joined the Navy and well that tought me even more. Now I am 36 busted my ass learned some shit and now I make around 70k.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know what's more important thou? It ain't the money at all that should matter its what you pick as a career. You can make a million dollars an hr and still be miserable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its finding a job that makes you happy. Don't settle for a fucking thing in life. Work for it and you will feel better about it trust me I been where you are. Or you can be like the world wants and slave for surviablity if that's what you want is less effort.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you have right now is pride stinging you. Fuck all that earn you way and show your siblings, parents, and peers you are a force to be reconconed with.

       1996 and 2015 are completely different times.  Also, you joined the Navy.. do you ever think about the contributions you made to the military industrial complex that spreads misery, ruin and death across the globe?  Just because you might have been stationed on a vessel and just went from point a -&gt; point b potentially never firing a shot, doesn't mean you weren't part of everything that is wrong.

       Yeah I have thought about it. Glad I did it too. It was required of me to murder people at one point in my military career and I did it because I was instructed to do so.

      <p>
       I would do it again without question because its what is required. Don't know the people and didn't care to either. The pity party of woe are the women and children won't work with me cause they were there when their god wanted them to die. Easy as that.

       I am not sorry for anything I did. I have no remorse for it. If I was still in the military I would execute my orders with haste because that is my job. You think there is a choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       A civilian wouldn't understand it. You have time to think about it cause you are not there. When you have people shooting at you there is no time to think. Or if you are ordered to fire a weapon of destruction you do it. It don't matter where its going to go because that's not important to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't mind the killing aspect of the military. Not even a bit really. What I did mind was civilians that thought they knew better because they saw it on TV or read about it in books. Always second guessing the actions of those that raised their hand when asked to defend a nation against all enemies foreign and domestic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't matter where the conflict was blame the ones that sent them their not the ones doing as instructed.

      <p>
       I am not saying I am better in any shape or form (nor are the multitudes of people who you believe are thinking that).  You are delusional if you think people who don't believe in war are some how "better".  Maybe more aware of their actions, but not better.  They just see a different means to an end, and do not wish to support corporate and political entities destroying the world.

       Lol its so easy to think like you do. I get it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are saying that you wouldn't be a part of the military cause you think its all for money? Well you are not wrong. It is. Its also for good. You want to focus on the bad cause its easier to find.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no other way. People have to die. Its the cycle of the world. Nations rise and fall. Humanity doesn't want peace. It wants blood and war. It wants high cyclic rates on machine guns and drones with laser guided missiles.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are a person that wants change. People are animals when given a chance. Its just the way we are. Realize that and it will be an easier pill to choke down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Took me a while to realize it myself because I thought there was another way. Took some shit I saw in another country to change my view. Just barbaric shit you can't imagine. With a town wanting it to happen. Over some shit a person stole for food to feed their family.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pulled a person apart with horses. All that was left was a head and a torso. Mother fuckers cheering about it. Seen babies chopped up like a Christmas ham too. Just cause they were the wrong gender. Humanity is fucked.

       I think you are crazy for thinking the world wants peace. Lol we have fought from the beginning of time since they first saw death by the hands of another man for anything. To ignore that and think there is a way to erase that need in the entirety of humanity is lying to yourself.

       It bothers me that from my experiences you label me as fucked up. You don't know me. You claim that you are empathetic towards others yet you dismissed me when it scared you. That's so wrong whoever that speaker was has the right idea.

       You would take years of talking to, to help.  Your thoughts are different than mine (and most moral, ethical, aware people), so I consider it warped.  I would seriously label you as borderline psychotic with some of your beliefs.  That is my opinion.  I said far gone, not "too far gone".  I just don't have the time or patience to deal with your bullshit dude.  That's all there is.  I never labeled you as "fucked up" ~ "warped as fuck" is different.   You have been programmed so hard, it's so messed.

       Another thing. If you did "help"me I would only memic the behavior you deem appropriate in order to "fit in" its what many do that are like I am.  As I am sure there are many more. You think about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its not to scare you its to make you realize some of us just don't care. We want to fit in but it isn't in many of us to just flip a switch and start giving a fuck. All the medication in the book wouldn't change it. Do I know I am not the same as many others?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well fuck yeah I do. I find that is what makes me real thou. Normal people seem fake. Worried about trivial things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example I am driving on a major highway. I count the cars around me at all times and am aware of what and where each one is. I check every 10 seconds or so. I do this for oncoming too.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the mornings I watch people at the hotel during breakfast to see the ingrained behavior they have to accept what they are given. Such as the small shot glass for juice. There is coffee cups three times as large right next to the small one.
      </p>
      <p>
       They always grab the small ones and get up 5 times to refill it or sit next to the juice machine. I find that fucking fascinating. Human behavior is just nuts to me. I actually enjoy watching mass behavior in public settings. You learn quite a bit.

       Its a label. Made by those that can't do it. Its a stigma that is associated with bad people so that others can feel better about their own behavior I think.

       I usually make no effort to hide my  true behavior as I feel its part of who I am. I earned this therefore why not show it?

       Well thanks for the thoughts. I don't need help. I have it under control. The reason I haven't done anything before my son was born is consequence. After he was born its cause he needs a father.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not violent only when my family is threatened. I ain't so nice then. Got ways to find people. Its easier to just let people insult because I know they have a good chance of be involved in a accident that causes their demise without my intervention.
      </p>
      <p>
       I won't deny your statement about being borderline. I don't have empathy for others outside my immediate family or friends. Just don't care unless I know it can help those I know too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't understand how there is a normal mindset when we are all different. You got all kinds of people. Ones that like to go home do the family thing wake up and repeat. Then you got some that go home and pet their lamp while singing some old 30s song that you hear on a horror movie before they chop them up.
      </p>
      <p>
       How does one see a baseline in all that? Seems like a conformity issue. I don't want your help I want you to explain normal to me. You make it sound as if you are a mental health type. Which I have never understood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't know why you felt you needed to help me when I don't see a problem. I am married, have a kid, a great wife, pay my bills, got 2 ferrets, 6 chickens, a cat, and stay outta trouble. Managed to get asked to come back to every job I have ever had. So I don't see the problem and how I am not normal.

       Its not a problem. Also never regret a decision you have made. Its a waste of time because you can't erase it. Try to learn from them.

       You are young and just starting out in life, everyone your age not attending some form of higher education is going to be stuck working for minimum wage. If you opt to not attend college or a trade school then your choices in life going forward are going to be severely limited.

Define success. Where are you ultimately headed after you've accomplished what you set out to do? Where are you trying to get to? People never stop to ask the most basic questions. 
Go ahead, strive and struggle for some future goal, climb the mountain. You can do those things, but it will make no lasting difference.
Joy and fulfillment will never be found through striving.

       Attitude is directly related to success in life.

       I didn't ask for the definition of the word success. I asked what does success mean to you?
What I speak of is not depressing, it is the opposite.
what is depressing is watching people struggle their whole life for meaningless things. People struggle and struggle for things. Prestige, wealth, fame, possessions, etc.
People don't even know what they really want in life.
You can't pursue happiness. it's here now if you know where to find it.

       You said define success, and that's what I did. That's what success means to me, the textbook definition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Attaining my goals in life makes me happy, because I accomplished what I set out to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wealth, presitge, fame, posessions are not in my definition of success, they are merely symptoms of success.

       I don't define happiness by how much money is in my checking account.

       I went to culinary school. There's a stigma attached to students from those schools. Many employers think we are full of shit because some students are arrogant. I love my trade, I just feel like I'm at a dead end. Thanks for the good vibes, brother.

       Oh that's even better! Try to start your own business. Not sure what state you are in but the government allows for whats called Homestead Food Operations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where you can sell food products to local vendors that you made at home, or even start a food truck business.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can start small and work your way up if the food is good enough!

       Same boat. First 4 years of the navy I was a cook on a submarine. Got an associates degree in culinary arts. You know what it got me in the civilian world?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not a fucking thing. I went to classes to learn how to do ice carving and fancy shit had a portfolio and all kinda shit to prove it. Not one place would hire me for more then minimum wage. So fuck it. I became a first party collections agent.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is a booming industry man. Try it out. Really a good job actually. Then I delivered appliances for GE that was ok. Pay was by the piece so it was screwy. Never the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I do inspections for power companies and airline on aerial equipment. Way better gig. If you are interested message me I will see what I can do and explain it more.

       Spend a few years homeless. You'll get off the grid, find new things to be pissed off about, and appreciate the shitty life of a cog more. Plus, when you're ready to say "fuck it" to said shitty life, you'll be more prepared for what you'll need to be self-sufficient.

       So you make $5.42 per hour ($19k/((40hrs x50wks)+(20hrs x 1.5 x 50wks))?  Maybe sue your employer for grossly violating minimum wage laws? Or spit some rage based on a story you didn't make up? There is plenty to be mad about.

       If you're working just one job, you need to talk to a lawyer who specializes in employment law. Based on those numbers, you are not getting paid overtime and you probably should be. If it's multiple jobs, none of which exceeds 40 hours per week, disregard that.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to the rest of your plight, there are methods by which it is possible to rise above the minimum-wage life. You may not like any of them. You may not want to do any of them. But they are real, actual options and, in the end, the choice, and therefore the responsibility for the repercussions of that choice or non-choice, are entirely yours.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ways I most often see young adults rise above the minimum wage lifestyle are military and college.
      </p>
      <p>
       Military seems self-explanatory. Think about what you want to do with your life long-term, try to match that with a branch of the service, and visit a recruiter. Make damn sure that any promise that you actually care about being kept is made in writing. They might still back out of it, but at least if it's in writing you have something to point to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Much of the time a four or six year military commitment results in the US government paying 100% of college expenses, possibly even including some level of graduate school, during service and following honorable discharge. The downside is, of course, spending all those years in the military.
      </p>
      <p>
       College could be a bit trickier than military because it requires funding and many have more stringent entry requirements than does the military. If you're out on your own and making that little money, you are probably eligible for tuition assistance: some combination of grants, scholarships, and loans. It totally sucks that we make our kids pay for college, but that is the way it is and it's not going to change in time to help you.  Much like the military option, figure out what you want to do for a job, make sure it's something that actually pays so you can pay back your student loans, and pursue a reasonable college.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might also do some research into colleges that offer free tuition to low income people. I'm pretty sure I heard that Stanford is doing that, and Stanford is a well-respected college. There may be others, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, I believe there are colleges in other countries that offer free tuition to anyone - even non-citizens - if they can get accepted and get there.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of these things require effort - research and decisions - on your part. Only babies shat out of wealthy wombs get wealthy without effort. But if you're working 55-60 a week, you don't seem to be afraid of effort, so you should be good.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        EDIT:
       </em>
       Also, you may consider relocating to a location that has a significantly higher minimum wage. For example, the city of Seattle has theirs set at $15.

       Second the GI bill is only 36 months of schooling and only gives tuition, book money, and housing money. Various branches have TA options that vary wildly but it's extremely unlikely to be able to get degree using that alone.  Everyone gets the GI bill who finishes their enlistment honorably. Heavily dependent on job you can also get free civilian certifications like your ccna or emt certs.

       There seem to be different options there, then. My daughter's ex-boyfriend spent either 4 or 6 years in the Navy. He was honorably discharged over 2 years ago and is currently attending his first of 2 years of graduate school, with all tuition, books, and a good chunk of living expenses still paid for by the Navy.
      </p>
      <p>
       it is entirely possible that he did some college before or during his service, therefore the 36 month GI bill is funding the remainder after his discharge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously the guy should get an understanding of all his options for himself.

       Here's a good way to remember how the GI Bill works...  It depends on which state you live/go to school in...  For example, Airman A, who goes to school in texas, qualified for 100% of his GI Bill benefits.  This does not mean that Airman A will be getting 100% of their schooling paid for.  This is because of AVERAGE In-State Tuition rates.  If you qualify for 100% of your GI Bill benefits, it means that the GI Bill will pay for 100% of the average in-state tuition rate.  Now let's say there's only 5 colleges in texas.  4 of them cost $100.00 per semester.  The last college costs $10,000.00 per semester.  This gives us an Average In-State Tuition rate of $2080.00.  If Airman A goes to one of the 4 cheap schools, he'll be golden, with everything paid for and lots of extra cash.  If he goes to the expensive school, he'll be $7920.00 in the negative per semester.  I am not an expert, but I did fuck myself real good when I moved to the wrong state for grad school.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL/DR:  Varies by state.  Research your average in-state tuition rate before picking a school.

       You're working a minimum wage job. Quit your bitching. You're not even really an adult yet either. If you want to make more money then get a tiny sprinkling of education or get a better job, if McDonalds is the best you can do then you don't really deserve more than minimum wage because anyone can do that job and we got a lot of high schoolers who need money for weed and Starbucks.

       If you read further down. I got my education. It got me shit. I'm now in debt, and looking for better opportunities for myself. However, with a culinary degree comes the stigma that we are arrogant. Some are, yeah. But that takes work away from the ones who are not. I only got my current job because I try and stay humble, and not big headed with my trade. Employers couldn't care less about a culinary degree, because anyone with half a mind can cook. So a formal education in my field is commonly considered as a show that you're better than everyone else. Or at least that's how most people take it, unfortunately.

       I started out making less than that and worked my way up. You don't get shit handed to you if you want to make a career. Train and better yourself. I started off at 19 years old making 17 total. I did something about it.  I worked my ass off and reaped the rewards. I worked long hours, nights and weekends. I then decided hey, I need to get some certs, what did I do because I could pay for them? Joined the army. Got into the field I loved to do. Started out as a private and within 3 years, I earned my sergeant. I didn't do it by kissing ass. I did it because by golly I cared enough about my future to want to earn more. I am out now, and all those years finally paid off. I now make almost 4x as much as I did when I was 19 (27 now).  I didn't do it by crying about it  I did it by working hard and proving that I am a great person to keep around.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is my rant. If you want something bad enough, fight for it and don't bitch when it's not handed to you. That's the problem with today's youth. You expect shit to be handed to you and don't know what hard work is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm done.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't bitch and work your way to success.

       Thanks for the reply. I agree with much of what you said. However,  I don't believe that my generation feels entitled to everything. People my age work just as hard, if not harder than previous generations. Someone of every age feels like the world needs to be given to them on a silver platter. I guess my argument to that would be that my generation is a product of our upbringing. Parents don't deserve all the blame, of course. Most do the best they can with what they have. Keep in mind that my generation also has to clean up after the mistakes and policies of those who came before us. Again. Thank you for the reply. What you said humbled me a little to say the least. Good vibes, brother. Enjoy your day.

       Dude you made part of your money being part of a military branch. If we could all deal with the heavy conscious from being trained to kill innocent people and blindly following orders then yeah we might climb up the socio-economical ladder in such a way as to think it is perfect and surely if I did it everyone else can. I can become rich right now with worth ethic and about $200 worth of crack but I find it immoral. Some of us see the possibility of making some changes so you dont have to work 40 hours a week to barely afford rent and groceries. If you still want to continue on the fucked up establishment, good for you but you arent just hurting yourself.

       No I made the money I did by doing what I needed to do in order to get the certifications I needed.

       I didn't join to kill or shoot people, I joined in thr networking field as telecommunications is my passion.

       curious what your job is? I'd say find something that is more fun. I don't like much about our world either...but I make 190k/yr and my job isn't terribly unpleasant. It certainly helps. I can think of lots of more fun jobs if all I had to do was make about 20K per year.

       Our system is not perfect, but it's the best system that mankind found so far. Don't like it? Try going in a non capitalism country and see how you like it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because you have a low pay job and you're not doing anything about it doesn't mean the society is not functioning. A large majority of people are very comfortable the way things are going and are simply enjoying life as it is. If you don't like your current situation, move your ass, go back to school, night classes if you have to, and learn a trade that you will actually enjoy (not to mention most likely much better pay).

       it's the best system taht mankind found so far??  I am sorry, but it is far from the best.. it's inefficient, it's an outdated model, produces way too much consumption, inequality, slavery conditions, domination mindsets, violence, stress, anxiety, and as time goes by things get much worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any system based on competition and domination is not the way of the future.. It needs to be based on cooperation and collaboration, with a horizontal power structure not a vertical one where all the power goes to an increidbly small minority..  Due to capitalism around the world, the richest 67 people have as much wealth as the 3.5 BILLION of humans.. Half the world fucken population... sickening.. when will people stop being so ignorant.

       Here's a good way to remember how the GI Bill works...  It depends on which state you live/go to school in...  For example, Airman A, who goes to school in texas, qualified for 100% of his GI Bill benefits.  This does not mean that Airman A will be getting 100% of their schooling paid for.  This is because of AVERAGE In-State Tuition rates.  If you qualify for 100% of your GI Bill benefits, it means that the GI Bill will pay for 100% of the average in-state tuition rate.  Now let's say there's only 5 colleges in texas.  4 of them cost $100.00 per semester.  The last college costs $10,000.00 per semester.  This gives us an Average In-State Tuition rate of $2080.00.  If Airman A goes to one of the 4 cheap schools, he'll be golden, with everything paid for and lots of extra cash.  If he goes to the expensive school, he'll be $7920.00 in the negative per semester.  I am not an expert, but I did fuck myself real good when I moved to the wrong state for grad school.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL/DR:  Varies by state.  Research your average in-state tuition rate before picking a school.

       I didn't ask for the definition of the word success. I asked what does success mean to you?
What I speak of is not depressing, it is the opposite.
what is depressing is watching people struggle their whole life for meaningless things. People struggle and struggle for things. Prestige, wealth, fame, possessions, etc.
People don't even know what they really want in life.
You can't pursue happiness. it's here now if you know where to find it.
