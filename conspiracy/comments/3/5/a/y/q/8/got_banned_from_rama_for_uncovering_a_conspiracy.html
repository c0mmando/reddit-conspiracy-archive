        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Not sure if this is the right place or against the rules but I read the sidebar and think it is ok. 
Over a year ago I noticed that AMA&#39;s that are being assisted by Victoria would always have a comment posted by the person that is the subject of the AMA saying &quot;Somebody asked XXX but deleted the question so here is my answer, XXX.&quot; 
They are always softball questions or &quot;questions&quot; that promote the person&#39;s intention of doing the AMA. 
After seeing this multiple times and only when Victoria was working with them I called her out. I said that nobody asked that question and they are lying to us. This is not the open, transparent honesty reddit seems to be telling us they represent. Well Victoria responded about 50 days ago to one of my many accusations and said they were not lying. She promised to screenshot the next one. I responded and told her that I guarantee I catch her doing it again within 3 months. 
The other day Mark Ruffalo did an AMA and the same thing happened. It was the top comment and my reply was the top reply with hundreds of likes and comments agreeing with me. A few minutes later the mods banned me from AMA for &quot;spam&quot; even though I posted one comment. 
I appealed the ban and Victoria herself promised to message the mods and request they overturn the ban. The mods replied that the ban is upheld and permanent because my post was &quot;harassing a reddit employee&quot;. 
Edit: Here is Victoria&#39;s replies to me when we were PM&#39;ing about my ban and how she was going to help me get unbanned. <a href="http://imgur.com/ZZ7GfaD">http://imgur.com/ZZ7GfaD</a> 
I don&#39;t care about getting a silly ban, I change screen names every few months to stay anonymous. I just want everyone to know that reddit and the mods at AMA have conspired and lied to us for years by posting fake deleted questions. 
This conspiracy has been proven!</p>

<p>Edit: Found where someone has documented it a few times. </p>

<p>Seriously. I&#39;ve noticed that response across several AMAs now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right that it is no secret and it&#39;s blatantly promotion now. What I mean is that when I started using reddit a few years ago I did not have that in the forefront of my mind. I took things at face value and didn&#39;t ever really question the reason behind any post and I certainly wasn&#39;t thinking about how reddit could be used for promotions, advertising and propaganda. I don&#39;t think its some idea shrouded in secrecy, but it did slowly morph over time to what it is now, and that is not quite as obvious to some people.</p>

<p>Reddit is mainstream media for new generations, but most of the people here are convinced they&#39;re part of some radical subculture. You do know people could call in questions before the internet existed, right? Or send fan mail that may or may not get answered? The AMA is nothing new, just a new medium.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember when I first made this account I did an AMA (deleted and scrubbed long ago), but I was just a dude right out of grad school williti chat with other people, and that was totally cool and the norm.</p>

<p>Can you imagine that shit <em>now</em>? No way. I got like 200+ upvotes. No way I&#39;d get that now.</p>

<p>....now I have to experiment. Incomin&#39; stealth AMA to prove my point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>seriously their PR people have fucked up if they really think coming on a reddit AMA would help promote some movie. You can tell the dumbarses because their ama questions are around 20 or less and each answer is very short. In the old days they did similar things via IRC or IM programs, and in 60mins they would answer 50 questions minimum and each response would be detailed. This Victoria person is the slowest typer in history or she&#39;s acting as a tv presenter and only reading out questions she or the PR person choose. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t be sure about <a href="/r/movies">/r/movies</a> because it seems like that sub was designed to shill.

    <div class="md"><p>I dunno, too much of the content on <a href="/r/movies">/r/movies</a> is too formulaic.  As it&#39;s just a relatively small number of content producers getting their shit to the top artificially (except for trailers, they (usually) get to the top on their own).

<p>A “Major Motion Picture” has a verifiable for-profit theatrical distributor. Moderators reserve the right to remove student, charity, <strong>indie</strong> and vanity projects - we recommend you submit to <a href="/r/filmmakers">/r/filmmakers</a>, a subreddit devoted to smaller-scale production.</p>

<p>I bet if you start talking about big budget foreign films you get shot down.. also some of the best movies have been indie movies... Garden State, The Big Lebowski, Being John Malkovich etc..</p>

<p>He&#39;s probably more like his character in Knights of Badassdom.  That movie was so painful that it had to be a labor of love for him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For one, Woody thought that the purpose of the AMA was where you take questions about the movie on a public forum.  So, he had the expectation to only be asked those questions...possibly not realizing what AMA actually meant.</p>

<p>Then, the icing on the cake was when he was asked some sort of question by a friend of a girl who Woody (allegedly) told her what she wanted to hear, banged her and just discarded her like yesterday&#39;s newspaper.</p>

<p>His response to that question was &quot;Hey, let&#39;s just keep questions about Rampart.&quot;</p>

<p>This was the beginning of a typhoon of attacks from users and it created a lot of negative publicity.</p>

That being said wouldn&#39;t it kinda make sense that if she is ghost writing for all of them, that when she is typing out a question that is claimed to have been deleted, she would reformat that question in her own words?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong it does look funny when you line it up, but none of those softball questions mean anything related to promoting whatever the &quot;celeb&quot; is promoting, so what is the real issue? What are they conspiring to gain leverage on? </p>

<p>I also think it&#39;s more likely for someone to type something to someone they possibly idolize or just see a celeb and then think their question isn&#39;t good enough so they could delete and just happens the woman who sits and refreshing the thread over and over and is digging through looking for non repeat questions, or questions about a topic that is beaten to death. </p>

<p>It also seems strange to me that people would ask a question, promptly delete it, after which the celebrity would still see it and then feel inclined to answer it.

<p>Now I&#39;m honestly wondering how much of the stuff you see in an AMA is bogus. Easy to suspect that the first 10 or 20 questions are restricted to users who won&#39;t ask any &quot;difficult&quot; questions. Anything after that likely never gets seen by whoever&#39;s doing the AMA anyways.</p>

My problem is that it is obviously being done and when I point it out the mods banned me permanently from the AMA subreddit.

    <div class="md"><p>This is not a conspiracy. I think this is a great sub posts like this, and I&#39;m glad it was posted.  But if this is true, reddit&#39;s actions are not illegal, nor are they inappropriate. I&#39;ve been in the marketing &amp; media industry for a decade now. I was also a journalist for a while. </p>

<p>Guaranteeing someone the ability to answer some softball questions during an interview is a great way to gain partnerships, get page views, and possibly make some money. Even if the owners want to use their power to sway public opinion, they are free to do so. Every other media company does it. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t like the practices of reddit build your own damn website. </p>

This is the classic sign of a conspiracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I suppose you could describe this is a conspiracy, but it just seems like something I would willing do myself. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I see the ethical dilemma, but in this case, I don&#39;t really see a problem. </p>

<p>I interviewed city and county officials all the time. The editor always gave me some questions that I had to ask, and the person getting interviewed did many times. There&#39;s no way I would have admitted it at the time, because that&#39;s part of the game. </p>

<p>Reddit does questionable things all the time. All media companies do. The ability to abuse your own platform is simply too tempting for humans. Don&#39;t get me wrong though, good on you for calling them out and telling your story. I just don&#39;t think this one is that big of a deal. </p>

<p>I enjoy the service reddit provides, and the extra money they make from paid AMA&#39;s is much less intrusive than most advertising platforms.  So what if the company makes money from it. </p>

<p>And so what if they don&#39;t scream THIS AMA WAS PAID FOR BY .... , I think its just kind of assumed.  This is a scandal more along the lines of the WWF not being completely real or reality tv shows being scripted and heavily edited.     </p>

<p>If that&#39;s your definition and understanding of the word spam, I&#39;m curious.. do you just try to make words fit what you want, or do you think you&#39;re using the same lexicon as everyone else?</p>
