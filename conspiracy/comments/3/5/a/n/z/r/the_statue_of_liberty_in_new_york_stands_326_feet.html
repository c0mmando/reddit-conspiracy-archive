       "The distance at which lights can be seen at sea entirely disposes of the idea that we are living on a huge ball." -Thomas Winship
      </p>
      <p>
       NASA and modern astronomers claim we are living on an oblate spheroid 25,000 statute miles in equatorial circumference with a curvature of 7.395 inches to the mile, varying inversely as the square of the distance, meaning in 3 miles there is a declination of nearly 6 feet, in 30 miles 600 feet, in 300 miles 60,000 feet and so on. Therefore, if we wish to prove or disprove the validity of their convexity claim, it is a fairly simple, straight forward matter of measurements and calculations.

       You posted fake math.
      </p>
      <p>
       60 mile hypotenuse * sin(2Pi * 60 mile arc / 25000 mile circumference) = 84 feet.
      </p>
      <p>
       At sixty miles, you should be able to see 326 feet - 84 feet = 242 feet of the Statue.
      </p>
      <p>
       I rounded up or approximated up at every step.  60 mile hypotenuse is an over-approximation of what underlies the 60 mile arc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The math you posted is simply wrong.  It's basic trig to get the correct answer.

       Lmao! oh oh. I guess I MUST be a shill. After all I and science disagree with you.   How about taking a boat ride on the ocean. You'll see it too. Or you can get a decent model rocket with a camera on the tip.  Launch it high enough you'll see the curvature yourself.  So there two things you can personally do to see yourself.

       Ooo a sign. Sounds like you've dismissed me as a shill already. Would it actually matter what I say? Like really. If you dismiss scientists, science, and people who have been in international waters, or people like me who lives in the middle of the plains and see the curve daily what could I possibly say that would convince you?  All satellite photos are fake. Back during the cold war ussr and USA hated each other yet agreed on a round earth. Anyone with good access to space are liers. Well cui bono?

       Why are you trying to convince me of anything? If the truth is on your side you need only provide me with the information that should change my mind. You've avoided direct reproducible evidence that I have presented you with, information that should change your mind, and instead you respond with hysterics and hyperbole.

       Haha, each time there is a skip the camera moves further away (watch the horizon itself get further away as you can see more water in between), and closer to the water, and then the ship disappears into the fog. I must come to the conclusion that you haven't spent nearly as much time at sea as I have if you can't see that immediately and think the effect shown in this video is convincing or matches real life observations.

       Seriously??!?!?!?! Really? !?!? It's edited for time.  It took over an hour to dissappear.  No one would sit through that unedited. Got any pictures of the edge of the earth?  How does the water not fall right off the edge? What's on the other side of the earth?  You claim proof but only have provided bad math, and poor logic. If I sent you to space to show you. Somehow you'd argue with your own eyes
