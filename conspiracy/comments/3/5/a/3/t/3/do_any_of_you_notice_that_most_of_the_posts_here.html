       FUN FACT: I am one of THOUSANDS who worked on HAARP. Every time you idiots say something with "HAARP" I immediately stop reading for my own sanity. (HAARP's purpose is not "secret" and while the project is finished, you could and still can GET A FUCKING UNRESTRICTED TOUR OF THE FACILITIES! YES EVEN WHILE IT WAS LIVE)
      </p>
      <p>
       There are enough REAL threats, and REAL people with REAL "conspiracies" that work against your interests, without idiots making shit up.

       Please learn to check facts.

       some of the theories posted in this sub are as unsubstantiated as your claim of being one of the thousands of people who worked on the hub. Based on the principle of compartmentalization of information unless you were upper management or a senior director then you may not know as much as you think you do about the reasons for HAARPs implementation. You could be completely right but you could also be completely wrong. This is a forum for discussion and debate on topics that don't fit into predetermined narratives.... to call people idiots for questioning and dissenting against some of these ideas is just ignorant. Be thankful we have a place to discuss these issues that no one else seems to cover (albeit in a heavily censored manner). I don't claim to be an expert on HAARP or any other topic but at least information is provided on this sub through which individuals can do their own due diligence and look into it more.

       A "dissenting opinion" based on sheer ignorance of ALL the facts, INCLUDING science itself, is not the same as me claiming to be part of the HAARP project.

       To be fair, there's already a sub that deals with real, fact-based conspiracies (r/actualconspiracies) and anything that's fact-based and isn't a conspiracy doesn't belong here. So what happens is that a lot of stuff just gets made up so it can be discussed. Otherwise, it'd be a very barren subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't r/science or anything. It's mostly just a hobby sub.

       You don't even know what my position on HAARP is... All I said to you was that just because you worked there, doesn't mean that they clued you in to every one of their objectives.

       Based on your evident intelligence level, I'm going to go ahead and take a guess that you never really even worked there anyway. Nor do you know anything about "science".

       Have all the "doubts" you like. Reality doesn't care.

       YOU are the ones making the claims about technology you know nothing about. You'll parrot whatever Alex Jones or "Natural News" says, and that's the extent you will go toward any actual knowledge.

       I know you REALLY want HAARP to be something "bad", but it isn't and never was. Have all the tantrums you like. It won't make your self-made delusions any more real.

       a lot of harrp is benign but if the US navy is funding the bulk of the research then there is certainly some benefit in it for them. 
at best you are claiming you were at some point a cog in the machine hell i would be shocked if you were any where even close to the facility.

       HAARP is a very scary piece of science that can be paraded in the open because no one understand what it is capable of.

      <p>
       the fact this was only a test facility is what makes it so frightening.

       just being able to heat the atmosphere makes it able to modify weather patterns which imho is a recipe for disaster, and you can not say anything to change my mind that if the navy is involved in the project they see an offensive use for it

       You should calm down a bit. You could have posted something worthwhile about what you know about HAARP and why you don't think it's a conspiracy, and listed the things you think people
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       care and worry about, but instead, you jump in here, frothing at the mouth like a crazy person, calling people names.
