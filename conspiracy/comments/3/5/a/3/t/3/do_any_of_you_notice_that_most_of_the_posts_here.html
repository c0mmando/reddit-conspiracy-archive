<p>FUN FACT: I am one of THOUSANDS who worked on HAARP. Every time you idiots say something with &quot;HAARP&quot; I immediately stop reading for my own sanity. (HAARP&#39;s purpose is not &quot;secret&quot; and while the project is finished, you could and still can GET A FUCKING UNRESTRICTED TOUR OF THE FACILITIES! YES EVEN WHILE IT WAS LIVE)</p>

<p>There are enough REAL threats, and REAL people with REAL &quot;conspiracies&quot; that work against your interests, without idiots making shit up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>some of the theories posted in this sub are as unsubstantiated as your claim of being one of the thousands of people who worked on the hub. Based on the principle of compartmentalization of information unless you were upper management or a senior director then you may not know as much as you think you do about the reasons for HAARPs implementation. You could be completely right but you could also be completely wrong. This is a forum for discussion and debate on topics that don&#39;t fit into predetermined narratives.... to call people idiots for questioning and dissenting against some of these ideas is just ignorant. Be thankful we have a place to discuss these issues that no one else seems to cover (albeit in a heavily censored manner). I don&#39;t claim to be an expert on HAARP or any other topic but at least information is provided on this sub through which individuals can do their own due diligence and look into it more. </p>
