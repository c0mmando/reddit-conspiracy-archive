       Something is fishy with social networking sites like twitter and facebook. Innocuous talk about "White pride" and concern about demographic decline of the White population is deemed to be "hate" by Twitter  and other social networking sites. Yet, actual ISIS terrorists are said to have a huge social media presence and are able to repeatedly post actual violent and threatening videos and all the msm does is give their online presence even more exposure:
      </p>

       <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/07/twitter-blocks-promoted-tweets-white-supremacist-weev-auernheimer">
        Twitter blocks promoted tweets by notorious white supremacist
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Among the tweets promoted by Auernheimer was one that read:
        <em>
         “Whites need to stand up for one another and defend ourselves from violence and discrimination. Our race is dying.”
        </em>
        A second promoted tweet read:
        <em>
         “White pride, world wide. Do you know the 14 words?”
        </em>
        – a reference to the white nationalist credo: “We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.”
       </p>
       <p>
        But a further attempt to promote the first tweet a day later led to a rejection from Twitter, which cited a ban on ads dealing with hate content, sensitive topics and violence.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Those tweets are deemed to be hateful and violate twitter's terms of service. Meanwhile, according to the ABC news program Nightline, actual terrorists from IS are purported to have a huge presence on Twitter and Facebook.
       </strong>
       They post actual violent and threatening videos and the major television networks are willing to air these promotional videos (albeit with a critical or 'concerned' tone) on network news broadcasts:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/nightline/listing/2015-05/07-nightline-050715-how-us-officials-say-isis-uses-social-media-to-recruit">
        Nightline 05/07/15: How US Officials Say ISIS Uses Social Media to Recruit
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder if this is occurring with clandestine support from Facebook and Twitter? Even if there was an army of terrorist shills posting content from unique ip addresses why give them so much exposure in the msm? In one form or another, the western media has been regurgitating this story of the terrorist groups maintaining a major presence on social networking media and having a huge array of slickly produced recruiting videos for many months now.
      </p>
      <p>
       My hunch is that the IS terrorists are still receiving support from intelligence services and all the msm talk of their slick promotional videos is intended to get useful idiots and patsies to go searching for these terrorist promotional videos.

       Well theres lots of different white people coming from different culture.

      <p>
       Irish,French,dutch,German,Russian

      <p>
       So white pride doesn't really make sense.

       Black pride makes sense since this is the u.s.a and their struggle is obvious

       Asian pride is pride in their culture

       Latino pride is pride in their culture

      <p>
       Jewish pride is pride in their culture

       This.  Our 'race' is human, or humanoid if some of us end up not even being from 'here' (see the recent RH negative non-human DNA study findings).  Our only real difference is what
       <em>
        tribe

       we come from, there are hundreds of tribes all across the globe, these tribes are what are referred to as the 'nations' in the book of Revelations.  Each tribe, like each individual has it's own story and it's own place in the dance.

       Yes I agree with that but its a good place to start when you want to get involved into community. If we lived in a perfect society yeah people would find out culture is just corporations instilling values to a people.

       Because you don't know what you are talking about.

       White pride makes as much sense as Asian pride.
You need to educate yourself before you post crap that logically makes no sense.
If you can't take criticism, don't post crap.

       Yeah but its enough of a difference to give an idea. Since one is actually pointing out their race instead of their skin color.  I'm writing on mobile on a public forum I'm not going to write an essay , its just an idea.   But its not that big of a stretch to understand...
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't take a sociology expert to tell you "white isn't a culture". Black american is a culture. America is a culture , the people complaining about not being able to use white power are as dumb as a bag of rocks.
      </p>

       Me I mixed up some words . cause it sounds like I k ow what I'm talking about. Pointing out the fact that japenese and China relationship suck doesn't make me gasp in awe over your intelligence.
      </p>

       I just didn't get as specific as you would have like. If that's the case stop bitching and wasting our time.

       White Americans is as much a culture as black America.

       So, black pride and white pride have the same validity.
Pride movements only divide people.

       White Americans is just america.
      </p>
      <p>
       Black american were brought to this country differently, they lived in different places, ate different food, were treated different. This created a culture. This is seperated from america its own culture. Still American but not black america
      </p>
      <p>
       Black Americans definitely have a right to have a different culture while still being america. Anything else are just towns and city with high immigrant count like China town.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you wanna say white pride it just doesn't make sense. It would have to be caucasion pride, European pride, French pride.  Mexicans don't say brown pride usually lol Asians don't say yellow pride.

       So, racism is ok but only against whites.
Rural whites have never been oppressed and Appalachians have all the same opportunities as all other Americans.  And, do not have their own culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       I disagree.  All racism is wrong and is used by TPTB to divide those they take advantage of.

       Yeah I agree in a perfect world we would know that culture is corporations instilling value in a people. Is the super simplistic explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I feel we still need culture to get Involved in the community.
      </p>
      <p>
       If white people in america feel oppressed then I definitley don't understand.

       I was replying to that guys complaint of not being able to use white power.
      </p>
      <p>
       I said it doesn't make sense pride is a culture thing not a skin thing. Asians aren't saying yellow power they are saying their respective culture pride.
      </p>
      <p>
       So white pride is just american pride. Black pride is black american pride. They have their own culture.

       Your biases are glaring. Your racism is impeccable. The way you selectively choose what is allowed to be racist or not is laughable. Sorry, but you've kind of fallen into this way of thinking that's designed to divide the people, and further the exploitation of the common man.

       As I said I already agree that culture is corporations Instilling values on a people. In a perfect world but its not. I feel culture has benifits as of right now. Getting involved in community etc.Yeah but if your american why say you have white pride? Its not being proud of your culture or country its being proud in your skin
Black american pride is about culture. The culture black americans have created in america that isn't part of the status quo american culture.
Mexicans have culture, different Asian races have different culture. But no one says yellow pride.
There's no other way to label it its gotta be black american pride.
If your white then you celebrate your own culture , if its american culture,irish culture,German,dutch. But white pride doesn't make sense. For it to make sense its gotta be american pride or caucasion pride. Get it? I'm not against it, it just doesnt make sense.

       Okay. This comment explains my ignorance ? Then those people should have american pride since they were born in america with american culture. White pride doesn't make sense. So do you want white pride or Caucasian pride.
My whole fucking point is those people should just go with american pride... Continue calling me a dumb ass please. For such a boring opinion.

       Black american pride makes sense because the history is different the culture is different their environment is different.  So comes the title. African american. But reddit says that is considered offensive?

In the 18th century they were sent to the American colonies, and in the early 19th century to Australia.[22][23] The Irish were dehumanised by the English, described as savages, so making their displacement appear all the more justified.
        </strong>
        [24] In 1654 the British parliament gave Oliver Cromwell a free hand to banish Irish "undesirables". Cromwell rounded up Catholics throughout the Irish countryside and placed them on ships bound for the Caribbean, mainly Barbados. Records suggest that priests may have been routinely tortured and executed. By 1655, 12,000 political prisoners had been forcibly shipped to Barbados.[25]

       Your entire point about "Black Pride" being "viable" was based upon their history of enslavement, and the systemic abuse they suffered right?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have cited undisputed sources, and accounts of Whites suffering the very same abuse... over a much longer time-frame and you are still actually attempting to claim "White Pride doesn't apply"?

       Yes the abuse they suffered in america. Its not the only factor when it comes to black culture in america.  I did not know white people were enslaved to the extent of black people. I thought american white slavery were for just a few white people who couldn't pay off debts.

       No cause they weren't born in Africa. Their ancestry is from america. Its black american culture. Its black american pride. There is no other way to label it. Through out the hundreds of years they have created their own culture in the country. Black americans. Black pride.  White pride makes no sense if your parents immigrateds from here and all you know is america then your american with american pride. You don't have white pride it makes no sense.

       Yeah but if your american why say you have white pride? Its not being proud of your culture or country its being proud in your skin
Black american pride is about culture. The culture black americans have created in america that isn't part of the status quo american culture.
Mexicans have culture, different Asian races have different culture. But no one says yellow pride.
There's no other way to label it its gotta be black american pride.
If your white then you celebrate your own culture , if its american culture,irish culture,German,dutch. But white pride doesn't make sense. For it to make sense its gotta be american pride or caucasion pride. Get it? I'm not against it, it just doesnt make sense. But please tell me a out the struggle.

       Um, yes it is about being proud of my culture and country. But thanks for trying to pretend like you know what I'm proud about, dumb ass lmfao.

       There is no "status quo american culture". You're living in a dreamworld in your mind that does not exist in reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're basically a retard who thinks we don't have a culture, or that our culture (which is the most advanced ever, period) isn't worth being proud of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said I don't care what your clearly mentally deficient and thick-skulled ass thinks is a worthy culture. White and PROUD.

       Uh I have never said white people don't have culture... They have culture everywhere.  American culture,German,dutch,French,Irish.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is normal american culture , there is black american culture these are the main ones in america.  White pride is just patriotism focusing on just skin color.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's the difference between patriotism and white power lol one is just focusing on your skin its not focusing on culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not shitting on french, German or any white culture I'm a shitting on people that think black american pride is the same as white power.... Its not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean there's saint Patrick's day, 4th of July , Halloween.  I know what culture is and I'm not saying white people don't have culture I'm asking you specify it.

       White power doesn't make sense without it being offensive.

       Ah yes the monolithic "asian" culture.  Just bring this up with any Chinese person, for example, and let them tell you how they are exactly the same, culturally, as the Japanese.  Your attempt to inject some logic into the discussion has only heaped on a new layer of ignorance and confusion.

       It was a mix up of  words I should  used countries but it still gives the same idea. Pride in a culture not pride in your skin color.  But it still stands its culture. Asians have culture I don't have to specify what specific culture.

       I said its a mix up of words. i should of used countries. I wasn't trying to homegnize an ethnic group.I fthought I didn't need to write down 100% of the basics. When I say Asian culture I'm already thinking  they know about the different regions. I didn't wanna write 15 countries...  That's pretty much it. My point was  white pride makes no sense in america . its either has to be caucasion pride or american pride

       Yeah but if your american why say you have white pride? Its not being proud of your culture or country its being proud in your skin
      </p>
      <p>
       Black american pride is about culture. The culture black americans have created in america that isn't part of the status quo american culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mexicans have culture, different Asian races have different culture. But no one says yellow pride.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no other way to label it its gotta be black american pride.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your white then you celebrate your own culture , if its american culture,irish culture,German,dutch. But white pride doesn't make sense. For it to make sense its gotta be american pride or caucasion pride. Get it? I'm not against it, it just doesnt make sense.

       Black pride is a reference to their culture in america you can't really label it another way. Black culture exist. We could call it African american pride. But we know people on reddit ( mostly white) think that's offensive...?.
      </p>
      <p>
       White pride is only pride in your skin if it was pride for your country then its just patriotism or German pride,Irish pride, French pride
      </p>
      <p>
       Black american pride is pride in the cultures that has come out of america.  White pride is only describing pride in skin color.
      </p>
      <p>
       Asian cultures don't say yellow pride
      </p>
      <p>
       Black power came out of the black panther age and they did need a slogan like that at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are white and wanna have pride say your a patriot or your respective heritage\culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes more sense to say caucasion pride or European pride. You don't really get a clear picture with white pride it just sounds offensive.  Here in america black pride comes with a more complete picture you don't automatically think their rascist as fuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       Black pride is hard to label in america. Mexicans don't usually say brown pride and Asians don't usually say yellow pride. This is situational

       Yeah but its confusing and its like being proud on having your skin not brown or black.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people say white pride  confusing. I mean they could mean america but its a shitty way of describing it. Their just telling me they like their white skin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Black pride comes with a lot more context and tells me they have pride in what their ancestors did in that country and they recognize the atrocities and struggles of their culture in this country.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you say your a patriot or have american pride then the picture is much clearer.
Its not confusing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Black pride is an old saying we have come to accept what it means. White power is an old saying we know what it means. White pride is newish and its just confusing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess the only doubt i have in my arguement which I'm still standing by 100% is can you have black american pride but still be a patriot. Its kinda conflicting.

       Then I still don't know what it means. Do white people just want to separate themselves from the rest of america and call it white pride.  White people have modern day america. Be a proud american IMO. Makes a lot more sense. Damn I didn't think it would be such a contraversial opinion. I didn't know white pride\power picked up so much steam.

       True true.  Black pride in america is an anomaly. IMO a justified one.   I can definitely tell white people would be confused if they didn't really know the black community that well.  When they respond with " well I got white pride so there"

       Your sn caught my interest so I browsed your submitted links for gonewild posts and noticed you posted to the sub for Last Man on Earth. Did you find that show to not be blatant anti-white propaganda? Race mixiing, the desirability of the ethnic Phil who took Tandy's name, his woman and his community? He was physically superior, smarter, less fucking weird and schizo, not obese and perfect in every way?

       Anti-White propaganda?  Nope.  However I was not surprised at all when Black Phil resorted to violence to solve his problems.  And if you've seen the season finale, you know Carol wisely chooses White Phil as a partner.
      </p>
      <p>
       I even found the show to have some pretty strong Christian messages: Phil (White Phil) prays to God a lot and God answers him maybe not verbally, but definitely with actions.  Carol insists Phil marry her before repopulating so their children aren't bastards.  And of course, Phil's selfish attempts to bed Melissa cause him trouble because he lusts after his neighbor's "wife"  or wife equivalent, whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was impressed with some of the positive messages, tbh and that's why I kept watching it.

       Right, Alpha fucks, Beta bucks. She bred with the ethnic phil and took off with white phil for security.

      <p>
       Which worked. Weak white kooky alternately religious and agnostic Phil lost his civilization to superior force. White Phil lacked the killer instinct and instead succumbed to superior force and gets to keep his philandering girlfriend who he did not win, but whom granted him her companionship after she answered the Call of the Wild. She got to sow her oats, now Tandy can be granted his desire. Which is to create his civilization. Which now has to be away from his hometown, the town he lived in his entire life, and rebuild elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope the show never comes back but if it does put me down for Carol having been knocked up by black Phil.

       Carol clearly preferred White Phil as a mate and companion.  I'm not writing White Phil off yet.  Television seasons often end on a cliffhanger and I look forward to seeing White Phil return victorious to Tucson to find Black Phil and Whatsername gone.

       Preferred doesn't mean anything after action. That's the same as telling your lover you didn't have feelings for the person you cheated with. The womb is the battleground, not the heart or neocortex or whatever.

       And a womb is nothing by itself.  It's a jar, a vessel, and a small part of a whole person.  I don't feel like a womb is that big a deal.

       That being said, I would not have slept with Black Phil, but I understand why Carol did.  Revenge, she wanted to boost her self esteem (also gross) and she wanted to one up the other two women because they wanted Black Phil. I don't agree with her actions, but I understand where they come from.

       You're an animal. Your purpose is to survive until you can reproduce. Everything else is an indulgence. Same goes for men. Same goes for every living thing. It's base, it's primal.

       I mean you identify yourself willfully as an object of beauty and desire. Not just a qt, but a bombshell, the descriptor beyond all other descriptor with regards to female attractiveness. You may think yourself more of a desirable breeding ground than you're willing to acknowledge. I don't see the negative if you do.

       Sorry but your DNA has to be passed down the same as a dog or a musk melon, through reproduction. And that involves some traditional animal-style tomfoolery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also God made us equal to the animals. We were never supposed to know the what we know, that is why we are fallen. It was the serpent who tempted us the forbidden fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. Knowing good from evil is the only thing that separates man from beast. And it's a gift from the devil himself.

       If ordinary white people care more about their race than they do about signaling how tolerant and not-racist they are, the scheme falls apart. And if people start looking into how things got so bad, well Shlomo's gonna have some splainin to do.

       ISIS isn't a threat at all. They are right on the Syrian border of Israel. They do not attack the Jews. Israel lets them come in and out, giving them medical treatment and supplies. Mossad and CIA made ISIS. They are an arm of the Jewish beast.

       Dude you need to educate yourself to the real truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you honestly think European Whites/Caucasians have not been treated to the exact same conditions of slavery, and systemic abuse as blacks?

       This is just an example of the Irish.  We can go deeper into the Scots, and many other whites that were enslaved and abused by a feudal lord system over centuries as well.

      <p>
       Try educating yourself beyond what the laughably skewed historical record that Jewllywood spoon-feeds Americans

       Yep I've said like a million times on this thread lol I'm also against culture and in a perfect world people would see culture is just corporation instilling values on a people. I completely understand.

       I was just talking about how people shouldn't complain about this whole white pride\power debacle.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't make sense.  Alteast use it correctly in context and say caucasion pride or German pride. White pride is weird in response to black american pride
