<p>Oh yeah, see the &quot;screen mesh&quot; when you zoom in? Yeah, that proves it was taken by the Mars rover. Yeah....</p>

<p>This is the opposite of science. Science is about questioning things. I question this photo and I find it dangerous that millions of people will refuse to question it and then gang up on anyone who does. 
<strong>That is the kind of mentality that has historically caused scientific progress to slow down or go backwards.</strong></p>

<p>Who said the photo is &#39;science&#39;? It isnt. Its a photo that NASA has released for people to enjoy. A photo is not science.</p>

<p>You say nothing about it indicates it isnt Earth? You&#39;re wrong. Clearly the size of the sun indicates it isnt Earth.</p>

<p>Why would they release the photo if it wasn&#39;t genuine? </p>

<p>To make gullible people like you think that we really have rovers on Mars so you will continue to support NASA.  Also I did watch the whole press conference and
if you think that Adam Steltzner is a legit (high school drop out) &quot;rocket scientist&quot; that was in charge of sending the rovers to Mars than you can&#39;t think for yourself.</p>

<p>You probably believe that Neil and Buzz really walked on the Moon too, lol?  I don&#39;t understand why people still think that NASA is different from any other aspect of the Government and is actually honest.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there&#39;s one thing Americans are crazy about it&#39;s NASA. People are just <em>rabid</em> NASA fans. In high school every single kid wants to grow up to be an astronaut because these big time astronauts are in their face all day. They know if they can just get onto the right space crew their whole lives will be different. They will get big endorsements from shoe companies. They can buy their mom that new house she&#39;s always wanted.</p>

<p>The thing is, this focus on space can distract kids from their schoolwork, and society is okay with it. Student astronauts can let their grades slide and the schools will just hire tutors for them. If they get caught in minor crimes the police will let them off the hook because they are such big space nerd fans. What&#39;s worse is that even in domestic violence incidents astronauts often get away with it. Hell, there was a case in Steubenville, Ohio where a bunch of teen astronauts sexually assaulted a girl and school officials helped cover it up. That&#39;s how obsessed with NASA this country is. </p>

<p>In a way it&#39;s just a ruse to help them escape the doldrums of their day-to-day life. It keeps them from talking about important issues because they are focused on what NASA is up to. What astronaut is going to what space crew and whatnot. As for me I don&#39;t worry about that stuff, but I can understand why people do. I would have saved a lot of money on college if I&#39;d had one of those big space scholarships, but I just had my little academic scholarship that barely paid for books.</p>

<p>No you wouldn&#39;t, because you won&#39;t accept anything I could possibly provide as evidence.</p>

<p>For instance, I could post this video of the Red Bull space jump where you can clearly see a rounded planet below him when he jumps. But I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll tell me it&#39;s fake. I already know there&#39;s nothing I could say to you to &quot;prove the earth is round&quot; to you, because anything that does must obviously be faked.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt0QuBsGU20">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt0QuBsGU20</a></p>

<p>How bout someone goes to space or does a really high jump like this that shows a flat earth? Why not send a balloon up and take shots of the flat Earth? There are high school kids who send these balloons up with cellphone cameras that get pictures of the curvature of the Earth... Why can&#39;t a single flat earther do that? Is it because they are wrong, or because they can&#39;t come up with the massive cash needed of like $300?</p>

<p>But whatever, I won&#39;t respond anymore. Arguing with a flat earther is pointless. You&#39;re either a troll or insane. Either way not worth talking to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Finally, someone with the balls to announce to the entire world that they are the biggest imaginable buffoon; someone willing to do Olympic-level mental gymnastics to believe in a nonsense conspiracy theory with no conceivable whatsoever reason for being perpetrated.</p>

<p>One that would require millions of perfectly obedient conspirators and carefully orchestrated efforts, all day every day, for hundreds of years. What will be the reward for this undertaking, the greatest hoax in the history of the human race? Nothing whatsoever. That&#39;s right, the greatest act of magic in all of human history is basically being actively perpetrated by millions of people, costing trillions of dollars, requiring unwavering loyalty without any semblance of an information leak... for no reason at all. Brilliant, it&#39;s a shame that a top mind such as yourself will never find himself in a position of power greater than &quot;gas station attendant,&quot; because if you were, we could really see some interesting and dynamic changes in this (completely flat) prison planet.</p>

<p>What&#39;s on the other side of this pancake that we all live on, I wonder? Why can&#39;t I use a telescope to see Japan, or the back of my own head for that matter? Given my understanding of your bold scientific theory, there&#39;s no reason I can&#39;t. Why is it that only lunatic fringe neckbeards would ever deign to espouse such a crackpot belief, I wonder... you would think that SOMEONE in a position of some respect would at least hint at this incredible revelation.

<p>NASA was created by Nazi scientists.  Do you really think they just changed there ideology just because they got a new color flag?  Of course not.  </p>

<p>Apparently you&#39;ve never researched into the moon landing either? 
Why have we not been back in almost 50 years? 
Why have we never put a women on the moon?<br/>
Why did the Russians quite and never land a Cosmonaut on the moon? 
 How did they get through the Van Allen radiation belts?  </p>

<p>How did NASA lose all the 14,000 reels of telemetry data (the data that tells exactly how the made it to the moon).  The biggest event in human history and they lose all the data??? 
I could go on and on about how obvious the scam is and I&#39;m not trying to be mean to you at all, I&#39;m just saying I know that you haven&#39;t researched very far into NASA if you still trust them.</p>

<p>Because no women were in the program back then, because all of the guys were former air force pilots and test pilots, and women did not do that during that era.</p>

<p>Waste of money. There is no value on the moon itself, the only value was being the first there and they lost. Why waste billions and billions of dollars to go kick some dirt around? Even by the end of our own Apollo program the moon landings and launches weren&#39;t even really being watched on TV. People lost interest.</p>

<p>Coincidence? No, just a terrible fuck-up. You focus on that, but what about the rocks we brought back that have been distributed to hundreds of institutions and countries around the world for study? They didn&#39;t just lock them away, they gave a lot of them out. None of those people have come back and said they were terrestrial.</p>

<p>And what about the reflectors we left on the surface that are still used today to accurately track the movements of the Moon? Again, this is something numerous institutions use and it&#39;s not some NASA secret.</p>

<p>No. Rockets are still rockets, and they are still extremely expensive. Have passenger jets changed much from the 70s? Not really. Still shaped the same, still expensive to build, still use the same fuel, still have same types of wings, etc. They might have some lighter materials but that&#39;s about it. Going to the moon or anywhere in space still takes an extreme amount of thrust from a rocket which requires fuel. SpaceX is working on making launching payloads cheaper by re-using the first stage, but it&#39;s a complicated process and they are still working on it. That will just make it cheaper, not more &quot;efficient&quot;.</p>

<p>The Saturn V rocket that took astronauts to the moon, to this day, are still the most powerful rocket ever made. That&#39;s how big and powerful they were... but that was extremely expensive, and in today&#39;s dollars, it would cost even more. And for what again, going back somewhere we&#39;ve already been that doesn&#39;t really have anything interesting right now and zero return on investment?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You assume I&#39;m not aware of that, but I am. I know they think that was faked, and it certainly appears that way. But we are talking about whether the US went to the moon or not, not whether China faked a spacewalk or not, right? China launching a probe that can take pictures is drastically different than a manned spacewalk. Also the probe was from 2010, the walk was from years before that. China landed a tiny rover on the moon last year too. Again, far less complicated than manned space flight. You&#39;re also ignoring the information from India and Japan by only focusing on China. Kind of a weak when you have to ignore everything else in that source. But that&#39;s what people do best here!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Your initial claim they lost all of the data was false by the way. The only thing that&#39;s missing are the original Apollo 11 tapes, which was one mission of many. The only thing of value they lost was the SSTV that was embedded on the tapes. The telemetry data was still recorded elsewhere. You seem to be claiming they lost ALL of it which isn&#39;t even the accusation most conspiracy theorists make. And you tell me that I haven&#39;t researched any of this? At least get your &quot;facts&quot; straight if you&#39;re going to reference it.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11_missing_tapes">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11_missing_tapes</a></p>

<p>And you blindly trust a lack of evidence and conspiracy sites... why is that superior? I&#39;ll take NASA, every other space agency in the world, and thousands of scientific institutes and researches throughout the globe who have plenty of evidence for the moon landings. But &quot;LOL&quot; all you want at me online, because everyone else is &quot;LOLing&quot; at you in real life or anywhere else other then this little hole you people post in here.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t bother replying anymore. It&#39;s pointless. Believe whatever you want and LOL all you want.</p>

<p>Space is interesting to me, and because I tend to peruse threads which are relevant to my interests, I end up reading threads about space. That&#39;s sort of how these newfangled internet discussion boards work.</p>

<p>2) Stuff floats upward in that video. Underwater, you are still affected by gravity. Stuff goes down. Stuff doesn&#39;t go upwards. </p>

<p>3) You can see there is no water pressure affecting the astronauts clothing. They are clearly in a vacuum. </p>

<p>4) Those are not air bubbles. They are debris, as clearly demonstrated by the fact they travel in different directions and in perfectly straight lines. I&#39;m sure that if it was a fake, such obvious &#39;flaws&#39; would be edited out. </p>

<p>This is simply the case of an uneducated moron seeing what he <em>wants</em> to believe. </p>

Regardless of what their ideals were, they achieved a huge amount, like the fucking jet engine.

    <div class="md"><p>The people that believe that the Mars Rover mission is real have never actually researched into it for themselves, guaranteed.  It is the worst acting job ever.  The Mars team leader Adam Steltzner is an absolute joke!  He is supposedly a high school drop out rock n roller turned rocket scientist with no explanation of how he made it to Mars rover team leader status.  That&#39;s because he&#39;s just a bad actor that has no clue about the Mars mission.</p>

<p>Here is a Mars Hoax video that is must watch (it&#39;s about 23:00 long)
if you don&#39;t want to watch the whole thing (which you should if you believe this scam) at least watch from around 15:00 or so and listen to the Adam Steltzner character not be able to answer any questions during the press conference.
<a href="https://youtu.be/U5_Il2tAT7U?t=1s">https://youtu.be/U5_Il2tAT7U?t=1s</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, indeed I thought that (terrible) video was strange.</p>

<p>So I went and watched the entire press conference <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HbBHASu7H8">here</a>.</p>

<p>When you watch the whole thing, it is nowhere near as strange. Yeah, he&#39;s a bit awkward and clearly not comfortable (I&#39;m a team leader, but hate speaking in front of large groups as well).</p>

<p>But the reason he cant answer many of the questions is because he simply doesnt have the data yet. The thing literally just touched down and all they have is the grainy thumbnail image. Another scientist says they will receive more data in about 25 minutes. If you listen to his full answer to the question about OD278, rather than just the snippet that the video above uses to purposefully make him look stupid, he actually has quite a good and intelligent answer.</p>

<p>The reason he cant answer the question about the image compression used is that he simply doesnt know - thats not his area. And a fairly minor detail in the grand scheme of things.</p>

<p>The other scientists are more comfortable in front of the cameras and answer the questions well.</p>

<p>If this is your best evidence that the Mars landing is fake, after looking at the full press conference, I&#39;m not convinced at all.</p>

<p>He was only the director of the landing procedures. Think of him like a project manager. There were hundreds of people who came up with different aspects and stages of that landing procedure, he was just kind of the &quot;manager&quot;.

<p>No no no! He&#39;d dropped out of high school!! There&#39;s no way a dropout can ever succeed in life! Those credentials are fake!!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When asked to describe his job he says just imagine Ed Harris! </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, he gives an appropriate response for the interview- especially as the questions pertained more to who they were as people than the minutiae of their work. Having  younger, not robotic-science-nerds is good for the future life of the program and that&#39;s why these people are well liked.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll have to put forth more convincing evidence other than your basica incredulity at the behaviour of a few involved people on an NPR interview.</p>

<p>You have shown me ZERO credentials or evidence of his &quot;degrees&quot; at a Universe-ity.  Besides the degrees that you haven&#39;t shown me what I care about far more is what he has to say.  I guarantee that he has never done any interviews that he gives details about anything.  You need more evidence that these guys have any clue of how to get a rover to Mars and the details behind it, because it&#39;s obvious they don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>HAHAHA</p>

<p>What do you want??? A scanned picture of his diploma? Pictures of him doing a kegstand with the boys from Kappa Kappa Phi? Shall I call up his mother and asked if she still has any photos lying around of Convocation Day? How can I prove that Stephen Hawking ever went to Univeristy?? He&#39;s a hack I tell you.</p>

<p>YOU were the one who claimed he had no credentials!</p>

<p>Hm, I wonder if he&#39;s even been interviewed by anyone who isn&#39;t a Pop-sci radio show?</p>

<p>Oh wait! He has! And they&#39;re readily available!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Sounds like good old fashioned incredulity. Basic public statements aimed at a broad audience are somehow evidence for them not knowing anything?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Paulstal Service video of the Mars fakery news conference was the final nail in the coffin for me. It is no longer on his YouTube channel, as far as I can tell, but is available here:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgoORq0AC_8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgoORq0AC_8</a></p>

<p>Anybody with any insight and understanding of basic human psychology can tell there is something terribly, terribly wrong with this press conference. It is blatantly obvious looking at these guys that the Mars Curiosity Rover project is a $6 billion scam.</p>

<p>Adam Steltzner (from around the 5 minute mark) is clearly a man who is wrestling with his conscience. For what is ostensibly the crowning moment of his career, he looks more like his favourite dog just got run over - he really, really doesn&#39;t want to talk about it. He keeps trying to bring in others to help him out. If you can&#39;t see this is a bad actor, lying through his teeth, you are basically an android.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there&#39;s one thing Americans are crazy about it&#39;s NASA. People are just <em>rabid</em> NASA fans. In high school every single kid wants to grow up to be an astronaut because these big time astronauts are in their face all day. They know if they can just get onto the right space crew their whole lives will be different. They will get big endorsements from shoe companies. They can buy their mom that new house she&#39;s always wanted.</p>

<p>The thing is, this focus on space can distract kids from their schoolwork, and society is okay with it. Student astronauts can let their grades slide and the schools will just hire tutors for them. If they get caught in minor crimes the police will let them off the hook because they are such big space nerd fans. What&#39;s worse is that even in domestic violence incidents astronauts often get away with it. Hell, there was a case in Steubenville, Ohio where a bunch of teen astronauts sexually assaulted a girl and school officials helped cover it up. That&#39;s how obsessed with NASA this country is. </p>

<p>In a way it&#39;s just a ruse to help them escape the doldrums of their day-to-day life. It keeps them from talking about important issues because they are focused on what NASA is up to. What astronaut is going to what space crew and whatnot. As for me I don&#39;t worry about that stuff, but I can understand why people do. I would have saved a lot of money on college if I&#39;d had one of those big space scholarships, but I just had my little academic scholarship that barely paid for books.</p>
