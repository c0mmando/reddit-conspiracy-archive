<p>Without 9/11 there would be no war in… (insert any country classified as part of the &quot;axis of evil&quot; or defined as being &#39;with the terrorists&#39;)</p>

<p>Without 9/11 thousands of U.S. troops would not have been sent to their deaths.</p>

<p>Without 9/11 hundreds of thousands of citizens of Iraq and Afghanistan would not have been sentenced to their deaths.</p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would be no inaction on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.</p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would be no civilian contractors in Iraq and the scandal that has followed them would have been averted.</p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would be no Camp Delta and no Camp X-ray at Guantanamo Bay.</p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would be no Military Commissions Act and no coordinated program of extraordinary rendition, indefinite detention and torture of those defined as “enemy combatants”.</p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would be no vast increase in secrecy and complete militarization of intelligence under the newly created office of the Director of National Intelligence.</p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would not be thousands of dead and dying emergency workers who are suffering crippling and fatal respiratory illnesses.</p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would be no vast increase in military and security spending that goes arm in arm with huge cutbacks in other key social programs (such as levees in New Orleans).</p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would have been no total abandonment of fiscal restraint, which has contributed to plunging the nation into an abyss of debt and looks likely to tip the world into a deep recession if not a complete depression.</p>

<p>And on and on and on.</p>

<p>Perhaps most importantly, without 9/11 there would be no &quot;post 9/11 society/mentality&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of these statements are wrong. There&#39;s no doubt 9/11 opened up the flood gates but tyranny has existed for hundreds of years. </p>

<p>Is anyone in this thread old enough to clearly remember 9/11? It was a shocking event, but the craziest thing happened in the weeks following: People united. I can&#39;t even put in to words what it felt like. Everywhere I went, when I looked someone in the eye, we just connected. We shared a bond. </p>

<p>Unfortunately we turned the bond into war. Just imagine if we took it in the other direction.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a matter of who hijacked it, it&#39;s a matter of if an air force pilot actually did his/her job on that day and succeeded in shooting it down (ie. not part of the plot).

<p>I&#39;m sorry but I genuinely think that is unbelievably absurd. With the amount of stages you need to go through to scramble a jet in the first place, you don&#39;t think this was one of the first things the cabal thought of disrupting? </p>

<p>They had thousands of kilograms of thermite in Tower 7. How unbelievably lucky they were that debris from Tower 1 hit it. Otherwise there would be <em>literally</em> no reason for the building to come down. And you propose that they waited for seven hours of the fires burning, hoping the thermite charges weren&#39;t compromised, to bring down the building in a progressive global collapse. </p>

<p>Even if a third plane hit WTC7, would you say it is worth the risk to rig it for demolition? I believe smuggling super secret documents from an office building is significantly easier than the process of prepping a building for implosion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like you are clutching at straws. Do you also believe a drone missile hit the Pentagon?</p>

<p>So let me get this straight.. You think that there was a remote controlled plane that was headed to WTC7 (ignoring the passengers on the original flights). Someone dun goofed and crashed the thing. Potential catastrophy for them, they&#39;ll get found out if they bring down the building with no reason. So they made up the debris damage/fires it created. Faked the photos of the damage/smoke and testimoney given. Then let civilians film the collapse?! Hoping that there was no brilliant bright flashes (thermite) or incredibly loud detonations recorded. </p>

<p>Oh, and this is all done in a manner that is completely undetected by researchers on retainer from Aegis Insurance. Investigating the buildings for evidence of negligence (super duper behzinga-thermite induced collapse would certainly qualify). </p>

<p>Buuuuuut I&#39;ll let you guess what their model and sworn testimoney served to back up...</p>

<p>What happened to the 3 buildings to make them fall the same way?
I think this is the real question that we need a concrete answer for.
-edit forgot to answer this. From what i&#39;ve dug up over the years it seems like the FBI or whoever took all the good footage from the areas surrounding the Pentagon to cover up what really happened.</p>

<p>I think for the WTC buildings..... they were rigged so all the core columns would be severed at the same time (thermite?)</p>

<p>The Pentagon must have had a bomb? 
Seeing that the area that exploded allegedly contained key information regarding the missing trillions. Rumsfeld announced that this money was gone on 9/10.</p>

<p>Looking only at a video of the collapse is <em>not</em> a good way to determine similarities between them. Even in the videos, the collapses are not alike, you can see the progressive collapse. The penthouse comes down first, then due to other failures, the facade falls afterwards.</p>

<p>You are mistaken in thinking that all three came down in a similar fashion. I know you won&#39;t accept NIST&#39;s explaination, but for the people who know this <em>wasn&#39;t</em> a demolition job, Tower 7 is explained.</p>

<p>Next... you have to tell me WHY Looking only at a video of the collapse is not a good way to determine similarities between them.
You say this and then proceed to use your perception of the videos to prove that the collapses aren&#39;t similar even though you just said that using the video to compare the collapses is not a good way to compare them...</p>

Honestly, the only reason your ideas of &quot;holes in the story&quot; are not extinct is because of memetic reproduction, not because they hold any weight.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m truly and utterly amazed you asked this. Can you see what is going on inside the building from the video evidence? Nope. WTC7 was constructed completely different to 1&amp;2. A fire induced progressive global collapse could not have occurred in 1&amp;2 due to the load bearing.</p>

<p>So, the manner in which they collapse is not alike. And the cause of their collapse is not alike. Would you like to elaborate on how they <em>are</em> similar? Other than &quot;they both fell down&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who are these people who KNOW that &quot;this&quot; wasn&#39;t a demolition job? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The scientists who built a model at Edinbourgh University know it wasn&#39;t an intentional implosion. Pretty sure the NIST report covered it also. So would you care to elaborate on why these two groups are lying?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>people have been asking questions for years and years about tower 7 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are still people who believe the world is flat, 6000 years old and evolution cannot happen. They &quot;ask questions&quot; pretty often, that doesn&#39;t mean when they get a rational response they will take it on board. Its the exact same thing with the Truther community.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and why are you able to say that Tower 7 is explained without being able to explain it to me?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You didn&#39;t ask me to explain it to you. What would you like to know? Also, do us both a favour and do a quick search before you ask me. I don&#39;t want to be regurgitating stuff that you won&#39;t listen to for no reason.</p>

<p>&quot;WTC7 was constructed completely different to 1&amp;2&quot; I know that buildings 1 and 2 were constructed to withstand the impact of major jetliners.

<p>&quot;A fire induced progressive global collapse could not have occurred in 1&amp;2 due to the load bearing&quot; so you are saying that you think that the building 7 event was &quot;A fire induced progressive global collapse&quot; ?? or what was your point here</p>

<p>I used to be in the same boat as you, I mean I was a kid, but still look upon the &quot;masses&quot; as complete and utter idiots. Until I started self-examining my own beliefs which I encourage you to do also. Don&#39;t dismiss our conversation out of hand, that&#39;s all I ask.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There was only a small office fire in WTC 7.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is just simply not true in the slightest. The fire had up to ten points of origin caused by the debris hitting from the North Tower. It was unfought by fire fighters and sprinkler systems. Fire-induced window breakage provided ventilation for continued fire spread and growth. It was not a &quot;small fire&quot;, not in the slightest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The demolition with liquid metal pouring out of the sides</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Molten material flowing out of WTC1, not WTC7. This <strong>is not evidence of thermite.</strong> To believe as such, you would need to think that these thermite charges were set off minutes before hand, melted through the steel. The structure then remained intact for long enough whilest this molten material ran out of the window. Can you see the problem with this idea?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Explosions were heard by eyewitnesses, including firefighters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another falsehood. No blast sounds were heard on the audio tracks of video recordings during the collapse of WTC 7 or reported by witnesses. According to calculations by the investigation team, the smallest blast capable of failing the building&#39;s critical column would have resulted in a sound level of 130 decibels to 140 dB at a distance of at least half a mile, if unobstructed by surrounding buildings. This sound level is consistent with a gunshot blast, standing next to a jet plane engine, and more than 10 times louder than being in front of the speakers at a rock concert.</p>

<p>For the building to have been prepared for intentional demolition, walls and/or column enclosures and fireproofing would have to be removed and replaced without being detected. Preparing a column includes steps such as cutting sections with torches, which produces noxious and odorous fumes. Intentional demolition usually requires applying explosive charges to most, if not all, interior columns, not just one or a limited set of columns in a building.</p>

<p>Honestly, I know you will move onto another &quot;inconsistancy&quot;. But do try to address the points made.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like you are clutching at straws. Do you also believe a drone missile hit the Pentagon?</p>

<p>So let me get this straight.. You think that there was a remote controlled plane that was headed to WTC7 (ignoring the passengers on the original flights). Someone dun goofed and crashed the thing. Potential catastrophy for them, they&#39;ll get found out if they bring down the building with no reason. So they made up the debris damage/fires it created. Faked the photos of the damage/smoke and testimoney given. Then let civilians film the collapse?! Hoping that there was no brilliant bright flashes (thermite) or incredibly loud detonations recorded. </p>

<p>Oh, and this is all done in a manner that is completely undetected by researchers on retainer from Aegis Insurance. Investigating the buildings for evidence of negligence (super duper behzinga-thermite induced collapse would certainly qualify). </p>

<p>Buuuuuut I&#39;ll let you guess what their model and sworn testimoney served to back up...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In your first paragraph you aren&#39;t telling me how!  You are just decreeing it so, and memetic production!?!? Things weren&#39;t classified as &quot;memes&quot; on the internet back when most of the good un tainted information regarding 9/11 was dug up by free thinking independent researchers. So i vehemently disagree with this paragraph.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok in your 2nd paragraph you attempt to mock me just because I want you held accountable for the things you type. Next you bring up a good point we can&#39;t see the inside, but that is consistent in all 3 collapses. </p>

<p>&quot;WTC7 was constructed completely different to 1&amp;2&quot; I know that buildings 1 and 2 were constructed to withstand the impact of major jetliners. Do you have any good sources for the differences between 1/2 and 7&#39;s construction I am genuinely curious now as you raise a good point here.</p>

<p>&quot;A fire induced progressive global collapse could not have occurred in 1&amp;2 due to the load bearing&quot; so you are saying that you think that the building 7 event was &quot;A fire induced progressive global collapse&quot; ?? or what was your point here</p>

Im not familiar with the Edinbourgh University model perhaps you&#39;ll actually provide a link to what you reference next time.</p>
