The smartass answer is &quot;pretty good because it happened&quot;. But I just thought about this today. There would be some difference wouldn&#39;t there? Different planes hit different areas, different floors. </p>

<p>Isn&#39;t that a gigantic obvious red flag?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. If they were brought down, it would have been very similar.
If they fell due to damage with no help whatsoever, wouldn&#39;t the collapses look a lot different than they did? </p>

<p>Purely hypothetical and kind of simplistic I admit, but just going back to basics on this and asking possibly stupid, simple questions that maybe haven&#39;t been looked at yet hoping to find some shrivel of information or an alternate viewpoint that had not been considered.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s also the official &quot;pancaking&quot; explanation which is false:  the notion that once the top floors got moving they would begin collapsing all the lower floors.  Which is not true as the lower floors were already strong enough to hold that potential energy, and when it converts to kinetic energy it would not be higher.</p>

<p>If the upper floors were detached by some fictional mega crane and we watched as they were then dropped on the lower mass of floors THEN we might see &quot;pancaking&quot; as they would be impacting with a higher level of kinetic energy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s so ridiculous, if the upper floors did buckle, this mass should have slid right off the top of the building or even got caught, tilted like the leaning Tower of Pisa.</p>

<p>About as likely as Hani Hanjour flying, for the first fucking time, a 757 along the ground, at over 400mph, into the side of the pentagon. Without scratching the grass. About as likely as him deciding to hit the pentagon on the side opposite his direction. Taking even more time, while in some of the most restricted airspace on the planet. If that wasn&#39;t amazing enough, he managed to hit the side that was being renovated, with far less than normal population. Scheduled to finish the next day. Renovated for? A fucking terrorist attack. Yeah, about as likely as that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, its because when the eye-witness testimoney is cross-examined it was very clear it had no relation to when Truthers claim the thermite was ignited to bring the building fown in a free-fall manner.</p>

<p>There is absolutely zero reason to believe someone&#39;s story on a day as chaotic as 9/11 over video evidence. Is it so implausable that explosions reported by people are simply mistaken? How many have heard them outside of the movies..</p>

<p>Again, we have video and audio evidence of all three towers falling, none of which recorded a series of detonations above 130dB. So any explosive being used is utterly impossible. Cling on to your idea and downvote me all you like, but try and prove that you can blow through the steel girders that were in place with explosives, without that noise. And you can colour me impressed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To compare the eye witness reports of the Pentagon plane to that of what happened in New York is dishonest at best. Would you agree that there were many noises in the WTC complex that could be mistaken for an explosion? Cars, debris etc. There was only one moment in question with regards to the Pentagon. Hundreds of people reported it as such, so yes I would apply more weight to their testimoney than that of the ones in New York.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>There is nothing of the sort. I&#39;m sorry if you don&#39;t like it, but the 130dB is simply a fact. The equivelant to standing next to a jet engine and very audible for up to a mile.</p>

<p>It is unescapable. Unless you can prove that this is false, your idea of building demolition <em>must</em> be adjusted. Feel free to ammend it to thermite, like many other Truthers have to account for this.</p>

Oh wait, nobody can do that since the vast majority of that evidence was shipped off and melted down without ever having its condition documented.

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a big difference between sounds not being recorded and sounds not being there. That they are seemingly missing from video&#39;s certainly seems odd, but not odd enough to argue that they were not there. Just take a look at most video&#39;s of that day. Even the building collapses. Many of them are not only missing sounds of explosions, they are showing the collapse of a building in complete silence.</p>

<p>When you really start to analyse all the available footage, you come to the conclusion that you hear less than you should, or things that you do not expect to hear. It would be quite a stretch to then assume that these massive buildings fell in complete silence. The culprit here is undoubtedly the way these camera microphones pick up sound or act when sound is too loud to get registered.</p>

<p>The few camera stand points that do have sound of the buildings falling have a distinct metallic rumble, exactly like other controlled demolitions.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smreRx51cus">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smreRx51cus</a></p>

<p>The collapse is even preceded by a loud explosion. Something that was recorded by different camera&#39;s.</p>

<p>I really think that the explosions are covering up the explosions. The amount of cutter charges probably produces this metallic roar, more so than distinct booms. I know this probably sounds like a silly cop-out at first, but just look at other demolitions on youtube. It&#39;s pretty common for loud booms to precede the building collapse (as did happen on 9/11). But during the collapse, they are often absent or replaced by these metallic sounds that either resemble firecrackers or a metallic roar.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4eMgVv9jQI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4eMgVv9jQI</a>

<p>Almost silent:

<p>This is the WTC again:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smreRx51cus">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smreRx51cus</a></p>

<p>The only difference is is that the loud explosions could&#39;ve been spread out across the entire time the buildings were burning, whereas in normal demolitions, they occur in the space of a few seconds, making them more obvious.</p>

<p>Yes, it is. If all of the audio evidence of the day does not record the explosions, I can say with almost certainty, there was no fucking explosions. What kind of &quot;skeptic&quot; are you if you say otherwise?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When you really start to analyse all the available footage, you come to the conclusion that you hear less than you should, or things that you do not expect to hear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of the recordings, perhaps. But my point is simple. There is no audio recording of detonations of noise between 130dB - 140dB. Absolutely none. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The culprit here is undoubtedly the way these camera microphones pick up sound or act when sound is too loud to get registered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More nonsense. You believe that the noise of the detonations was <em>too loud</em> to be recorded? Please try to prove that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The few camera stand points that do have sound of the buildings falling have a distinct metallic rumble, exactly like other controlled demolitions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You mean, like the other buildings that collapse? What a suprise that is.. Again, what you are missing is the important part. The series of loud detonations before the collapse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The collapse is even preceded by a loud explosion. Something that was recorded by different camera&#39;s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You video does not show that. Not in the slightest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I really think that the explosions are covering up the explosions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wat... Please elaborate on this. </p>

<p>But then you go on to say..</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only difference is is that the loud explosions could&#39;ve been spread out across the entire time the buildings were burning, whereas in normal demolitions, they occur in the space of a few seconds, making them more obvious.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ha. AHAHAHAHA. That is incredible. Do you have any idea what that would do to the building?! The point of origin of the collapse was where the steel girders were either damaged by the jet or weakend by fire. If you seriously believe that it is possible to hide a series of detonations, damage the girders and for the collapse to take place as it did, I think we are done here. That is a fantasy land.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll say it again, give me <em>original</em> video evidence with a timestamp that shows these explosives. <strong>Or</strong> prove that the charges could have destroyed the beams without reaching 130dB. Otherwise, you have no argument here for explosives, none.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t think I had to, I wasn&#39;t even defending the &quot;official story&quot;. Just pointing out to the guy that explosive are literally impossible. In the audio we have from that day, nothing of the sort reaches 130dB before or during the collapse of any of the towers.</p>

<p>The smoke ejecting from the side is also not evidence in the slightest of an explosion. This is an old one that has been going around since the start, you should know better than to tout this. the falling mass of the building compressed the air ahead of it, much like the action of a piston, forcing smoke and debris out the windows as the stories below failed sequentially.</p>

<p>These puffs were observed at many locations as the towers collapsed. In all cases, they had the appearance of jets of gas being pushed from the building through windows or between columns on the mechanical floors. Such jets are expected since the air inside the building is compressed as the tower falls and must flow somewhere as the pressure builds. It is significant that similar “puffs” were observed numerous times on the fire floors in both towers prior to their collapses, perhaps due to falling walls or portions of a floor. Puffs from WTC 1 were even observed when WTC 2 was struck by the aircraft. These observations confirm that even minor overpressures were transmitted through the towers and forced smoke and debris from the building.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, I was referencing the white smoke that came out of windows prior to collapse. I could have been more specific about that. White smoke is a result of a water and fire (smoulder, steam) or is a result of an accelerant. There was nothing inside the WTC complex or the planes, according to NIST and 911C, that could have acted as an accelerant that would result in white smoke. What does result in white smoke would be nanothermite, and it is one of the few explosive resins capable of that. White smoke pouring out of windows against a backdrop of thick, black smoke is odd.</p>

<p>And, no, talking out of my ass would suggest either my head is up my ass or I can throw my voice. Seeing as I&#39;m neither a Warner Bros cartoon character nor a believer in the official 9/11 storyline, I can confidently say my words are not emitting out of my ass. Yes, it is orderly. It didn&#39;t collapse like an accordion, but given these towers were over 100 stories high and each tower weighed over 700,000 tonnes, their symmetrical collapses inward upon themselves is extraordinary. (However, considering the series of an extraordinary and unbelievable events of that day, maybe we shouldn&#39;t be surprised). At some point the structural integrity of the support columns should have failed asymmetrically and at least one of the towers <em>somewhere</em> should have keeled off to the side or broken off part way up. The fact that every single support column failed, floor by floor, and provided no resistance and the towers fell into themselves with no variation is astounding and beyond improbable. Every floor, every column, every tower, to the basement. That&#39;s not how physics work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, its not. But 130dB each from a series of  explosions is not going to be muffled enough to hide it from the audio recordings of WTC7. Its kind of cute how you are trying to defend explosives being used but at the same time pushing the thermate idea. Thermate is <em>not</em> an explosive. Ridicule is not equivacal to evidence, show me why these explosives would be muffled to this extent because they took place inside a building. </p>

<p>Also, if you are to suggest thermate, I&#39;m almost sure one of its components is barium nitrate? If thermate was to be used to tear down these buildings, the amount used would result in a monumental amount of people exposed to it.  Symptoms of poisoning include tightness of muscles (especially in the face and neck), vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, muscular tremors, anxiety, weakness, labored breathing, cardiac irregularity, and convulsions. Death may result from cardiac or respiratory failure, and usually occurs a few hours to a few days following exposure to the compound. Barium nitrate may also cause kidney damage.</p>

<p>So I&#39;d like to explain how the explosives were muffled to the extent that you claim, and also how they covered up the people subjected to barium nitrate poisoning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the fact of the matter is that no matter what the official story is, people will always shill for it and the establishment will always try to discredit those who question it.</p>

<p>If the official story for 9/11 was that bin Laden had brought the buildings down with explosives, the same people who are shilling the jet fuel theory now would be saying that it was definitely explosives. They would:</p>

<ul>
<li>Point us to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_A9X_8flGeM">videos of explosions being heard</a>;</li>
<li>Ask us who we are to question <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/about.html">architects and engineers</a> on the structural integrity of the WTC buildings;</li>
<li>Call us ghoulish and unpatriotic for questioning the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IYlEVCpG_0">testimony of the firefighters who heard explosions</a>;</li>
<li>Ask us why <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/active-thermitic-material-discovered-in-dust-from-the-9-11-world-trade-center-catastrophe/13049">thermite was found in the WTC debris</a>;</li>
<li>Tell us that Larry Silverstein just got lucky that his wife insisted that he attend a dermatologist appointment on the morning of September 11th, 2001, which left him alive and well enough to collect $4.577bn in insurance: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Silverstein">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Silverstein</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>And so on.</p>

<p>Obviously this hypothetical doesn&#39;t account for where the fuck NORAD was at during the worst terrorist attack on American soil in history. And why no one was court marshalled for dereliction of duty. Or how the plane that hit the Pentagon, including its Rolls-Royce RB211 engines, completely vaporized.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure they&#39;d come up with something, though, because they will always be backed up by experts/commentators that are either on the payroll or too afraid of being discredited to question the official narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do those frequency levels take into account how loud NYC is on any given day? Are they adjusted to consider the incredible volumes of noise in Lower Manhattan that day? Not that frequency and wavelength vary city by city, but what kinds of explosions are those 130dB referencing? How much of an explosion is required to reach that level of sound? In more than a couple videos I&#39;ve watched, the booms recorded and shown on graphs are sequenced. Not random enough to suggest the blowing up or smashing of cars, bodies hitting the ground, or whatever else you may want to attribute it to. They fall in the same pattern as firefighter testimonies (the people in the buildings), the systemic collapse and explanations of controlled demolitions.</p>

<p>But fine. You don&#39;t care for eyewitness testimony because you think it is unreliable and I don&#39;t care for jet fuel as the fuel source with the greatest potential energy.</p>

<p>Let me ask you this so we can see where this conversation may go: Is there anything in the 911C, NIST, reports or federal investigative filings that you disagree with or question? From several months prior to 9/11, to 9/11 and into the beginning of the War on Terror. Does anything 9/11-related cause you to think or say, &quot;oh my God, that is bullshit. That&#39;s a boldfaced lie. They&#39;re lying to us about <em>that,</em>&quot; whatever that may be?</p>

<p>Both buildings were designed and built in the exact same way and both suffered the same damage. The only difference was that one had a hit higher up and the other took the hit lower down. And if you watch the videos they don&#39;t fall in the same way at all. </p>

<p>They both collapse but you can plainly see that the top of the first one to fall kind of goes out as if its falling to one side like sawing down a tree. After this happens the floors beneath it collapse. </p>

<p>IDK if this proves that the collapse were organic however the flaw in your premise is that  if it was organic you would expect both of them to collapse in similar ways since they&#39;re both the same building hit by similar planes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we expect them to collapse, perhaps. I guess I find it fishy that they both fell.
I&#39;ve seen the videos of both towers many many many times. To me, they look very similar. </p>

<p>I realize that focusing on the science behind why the building fell is a huge circle jerk that goes round and round with no catharsis.</p>

<p>There are plenty of people lined up to point out the inconsistencies and seemingly, even more to point out why there is no possible explanation besides the NIST explanation.</p>

<p>I was just thinking out loud today about this and wondered what others thought.</p>

<p>If two planes hit the same building, would the outcome 100% result in collapse, even under similar circumstances? </p>

<p>There are many more (100s) of red flags to harp on but this one just always seemed odd to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADygllD35t0">Here is what FDNY has to say about it.</a>  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5d5iIoCiI8g">Here is a clip that directly answers your question.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2g-aGSxu0Y">Here is eye witness accounts of explosions the day of the event.</a>  From people that know what an explosion is from on the job expirence.</p>

<p>If a bomb goes off inside a steel and concrete structure, can you tell me how you would hear explosions at those dB?  Surely the building itself would muffle the sound.  </p>

<p>Short version, the great thermate debate answers your question.  </p>

<p>And the fact you aren&#39;t going to get the full sound through the steel and concrete of the building.  </p>

<p>Can you tell me when NIST plans on getting its final report peer reviewed?  There are many peer reviewed papers on the use of controlled demolitions at the WTC.  Why hasn&#39;t NIST&#39;s report been peer reviewed?  Or why do their models not reflect the video evidence of that day? </p>

<p>What building codes have been changed since 9/11 if fires could bring buildings down?</p>

<p>When does fire and gravity eject materials upward and outward as seen in this <a href="http://i.imgur.com/4mDzgSP.jpg">pic?</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_LlJzR2oYI">What did this guy expirence?</a></p>

<p>If by some chance you have a rational explanation for any of these questions, be ready for a bunch more on how fire can turn the buildings to dust.  </p>

<p>Fires that were oxygen starved and that left no evidence of being even close to temps. that would weaken steel.</p>

<p>Im all ears, this should be good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Considering you&#39;ve bombarded all of my comments in this thread with the same points, you can refer to my previous respnses for a couple of things.. Thermate + buildings muffiling sound.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can you tell me when NIST plans on getting its final report peer reviewed? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would count being published in the Journal of Structural Engineering as being peer-reviewed. The reason you do not is because A&amp;E49/11Truth told you it wasn&#39;t. It is ASCE&#39;s flagship and most respected journal, to suggest that it did not go under review is quite frankly absurd. On the flip side, there are <strong>zero</strong> PhDs that have spoken out against the NIST report and <strong>zero</strong> published papers that have rebutted the methods used to create the report.</p>

<p>But, peer-review is not the be all and end all of scientific weight. Probably the best way to find out if a published paper holds weight is the amount of papers that draw upon and cite it. The NIST report has that in abundance. I understand these are a shit ton of links, but it just serves my point.</p>

<p>For the rest of your Truther &quot;inconsistancies&quot; check NIST&#39;s FAQ&#39;s dude.. I mean come on, these are questions that are explained rationally by the &quot;official story&quot;. Just because you don&#39;t accept it, and attribute it to some nefarious deed doesn&#39;t equate to an inside job. This is shit that has been explained probably thousands of times, what do you think you will get out of asking me to explain it again?</p>

<p>Its pretty obvious that your mind is made up and you won&#39;t give an inch, confirmed by the fact that you are defending both explosives being used and positing thermate being the explaination.</p>

<p>I know that you will dance around and avoid this question by saying &quot;we need another investigation&quot; or a cop-out along those lines, but I&#39;ll give it a go anyhow. </p>

<p>Give me your best alternate explaination of the events of that day. Like a play by play, bullet points if you&#39;d like to. If you don&#39;t have a fully fleshed idea, mark it with a &quot;A&quot; for assumption. Let&#39;s see what you&#39;ve got, fourteen years after the event.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADygllD35t0">Here is what FDNY has to say about it.</a>  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5d5iIoCiI8g">Here is a clip that directly answers your question.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2g-aGSxu0Y">Here is eye witness accounts of explosions the day of the event.</a>  From people that know what an explosion is from on the job expirence.</p>

<p>If a bomb goes off inside a steel and concrete structure, can you tell me how you would hear explosions at those dB?  Surely the building itself would muffle the sound.  </p>

<p>Short version, the great thermate debate answers your question.  </p>

<p>And the fact you aren&#39;t going to get the full sound through the steel and concrete of the building.  </p>

<p>Can you tell me when NIST plans on getting its final report peer reviewed?  There are many peer reviewed papers on the use of controlled demolitions at the WTC.  Why hasn&#39;t NIST&#39;s report been peer reviewed?  Or why do their models not reflect the video evidence of that day? </p>

<p>What building codes have been changed since 9/11 if fires could bring buildings down?</p>

<p>When does fire and gravity eject materials upward and outward as seen in this <a href="http://i.imgur.com/4mDzgSP.jpg">pic?</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_LlJzR2oYI">What did this guy expirence?</a></p>

<p>If by some chance you have a rational explanation for any of these questions, be ready for a bunch more on how fire can turn the buildings to dust.  </p>

<p>Fires that were oxygen starved and that left no evidence of being even close to temps. that would weaken steel.</p>

<p>Im all ears, this should be good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, where to even start. </p>

<p>Delaying the investigation until Nov 2002 is bullshit.
Claiming we didn&#39;t see it coming is bullshit (saw multiple government officials on the news trying to spin this, including Rice)
No footage of the Pentagon is bullshit. 
Trying to appoint Henry Kissinger as the 9/11 commission chair was a huge red flag, and bullshit. That obviously didn&#39;t stick.
The same day accusation towards Osama Bin Laden is bullshit. 
Osama Bin Laden&#39;s entire history is bullshit.
The muslim &quot;they hate our freedom&quot; motive is bullshit.
The same day &quot;training exercises&quot; are bullshit.
I still think the cell phone calls are bullshit.
George Bush Sr. meeting with the Bin Ladens on 9/11 is bullshit (Carlyle Group).
The 9/11 Commission investigation was bullshit.
WTC 7 falling because it was on fire is bullshit.
Any claims that it had enough structural damage to free fall are bullshit.
Donald Rumsfeld is full of shit. 
The WMD scare was bullshit.
The anthrax was bullshit.
The wars were bullshit.
The muslim boogey man is bullshit.
Al Qaeda is bullshit. 
ISIS is bullshit.
The patriot act is bullshit.
The NSA is bullshit.</p>

<p>There is a lot of bullshit. I could link articles and evidence - that has been done countless times to no avail.</p>
