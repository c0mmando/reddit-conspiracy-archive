<p>Not only that, there are many times (approximately 26 a year) as the Earth orbits around the sun and the moon orbits around the Earth that the moon ends up in a position in line with Earth&#39;s path of orbit (either in front of or behind Earth) as it goes around the sun, guaranteeing that it would have the same perspective of stars as the Earth those 26 times a year...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point was that the vantage point is irrelevant in such small distances relative to the distance to stars in the constellations, meaning there was no reason to leave them out because &quot;they&#39;re too difficult to fake.&quot;  So in reality, it would be pretty straight forward to &quot;fake&quot; them with accuracy.</p>

<p>The Moon&#39;s surface is airless. On Earth, our thick atmosphere scatters sunlight, spreading it out over the whole sky. That&#39;s why the sky is bright during the day. Without sunlight, the air is dark at night, allowing us to see stars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve heard it said that the surface of the Moon is quite bright. Maybe a good analogy would be picturing yourself in a spotlight in a dark room, and the way you couldn&#39;t see much outside that spotlight. Someone outside the spotlight could make up details in the dark to a greater extend.</p>

<p>We on Earth are the audience looking at the spot light on the Moon, and the astronauts on the Moon would be the performers in the spotlight, who could only see the brightest objects in the darkness, like the Earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny, I just literally typed exactly what he said. I am not misinterpreting it, he states this (in bold):</p>

<p>NdT says @6:34</p>

<p>“Well take for example, the assertion that the photos from the moon lunar surface, <strong>since the moon has no atmosphere, then a daytime picture, if you’re there during the daytime on the moon then you see a full night sky of stars even with the sun in the sky as well.</strong></p>

<p>You don’t see stars in the daytime on Earth, not because they’re not there but because the atmosphere is a glow with scattered light from the sun. If you take away the atmosphere, the sun will still be there but the sky goes dark. Thats what the folks get when they go to the edge of the atmosphere and they’re calling that the edge of space, but when you get to the edge of the atmosphere, the atmosphere is no longer between you and edge of the Universe. And the stars reveal themselves just as they would at night. So, everyone knew this.”</p>

<p>(He then goes on to explain how the cameras and photographic conditions are the ONLY reason that the stars don’t appear in the photos.)</p>

<p>He even says: “If you turn the camera to the sky, a much longer exposure with sensitive film, you’ll get the stars but then you overexpose the stuff in the foreground”.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I hear, is that your quote is what he explains that the people who believe in the moon hoax assert, that is not what he himself asserts. In other words &quot;these people who claim that the moon landings were a hoax, claim that because there is no atmosphere there should be visible stars.&quot; At approximately 7:25 he stops talking about what other people say, the people who believe that moon landing was  a hoax and there should be stars in the images, and explains why there are no stars in the images and how it can be explained. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That statement explains why we don&#39;t see the stars in the images: because the objective of the images was to show man on the Moon, not the stars on the sky. You would need to take a much longer exposure and overexpose the foreground, the man on the Moon, if you wanted to show the stars in the sky. </p>

<p>Why they didn&#39;t take images with longer exposure times? Maybe they didn&#39;t think they would have any value, because they are the same stars we can see from Earth or from orbit with telescopes like the Hubble, and the astronauts had limited time to operate on the surface.</p>

<p>Tyson continues: &quot;so, photography 101 answers that question, but there are huge websites given unto this, so what that told me, was that people simply wanted to believe that it was a hoax, and then made all the information fit that need without actually caring about the scientific truths, that with any evidence would disprove all what they were thinking&quot;</p>

<p>Maybe at this point we should both listen to the whole conversation between Tyson and Rogan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got sidetracked and forgot about the claims of the astronauts. Still, I don&#39;t think that it was explained in the video that the stars would be visible to the astronauts on the Moon, because the context of the conversation in the video was the photos, not the claims of the astronauts. Whether or not the astronauts saw the stars while on the Moon was outside the conversation between Tyson and Rogan.</p>

<p>Interesting video, thanks for sharing. I have been wary about listening to Rogan, with the little information I&#39;ve had about his opinions and views, even though people have said that he hosts interesting conversations. After listening to this I&#39;m less reserved about him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>video/image wise i would say it could be chalked up to exposure values.</p>

<p>the light off the surface and the things it would be reflecting off of would have possibly made them much harder to see.</p>

<p>the reflected light would probably be considerably stonger there than on earths surface. that said there is no atmosphere for that reflected light to then scatter on so... </p>
