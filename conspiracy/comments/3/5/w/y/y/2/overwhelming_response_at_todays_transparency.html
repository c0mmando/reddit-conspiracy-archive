<p>Some other highly upvoted comments:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy questions answered, none of the hard ones answered. Just like an actual AMA. Nice.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re really interested in transparency, you need to take a really hard look at shadow banning. It is literally the opposite of transparent and a problem that is far more prolific than takedown requests.</p>

<p>Let us see votes again, and I&#39;ll believe you. 33/32 means so much more than 1.</p>

<p>Anyone from reddit care to comment on the community allegations of Reddit admins and mods removing content relating to interim CEO Ellen Pao, her sexual harassment lawsuit against her former employer and the Ponzi scheme allegations against her husband Buddy Fletcher? It&#39;s extremely disturbing that an organization which claims to hold transparency as a value stands accused of deleting user content under a veil of secrecy.</p>

<p>Oh, transparency, huh? That&#39;s why you&#39;re mysteriously shadowbanning people left and right? A weird, draconian process with no explanations whatsoever that can descend on anybody at anytime?</p>

<p>How about you deal with that shit first and then maybe I&#39;ll take a shot at believing this company line. Until then, you&#39;ve got a long fucking way to go before anybody reasonable believes you.</p>

<p>Shadowbans need to be eliminated. The spammers they were designed to stop, have an easy and robust workaround, so all they do is piss people off by treating Redditors like shit. Many people would be surprised how easy and how often people are being shadowbanned.</p>

<p>Reddit is on the one hand...mainstream...on the other hand...it isn&#39;t completely compromised.</p>

<p>Which means...we have the fighters still here...and we have a very public chess board to fight on.  Honestly, I see that as a great opportunity. Would it be pleasant to see it that way, no...But why not? </p>

<p>I say doubledown...tell em&#39; to fuck off. And have the drag down, knock out fight here...the very fact that the comments you quoted were popular shows that they don&#39;t have the fight won...Just keep on keepin&#39; on....and have fun.</p>

<p>Of course not.</p>

<p>Completely compromised would be worthless. It is much better to marginalize and ridicule non-comforming opinions than to ban them outright.</p>

<p>Marginalizing &quot;incorrect&quot; views can be used to create the perception of an overwhelming normalcy bias that inhibits the development of those views in others who will not want to see themselves as defective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see this as a positive thing. Every time reddit comes out with a new &quot;thing&quot; everyone hates it.</p>

<p>No one likes the admins.</p>

<p>No one like the power of the mods on popular subreddits...</p>

<p>No one actually wants what they are trying to do.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the bottom line. What makes reddit&#39;s user base unique is that the core of us is made up of people that know how to game the internet. Meaning, when reddit pisses off it&#39;s user base, not only do we know how to see through their techniques, we know how to fight back.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s fucking fight back!</p>

<p>Everyone reading this...do whatever the fuck you want to fuck with reddit. Create multiple accounts, whatever...make everything reddit does irrelevant.</p>

<p>We are NOT irrelevant...by no means...in fact! Reddit needs us for it to even be a thing. It needs people participating...it needs people adding links and comments etc.  How do you not see how much power we have!?</p>

<p>If anything, the fact that the reddit corp wants to do something retarded, and the users are calling it stupid should be a good sign.  I&#39;m happy about it...Right?</p>

<p>Each of the threads have unique conversations that are occurring. Deleting just one would be essentially censoring the discussion that everyone is having in the thread.</p>

<p>Different users are participating in each thread.</p>

<p>You seem misinformed about the purpose and the strengths of this sub.</p>

<p>Similar topics get posted all the time. However, I find that the truly interesting stuff happens in the comment sections. </p>

<p>Simply choosing to remove an entire thread with dozens (or more) conversations is exactly the opposite of what this sub stands for.</p>

<p>Not only would there be a (justifiable) outcry, but it&#39;s simply not the right thing to do. </p>

<p>Also, this particular topic happens to be <em>extremely</em> relevant and important. I&#39;m surprised there were only 3 posts discussing this, I would&#39;ve expected more.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a moot point, considering 2 posts went up within several minutes of each other. In this instance, you&#39;re looking at things from the wrong perspective. A sticky post titled &quot;Mega-thread-blah-blah-blah&quot; is the solution to the problem you won&#39;t address.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Some would argue there is more than one purpose to this subreddit. I&#39;ve gone toe-to-toe with users who have tried to do harm to the 911 truth movement online. I&#39;m well aware the purpose of this subreddit at several points has been to hurt, not help, the 911 truth movement. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You seem misinformed about the strengths...of this sub.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Patterns occur on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> which make it clear the intent is to obfuscate with non-conspiracies and reddit meta-drama. This isn&#39;t undelete or badcopnodonut.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I find that the truly interesting stuff happens in the comment sections.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I must agree. You&#39;ve doled out some &#39;interesting&#39; advice on comment sections, as it pertains to your lack of knowledge of 911 and richard gage. </p>
