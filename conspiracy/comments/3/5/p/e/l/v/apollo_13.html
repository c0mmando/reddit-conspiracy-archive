       Hey everyone. This post is purely speculative, and a theory in every sense of the word.
      </p>
      <p>
       The theories surrounding the moon landing and space travel in general are theories I've been aware of, but never really dove into for quite some time. For a long time I believed without a shadow of a doubt that we landed on the moon, and I didn't want to hear or see any evidence to the contrary.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the last few months, I've been reading more and more theories/reasons why we didn't land on the moon, and I have to say that my opinion has changed greatly. Now I tend to lean towards the belief that we did not land on the moon, not in 1969 anyway..
      </p>
      <p>
       My question/theory is: What is the possibility that Apollo 13 was actually the first flight we tried to send to the moon, and that the Van Allen Belt still proved too much to overcome? I will admit my knowledge on the topic of the Van Allen Belt is hazy at best, so I'm not even sure it is plausible for the belt to have caused the failure on that flight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I am pretty raw in regards to theories on the moon and space travel, so any education you folks could throw my way would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for any links, or help nudging me in the right direction!

       The troublefree traversal of the Van Allen Belts is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the moon landing hoax.

       Jay Weidner makes a good point that Apollo 13 likely shows what the astronauts did on every mission:  which was simply launch and go out to moon orbit but never land, as landing and surviving on lunar surface has the lowest odds of success of any stage of the journey.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tend to think they actually executed the lunar module separation and went down to a lower orbit then basically came back up to reconnect...which is all we have film of (there's no film of the landings from the command module perspective).

       Why do people think the Apollo missions couldn't fly through the Van Allen belt? I thought that idea was based off of a poor understanding of the belt.

       People seem to think deadly amounts of radiation are being spewed around all the time.  The truth is it comes in waves.  Not impossible to get to the moon and back with limited exposure with a little bit of luck.

       LOL. Dude, 6 times in 3 years is a whole lot of luck.  Maybe that should be the new motto.  NASA: who needs technology when you're lucky.
      </p>
      <p>
       But seriously, can you show us one of these special pathways that nasa traveled through.  where is it in the scientific literature that shows weunderstand the movements of the radiation to the point of being able to pick a launch date and traverse along a clear path path?   And more importantly, are you conceding to yourself that the radiation belts are deadly and need to be avoided?
  Because when you come up short in your search for nasa telemetry data, much less that they chose a path to avoid radiation waves, you are going to want to remember that the radiation is  a current technological barrier that even today hasn't been overcome.

       I'd argue that the dangerous times to be afloat are the rarity, not the norm.  We are being constantly pelted with radiation from the sun.  It's in you right now.  Radiation isn't deadly - large amounts of radiation is deadly.  Our closest form of large amounts of radiation is the sun, and the amount it outputs varies based on solar storms and CME's.  The Sun is 93 million miles away from earth.  Cmon.
      </p>
      <p>
       The belts are formed by particles from the sun getting captured in the planet's magnetic field.  This isn't some voodoo barrier, it's just concentrated sun particles as they pass around the earth.  They don't get stuck and continually build up, they are just passing through, so while the density is higher it's not an insane amount.  This might be a problem if the astronauts spent significant time in the belt, but they passed through it at almost 40,000 km/hr.  They spent less than 2 hours in the belt each way.
      </p>
      <p>
       You act like radiation shielding isn't a thing.  It is.  We can't completely contain it but we can reduce it to safe levels.  The Apollo astronauts were shielded and they were monitored for radiation levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       "In fact, the astronauts' overall exposure was dominated by solar particles once outside Earth's magnetic field. The total radiation received by the astronauts varied from mission to mission but was measured to be between 0.16 and 1.14 rads (1.6 and 11.4 mGy), much less than the standard of 5 rem (50 mSv) per year set by the United States Atomic Energy Commission for people who work with radioactivity."

       Radiation belts are something that should not be orbited in without significant shielding, but they are safe to pass through (at least in regards to the one around earth, which we have the most data on).

       Do you know why Apollo 13 is named 13? It's not just a fancy name with a coincidental bad luck number, it's the 13th mission of the Apollo program.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apollos 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 went around the moon - With 11 and 12 landing.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why would Apollo 13 suddenly be screwed up by the Van Allen belts when many prior missions went through the belts and reached the moon with little issue?

       It wasn't, a Dutch one was, and un like all the other official moon-rock gifting ceremonies, this wasn't gifted by astronauts or the president. This was apparently passed off by an ambassador. Very likely that the museum was just full of shit and looking for something to bring in visitors.

       The moon has pretty much no atmosphere. Dust clouds don't behave the same as on earth. Why would there be a dust cloud hanging around?

       1)It wasn't, a Dutch one was, and un like all the other official moon-rock gifting ceremonies, this wasn't gifted by astronauts or the president. This was apparently passed off by an ambassador. Very likely that the museum was just full of shit and looking for something to bring in visitors.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was given to former Prime Minister Willem Drees during a goodwill tour by the three Apollo-11 astronauts shortly after their moon mission in 1969.

       2)I don't understand what you're asking. It's dust. Dust gets everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the lunar lander came to rest, the astronauts had to use a lot of thrust to slow the lander down for a safe landing. Yet there is no crater underneath the lander...in fact theres no dust displacement either. How strange?
      </p>
      <p>
       3) The moon has pretty much no atmosphere. Dust clouds don't behave the same as on earth. Why would there be a dust cloud hanging around?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because if the lunar lander did throw up a shit load of dust, it would take a lot longer to settle, but lets pretend Armstrong took his time leaving the lander before he went walkies. Why didn’t any of the dust settle on the landers pads?

       4) With care. It was stowed and unfolded, like unfolding a large lawnchair. They didn't put it together from scratch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah sure. It just unfolds. What could possibly go wrong?

       5) Why did they use a stencil over the window in Apollo 11 to make it look like they were further away from Earth than they were? 
They didn’t?  Your 100% sure are you?....

       6) How were parts of the shadows lit up on the moons surface with no extra light sources?
      </p>
      <p>
       They weren't you say! Astronaut lit up in shadows...

       Do you believe 100% that the US gov would never lie to you? Do you really?
This is irrelevant to the point at hand.
NO! This is totally the point at hand! I say the US gov is lying about the moon mission, and you say they are not. It couldn’t be anymore at hand!!

      <p>
       The very small layer of dust would have been moved away. I'm not such what degree of visual "dust displacement" would be satisfactory to you. You seem to be under the imression the lander came to a big fiery halt in a sand pit.

      <p>
       Who says it did?
      </p>
      <p>
       The lander's engines were shut off before it touched ground, there wouldn't be a big fiery, smoky, billowy mess.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dust on the moon behaves much different than on earth.  There would be no big billowy clouds- any small amount of dust kicked up would have settled before the lander hit down and the rest would have been thrown away from the immediate area (mentioned by Aldrin) as it would act ballistically.

       Correct. I also don't think the rothschilds are behind everything, and that JFK was shot by one crazed dude and elvis ate too many Peaut Butter sandwiches and got fat and died of a drug overdose.

       Oh yeah cause the word shill is really demeaning and hurtful. Come on man, you have to know that's ridiculous. I wasn't even particularly rude in my comment, it's not like I was insulting their family, or their intelligence or anything. Such bullshit, excuses for censorship is what it is. No one should have the authority to restrict speech due to perceived harmfulness of words. They're fucking words, no one needs to be defended from words. Anyone who is "offended" by the words of a Stanger is choosing to feel offended. Words don't hurt anyone unless they choose to feel that way.

       Apollo 13 was a planned fuck up, designed to focus americas attention on the fact that we were going to the moon.  America had become ho hum about moon landings by this time.  Perhaps they sensed that something wasn't right or not real.  The apollo 13 " crisis" was what was needed to keep americas attention looking in the right direction.

       I realize there is video evidence, but being around television production as much as I have in my life has shown me how anything can be faked, which has done nothing but make me more skeptical to anything I see regarding video evidence.

       The physical tapes (which were intended solely backups) are gone.

       If they were to ever find the tapes (which I doubt as they were probably recorded over) they wouldn't go "Whoah!! Look at all this new data we have!". Whe the data was originally being sent it didn't just go out the window.

       They didn't just record the data to tape (which was, once again, always meant as backup) and then ignore it. Data was dealt with as it was received. They used proprietary IBM systems to handle the incoming data before it was stored.

       How is it not relevant? There wasn't much reason to backup the data, let along hang on to it. Telemetry tapes were bulky and awkward and often got taped over. That was just how things worked.

       Dude.  That graph in the Mission Report is not telemetry data.  Telemetry data is
       <strong>
        raw data that's sent over a long distance
       </strong>
       .  In other words, you would take the telemetry data and
       <em>
        use it

       to create a graph like that.  The graph itself is not telemetry data, nor is anything else in the Mission Report.

      <p>
       Do you know what a graph is?  It's a way of looking at/interpreting raw data, it isn't raw data in itself.

       Okay man, you're right - those 13,000+ reels of hard evidence are totally irrelevant, as are all of the original videos being missing.  Who needs hard evidence for anything right?  Let alone the alleged greatest technical achievement in the history of mankind.  Nothing to see here, move along.

       The videos were broadcast on to format-appropriate media. Many pieces of old footage has been "lost" once the transition between formats was made.

       So now you're alleging that NASA deliberately threw out the tapes because there was "no need to hold on to" them?  Where'd you get that information from?  Because it directly contradicts NASA who has no idea where the tapes went and has never claimed that it "didn't need to hold on to" them.

       Having big clunky backups was superfluous so they passed them off to be stored somewhere. They weren't locked away in a super secure memory bank somewhere because they didn't need to be. The broadcasts had been made and transferred to standard format and the data recorded.

       1) There are no enemies of the US. It's all a giant shell game.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) After we complete a conflict, we then go and pump hundreds of millions of dollars back into the economy of the country we have just defeated in war. If you think people's coffers don't get lined via those hundreds of millions, you're just dense

       GPS is skywave propagation of signals, bouncing them off the ionosphere via the 'repeater' towers in the system.

       The rockets went up in an arc and promptly fell back to Earth, reaching nowhere near the altitudes claimed. Notice, outside of NASA and their affiliates, no one can reproduce any of this. We have a LEM in a Smithsonian; why not fire it up with a new round of Masons?

       So now you're alleging that NASA deliberately threw out the tapes because there was "no need to hold on to" them?  Where'd you get that information from?  Because it directly contradicts NASA who has no idea where the tapes went and has never claimed that it "didn't need to hold on to" them.

       Who said there was "no need to hold on to" the reels?  NASA?  Nope.  So this is just you saying there was no need apparently.  You aren't really making a point if you didn't mean to imply they threw the tapes out deliberately.

       Another unfounded claim.  Who says they were taped over?  That has never been proven - NASA simply doesn't know.  That's one of many speculations as to what could've happened to the reels.

      <p>
       The originals are gone, the back-ups are gone, and the 13,000+ reels and the data they contained are nowhere to be found.  These are facts despite your inability to accept them.
