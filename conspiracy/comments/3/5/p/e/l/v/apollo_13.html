        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey everyone. This post is purely speculative, and a theory in every sense of the word. </p>

<p>The theories surrounding the moon landing and space travel in general are theories I&#39;ve been aware of, but never really dove into for quite some time. For a long time I believed without a shadow of a doubt that we landed on the moon, and I didn&#39;t want to hear or see any evidence to the contrary. </p>

<p>In the last few months, I&#39;ve been reading more and more theories/reasons why we didn&#39;t land on the moon, and I have to say that my opinion has changed greatly. Now I tend to lean towards the belief that we did not land on the moon, not in 1969 anyway..</p>

<p>My question/theory is: What is the possibility that Apollo 13 was actually the first flight we tried to send to the moon, and that the Van Allen Belt still proved too much to overcome? I will admit my knowledge on the topic of the Van Allen Belt is hazy at best, so I&#39;m not even sure it is plausible for the belt to have caused the failure on that flight. </p>

<p>Again, I am pretty raw in regards to theories on the moon and space travel, so any education you folks could throw my way would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for any links, or help nudging me in the right direction! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jay Weidner makes a good point that Apollo 13 likely shows what the astronauts did on every mission:  which was simply launch and go out to moon orbit but never land, as landing and surviving on lunar surface has the lowest odds of success of any stage of the journey.</p>

<p>I tend to think they actually executed the lunar module separation and went down to a lower orbit then basically came back up to reconnect...which is all we have film of (there&#39;s no film of the landings from the command module perspective).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL. Dude, 6 times in 3 years is a whole lot of luck.  Maybe that should be the new motto.  NASA: who needs technology when you&#39;re lucky.</p>

<p>But seriously, can you show us one of these special pathways that nasa traveled through.  where is it in the scientific literature that shows weunderstand the movements of the radiation to the point of being able to pick a launch date and traverse along a clear path path?   And more importantly, are you conceding to yourself that the radiation belts are deadly and need to be avoided?
  Because when you come up short in your search for nasa telemetry data, much less that they chose a path to avoid radiation waves, you are going to want to remember that the radiation is  a current technological barrier that even today hasn&#39;t been overcome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d argue that the dangerous times to be afloat are the rarity, not the norm.  We are being constantly pelted with radiation from the sun.  It&#39;s in you right now.  Radiation isn&#39;t deadly - large amounts of radiation is deadly.  Our closest form of large amounts of radiation is the sun, and the amount it outputs varies based on solar storms and CME&#39;s.  The Sun is 93 million miles away from earth.  Cmon.</p>

<p>The belts are formed by particles from the sun getting captured in the planet&#39;s magnetic field.  This isn&#39;t some voodoo barrier, it&#39;s just concentrated sun particles as they pass around the earth.  They don&#39;t get stuck and continually build up, they are just passing through, so while the density is higher it&#39;s not an insane amount.  This might be a problem if the astronauts spent significant time in the belt, but they passed through it at almost 40,000 km/hr.  They spent less than 2 hours in the belt each way.   </p>

<p>You act like radiation shielding isn&#39;t a thing.  It is.  We can&#39;t completely contain it but we can reduce it to safe levels.  The Apollo astronauts were shielded and they were monitored for radiation levels.  </p>

<p>&quot;In fact, the astronauts&#39; overall exposure was dominated by solar particles once outside Earth&#39;s magnetic field. The total radiation received by the astronauts varied from mission to mission but was measured to be between 0.16 and 1.14 rads (1.6 and 11.4 mGy), much less than the standard of 5 rem (50 mSv) per year set by the United States Atomic Energy Commission for people who work with radioactivity.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt</a></p>

<p>Radiation belts are something that should not be orbited in without significant shielding, but they are safe to pass through (at least in regards to the one around earth, which we have the most data on).</p>

<p>Because if the lunar lander did throw up a shit load of dust, it would take a lot longer to settle, but lets pretend Armstrong took his time leaving the lander before he went walkies.

<p>Because they landed (using very little thrust) on rock.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The very small layer of dust would have been moved away. I&#39;m not such what degree of visual &quot;dust displacement&quot; would be satisfactory to you. You seem to be under the imression the lander came to a big fiery halt in a sand pit.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Who says it did?</p>

<p>The lander&#39;s engines were shut off before it touched ground, there wouldn&#39;t be a big fiery, smoky, billowy mess. </p>

<p>Dust on the moon behaves much different than on earth.  There would be no big billowy clouds- any small amount of dust kicked up would have settled before the lander hit down and the rest would have been thrown away from the immediate area (mentioned by Aldrin) as it would act ballistically.</p>

<p>Real time biomedical data (radiation exposure was not available realtime) were monitored, on Earth by a surgeon.</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t just record the data to tape (which was, once again, always meant as backup) and then ignore it. Data was dealt with as it was received. They used proprietary IBM systems to handle the incoming data before it was stored.</p>

<p>Nasa states the tapes are lost, not that they never acquired any data.</p>

<p>That&#39;s right. He&#39;s referring to the stored, backup tapes. Not you know, the data acquired is it was produced- some of which I aready posted.  If there was no data returned they wouldn&#39;t know that Armstrong&#39;s heartrate was pushing 150 bpm before he stepped out of the lander.</p>

<p>All of the telemetry data is missing according to NASA.  Nothing you&#39;ve provided is telemetry data.  The Mission Report is not telemetry data.</p>

<p>No you didn&#39;t.  A heartbeat graph from the Mission Report is not telemetry data.  The 13,000 reels that are missing are what&#39;s being discussed here.</p>

<p>Whether they &quot;acquired data&quot; in the past is irrelevant if none of the alleged acquired data exists today, which it doesn&#39;t.  And this is true of all the Apollo missions.</p>

<p>So apparently my suspicion that you don&#39;t know what telemetry data is has turned out to be correct.  None of what you posted is telemetry data and none of the hard evidence behind the Apollo Missions, the 13,000+ reels, can be located.</p>

<p>To make money for TPTB.</p>

<p>Which is vastly more lucrative if you control both sides of the conflict. </p>

<p>So now you&#39;re alleging that NASA deliberately threw out the tapes because there was &quot;no need to hold on to&quot; them?  Where&#39;d you get that information from?  Because it directly contradicts NASA who has no idea where the tapes went and has never claimed that it &quot;didn&#39;t need to hold on to&quot; them.</p>

<p>And here it is.  I could tell this was bubbling under the surface all along, thanks for making your actual opinion clear.</p>

<p>Just FYI for the future though, claims without hard evidence to back them up are claims alleged.  That&#39;s why a &quot;paranoid idiot&quot; such as myself used the word.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say they deliberately threw out the tapes. I didn&#39;t even say they accidentally threw out the tapes. I didn&#39;t make any sort of claim. </p>

<p>I stated that storing them was difficult and not a major priority, and it was common that they&#39;d get over written.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t contradict anything I said. </p>

<p>If  keeping some clunky old reels with redundant information was #1 top priority material they wouldn&#39;t have been taped over.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing alleged anywhere. Please look up all the recording information. But you probably think that&#39;s falsified so I understand your assumption.</p>

<p>The data has been recorded. The originals are gone. Plain and simple. No information from the missions is unknown, at least none that is purpoted to be by making statments about missing telemetry.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have the option to whether I wanted to or not so how is this question relevant?  But yes, I&#39;d certainly comb through it if the evidence existed.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This is you: &quot;Yes, as the data had been recorded there was no need to hold on to big, heavy, hard to store reels.&quot;</p>

<p>Who said there was &quot;no need to hold on to&quot; the reels?  NASA?  Nope.  So this is just you saying there was no need apparently.  You aren&#39;t really making a point if you didn&#39;t mean to imply they threw the tapes out deliberately.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I stated that storing them was difficult and not a major priority</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to who?  This was <em>allegedly</em> the greatest achievement of all time (or one of them), why would the hard evidence not be a priority?  Has NASA ever said it <em>wasn&#39;t</em> a priority?  Nope, they just claim they lost it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If keeping some clunky old reels with redundant information was #1 top priority material they wouldn&#39;t have been taped over.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another unfounded claim.  Who says they were taped over?  That has never been proven - NASA simply doesn&#39;t know.  That&#39;s one of many speculations as to what could&#39;ve happened to the reels.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The data has been recorded. The originals are gone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The originals are gone, the back-ups are gone, and the 13,000+ reels and the data they contained are nowhere to be found.  These are facts despite your inability to accept them.</p>
