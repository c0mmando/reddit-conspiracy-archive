       The London and Northwestern Railway forms a straight line 180 miles long between London and Liverpool. The railroad's highest point, midway at Birmingham station, is only 240 feet above sea-level. If the world were actually a globe, however, curveting 8 inches per mile squared, the 180 mile stretch of rail would form an arc with the center point at Birmingham raising a full 5,400 feet above London and Liverpool. Adding the station's actual height (240 feet) to its theoretical inclination (5,400 feet) gives 5,640 feet as the rail's necessary height on a globe Earth, more than a thousand feet taller than Ben Nevis, the tallest mountain in Great Britain.

       The Suez Canal which connects the Mediterranean Sea with the Gulf of Suez on the Red Sea is a clear proof of the Earth's and water's non-convexity. The canal is 100 miles long and without any locks so the water within is an uninterrupted continuation of the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea. When it was constructed, the Earth's supposed curvature was not taken into account, it was dug along a horizontal datum line 26 feet below sea-level, passing through several lakes from one sea to the other, with the datum line and the water's surface running perfectly parallel over the 100 miles. The average level of the Mediterranean is 6 inches above the Red Sea, while the floodtides in the Red Sea rise 4 feet above the highest and drop 3 feet below the lowest in the Mediterranean, making the half-tide level of the Red Sea, the surface of the Mediterranean Sea, and the 100 miles of water in the canal, all a clear continuation of the same horizontal line! Were they instead the supposed curved line of globe-Earthers, the water in the center of the canal would be 1666 feet (50
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       x 8 inches = 1666 feet 8 inches) above the respective Seas on either side!

        you have a lack of understanding of how curvature works, though.
       </del>
       The degrees of curvature in an area covered by a 2 meter level, for example, is miniscule compared to the 4 degree curvature of the entire stretch of railroad. You wouldn't notice the curvature with a level.

       Yeah, that's my point... "people who understand how levels work".
      </p>
      <p>
       A level will never indicate curvature... until the tool itself is long enough (assuming it's actually straight) that one end would be "up" while the other is flat. Then it's not the bubble but the length and straightness of the tool showing you curvature. This assumes you can find a place in which terrain doesn't skew your results.

       Indeed. And this has nothing to do with sea level. It simply means that the distance between a tangent at the beginning of the railway and the end of the railway is 120feet.

       The railway is 180 miles long, and if the Earth were curved, the railway should have to account for 5,400 feet of difference from the center point to its edges. Instead, how much difference is there?

       What? Where are you getting 5400 feet? What edges? A 180 mile long string is still 180 miles long even if you bend it or curve it or wind it up into a ball. I'm not sure what measurement you think is unaccounted for.

       Take a basketball, and take a string. Cut the string to 8 inches. Lay it on your flat earth and measure...8 inches. Now lay it on the basketball. Mark the start of the string, mark the end of the string. Then measure the distance on the surface of the ball. 8 inches. See, the length isn't effected by curvature, its always constant. So im not sure what issue you feel isn't being taken into account.

       So engineers lay 180 miles worth of railroad just like a string?
      </p>
      <p>
       Railroad engineers have to account for any and all minute elevation changes. The expected curvature of the Earth is 8 inches per mile squared, and they never have to account for this.

       They actually do. Or rather, the surveyors handle that part, making sure that all parts of a building are level according to the local gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, I still don't understand your issue. What discrepancy are you having between what you expect to see and what you are actually seeing? A 180 mile long structure is going to be 180 miles long with each point on that line being level with the local gravity, following the curve of the earth. I'm not sure what the problem is.

       Which is off, the calculation of expected curvature or the actual observed height? Please be extremely specific so that we can all understand.

      <p>
       I agree, "its off" by a factor of over 40: there is clearly no curvature visible when it should be obvious in such extreme examples.

       All of that evidence comes from the same source, and is not independently reproducible. I've already shown multiple examples of independently reproducible observations that prove the flatness of the Earth.

       It's flat for several hundreds of km. I had an office in a skyscraper with nothing blocking my view.  Just by looking out the window at the horizon you can see it curve.  Daily observations for a few years.    Hell I go to the farm and stand on the silo and I can see it. I have no wierd eye disease or anything like that. This is why I'm so flabbergasted at flat earth people.

       All of that evidence comes from the same source, and is not independently reproducible. I've looked through it all multiple times; by your quick link to a google search I doubt you have.

       My point is that if I did it myself, and showed you the raw footage that proved the earth is a globe. You would just dismiss is as fake. Why should I trust your video?

       If you're going to claim all of us "round earth" people have fake evidence you better be ready to supply some unaltered evidence of your own.

       "It must be obvious to the reader that, if the earth be the globe of popular belief, the rules observed for navigating a vessel from one part of this globe to another, must be in conformity to its figure. The datum line in navigation would be an arc of a circle, and all computations would be based on the convexity of water and worked out by spherical trigonometry.
       <strong>
        Let me preface my remarks on the important branch of our subject by stating that at sea the datum line is always a horizontal line; spherical trigonometry is never used, and not one out of one thousand shipmasters understands spherical trigonometry

       He could:
      </p>
      <p>
       a) send a balloon with a camera up to at least 90,000 ft.
b) charter a flight from somewhere in the southern hemisphere, across the south pole, and report back where he ends up.
c) learn how to do math so he can correctly speak about the curvature of the earth in real numbers and not obviously inflated numbers.

       You'd have to ask the flat-earthers that question.

       EDIT: Wait, I think I can answer this now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people must be incapable of comprehending anything beyond their own personal experiences. I mean, sitting here, looking out my window, the ground absolutely looks flat. Everywhere I've ever been, it's been the same. I've even looked out over the Great Lakes and a few oceans, but I never actually saw a curvature (nor did I ever specifically watch a ship sailing away or such).
      </p>
      <p>
       If I were incapable of considering science, reproducible experiments, videos, photographs, and math that someone else did or made, I think it might be pretty hard to convince me that my own experiences were inaccurate.

       Did you not see the words, "awesome telescope" and "infrared" or did you not understand what they are and how they work?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a helpful definition of the word, "telescope", that describes how such a device might help Portugal look bigger than a "cocoa puff":
       <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/telescope">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a handy description of "FLIR", which captures light in the infrared wavelengths (one your eyes can't see). Interestingly enough, the infrared wavelengths penetrate fog, mist, smoke, etc.:
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_looking_infrared">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_looking_infrared
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Telescopes with significant magnification capabilities that are capable of capturing the infrared spectrum exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the planet is flat lika you head (
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBv3_0j0y_4">
        reference

       Right. So you put forth this supposition that the earth is flat and then when someone proposes an experiment that will absolutely PROVE you right (if it works, and it SHOULD work on a flat earth)... you deflect like THAT?

       So you're trolling, incredibly ignorant, or can't overcome cognitive dissonance?
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, go set up an IR telescope on a big hill on the US East Coast and take a picture of Portugal, publish it, and either be killed by the conspirators, lauded for disproving modern science, or convinced you were wrong about the flatness of the planet.

       Whichever outcome you get, the debate ends because you prove it one way or the other.

       Also, any outcome you get, you can stop being a laughingstock, assuming your words match the evidence the experiment produces.

       Brohammer, there is proof all over the world and Internet that the Earth is a rough sphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're the one in here railing against all reason and evidence that it's not the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       I proposed an experiment that would absolutely enable you to prove your point. That's how science works. We come up with a supposition / theory (the earth is flat), then we come up with predictions based on that theory (I should be able to see infrared light across the ocean), then we set up experiments to determine whether those predictions were accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people who support flat earth decry the simplest, most basic of experiments like you did, it should tell not only us, but
       <em>
        them
       </em>
       something.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't want to fly to another country (I don't know where you're from), you don't have to. All you need to do is get to a large enough body of water that the coastline on the other side would be well behind the horizon on a spherical earth, set up the experiment, and see what you see.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's some information about the horizon:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        For an observer on the ground with eye level at h = 5 ft 7 in (1.70 m), the horizon is at a distance of 2.9 miles (4.7 km). For an observer standing on a hill or tower 100 feet (30 m) in height, the horizon is at a distance of 12.2 miles (19.6 km).
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You don't even need that big a body of water. 30-50 miles across ought to be plenty, assuming you're avoiding tall features on either coast.

       That's a lot of vague-ry while almost all of my claims have been extremely specific examples. Do you have something specific you think helps prove your beliefs? Especially after you admit that all of your personal experience lends itself to one conclusion.

       If the earth is flat, how do you explain travel? Every pilot in the world would have to be in on it considering you can get to the same locations going east or west.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, how do you explain the temperatures at the equator, or the amount of sun &amp; the position of it in Alaska? If the Earth was flat, the sun would be in the same spot for everyone.

       This just proves my point. ALL pilots would have to be in on it, otherwise they'd be flying off the edge of the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as far as flights from NY to LA and LA to NY.. read this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Earth rotation has no, direct, bering on flight time, because the low level atmosphere rotates along with the Earth from west to east. However, high level, prevailing winds DO affect flight time,.&amp; over all the world, the high level "jet stream" blows from west to east, so, the flight from LA to NY is faster

       I've seen it explained better. Think of the earth as a disc where the north pole is the center and the south pole is the edge.
      </p>
      <p>
       So a compass would still face north (towards the middle) and you could still go around the world and come back to where you started but you have to do that east to west. North to south is not possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not exactly a flat earth believer, but it is interesting that north-south circumnavigation is such a rare thing in human history. (not sure it's ever been recorded) This on top of the heavy military presence at the north pole really feeds into the flat earth idea.

       In this case, the military would need to be at the south pole, not the north pole. Also, where would flying from somewhere in the southern hemisphere save more time by going across the south pole? I tried to find a good example of a flight that would make more sense going across the south pole, but I can't.

       I didn't mean to be rude to the guy, but believing that there's a coalition of armies large enough to stretch around this HUGE ring of ice that nobody has every been to or came back from just is highly illogical.

       To this point, I figured it would have been done because humans tend to want to do really stupid, dangerous stuff just so they can say they did. If I remember it's been done but has never been recorded and is exceptionally rare because of the reason you mentioned and because it's a very harsh climate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find myself fascinated by the flat earth stuff because there are so many nuggets out there that seem interesting. To me it all doesn't add up to the earth being flat, but I feel like they're touching on something that's hidden.

       Learn how to fly, and go do it yourself. If you run into the coalition of armies, they will welcome you with open arms as a fellow flat-earther. If not, and you end up somewhere that the globe says you should be, then you can know that the earth is round and find comfort in the beauty of science and scientific fact.

       Sadly I'm more likely to get the one about the ships. As to the point OP is trying to make, everything we build is made with pieces that are less than 100 ft. long because of transporting them. It is therefore unnecessary to consider the curvature of the earth when constructing things. If we made things with pieces that were thousands of feet long  and had to be critically precise, it might make a difference. To make his case a bit stronger he might  could find something in surveying large distances. Unfortunately he doesn't actually have reality on his side.

       Anyone can prove the sea-horizon perfectly straight and the entire Earth perfectly flat using nothing more than a level, tripods, and a wooden plank. At any altitude above sea-level, simply fix a 6-12 foot long, smooth, leveled board edgewise upon tripods and observe the skyline from eye-level behind it. The distant horizon will always align perfectly parallel with the upper edge of the board. Furthermore, if you move in a half-circle from one end of the board to the other while observing the skyline over the upper edge, you will be able to tracle a clear, flat 10-20 miles depending on your altitude. This would be impossible if the Earth were a globe and the surface of water convex! If the Earth were actually a globe 25,000 miles in circumference, the horizon would align over the center of the board but then gradually, noticeably decline towards the extremities. Just ten miles on each side would necessitate an easily visible curvature of 66.6 feet from each end to the center.

       I think that if you went skydiving it would be the most enlightening experience you could have. As you've said, go and see it with your own eyes. Its a very good day out too. Over large grasslands in Co. Down.
      </p>

       You can get together with a local charity fundraiser to cover a little bit of the cost, take a couple of days out, get some friends together to do it and go jump out of a plane.

       In slack's defense, you need to go up well above 50,000 ft to see the curvature of the earth. People who have flown in the concorde have seen it...
      </p>
      <p>
       From Concorde flying trans-Atlantic at 60K feet, the horizon is imperceptible on the south side (towards the equator) and quite pronounced towards the North Pole. Really an amazing difference between the 2 views. The most surprising aspect of the Concorde is the very smooth ride (no turbulence at flight level 600) and the lack of any sensation of speed (really the only exciting part is the takeoff, particularly at JFK where they used that great delta wing for some unique noise abatement flying).

       Thanks for the suggestion but I've been skydiving and I've been in hot air balloons; I must conclude that you have done neither because neither provided any view of any observable curvature.

       If curvature of the earth were visible from such altitudes you would be able to easily link to many pictures proving such.

       Boards come in lengths of less than 16 feet typically. That's not enough length to demonstrate the curvature of the earth. I wish this subject wasn't here  making us all look like fools.The vast lifelong evidence of a global earth
is plenty for me. From a high enough mountain top you can directly see the curvature. Every other object, of  reasonable size, in the universe is  a ball, so is the earth.

       If you are so afraid of marginalization you should take care not to marginalize others. You have dismissed many reproducible observations; do you have pictures of any curvature from high mountaintops? Because that too directly contradicts my experience and all of the photographs I can find.

       There is no physical evidence for this at all. Independently verifiable and reproducible amateur observations only show globs of light when looking at objects in the night sky. That is the extent of any actual evidence that we have for "every other object in the universe".

         You're not capable of explaining why anyone can set up a tripod/camera, aim it towards the sky, and get time lapse photos of beautiful, perfect concentric circles when we're spinning at 1k mph and moving at 66k mph.

         You have no idea why there are no direct flights to/from destinations in the southern hemisphere nor why they always disappear from GPS once they're about 1 hour from the coastline.

       You know what you're told. Your science is your religion. If one of your high priests (Neil deGrasse Tyson) told you the earth was flat you would adjust yourself accordingly to assimilate this new scientific discovery.

       Brohammer, there is proof all over the world and Internet that the Earth is a rough sphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're the one in here railing against all reason and evidence that it's not the case.
      </p>

       I proposed an experiment that would absolutely enable you to prove your point. That's how science works. We come up with a supposition / theory (the earth is flat), then we come up with predictions based on that theory (I should be able to see infrared light across the ocean), then we set up experiments to determine whether those predictions were accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people who support flat earth decry the simplest, most basic of experiments like you did, it should tell not only us, but
       <em>
        them
       </em>
       something.
      </p>

       If you don't want to fly to another country (I don't know where you're from), you don't have to. All you need to do is get to a large enough body of water that the coastline on the other side would be well behind the horizon on a spherical earth, set up the experiment, and see what you see.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's some information about the horizon:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        For an observer on the ground with eye level at h = 5 ft 7 in (1.70 m), the horizon is at a distance of 2.9 miles (4.7 km). For an observer standing on a hill or tower 100 feet (30 m) in height, the horizon is at a distance of 12.2 miles (19.6 km).
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You don't even need that big a body of water. 30-50 miles across ought to be plenty, assuming you're avoiding tall features on either coast.
