<p>&quot;mind tech&quot; is a general catchall encompassing artificial consciousness (AC), AI, mind reading, mind writing, and more traditional &quot;mind control&quot;. Directed energy is one of the main categories of Non-Lethal Weapons research under which mind control is properly categorized. The military likes to come up with obscuring phrases for politcally sensitive research so that even if you find the records, unless you know what you are looking for they don&#39;t look interesting. A lot of the research goes into countering atmospheric divergence and diffusion in long say in anti-satellite tech.</p>

<p>is not a description of anything.  It barely qualifies as a paragraph.  There is no information contained within.</p>

<p>Yes, microwave are mostly used for disruption of mental processes whereas ELF is used for more specific and controlled affects. Unrelated but the remote sensing capabilites of micromillimeter are fairly incredible. I didn&#39;t look in depth into all of the later links but the first one seems to be fake but based on real tech which we aquired from the soviets, which you can see in the public record as part of the assault in the WACO compound. Voice to Skull or more properly the Frey Effect is one of the categories of mind wring that I referred to and is very advanced at this point.</p>

<p>is four sentences that simply echo what has already been disclosed or suspected.  You provide no novel, substantive information on anything mentioned.</p>

<p>Okay, we get it.  You&#39;re less than 25.</p>

<p>Do they call it &quot;linguistic forensics&quot; when your eggheads are programming the array of profiles you can select from a dropdown, instantly changing your writing style and vocabulary?.  And what is this random strawman?  I encouraged people not to participate.  You have not answered any questions from any private reserve of knowledge that you may have.  Make a top level post espousing what you know of the various subjects that people have submitted inquiries regarding. Write it such that you are not subsequently forcing people to drag information out of you like pulling teeth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;mind tech&quot; is a general catchall encompassing artificial consciousness (AC), AI, mind reading, mind writing, and more traditional &quot;mind control&quot;. Directed energy is one of the main categories of Non-Lethal Weapons research under which mind control is properly categorized. The military likes to come up with obscuring phrases for politcally sensitive research so that even if you find the records, unless you know what you are looking for they don&#39;t look interesting. A lot of the research goes into countering atmospheric divergence and diffusion in long say in anti-satellite tech.</p>

<p><strong>Microwave weapons</strong></p>

<p><em>weapons which have been publicized by the military are as follows:
Active Denial System is a millimeter wave source that heats the water in the target&#39;s skin and thus causes incapacitating pain. It is being used by the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory and Raytheon for riot-control duty. Though intended to cause severe pain while leaving no lasting damage, some concern has been voiced as to whether the system could cause irreversible damage to the eyes. There has yet to be testing for long-term side effects of exposure to the microwave beam. It can also destroy unshielded electronics: see TEMPEST (research into unintended electronic release of information).[6] The device comes in various sizes including attached to a humvee.
Vigilant Eagle is an airport defense system that directs high-frequency microwaves towards any projectile that is fired at an aircraft.[7] The system consists of a missile-detecting and tracking subsystem (MDT), a command and control system, and a scanning array. The MDT is a fixed grid of passive infrared (IR) cameras. The command and control system determines the missile launch point. The scanning array projects microwaves that disrupt the surface-to-air missile&#39;s guidance system, deflecting it from the aircraft.[8]
Bofors HPM Blackout is a high-powered microwave weapon system which is stated to be able to destroy at distance a wide variety of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) electronic equipment. It is stated to be not lethal to humans.[9][10][11]
The effective radiated power (ERP) of the EL/M-2080 Green Pine radar makes it a possible candidate for conversion into a directed-energy weapon, by focusing pulses of radar energy on target missiles.[12] The energy spikes are tailored to enter missiles through antennas or sensor apertures where they can fool guidance systems, scramble computer memories or even burn out sensitive electronic components.[12]
AESA radars mounted on fighter aircraft have been slated as directed energy weapons against missiles, however, a senior US Air Force officer was quoted noting: &quot;they aren&#39;t particularly suited to create weapons effects on missiles because of limited antenna size, power and field of view&quot;.[13] Potentially lethal effects are produced only inside 100 metres range, and disruptive effects at distances on the order of one kilometre. Moreover, cheap countermeasures can be applied to existing missiles</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, microwave are mostly used for disruption of mental processes whereas ELF is used for more specific and controlled affects. Unrelated but the remote sensing capabilites of micromillimeter are fairly incredible. I didn&#39;t look in depth into all of the later links but the first one seems to be fake but based on real tech which we aquired from the soviets, which you can see in the public record as part of the assault in the WACO compound. Voice to Skull or more properly the Frey Effect is one of the categories of mind wring that I referred to and is very advanced at this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Different modes of function are used for different technologies. microwave beams focus on disturbing the release and flow of neurotransmitters across synapses. The ELF tech depends on the power level used. The high powered magnetic fields are modulated to cause an electric field which actually cause electrons to flow through the brain in controllable ways. The low powered ELF is instead used to affect the biogenic magnetite which creates a subtle magnetic field which is the basis of consciousness binding in the brain. No single frequency is used, the frequencies are modulated in the either the microwave or ELF range sometimes extending into VLF</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consciousness binding is the process by which the brain takes all of its information that it is processing and turns it into one big picture. It is the reason why there isn&#39;t one part of you that sees, one part that hears, one part that thinks etc. You can actually find videos online of what is described as &quot;shutting down specific parts of the brain&quot; with magnetic fields. In reality, shutting down part of your brain would likely kill you, what is happening is that the binding process is disrupted. It is similar to cutting the corpus callosum where there are two distinct parts of the brain each of which is not bound to the other. </p>

<p>The brain works on an electro-chemical-magnetic basis. Neurotransmitters are just chemicals that cause neurons to react in specific ways. Effecting the neurotransmitters has as wide an effect as the brain can produce essentially. </p>

<p>The same as above, electron flow through neurons is one of the basic forms of brain processing, it is similar to electrons in a computer. Controlling the electron flow is similiar to being able to control the commands that a computer processes.</p>

This was later built upon by disinfo agents Charles Berlitz and Bill Moore. No, Blue Beam is soviet disinformation. It is important to understand that the Soviets run disinformation operations too but their goals were wider than ours in that the included long term political subversion. Very often if you see a conspiracy that talks about the intelligence community being taken over by some conspiracy of underground 5th columnist nazis who have infiltrated the western intelligence community and are building up a coup to institute a neo-fascist government it is soviet disinformation. Blue Beam is one of those things. AFOSI is Air Force Office of Special Investigations. I have never seen anything that implied that HAARP had any purpose other than its stated goals.</p>

<p>&quot;mind tech&quot; is a general catchall encompassing artificial consciousness (AC), AI, mind reading, mind writing, and more traditional &quot;mind control&quot;. Directed energy is one of the main categories of Non-Lethal Weapons research under which mind control is properly categorized. The military likes to come up with obscuring phrases for politcally sensitive research so that even if you find the records, unless you know what you are looking for they don&#39;t look interesting. A lot of the research goes into countering atmospheric divergence and diffusion in long say in anti-satellite tech.</p>

<p>Yes, microwave are mostly used for disruption of mental processes whereas ELF is used for more specific and controlled affects. Unrelated but the remote sensing capabilites of micromillimeter are fairly incredible.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and it isn&#39;t so much about aliens as it is about the Soviet. It started out as a campaign to convince the Soviets that we had a superweapon (which I talked about in another post) as well as in codebreaking efforts. It was not intended to be taken as extraterrestrial (which you can see in the Kenneth Arnold sighting) but it spun out of control with the media. More recently it has been used to cover up sightings of stealth aircraft and to combat soviet/russian espionage and subversion. Russian intelligence has had a large presence in the UFO community for a long time. There are many &quot;true believers&quot; in UFOs working on classified tech in the US government and spies will use the guise of UFO research to try to get classified information out of them. The disinformation is often used to track the information flow in the UFO community by dealing out what are called &quot;marked cards&quot;. information is like dye in a river, you can put it in at one end and see where it comes out. Disinfo is also used to &quot;flush the moles out of their holes&quot;, you leak a piece of information and then see who comes running.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>anti-grav doesn&#39;t work, at least at our current level of technology. I am not a tech guy but I had to learn the ELI5 version to know what I was protecting. The Electro-magnetic propulsion is better described as electrohydrodynamic and is based on the utilizing high voltages to create corona discharges upon a plasma which is generated on the direct exterior to propel either light weight or lighter-than-air platfroms. Prototypes were developed in the late 70s. and were improved into the late 80s&#39; early 90s at which point they were still fairly basic in their capabilites. Since then more powerful power sources have improved upon their effects, but it is still more of a novelty compared to the capabilities of some of the more traditional aircraft. Their best atribute is small radius and high g turns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically there is not enough power to make it work on big aerial platforms but it works in field tests? It works in principle? correct ?</p>

<p>Is it tested in space or just on earth? Also, is there working prototype models that were tested in field ?</p>

<p>If I understood it correctly..it is use of polarization of electric field to propel object in some direction by manipulating polarization of outer layer of object ? more or less something like that ? Or corona discharges are used as &quot;impulse drive&quot;. Like, giving impulses of polarization to move object ?</p>

<p>How fast can it go ?</p>

<p>If you want to know more </p>

<p>Corona discharge</p>

<p><strong>Impulse drive</strong></p>

<p><em>Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual indicates that the impulse engines are nuclear fusion engines where the plasma from the fusion reactor powers a massive magnetic coil to propel the ship. It is a form of magnetohydrodynamic or magnetoplasmadynamic thruster. This is used in conjunction with the ship&#39;s warp drive&#39;s alteration of the ship&#39;s relativistic mass, to achieve mid-to-high sub-light speeds.</em></p>

<p>Basically impulse drive from star trek works and U.S. government has prototypes. Can you give more info ? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically. It has only been tested on Earth to my knowledge but yes space applications are one of the reasons that so much research has been done in this relatively limited technology. But honestly, any space testing would have been handled by Air Force Space Command and I would not have had a need to know. It hasn&#39;t broken Mach 1 or even gotten very close.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, look up the pictures that Paul Bennewitz took which were published in X-Descending of an early prototype. Limitations are on the speed and distance.  <a href="http://s1163.photobucket.com/user/TheGUT/media/BBennewitzUFO_zps59ad603f.png.html">http://s1163.photobucket.com/user/TheGUT/media/BBennewitzUFO_zps59ad603f.png.html</a></p>

<p>It uses traditional power sources, nothing specifically fancy. Materials used are lightweight alloys, which are very advanced but nothing specifically exciting. I don&#39;t know the specific Power output but it is not very efficient.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The anti-grav disinformation dates back to the early 50&#39;s based on a joint collaboration between MI6 and CIA based on an even early scheme run by the CIG and alumni of X-2 from WWII. Its purpose was originally part of a disinfo scheme aimed at the soviet union to convince them that we had high altitude intercontinental craft with the capability of carrying nuclear payload, essentially an unstoppable weapon at that time. That disinfo scheme has since been absorbed into other disinfo schemes aimed at different players.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not an expert on 9/11 by any means so don&#39;t crucify me here I am just giving you my guess 1. I would assume that jets were scrambled after it became apparent that the planes were hijacked which was not immediately known.  2. I didn&#39;t work with commercial craft, but military craft can certainly exceed their recommended max speed. Commercial planes usually fly around 600 miles per hour so 100 miles per hour after a descent isn&#39;t really a huge change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting question. I know that there have been some groundbreaking discoveries in producing artificial consciousness that were made by NSA. I don&#39;t know in extensive detail how it works because it was handled by an outside agency, but this is what I have heard.</p>

<p>First of all let me clarify that when I am talking about consciousness I am not talking about self-awareness, or thinking, or anything like that. I am talking about perception in and of itself.</p>

<p>Consciousness is not an emergent phenomena as has usually been assumed. It is an inherent property of matter similar to mass or charge. A free floating particle is apparently conscious, but not conscious anything in particular or any external phenomena. Conscious can be organized in such a way that their is a feedback look of perceptions of external phenomena back into the system of consciousness at which point it is termed self-aware.  It does not involve any undiscovered classical fields and so I have assumed based on that, and the group that discovered this, that the organization of consciousness is based on some kind of quantum effect. It was apparently discovered as part of a group looking into the relation of cybernetics to quantum entanglement. They were looking into the functional basis of the evolution of consciousness. In other words what actual benefit/feedback did the conscious mind provide to the physical mind.</p>
