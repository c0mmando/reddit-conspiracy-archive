I have avoided it because I don&#39;t want to see evidence of dead kids. It&#39;s depressing and it sucks. I have not fully put the conspiracy out of my mind but I hate to believe someone..anyone...would make up a story about kids being shot to death at school for whatever reason. So , if anyone has some convincing info, share it. I&#39;ve now become curious.</p>

<p>Most of the things he says are lies. He says the wounded should have been transported by helicopter, this is a lie because the 4 wounded were already transported by car/ambulance. They were already at the hospital long before any helicopter could have taken off.</p>

<p>He claims that no paramedics were allowed in the school. Complete lie.</p>

<p>He claims that all the victims were pronounced dead within 8 minutes. Complete lie.</p>

<p>He claims identification of deceased is never done through photographs. Lie, it&#39;s standard practice.</p>

<p>He repeatedly lies about filing a &quot;federal lawsuit&quot; exposing the Sandy Hook &quot;hoax.&quot; He was supposed to file it last November. He says it&#39;s been filed. Where is it? </p>

<p>Thats a link to all of his questions - keep in mind he is a school safety professional.  Many of his questions seem a little strange, but are related to procedures which should have been followed during any school emergency.  In all honesty I think his list could be much more concise, but it does point to many holes in the official narrative.</p>

<p>Other questions I have are asked in the Sofia Smallstorm Sandy Hook video here - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1yfJDCMU64">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1yfJDCMU64</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s quite long but there are a series of questions asked by a military man during the introduction (within first 5 minutes) about how a doughy 150lb young man could use the same gear that he does as a 220lb combat specialist.  Lanza got 26 victims in 5-7 minutes with 3-11 shots each, also impressive even for a combat specialist.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s a case of &quot;releasing&quot; these videos and photos - I believe it&#39;s an issue of fabricating them, and inventing medical histories, backgrounds, and entire lives - which is why it was only done sloppily with facebook charities that went up days before the drill / hoax / event / fraud.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>sigh</em></p>

<p>Adam Lanza could carry the weight. It&#39;s not an issue. That&#39;s why idiots ask &quot;how could he carry it&quot; rather than arguing &quot;he couldn&#39;t carry it.&quot; They know.</p>

<p>As far as marksmanship: he was shooting children packed into a bathroom so tightly that they could not move or close the door. He was firing from point-blank range and literally could not miss. It&#39;s not &quot;impressive&quot; at all. Would you please stop perpetuating this lunacy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that the official story claims 26 killed etc.  The burden of proof isn&#39;t on me - it&#39;s on those who support the official narrative, which is completely preposterous.  The claim is that 26 were killed and pronounced dead and there is zero evidence to support the official narrative and a lot more questions raised than answered, which is why my objections are listed in question form and in the Sofia Smallstorm video.</p>

<p>Edit:  if you&#39;d like reasons, I&#39;d cite the total lack of photographic evidence including the dashboard camera that conflicts with the official timeline, the homicide report that says zero killed, the demolition of the school, and the Facebook and other charity groups that were set up ahead of time</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The dashboard camera does not conflict with the official timeline. One of dash cameras is 1min20sec off on its timestamp. Make this very simple correction and you can relieve yourself of this supposed inconsistency. Note that this was clearly explained in the official report. If you have any guts, take to task whoever told you otherwise.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the homicide report that says zero killed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Complete horseshit. I assume you&#39;re reading the FBI report and looking at the wrong page. Your lack of reading comprehension is not a sign of conspiracy. Merely your own ignorance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the demolition of the school</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...was voted upon by the town. Is the entire town in on whatever you think you&#39;re alleging? What exactly is lost in the demolition? You do understand that all evidence had already been removed, right? Are all of the other instances where notorious crime scenes were demolished thus conspiracies? Could you name even a single one of these instances, since this is apparently an issue you are passionate about? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and the Facebook and other charity groups that were set up ahead of time</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No such thing exists. Just paranoid fantasies of liars. Cite one single instance, and be careful to check that it wasn&#39;t debunked years ago before you embarrass yourself.</p>

<p>If you care about the truth, you will do what I challenge you to do. If you prefer horseshit conspiracy theories, you won&#39;t. Just don&#39;t make an mistake as to where you place yourself in rational society.</p>

<p>Where has there been justification for some of the most invasive, costly and disempowering policies of recent years?</p>

<p>Bin Laden has never been shown to have been responsible. Oswald could never match the evidence of JFK&#39;s assassins. Meanwhile, we know each detail of OJ&#39;s trial. And we have people like you saying that we have to establish the guilt of the government rather than the government has to establish the truth abut Sandy Hook. </p>

<p>If the government would like to include Sandy Hook in the national narrative and motivate the electorate to support policies derived from it, then they need to prove it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are plenty of photos of the evacuated classmates, and yet here you are completely disregarding them in favor of your fantasy reality. Same thing with photos of blood.

<p>That&#39;s not an AR-15 on the floor of the classroom? It&#39;s not registered to Nancy Lanza? She didn&#39;t live in the house with her son? 
That&#39;s not his car, registered to her, photographed outside the school?
The surviving families are not real? The people who know them and knew their murdered children are not real? The people who in turn knew them? How many millions of &quot;actors&quot; were hired here?
The medical examiner is a fraud? If so, why aren&#39;t all the hundreds of criminals convicted on his testimony appealing their cases based on this?
Where exactly did any of the hundreds of kids in that district go to elementary school if not Sandy Hook? And not a single person in the entire town speaks up and says &quot;wait a minute, that&#39;s not an active school! All the kids attend X school!&quot; Not one. Nobody. 
Where exactly is Adam Lanza? Was he not a real person? All the people who knew him, the doctors that delivered him, his birth certificate and death certificate, all of educational records, all of his teachers and classmates, his entire family, all the witnesses who saw him at firing ranges or playing arcade games... these are all fake people too?</p>

<p>You&#39;re not being a skeptic if you don&#39;t have explanations for these questions; you&#39;re just sticking your fingers in your ears and playing make-believe. What specifically are you claiming happened, if not a school shooting? Man up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no proof that anyone was killed at Sandy Hook that day.  No bodies, and no pix of bodies.  </p>

<p>There were supposedly about 450 kids attending the school, but we&#39;ve only seen pix of about 20 kids.  No one was triaged.  No one was airlifted.  The road to the school was completely blocked by personal vehicles when it should&#39;ve been cleared for emergency personnel.  The families (oddly the majority are actors and/or musicians) that we saw &quot;mourning&quot; were laughing.  Gene Rosen&#39;s story is ludicrous and illogical.  Wayne Carver&#39;s story is unprofessional and inane.  A few people made millions off of donations.  The school was completely demolished, as was the Lanza family home.  Multiple &quot;Sandy Hook&quot; subreddits were taken down. Those are the biggest red flags in my book.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The issue is the dog that didn&#39;t bark.</p>

<p>From the police records, you have students being evacuated across the school parking lot over an extended period. But from multiple dashcams, we see no sign of any students. We don&#39;t see signs of hurrying, of ... anything other than a few cops walking around. i have yet to see any evidence which would be present if the event were real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, in the second video...</p>

<p>At 1:06:02 in the video, the cached date/time is in GMT. I ran a conversion on this and here are the results:</p>

<p>(GMT): Thu, 13 Dec 2012 01:22:20 GMT
CST: 12/12/2012, 7:22:20 PM</p>

<p>Therefore, the cache was actually 2 days before. That is, IF it is indeed accurate.</p>
