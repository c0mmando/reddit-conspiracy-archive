       So... This is old new, I realize, but my boyfriend asked me today if I've ever seen pictures from sandy hook. I have avoided it because I don't want to see evidence of dead kids. It's depressing and it sucks. I have not fully put the conspiracy out of my mind but I hate to believe someone..anyone...would make up a story about kids being shot to death at school for whatever reason. So , if anyone has some convincing info, share it. I've now become curious.

       To the best of my understanding, the entire thing was a hoax / drill / exercise.  There were a lot of fundraising and charity organizations for Sandy Hook victims that were created before the date of the alleged shooting - details aren't fresh on my mind but look into Wolfgang Halbig, he is an investigator that can break down the farce better than I can.

      <p>
       Most of the things he says are lies. He says the wounded should have been transported by helicopter, this is a lie because the 4 wounded were already transported by car/ambulance. They were already at the hospital long before any helicopter could have taken off.
      </p>
      <p>
       He claims that no paramedics were allowed in the school. Complete lie.

       He repeatedly lies about filing a "federal lawsuit" exposing the Sandy Hook "hoax." He was supposed to file it last November. He says it's been filed. Where is it?

       Thats a link to all of his questions - keep in mind he is a school safety professional.  Many of his questions seem a little strange, but are related to procedures which should have been followed during any school emergency.  In all honesty I think his list could be much more concise, but it does point to many holes in the official narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other questions I have are asked in the Sofia Smallstorm Sandy Hook video here -

       It's quite long but there are a series of questions asked by a military man during the introduction (within first 5 minutes) about how a doughy 150lb young man could use the same gear that he does as a 220lb combat specialist.  Lanza got 26 victims in 5-7 minutes with 3-11 shots each, also impressive even for a combat specialist.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe it's a case of "releasing" these videos and photos - I believe it's an issue of fabricating them, and inventing medical histories, backgrounds, and entire lives - which is why it was only done sloppily with facebook charities that went up days before the drill / hoax / event / fraud.

       Adam Lanza could carry the weight. It's not an issue. That's why idiots ask "how could he carry it" rather than arguing "he couldn't carry it." They know.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as marksmanship: he was shooting children packed into a bathroom so tightly that they could not move or close the door. He was firing from point-blank range and literally could not miss. It's not "impressive" at all. Would you please stop perpetuating this lunacy?

       No offense but I'll take the former combat specialist's word over yours in this case.  The issue is that no credible evidence has been presented that this was a real event - I would like to sympathize with you and others in the wake of tragedy, but not on

       The problem is that the official story claims 26 killed etc.  The burden of proof isn't on me - it's on those who support the official narrative, which is completely preposterous.  The claim is that 26 were killed and pronounced dead and there is zero evidence to support the official narrative and a lot more questions raised than answered, which is why my objections are listed in question form and in the Sofia Smallstorm video.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:  if you'd like reasons, I'd cite the total lack of photographic evidence including the dashboard camera that conflicts with the official timeline, the homicide report that says zero killed, the demolition of the school, and the Facebook and other charity groups that were set up ahead of time

      <p>
       The dashboard camera does not conflict with the official timeline. One of dash cameras is 1min20sec off on its timestamp. Make this very simple correction and you can relieve yourself of this supposed inconsistency. Note that this was clearly explained in the official report. If you have any guts, take to task whoever told you otherwise.

      <p>
       Complete horseshit. I assume you're reading the FBI report and looking at the wrong page. Your lack of reading comprehension is not a sign of conspiracy. Merely your own ignorance.

      <p>
       ...was voted upon by the town. Is the entire town in on whatever you think you're alleging? What exactly is lost in the demolition? You do understand that all evidence had already been removed, right? Are all of the other instances where notorious crime scenes were demolished thus conspiracies? Could you name even a single one of these instances, since this is apparently an issue you are passionate about?

      <p>
       No such thing exists. Just paranoid fantasies of liars. Cite one single instance, and be careful to check that it wasn't debunked years ago before you embarrass yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you care about the truth, you will do what I challenge you to do. If you prefer horseshit conspiracy theories, you won't. Just don't make an mistake as to where you place yourself in rational society.

       You don't have a single shred and therein lies the problem. Our national debate is co-opted by those who can run psy-ops across the screen to justify whichever agenda they want. But in order to justify an agenda, you must demonstrate the problem is real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where has there been justification for some of the most invasive, costly and disempowering policies of recent years?
      </p>
      <p>
       Bin Laden has never been shown to have been responsible. Oswald could never match the evidence of JFK's assassins. Meanwhile, we know each detail of OJ's trial. And we have people like you saying that we have to establish the guilt of the government rather than the government has to establish the truth abut Sandy Hook.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the government would like to include Sandy Hook in the national narrative and motivate the electorate to support policies derived from it, then they need to prove it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their evidence to date is, we said so. And that is Good enough for you.

       In order to have a murder weapon, someone first needs to have been murdered. Where are the victims? The blood? The classmates?
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps before rushing into a conspiracy debate, perhaps consider what is being debated. The specific theory you are challenging is a non event being positioned as an atrocity.

       There are plenty of photos of the evacuated classmates, and yet here you are completely disregarding them in favor of your fantasy reality. Same thing with photos of blood. Obviously they have no effect on you, so what would be the point of unsealing photos of slaughtered children?
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's "non-event" then how do you explain all of the evidence (keeping in mind that "only video of dead bodies counts as evidence" is just something you made up and has absolutely no bearing on law, logic or real life at all):
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not an AR-15 on the floor of the classroom? It's not registered to Nancy Lanza? She didn't live in the house with her son? 
That's not his car, registered to her, photographed outside the school?
The surviving families are not real? The people who know them and knew their murdered children are not real? The people who in turn knew them? How many millions of "actors" were hired here?
The medical examiner is a fraud? If so, why aren't all the hundreds of criminals convicted on his testimony appealing their cases based on this?
Where exactly did any of the hundreds of kids in that district go to elementary school if not Sandy Hook? And not a single person in the entire town speaks up and says "wait a minute, that's not an active school! All the kids attend X school!" Not one. Nobody. 
Where exactly is Adam Lanza? Was he not a real person? All the people who knew him, the doctors that delivered him, his birth certificate and death certificate, all of educational records, all of his teachers and classmates, his entire family, all the witnesses who saw him at firing ranges or playing arcade games... these are all fake people too?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're not being a skeptic if you don't have explanations for these questions; you're just sticking your fingers in your ears and playing make-believe. What specifically are you claiming happened, if not a school shooting? Man up.

       As a parent, there is no way I can accept the video of a alleged parent of a murdered child smiling and joking between his child's death and just before an appearance on national tv.
      </p>
      <p>
       The police dash cams show nothing resembling the reported activities and therefore those reported events did not happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       What didn't happen? Students weren't being evacuated. And the more you look into, the more it is smoke and mirrors.

       It's marketing. Cheap and effective. And we are the consumers. And even though I don't believe a word of their marketing, I'm forced into paying because folks like you will believe anything.

       There's no proof that anyone was killed at Sandy Hook that day.  No bodies, and no pix of bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were supposedly about 450 kids attending the school, but we've only seen pix of about 20 kids.  No one was triaged.  No one was airlifted.  The road to the school was completely blocked by personal vehicles when it should've been cleared for emergency personnel.  The families (oddly the majority are actors and/or musicians) that we saw "mourning" were laughing.  Gene Rosen's story is ludicrous and illogical.  Wayne Carver's story is unprofessional and inane.  A few people made millions off of donations.  The school was completely demolished, as was the Lanza family home.  Multiple "Sandy Hook" subreddits were taken down. Those are the biggest red flags in my book.

      <p>
       At 1:06:02 in the video, the cached date/time is in GMT. I ran a conversion on this and here are the results:

      <p>
       (GMT): Thu, 13 Dec 2012 01:22:20 GMT

       Depending on how you look at this, it could mean that all visitors must check in with some sort of command post, or, all of the people involved in the exercise must check in.

       From the police records, you have students being evacuated across the school parking lot over an extended period. But from multiple dashcams, we see no sign of any students. We don't see signs of hurrying, of ... anything other than a few cops walking around. i have yet to see any evidence which would be present if the event were real.

       It's fascinating how most of the evidence can go different ways depending on how you view it.

       (GMT): Thu, 13 Dec 2012 01:22:20 GMT
