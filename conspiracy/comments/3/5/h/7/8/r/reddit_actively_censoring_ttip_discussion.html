<p>Your comment had to be approved by <a href="/u/automoderator">/u/automoderator</a> after it was marked as spam by the reddit filter.
There are three options, please act accordingly:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You are a spammer. Please choose another subreddit. You will understand that we will have to do our best that your domain, your content and all related accounts will be known to the reddit admins as spam.</p></li>
<li><p>You have used a short url in the comments. Please edit your comment and don&#39;t use bit.ly et al. PM the moderators after you are ready because reddit most likely will reban this comment again.</p></li>
<li><p>Your comment contains a link to a banned domain or has otherwise triggered the spam filter. Everything should be fine by now but you may want to improve your comment.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Should you be a spammer, please don&#39;t take this automated approval as an invitation to spam this subreddit.
Every approval will be checked and if we discover abuse, this aid will be removed immediately.</p>

<p>It seems that a comment I posted on a discussion got caught as SPAM by the <strong>reddit</strong> rules. (not those of the subreddit) The intriguing part is that my comment didn&#39;t contain any of the characteristics that seem to usually warrant getting caught by the filter. None of those listed by AutoModerator at least.</p>

<p>I merely posted a short opinion on the TTIP. What&#39;s more, my comment was, I think, more insightful than the top comment...</p>

<p>My comment was hidden long enough to loose any visibility.</p>

<p>Am I right to feel frustrated by this to think that there might be some conspiracy on reddit&#39;s side to hinder TTIP discussion here or am I being a conspitard?</p>

EG, in Australia the government was sued hundreds of millions of dollars because they outlawed smoking. Sued by the tobacco industry.
There was a great video I saw on RT about this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got shadow banned a year or two ago for no reason that was ever explained to me - and after complaining for months, I got reinstated, again without a reason.</p>

<p>Reddit definitely has bullshit in great, piled masses.</p>

<p>That said, as a programmer, when you get some complex explanation of an algorithmic thing like this, even if the explanation doesn&#39;t quite match the document, it&#39;s the program at fault - it&#39;s an oopsie by someone like me.  Getting these things right 100% of the time on natural text is basically impossible.</p>

<p>If &quot;they&quot; were trying to fuck you up, they&#39;d simply shadowban your posting and you wouldn&#39;t even know that no one was seeing it - or even just brigade downvoted it.</p>
