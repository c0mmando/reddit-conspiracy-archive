       The police need to be monitored to keep their violence down.  The same for the crowd.  Too many times, I hear about undercover shills creating violence.  Then the media machine have their story.

       We live in an even more socialized country in Europe, and we are watching it be bankrupted because of social services. As immigrants pour into the country &amp; receive the same benefits as citizens because of EU laws, there aren't enough people paying into the system to support it anymore. Services are being slowly cut day by day - while the taxes remain at &gt;65%.

       Currently there is a very high post about vandalism from the protestors. As soon as the "media" has its narrative they will smother you with the story.

       Not being from the uk I have no idea what "anti tory" even means, and after looking around for a few mintues it seems people are angry over welfare cuts?
      </p>
      <p>
       Will this world never be happy until we can all have everything we want at the expense of the few who decide to work and make something of themselves?

       No. They're angry because what "austerity" truly means is that all vital systems, including healthcare, education and yes welfare for the needy, are being cut in order to bring the deficit under control. Only one problem. The government is saving pennies from that shit while London becomes the most billionaire-infested city in the world. Please stop believing the lies folks... they're just trying to make you hate poor people :/

       So guys tell me why I have it so wrong then. Just because people squander their   lives and make nothing of themselves, it does not become the responsibility of those that worked hard too make something of themselves.

       That is the only lesson I can take from this is that the have nots feel entitled to take from the haves.

       The benefits bill is a tiny part of this. But even with benefits, most benefits are being paid to people in work. People who work hard every day but still need state assistance because wages are shamefully low. On top of this, vital public services (including health) are being slashed for ideological reasons. People are actually dying because of these policies.

       Hi mate, I think the anger stems more from the fact that after the 2008 crash the UK government bailed out the banks, using taxpayer money, as they were 'too big to fail'. The banks then duly gave massive bonuses to their executives while the middle got squeezed further and the people at the lower end of the socioeconomic scale are forced to go to food banks so they don't starve in the street.
      </p>
      <p>
       The anger is not about entitlement. It's about theft from the populace with the transfer of money directly from the pockets of the UK taxpayer to the 0.1%.
      </p>
      <p>
       Source - was a UK taxpayer.

       Dude I think you're missing the point. The UK taxpayer spent £850bn bailing the banks out after 2008 (in the US it was in the trillions), yet hardworking people like yourself are being led to believe that poor people are stealing from you.
      </p>

       If you want an idea of how we're all being raped by Wall Street/CoL and our governments, I'd recommend reading The Money Bubble (
       <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Money-Bubble-James-Turk/dp/1622170342">
        www.amazon.com/The-Money-Bubble-James-Turk/dp/1622170342
       </a>
       ). I can assure you that the 'haves' of this world don't need you to defend them from the 'have nots' - they're doing just fine (probably better than any political class has had it in human history).
