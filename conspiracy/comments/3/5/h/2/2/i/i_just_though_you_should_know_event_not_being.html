<p>We live in an even more socialized country in Europe, and we are watching it be bankrupted because of social services.

    <div class="md"><p>Hi mate, I think the anger stems more from the fact that after the 2008 crash the UK government bailed out the banks, using taxpayer money, as they were &#39;too big to fail&#39;. The banks then duly gave massive bonuses to their executives while the middle got squeezed further and the people at the lower end of the socioeconomic scale are forced to go to food banks so they don&#39;t starve in the street.</p>

<p>The anger is not about entitlement. It&#39;s about theft from the populace with the transfer of money directly from the pockets of the UK taxpayer to the 0.1%.</p>

<p>Source - was a UK taxpayer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude I think you&#39;re missing the point. The UK taxpayer spent £850bn bailing the banks out after 2008 (in the US it was in the trillions), yet hardworking people like yourself are being led to believe that poor people are stealing from you.</p>

<p>If you want an idea of how we&#39;re all being raped by Wall Street/CoL and our governments, I&#39;d recommend reading The Money Bubble (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Money-Bubble-James-Turk/dp/1622170342">www.amazon.com/The-Money-Bubble-James-Turk/dp/1622170342</a>). I can assure you that the &#39;haves&#39; of this world don&#39;t need you to defend them from the &#39;have nots&#39; - they&#39;re doing just fine (probably better than any political class has had it in human history).</p>
