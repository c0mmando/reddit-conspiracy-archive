       I am not saying that all of these bullet-points are accurate or proof of fraud. Some deserve more thought than others. But if we cannot ASK QUESTIONS about the most historic moment in human history, then what can we ask about?

       What other FACTS confirm the moon landing really happening?

       I'd like to see more evidence of the claim that 'Russians could track the whole thing from start to finish'.

      <p>
       How? We can barely track an asteroid with todays technology.

       Maybe someone can look into this, I've never seen evidence other than the claim.

       Asteroids are a bitch because you typically don't know where they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do know where they are, the problem is solved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although we can track asteroids like
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99942_Apophis">
        Apophis
       </a>
       - Helps if they're large enough. But we didn't know that one was coming prior to detecting it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But back to manmade thingies, we're still keeping track of Vogager 1 which is leaving the solar system.

       It is my understanding that the last manned mission to the moon apollo 18 , was canceled because it was determined that the russians had developed a radar tracking system capable of tracking the apollo craft.  I read it once years ago and remember it but can't find the link.

       Also worth pointing out the correlation between moon launches/landings and military operations in the increasingly unpopular Vietnam War. The moon stuff pushed the war stuff out of the media coverage. As soon as the Vietnam War ended, so did the moon landings.
      </p>
      <p>
       And nobody's tried to go back since? And the Van Allen Belts are now too radioactive for people to pass through? And the space suits could alternate from warming to cooling the human body as the astronauts passed from shadow to light, sometimes at the same time?
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't decided whether the moon landings were faked or not, but I'm definitely leaning towards faked. It's pretty clear the society we live under is managed as much as the Russians under Pravda ever were, the US has just done a better job. A masterful job, really.

       Heating isn't a problem, only cooling. Spacesuits use a garment which is pretty much identical to one worn by on earth by firefighters and racecar drivers and such

       That makes sense.  It's always something I wondered but had never been given a plausible answer.  Most teachers &amp; professor types would just smile and move on.  I gave up for many years because of non answers like that.  :-)

       Don't forget the ridiculous call to space from Nixon which if you listen to it sounds like a commercial. No questions like what's it like, how was the landing? Just pure and plain propaganda.

       Nixon needed the Apollo 11 telephone call to distract the public from other events going on that weekend... primarily the Chappaquiddick incident. Nixon even called a National Holiday on the Monday following the lunar landing. That's a day off work for all government employees.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are right. Nixon was playing a role in a TV commercial for America. He was an actor, like the actornauts. The White House side was totally scripted with the assistance of Frank Borman. But Neil &amp; Buzz weren't told who the call was coming from. It was a surprise to them.

       modern cell phone technology could learn a lesson from "nasa phone the moon" and no dropped call.  I remember calling my grandma long distance in the early 70's and at 600 miles away I experienced delay in the transmission.

       They aren't common because they were there to take photos of the moon and if you set your camera exposure to take photos of the stars you will overexpose the moon (you see the same effect if you try to photograph the moon from earth).

       just a handful of pictures from a camera on a stand on the Moon would have been priceless for the astronomy community. we got none, not a single starfield picture outside the atmosphere from NASA, from above the Van Allen belts.

       For the relatively wide angle lenses the cameras were using (60mm on medium format~ 30mm on full frame) atmospheric distortion isn't really an issue.

       For luna astronomy to be worthwhile you are going to need something with a fairly long focal length, a decent sized mirror and a tracking mount. That's a lot of weight and realistically you are better off putting the system into earth orbit where you don't have to worry about dust.
      </p>
      <p>
       They did do some UV astronomy (which you can't really do from earth) and in those images you can see stars:

       You are not offering any evidence to the contrary of the official narrative. You are hardly asking any relevant questions. You are mostly suggesting some possible alternatives to parts of the official narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure what is your question now. It's an illogical question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do we have to prove that your alternatives are nonsense? Which is not logical. If you believe that the whole surface of the moon is reflective and that scientists are actually using that instead of the mirrors, the burden of proof is on you. The best one could do in the response to eg. your Laser lunar ranging point is to repeat word-for-word the official narrative. What else do you expect? Is there any part of the official claims on the laser lunar ranging that you believe needs additional evidence? What kind of proof you expect on moon rocks?

       I dunno, I guess that is what I am looking for. I am not convinced one way or the other honestly. I lean more toward the fact that we did go. But the more I examine the evidence, the more shocked I am at how flimsy it is.

       Here are the questions I would ask:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) can we trust that the
       <em>
        few
       </em>
       organization with the technology to conduct these experiment are
       <em>
        truly
       </em>
       unbiased and not affiliated or influenced by NASA
      </p>
      <p>
       2) like most things concerning space or the moon, we really have to take NASA's word, because we have no idea if the moon can or cannot reflect like a mirror, or what kind of returning reflection constitutes "good enough" for proof
      </p>
      <p>
       3) reflectors on the moon do not prove that MAN put them there, unmanned robots could have left them
      </p>
      <p>
       4) strictly for arguments sake, reflectors on the moon do not prove that humans are involved, as far as we know, life outside of Earth exists and they left or have reflective structures on the moon
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I know that I am just going out of my way to poke holes here. But I also feel like Apollo enthusiasts go out of their way to trust NASA and to rationalize the inconsistencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am still on the fence about all this. So I think that questions should be asked (even slightly ridiculous ones) to counterbalance the amount of blind faith and irrational responses used to justify that we did go.

       The unmanned Russian missions. Also, if NASA was willing to lie about the Apollo missions, it would stand to logic that they would be willing to lie about a prior unmanned mission to the moon to leave reflectors. Or, for example, the Apollo footage was faked and was broadcast while an

       If you want useful timing data the limiting factor for doing it is the telescope size. The lasers and detector/filtering systems are within the range of an awful lot of groups. There are about 30 telescopes around that are big enough to pull it off.

       In terms of separation from NASA BTA-6 and possibly LAMOST would be the most obvious.

       Telescopio Nazionale Galileo and Calar Alto Observatory are other options.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were prepared to throw more observing time at the problem the Nordic Optical Telescope or the Thai National Telescope become potential options.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't want timing data then its just about doable with a 1 meter telescope. Steerable 1 meter telescopes aren't that uncommon.

       We've been through this, yet you still cling to the same arguments, then vanish once you're tired of repeating the same, easily contradicted points:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) the Luna missions collected
       <strong>
        1/1000th
       </strong>
       the mass of Lunar rocks as the Apollo missions.  Unmanned craft would not have been able to retrieve rocks as large as Big Muley, where did Big Muley come from if not from the Apollo missions?  Note, it doesn't have a fusion crust.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) The Apollo missions collected 2,415 samples.  Of these, 270 were gifted to other nations.  Of those 270, only
       <strong>
        180
       </strong>
       are missing or unaccounted for.  How does this 0.7% of unaccounted for material prove anything?
      </p>
      <p>
       3)
       <strong>
        One rock
       </strong>
       out of thousands has been proven to be fake, which could have several reasonable explanations compared to
       <strong>
        all
       </strong>
       of them being fake.  Why is 1/2,415 enough for you to believe something is a conclusive piece of evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       You have yet to sufficiently answer any of these questions, yet continue spouting the same tired lines.

      <p>
       Also your maths sucks. 180 missing moonrocks is 7% of the total claimed to have been collected by NASA (not 0.07%), but even that stat is irrelevant. The key issue is that according to your figures, fully 2/3 of the moonrocks gifted by NASA to foreign nations have mysteriously disappeared. If that doesn't ring alarm bells, there's no hope for you.

       I'm providing you with evidence of what actually happened and some random person on the internet says that "oh you could just remove the fusion crust" and you believe them?  Over the mountains of overwhelming evidence to the contrary?  Do you realize how ridiculous this is?

        Finally, meteorites are very different in appearance from the Apollo lunar samples. Samples brought back from the moon have very small pits on the surface. These so-called "zap pits" are caused by micrometeoroid impacts and are generally only visible under a microscope. But they are completely absent from recovered lunar meteorites because the outer layers have been burned away by passage through the earth's atmosphere.

       Are you religious, by any chance? Because you are citing NASA data in order to "prove" NASA claims with the same circular logic that evangelical christians quote the Bible to "prove" the existence of God.

       Everything you think you know about "Big Muley" is courtesy of NASA. It was "discovered" by them, analysed by them and is behind lock and key at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center where nobody else can verify their claims about its provenance or geological constitution.

       So once again, you have zero evidence and all you can say is that we need to trust you in saying NASA is lying?
       <strong>
        Without any evidence whatsoever???
       </strong>

      </p>
      <p>
       It seems as though you're just being intentionally ignorant at this point, going through your post history reads like the ramblings of a deranged sociopath.  No matter what NASA does, you don't believe it, even when
       <strong>
        unequivocally
       </strong>
       proven otherwise!
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition, now that you have no additional relevant counterpoints, you've backed into your "well NASA saying so doesn't make it so" even in regards to Big Muley.  Slowly moving away from your "well the fusion crust could've been chipped away" to "it might not even be a moon rock at all!"  At least you've managed to eliminate one idiotic bullet point from your list of mindless critiques.
      </p>
      <p>
       It isn't NASA's job to eliminate your ignorance, it's something you should be capable of doing with some critical thought.  You have
       <strong>
        zero
       </strong>
       evidence and are just appealing to your lack of belief in NASA.  Every piece of
       <em>
        evidence
       </em>
       you have provided is easily dismissed or even completely incorrect.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have nothing, this is pointless.  You'll believe what you want in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary.  This is the very definition of being willfully ignorant, you live in a bubble, a horrifying, strange bubble of absolute idiocy.

       Dude, what is this overwhelming evidence to the contrary you speak of.  I don't see it . This big muley you talk about is said to be from the moon because it is a type of rock that has experience shock wave like from a nearby asteroid hit.  Asteroids hit earth.  look at the arizona crater.  The rock could have been from an earth asteroid event.  There is no proof of lunar origin. Interesting, you glom on to the lack of fusion crust as if it a prerequisite of  earthbound lunar like material.  Every single piece of nasa "evidence" is questionable and some is downright anomalous.

       Are you seriously asking me to go through your history because you don't have the ability, courage or mental fortitude to admit that you're simply a NASA naysayer?  Everything you post about NASA lacks any credible evidence whatsoever, yet you believe it, because you are ignorant.  If you want me to find a specific example of you being absolutely wrong in a proven instance I'm sure I could, but I honestly don't feel like doing it at the moment.  The fact that you seem to think that you don't simply disagree with NASA as a reflex is laughable.  According to you, they have effectively done nothing of substance in addition to intentionally misleading people.  An organization of nearly 20,000 people out to trick you, it must be terrifying existence.

       Of course not, but going through your posts more, it seems even the most minute things that NASA does are inexplicably questioned by you.  It really seems as though you truly doubt nearly every piece of information that NASA provides.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what do I know, maybe you're a professional astronomer, or work in an observatory or with a telescope which has data that NASA doesn't have access to.  There's no other reasonable or logical explanation for your continuous doubts regarding NASA's achievements, unless you somehow know more than them.  It's just odd that you have all of this information which proves your serious doubts regarding NASA yet seem so unwilling to provide it here.
      </p>

       So please, I beg you, if you have
       <strong>
        any single piece of actual evidence for any of what you are saying

       provide it now or else this is pointless as it's a person with evidence on one side facing a conjecture artist on the other.

       1) Big Muley is not really that big. I don't think it proves that a manned craft was needed. Wouldn't an unmanned craft actually have
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       room? Also, it could have been collected from Antarctica or the numerous other places that lunar rocks fall. The fusion crust I will address at the end.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Honestly, 180 missing out of 270 is sketchy as fuck. Its not like you give someone a moon rock and they just put it in a drawer. But yes, I can concede that maybe people stole them because stealing a moon rock would be high priority. So I am on the fence about this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Honestly, if one rock was proven fake, it kind of opens a can of worms. Like if one photo were proven to be fake, it immediately brings the rest into question. Because the 180 rocks that are now missing cannot exactly be tested anymore. For all we know, half of them or more were faked. Just saying, we have no answer to that question, we can only make assumptions from both ends of the argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Fusion crust. Unfortunately, the absence of "fusion crust" or anything that defines a moon rock as being " directly from the moon" is just one more thing that we have to take NASA's word for. Since we have no other moon rocks "directly from the moon" except for the ones brought back by NASA and the Russians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, as far as we know, they could use a myriad of scientific processes to achieve an effect that they can then sell as "see, these rocks are different".

       Amazing, please point me to a single example, with proof, where this was done in a manner that went completely undetected by the top geologists and meteorite scientists on the planet.

       Otherwise it's simply blind conjecture.

       In fact the missing number is probably far lower. At the present time fewer than 20 are known to be missing.

       In fact that's precisely what a lot of governments will do. These things aren't actually that impressive to look at. An acrylic ball with a few chips of rock in them. Some will have gone on public display but a lot will have gone to archives (which in many cases are literary a draw or a shelf in a warehouse). Even those that did go on display didn't all stay on display. Cataloguing in museums isn't always what it should be.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that they were given as gifts via diplomatic channels rather than strait to relivant museums also complicates matters. For example even the fairly well organised UK only the goodwill moon rock is in the natural history museum. The Apollo 11 moon rock is in 10 Downing street.

       No it doesn't. It makes assumptions about both the status of the cameras, the difference between shot distances and focal lengths, the distance between objects and the movement between shots.

       1 &amp; 2 you seem to think that NASA has a monopoly on space travel/knowledge, almost as if the Russians or anyone else have never ventured beyond Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       NASA doesn't have a monopoly, NASA can't even reach the ISS anymore.
      </p>

       3 - It does if you look at the list of missions to the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look at what missions did what, and which were manned. If the reflectors were placed there by unmanned missions - Which NASA mission did it?

       So once again, you have zero evidence and all you can say is that we need to trust you in saying NASA is lying?
       <strong>
        Without any evidence whatsoever???
       </strong>
       *
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems as though you're just being intentionally ignorant at this point, going through your post history reads like the ramblings of a deranged sociopath.  No matter what NASA does, you don't believe it, even when
       <strong>
        unequivocally
       </strong>
       proven otherwise!
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition, now that you have no additional relevant counterpoints, you've backed into your "well NASA saying so doesn't make it so" even in regards to Big Muley.  Slowly moving away from your "well the fusion crust could've been chipped away" to "it might not even be a moon rock at all!"  At least you've managed to eliminate one idiotic bullet point from your list of mindless critiques.
      </p>
      <p>
       It isn't NASA's job to eliminate your ignorance, it's something you should be capable of doing with some critical thought.  You have
       <strong>
        zero
       </strong>
       evidence and are just appealing to your lack of belief in NASA.  Every piece of
       <em>
        evidence
       </em>
       you have provided is easily dismissed or even completely incorrect.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have nothing, this is pointless.  You'll believe what you want in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary.  This is the very definition of being willfully ignorant, you live in a bubble, a horrifying, strange bubble of absolute idiocy.

       If you want useful timing data the limiting factor for doing it is the telescope size. The lasers and detector/filtering systems are within the range of an awful lot of groups. There are about 30 telescopes around that are big enough to pull it off.
      </p>
      <p>
       In terms of separation from NASA BTA-6 and possibly LAMOST would be the most obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Telescopio Nazionale Galileo and Calar Alto Observatory are other options.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were prepared to throw more observing time at the problem the Nordic Optical Telescope or the Thai National Telescope become potential options.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't want timing data then its just about doable with a 1 meter telescope. Steerable 1 meter telescopes aren't that uncommon.
