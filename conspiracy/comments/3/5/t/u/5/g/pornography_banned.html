<p>I am not a fan of porn. But censorship starts with porn. </p>

<p>BTW Manga (Japan) <strong>comics</strong> of porn are considered child porn in many countries and very illegal. </p>

You don&#39;t need to filter and censor the whole Internet for your own <em>personal</em> tastes... You can <em>personally</em> make the net show what you want it to... then again that would take a good solid 10 minutes and involve personal responsibility. Ergo, the whole world should conform to your own view of what is proper... </p>

<p>Nah, its much better to get into long drawn out arguments as to why one persons porn is actually erotica and there must be a normality that is enforced...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a delusion that seeing sex degrades humanity. Porn does not destroy the image of men or women, well, most porn at least. There is some questionable stuff out there with abuse baked in. It&#39;s one&#39;s judgement against being naked in film or art while having sexual pleasure just for fun is what makes it seem wrong. I watch plenty of porn. People still have plenty of value to me. It makes them seem even more awesome to me. Misogynistic machismo culture is a separate issue. </p>

<p>I blame religion for this crazy shame that we have about our own nature, because they propagate it. Most people that speak out against porn are thusly religious. There is no need for demonizing this glorious part of our nature. </p>

<p>We are hypersexual beings. There are two other species that I know of that share this trait, bonobos and dolphins. Almost all animals don&#39;t have sex like these two other species and ourselves do. Having sex distracts attention from the environment, making one vulnerable to predation. So most animals only have sex to make babies at the optimal time for survival, in season as it is said.</p>

<p>It is theorized that these two species have sex for bonding purposes, increasing group survival in some way. Otherwise they should have evolved away from taking repeated risks of predation. Bonobos, dolphins and human beings are all relatively intelligent social mammals that survive in groups. Sex does make people feel closer and more willing to reciprocate when it is asked of them.</p>

<p>All three species have a variety of sex. They all have gay sex too. Gay sex doesn&#39;t make babies, obviously, but it does still makes bonding. It still serves the social function. Perhaps that&#39;s why they do it, not because Satan made them do it.</p>

<p>There are people that study these things and I recommend you broaden your horizon on the issue, for your own sake. There is no need to fear one of the greatest gifts from God we have ever received, the ability to bring each other to ecstasy just for the price of being appealing to each other. Go to YouTube and type in Christopher Ryan. He studies bonobos and frequently points out that we are equally related to bonobos as we are to the comparatively violent chimpanzees, who also still have some curious sexual behaviors. He points out many physiological traits that back up his assertion of our hypersexual nature. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t be afraid of yourself. Shame is the belief, the fear that something one is or one has done will cause others to judge oneself and exclude oneself. Sex is shameful, because people exclude people for being or acting certain ways, some shame has merit, but much of it is useless bullshit. Guilt is the belief, the fear that something one is or has done is inherently wrong, or rather, that God himself will judge one for it. Don&#39;t fall for these lies that reduce joy to misery. Enjoy life, for it will end one day. Don&#39;t fear and worship those that control others by fear.</p>

<p>A gift that should be used wisely. You misunderstand that I fear it. I fear that I will misuse it. I do not see that sex degrades humanity, I see that using it wrongly does. And that happens. <em>OFTEN,</em> and in horrifying ways. Rape culture, for instance.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I am not miserable.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I do not need porn or sex to enjoy life.</p>

<p>I do not doubt your values in men and women as not objects. That does not mean others share your values and perceptions, and that is the danger.</p>

<p>If my beliefs and God is to be brought into the matter, whom I do believe in, I do believe He created sex in a way that we could enjoy it. But I&#39;ll do it His way, with patience and humility. It is not a way of misery. It is treating sex as other than material pleasure, as something more spiritually glorious, a union.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&#39;t fear and worship those that control others by fear.</p>

<p>I do not. I worship a King that won me freedom and life for death. If I feared and worshiped that as you say, I&#39;d be worshiping the devil. God is not a God of fear or control, do not mistake the light for the dark.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;m glad you&#39;re happy with your life. One doesn&#39;t need sex to love life, but it helps. </p>

<p>Be aware that others may be offended if you shame the things they like to do like pleasure sex and porn. Please don&#39;t be troubled by the apparently poor choices of others. We all want to help, but first we should do no harm.</p>

<hr/>

<p>God is an interesting topic I must say. I went from Roman Catholic to atheist to agnostic. I still have a hard time accepting the darkness he found useful to put into the world. Although, there are a lot of good reasons why it is there, mainly self-discipline. I find a lot of darkness around the topic of God. </p>

<p>I think God allows con artists to fool us with his name to get us to learn from our mistakes, to learn that we must stand on our own two intellectual, moral and spiritual feet. That way we become strong, confident, independent minded defenders of what we believe is right, not what some con artists want us to do. ISIL is a modern extreme example of why this is important. God is very important to a mind and if one believes he wants something, one will try to do it.</p>

<p>I have come to believe that whenever anyone speaks for God, they are almost always trying to serve themselves. They usually know that they don&#39;t know God said what they are saying. They read it, heard it, or thought it up themselves. They should be more honest about their sources. </p>

<p>God is subtle and only responds overtly in one&#39;s life if one asks it with genuine integrity and personal responsibility. He will never prove his existence otherwise and never in a way that can be proven to others, for reasons beyond the scope of my post and some beyond my understanding I presume. </p>

<p>Whenever human beings put their ideas in the mouth of God in written or spoken word, one can consider it, but one should never believe it is the literal word of God. That&#39;s what gets us spiritual seekers into trouble, dogmatic belief. Be open minded, be true with oneself (don&#39;t lie to oneself, he knows anyway), be integrity in all ways, especially in dealing with others, and I truly believe God will be quite satisfied with you. That doesn&#39;t mean he won&#39;t challenge you. God bless you. </p>

<p>That I can especially agree with. I do not mean to shame anyone, I do not care what people do with their time. I just have a great distaste for the porn industry itself.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Oof... yeah, I can actually agree with this too. Very often I&#39;m upset at myself for the harsh or proud way I&#39;ve acted towards others. It is not the way God calls me to treat people and I hate when I find myself doing it. It&#39;s hard though, with how frustrating people can be. Thank you for not being as such.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Corinthians 4:20 comes to mind with this. &quot;For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.&quot; It&#39;s no good to have an understanding of the gospel that justifies sin through grace (which I understand <em>many</em> Christians these days have such an interpretation. It&#39;s extremely saddening). Open mindedness is definitely something I strive for, reasonably at least.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry if anything I&#39;ve said seemed overly aggressive or hostile. I&#39;ve gotten far too comfortable in the habit of becoming upset with people online...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the issue is that you need to define porn.  It&#39;s like the saying &quot;I know it when I see it.&quot;  All it will take is for peope to start calling nude art porn and then it&#39;s a slippery slope from there.  Why let religious nuts and prudes decide what grown men and women can do and see?  You have to stand up for the worst of speech and expression.  When figures of authority get to criminalize what is &quot;offensive&quot; (which is a 100% subjective experience) you open the door for any dissenting opinion to be deemed illegal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is the value of nude art? Art is harder to identify than porn is. Pornography isn&#39;t an attempt at beauty or perfection, it&#39;s a graphic representation of a sexual act. There is no cultural value in, particularly extensive, graphic representations of the sexual act. Except for profit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The value of nude art is the beauty of it to people who find it beautiful.  I don&#39;t like country music but I know a lot of people who do and just because I see no value in it doesn&#39;t mean that it should be thrown out as useless.  And, unfortunately, your definition of porn is not universal.  In the past any nudity has been deemed pornographic.  This is why nude paintings and statues were covered with cloth and the paintings were painted over with clothing.  Not everyone has the same definition of what is art and what is pornography.  You simply don&#39;t let people legislate what is &quot;offensive.&quot;  If you don&#39;t like something, you just don&#39;t partake in it.  It&#39;s as simple as that.  </p>

<p>Censoring to fit your needs simply shows you are not in this for others, just yourself.</p>

<p>What &#39;this&#39; are you referring to? Cause you&#39;re confusing me. And yeah I&#39;d be in whatever for myself, no one&#39;s in anything for me right now, and I&#39;m not exactly in any kind of position to be in it for others in taking any action. I just sit here reading and waiting for the inevitable.</p>
