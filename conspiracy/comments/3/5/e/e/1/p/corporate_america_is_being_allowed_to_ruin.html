        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2015/05/no-wrongdoing-here-just-6300-corporate-fines-and-settlements.html">The USG allows the bankers to walk away from prosecution</a>. If a citizen transfers money illegally or commits mortgage fraud--we&#39;d be locked up, but the banks are allowed to make out of court settlements with no prosecution on the record. But We the People must follow the ever-increasing library of laws and regulations now imposed on us.</p>

<p>The USG allows the DoD to write their own checks with <a href="http://www.reuters.com/investigates/pentagon/#article/part2">no audit necessary</a>--while the citizens and small businesses of the country follow the law and submit their taxes or face serious penalties. Every taxpayer, business, and government agency in America is supposed to be able to pass a financial audit by the feds, every year. It’s the law, so we do our duty. There’s one exception: the Pentagon--which is even so bold as to announce it has misplaced <a href="http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/19/85-Trillion-Unaccounted-Should-Congress-Increase-Defense-Budget">TRILLIONS</a> of dollars.</p>

<p>The USG allows the intelligence agencies to trample our rights and the U.S. Constitution--no serious investigation of the NSA has taken place. We do not know the true actions of the CIA-FBI-DoD because of the extreme secrecy. How can we possibly know if the agencies are acting in our interest--and within the law--if we do not even know what they have done?</p>

<p>The USG allows our law enforcement to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/08/13/wonkbook-11-facts-about-americas-prison-population">jail millions</a>. They would rather pay for our citizens to be jailed than pay for our children to receive the best education or provide training for those who need it.</p>

<p>The USG attacks other countries around the globe--JSOC has boots on the ground in about <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/14/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-us-has-military-personnel-130-nation/">100 countries right now</a>. Will we end up in another &quot;war&quot;? Will it be in Iraq? Syria? Yemen? Ukraine? Iran? Korea? China? Russia? Will it be because they attacked our soil or because we are protecting the business interests of the .01%?</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-a6jzU0YgQ">USG also wages economic warfare against other countries</a> which leads to instability and is not a peaceful long-term solution. 
We do not need to <a href="http://williamblum.org/essays/read/overthrowing-other-peoples-governments-the-master-list">overthrow other governments</a>--they have a right to be their own sovereign nation and to live peacefully. Other nations have a right to make their own laws and choose their own leaders.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2013/05/authorization-for-use-of-military-force-a-blank-check-for-war-without-end/">USG would rather invade other countries and build military bases</a> /infrastructure over there than upgrade our own infrastructure. I wish most of our soldiers were not in the military--instead they could be building roads, high-speed rail lines, and green energy infrastructure in the U.S. (and around the globe...HELPING people).</p>

<p>The USG allows corporations to write our laws: agriculture, banks, energy, healthcare, media/cable conglomerates, transportation, tax laws...</p>

<p>FINALLY: The USG allowed our country to be attacked on 9/11 with no open investigation. In fact, our leaders openly resisted the investigations of both the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePOIhhd9Jr0">Joint Intelligence Committee</a> and the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/12/911thebigcoverup">9/11 Commission</a>. Evidence was destroyed, the investigations were <a href="http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/">obstructed</a> and the evidence hidden from We the People (and the world). GW Bush couldn&#39;t even testify under oath and in public before the 9/11 Commission--he spoke with the press for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bnuvtRo8b0">5 minutes</a> after his &quot;conversation&quot; with them.</p>

<p>I do love America--but the USG is FAILING. Our leaders should be concentrating on helping us--the tax payers--instead of bombing other countries around the globe and leading us into another War. Who is running things--the Pentagon? the CIA? the defense companies? the bankers?</p>

<p>I seriously FEAR that WAR, INC will take things too far--and the Corporate Perpetual War may very well end up in <a href="http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2015/04/15/will-washington-kill-us-paul-craig-roberts/">WWIII</a>.</p>

<p>It is not the USG that is directly responsible, it is merely a vehicle (like any government) for the interests it has been designed to serve; the western elite. </p>

<p>Since the end of WW2, US foreign policy has been dominated by neoconservatives within the State Dept/CIA, the MIC and other various industries with foreign holdings. In turn the corporate arm of this cabal backs politicians who support their agenda. Their only goal is to consolidate power and to destroy anything which threatens their ability to make money. Nearly every government (the vast majority socialist or left leaning, and with democratically elected leaders) the US has destabilized or overthrown, was a threat in some way to US corporate interests operating within the target country. </p>

<p>Neoconservatism is an unsustainable ideology, it depends upon perpetual theft and oppression. A state of insecurity, fear and paranoia, and the exploitation of Americans and foreign nations in order to be viable, in that endeavor it will not succeed. It is an irrational death cult that is the antithesis of freedom, justice and egalitarianism. It only wears the guise of those virtues in order to justify it&#39;s atrocities. </p>

<p>Just look at the history of US foreign policy, US corporate interests in targeted countries, the track record of the CIA and who all of that benefits and you will have the answers you need.</p>

The irony is that extreme, unchecked, unregulated capitalism creates wealth inequality to extremes, which ultimately can&#39;t support the system, because the public eventually has no buying power.

    <div class="md"><p>Bernie Sanders, who is the longest-standing independent federal legislator in our country&#39;s history, has been fighting the power elite for literally decades and he needs our support. I have voted in three presidential elections but about a month ago I made my first-ever political contribution, and I gave it to somebody who hasn&#39;t even decided on whether he&#39;s going to run or not. That&#39;s how strongly I feel about Bernie Sanders.
Here&#39;s a side-by-side comparison of his financial backing and that of Hillary Clinton:
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/GCOVi0J.png">http://i.imgur.com/GCOVi0J.png</a></p>

<p>Before anyone interjects that Hillary&#39;s financial backing doesn&#39;t say anything about her or her agenda, please read this pdf.</p>

<p>&quot;God help us on the day the TPP is put into effect.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&#39;s Bernie talking about the TPP. It&#39;s one of the best speeches I&#39;ve seen a senator make and it needs way more than the 45,000 views it&#39;s had so far:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beOJtXLSQyc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beOJtXLSQyc</a></p>

<p>If you or anyone else out there has any interest in a Bernie Sanders presidency, please think about donating if you haven&#39;t already. He&#39;s going to need a ton of small contributions to compete with Hillary or whoever the Republicans trot out there and, from what I gather, whether or not he runs will depend on whether he thinks victory is even possible. Let&#39;s give him a reason to think it&#39;s possible.

    <div class="md"><p>The inevitable collapse of peak civilization can not be avoided at this point in history. </p>

<p>There is no &quot;one&quot; group or interest that &quot;controls&quot; this chaotic world we call Earth.</p>

<p>There are many groups vying for increasing power and wealth against other groups, and this is done completely out in the open. The overarching problem is that we place profit ahead of humanity. This is because of our debt based currency, businesses and individuals must take out debt to compete in this game, and therefore must generate a profit to pay off the interest. Cost of living always increases because of inflation, profits must increase to catch up. Profits are increased by cutting corners, lowering pay, and reducing benefits. But if the profits don&#39;t increase, everyone gets laid off. Its a beautifully vicious cycle.</p>

<p>So in order to keep afloat we work for companies that dehumanize us, we buy products from corporations that exploit the 3rd world, we invest in government bonds, and we invest our money into whatever &quot;opportunity&quot; appears the most profitable, regardless of <em>how</em> those investments generate profit. How do they produce profit? Much of the time its through war &quot;defense&quot; spending. Or in some cases the government will literally create money to pump into the stock market to keep it from crashing (QE).</p>

<p>So there is a conspiracy to get us into a trap(debt based currency), but it is our own greed and unconsciousness that perpetuates that trap.</p>

<p>Just get your popcorn ready and you&#39;ll be in for the greatest spectacle the world has seen in 4billion years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The corruption is very blatant nowadays. Even mainstream subreddits are receiving interesting comments like this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/35dy8f/colo_mom_gets_38_years_for_using_baseball_bat_to/cr3kw2a">one</a>.</p>

<p>Impossible to prevent WWIII, if the powers want war they will have it. Best to educate and make people aware of how flawed the system is from the start, how the system is manipulated by corporations or the wealthy to get scot free from jail or taxes. </p>

<p>This is a good post, hopefully more will come like this. Let more people be aware, hopefully.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, in all my travels, most people that I&#39;ve spoken with don&#39;t hate/blame the People, but rather they can&#39;t comprehend why we haven&#39;t overthrown our Government yet.  When I&#39;ve traveled to both Europe &amp; Asia for business, over dinner &amp; several whiskies, the consensus is that they fear our military might be used for more  &quot;interventions&quot; for some bogus incident, which will in turn cause WWIII.  Again, my overseas friends are cognizant that it&#39;s not us (the People) that are to blame for all these &quot;interventions&quot;, wars, inequality, and conflicts that we see going on today, but rather they see our Government who are controlled by &quot;special interest groups&quot; the one to be held accountable.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To put this all as simply as possible.</p>

<p>The system is not broken, but working exactly as it was designed.</p>

<p>The thing that freaks me out the most is not this fact, but the common person who is pushing for &quot;the end of days&quot;. </p>

<p>I am very spiritual, and enjoy talking religion with people. But the ache for everything ending coming from christian groups is chilling.</p>

<p>Look forward to self fullfilled prophecies.</p>
