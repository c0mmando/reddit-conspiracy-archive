        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A copy of the book &quot;The Lighthouses of the World&quot; and a calculator are enough to prove that the Earth is not a globe, but an extended flat plane. The distance from which various lighthouse lights around the world are visible at sea far exceeds what could be found on a globe Earth 25,000 miles in circumference. For example, the Dunkerque Light in southern France at an altitude of 194 feet is visible from 28 miles away. Spherical trigonometry dictates that if the Earth was a globe with the given curvature of 8 inches per mile squared, this light should be hidden 190 feet below the horizon!</p>

<p>&quot;The distance at which lights can be seen at sea entirely disposes of the idea that we are living on a huge ball.&quot; -Thomas Winship</p>

<p>NASA and modern astronomers claim we are living on an oblate spheroid 25,000 statute miles in equatorial circumference with a curvature of 7.395 inches to the mile, varying inversely as the square of the distance, meaning in 3 miles there is a declination of nearly 6 feet, in 30 miles 600 feet, in 300 miles 60,000 feet and so on. Therefore, if we wish to prove or disprove the validity of their convexity claim, it is a fairly simple, straight forward matter of measurements and calculations.</p>

<p>Learn to read before you call it nonsense, and you are obviously the one who can&#39;t grasp the math.  It&#39;s 8 inches x miles SQUARED.  That means at 28 miles it would be 28x28 = 784 x 8 = 6272 inches or 523 feet 
523ft -194ft (elevation) 329 ft   then I think that they factored in the &quot;candlelight power&quot; of the light and it would still be 190ft below the horizon.</p>

<p>On a ball earth at an elevation of 325 ft, you can only see the horizon at 24 miles. </p>

Observer Height 164 feet, this would put the lighthouse 700 feet below the horizon.</p>

When I zoomed in with a camera I could see all the way to the bottom.  after factoring in the slight elevation I was on, the tower should have been at least 17 - 20ft lower yet I could see the whole thing to the bottom.

</blockquote>

<p>This must be very embarassing for you as you did not even fully read the math blog you posted. The author specifically points out and corrects the exact mistake you just made.</p>

<p>&quot;The contractor had stated that the curvature of the Earth causes level to deviate from horizontal by an 1/8th of an inch (125 thousandths of inch) for 100 feet of horizontal distance. The actual deviation is ~2.9 thousandths of an inch for 100 feet of horizontal distance, which is almost 45 times less than the contractor claimed. So it is meaningful to buy a laser level that is accurate to 1/16th of an inch over 100 feet, i.e. the laser level error is not swamped by the curvature of the Earth.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why did the contractor make the claim that the Earth&#39;s curvature is 1/8th inch over 100 feet? He made a simple mistake. He did not understand that the deviation from horizontal for short distances is given by a square-law relationship, shown in Equation 2. In Equation 2, I include an approximation that is only valid when R is much greater than x, which is true in typical construction problems.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If we use Equation 1 or Equation 2 to calculate the deviation from horizontal at 1 mile, we get 8 inches. This value is quoted in a number of references on surveying (e.g. here is one, here is another). <strong>What the contractor did was erroneously assume that the deviation varied linearly with distance, which would mean that a deviation of 8 inches at 1 mile is equivalent to an 1/8th of inch at 100 feet.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Using 3963 miles as the radius of the Earth (R), we&#39;ll use the 3rd equation I linked in the OP and skip the derivation. For our &quot;x&quot; value we use 42 miles that the light is visible from.</p>

<p>δ = sqrt( R<sup>2</sup> + x<sup>2</sup> ) - R = sqrt( (3963 mi)<sup>2</sup> + (42 mi)<sup>2</sup> ) - 3963 mi = 0.22255241867536484293690238287099 mi</p>

<p>0.22255241867536484293690238287099 mi = 1175.0768ft</p>

<p>The Lighthouse is 180 feet high.</p>

<p>1175.0768ft - 180 ft = 995.0768 ft.</p>

<p>The Lighthouse should be occluded by 995 feet of the curvature of the Earth from a distance of 42 miles; instead it is plainly visible, as if the Earth were just a flat extended plane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The third equation you posted is not the one you use to calculate the curve of the earth. </p>

<p>You use the Pythagorean theorem. If you are at a point P on the earth&#39;s surface and move tangent to the surface a distance of 1 mile then you can form a right angled triangel as in the diagram. Using the theorem of Pythagoras a2 = 39632 + 12 = 15705370 and thus a = 3963.000126 miles. Thus your position is 3963.000126 - 3963 = 0.000126 miles above the surface of the earth. 0.000126 miles = 12<em>5280</em>0.000126 = 7.98 inches. Hence the earth&#39;s surface curves at approximately 8 inches per mile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The third equation is a simplified version of the derivation from the Pythagorean theorem that is shown in images #1 and #2.</p>

<p>You just proved the calculations of 8 inches for a one mile tangent.</p>

<p>Make that tangent 10 miles and repeat your calculations. Do you get 80 inches of curvature? <del>Please show your steps.</del> Here, I did it for you because I doubt you will respond after this:</p>

<p>Using 3963 miles as the radius of the Earth (R), we&#39;ll use the 3rd equation again. For our &quot;x&quot; value we use a 10 mile tangent.</p>

<p>δ = sqrt( R<sup>2</sup> + x<sup>2</sup> ) - R = sqrt( (3963 mi)<sup>2</sup> + (10 mi)<sup>2</sup> ) - 3963 mi = 0.01261668443341835825623016821002 mi</p>

<p>0.01261668443341835825623016821002 mi = 66.616094ft</p>

<p>If it were a linear constant drop of 8 inches per mile, then at 10 miles it would be 80 inches and yet when we calculate it we get a lot more than that.</p>

<p>How thick is this <em>earth</em>? A flat surface has to have more than one edge. So, go take a walk, away from the Antarctic and when you get to the other edge check back with us here.</p>

<p>Go look at a big flat rock. It has edges, thickness, a top side and an underside. Draw your circle on that rock. Now use two little fingers and walk that rock... Did you get to the edge? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if the math is right, which it isn&#39;t, why would you assume the earth is flat instead of questioning your understanding of the behavior of light? I&#39;m not sure if you are stupid, or just ignorant. Einstein&#39;s theory of relativity states that light curves under the influence of a gravitational field. Any light emitted horizontally from the lighthouse would curve slightly downward, thus reaching ships that would otherwise be unable to observe it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is what Tesla says about Relativity and the religion that you apparently subscribe to.</p>

<p>&quot;Einstein&#39;s relativity work is a magnificent mathematical garb which fascinates, dazzles and makes people blind to the underlying errors. The theory is like a beggar clothed in purple whom ignorant people take for a king... its exponents are brilliant men but they are metaphysicists rather than scientists.&quot;
        New York Times (11 July 1935), p. 23, c.8</p>

<p>“I hold that space cannot be curved, for the simple reason that it can have no properties. It might as well be said that God has properties. He has not, but only attributes and these are of our own making. Of properties we can only speak when dealing with matter filling the space. To say that in the presence of large bodies space becomes curved is equivalent to stating that something can act upon nothing. I, for one, refuse to subscribe to such a view.”</p>
