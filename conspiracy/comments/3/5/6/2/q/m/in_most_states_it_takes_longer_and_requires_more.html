    <div class="md"><p>There is a HUGE difference... Cops get 24/7 training academy for 4 months before being put under the direct mentorship of a PTO for 6 months to a year on the job.  They are being PAID through the whole process, as they have to be hired into the job first.</p>

<p>Barbers get scammed into a 1500 hour indentured servitude to earn their licenses...  they get the basic training (that lasts at most a few days) and then they get to pay the Barber College to work for the rest of their hours to earn their license.  It&#39;s an educational format that hearkens back to apprenticeships in the medieval era.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the fact that there is a huge difference is exactly the problem.  4 months is not enough time, regardless of if its 24/7 or not, to impart the conscious mindset needed from police today (and i use &quot;needed&quot; in the sense of their traditional public duty, not these mindless drones who cant think for themselves and simply follow orders).   If i wanted to teach you football, mathematics, science, philosophy, ANY discipline really, training you 24/7 would not be the best way to do it!  learning takes TIME.  there are no shortcuts.    Cramming the time it takes to get a college degree into the shortest possible 24/7 training block would be a HORRENDOUS way to impart knowledge to someone.  What it IS good at however is conditioning someone to NEVER question/ think for themselves, and to simply follow orders, which is the kind of police being bred today.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re absolutely right... there IS a huge difference.  That&#39;s exactly what the problem is, and why it needs to be reformed.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Along your line of thought, many departments are looking for at least Associate Degrees on the resumes of applicants these days.</p>

<p>As for the training, the 4 months in the Academy are to train the State/Local laws, train the physical aspects of the job, train the technical aspects of the job, ensure the fitness of the troops and to train in the UoF standards for their State/city.  The &quot;conscious mindset&quot; you mention is not something you learn in a school (other than the rote aspects), but actually out doing the job under close supervision.  That is why there is the requirement for the time under a PTO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just really hope that more stringent regulations on police training come from these recent developments.  because Thats really what the root of the problem is, far too many cops are either stupid (cant think quick on their feet) or have deep emotional issues.   These people could safely be weeded out if police training/ selection process was similar to other training/job requirements.  </p>

<p>the burden of having the authority to use a gun to enforce public situations should have much higher cognitive requirements. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not even close to the same. As the government sees it, people will be getting paid to cut hair and well, it&#39;s not the barber&#39;s money. It&#39;s the government&#39;s. They just decide how much the barber gets to keep. Having a gun doesn&#39;t mean necessarily mean more income unless you&#39;re a cop or a criminal. It&#39;s all about tax cattle (us) and milking us (taxes, licensing, and fees).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didnt mean this to be a comparison of their economic earning potentials,  I mean it as a comparison of the time needed for training vs &#39;supposed&#39; skill involved.   I say &#39;supposed&#39; because in an ideal society, cops would be intelligent, emotionally stable individuals.  However, this is not the case currently, and that is the problem im trying to highlight.   These recent police misconduct cases all pretty much stem from the fact that almost anyone can become a cop, in a relatively short amount of time, and not much is required from them in terms of cognitive/psychological integrity.  if only ONE thing changes as a result of the Baltimore riots, I would much rather see more stringent laws put in place regarding the  requirements for who can be a cop (emotional stable, relitevly smart, can judge situations on their feet and not resort to using deadly force &#39;without thinking&#39;, ect ect), than i would like to see 5-6 cops get thrown in jail for murder.   Changing the laws would effect society in a positive way going forward, throwing a couple cops in jail would be putting a bandaid over a leak at the bottom of a boat...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most police involved shootings, the officer has 2-7 years on. It&#39;s just a stat we were given, I don&#39;t have a source other than &quot;academy instructor&quot;. With that said, the officer has years of experience., whereas the Barber has 1 or 2 max.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>2-7 years on a job that had SHIT as far as requirements for acceptance go.  how is a shitty cop with 7 years under his belt supposed to explain anything??

    <div class="md"><p>Easy there paahtna!  No need for all that, its a ridiculously simple fix.  Just increase the entrance requirements for police officers, problem solved.   There are many employment opportunities for the emotionally unstable/cognitively impaired, policing shouldn&#39;t be one of them, that&#39;s all in sayin.  Its not that outrageous...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I understand about police departments, they train bullying and tough guy routines into the recruits. They tell them citizens are dangerous and a lot of this comes down from the federal level via the department of justice. The issue with the police is they are actually there to protect the wealthy from us (keep us cattle in line).</p>

<p>Most people don&#39;t have the imagination or optimism it would actually take to fix the issue with police brutality/murder. It requires red pill thinking by all and the collapse of <strong>belief in the system.</strong></p>
