        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>NASA has retained copies of the TV broadcasts and offers several clips on its Web site. But those images are of lower quality than the originals stored on the missing magnetic tapes. </p>

<p>Because NASA&#39;s equipment was not compatible with the TV technology of the day, <strong>the original transmissions had to be displayed on a monitor and reshot by a TV camera for broadcast.</strong> </p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/14/AR2006081400998.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/14/AR2006081400998.html</a></p>

<p>...............</p>

<p>45 reels of magnetic tape recorded about 15 minutes of video on each from the original ′down-link′ stations. Unfortunately, nobody knew where the tapes were. Nazfger hunted for them to no avail. One alleged tape turned up in Australia, supposedly a copy an engineer made and kept in his garage for many years. But that tape turned out to have telemetry data from a space mission from 1967. The searchers then learned that in the mid 1970s, NASA was running low on magnetic tape and began erasing old reels and recording new missions on them. Oh-No! Nazfger did learn that there was a duplicate set of the 45 tape reels made based on old memos. <strong>But nobody knows where they, or the originals are, or if they even still exist.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.rightpundits.com/?p=12109">http://www.rightpundits.com/?p=12109</a></p>

<p>...............</p>

<p>The communication network for the Apollo Moon landing was organized by a 26-year old NASA engineer named Dick Nazfger. Signals from the LM were beamed from the Moon to the Earth and picked up by two radio telescopes in Australia turned into giant satellite TV dishes. They then sent the video data to a facility in Sydney, which combined the signals and displayed them on a small TV screen only a few inches wide. This high resolution display had another TV camera pointed at it, which was used to beam the images via Earth orbiting satellites to the United States and NASA′s headquarters via the Goldstone dish in Arizona. From Houston, the video was beamed across the nation, and the world via other satellites.</p>

<p><strong>So, what 600 Million people, including myself, were watching was a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy.</strong></p>

It was at that point I realized almost everything we&#39;ve been told is probably a lie on some level, and that the insidious evil must permeate all societies because if Russia and China aren&#39;t calling the USA on our propagandist bullshit it&#39;s because their horrific lies to their people must be just as bad. </p>

<p>Yes.  Or it&#39;s the same group of liars in control of those countries as well, end result for you and I is probably mostly the same either way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looks into the ISS hoax. I didn&#39;t believe it myself either, but there&#39;s some very suspicious video that suggests the ISS may in fact be fake. There&#39;s just a round satellite floating where the ISS is supposed to be, and all the footage, photos are just composites, and people floating around in zero G planes. It sounds crazy until you watch the videos... China and Russia are in on it.</p>

For the record, although the guy thinks reentry is fake too, I doubt that. I&#39;m pretty sure a space station, reenetry, LER are all possible, but imo for whatever reason a lot of the videos shown are indeed fake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was ready to believe the moon landing was a hoax until I got banned from a hoax website when I said the space shuttle and the ISS was real, which I know because I worked on the ISS and personally saw the space shuttle take off several times while working at the kennedy space center.  when people don&#39;t believe what I saw with my own eyes, in fact call me a liar, then I can&#39;t trust anything else they believe.

    <div class="md"><p>I know, but if you lump them in with the moon landing hoax, then I reject reject everything in your world view.  The only thing that bothers me about the moon landing is how they got off the moon.  You need to switch over to moon-based coordinates in your IMU in order to rendezvous with an orbiting spacecraft, IMO, yet the moon has never been surveyed.  You would need to use a theodolite and a survey marker to initialize the IMU.  They say they used a star finder, but they also said they &quot;didn&#39;t remember&quot; ever being able to see stars.  This causes me a slight amount of cognitive dissonance.</p>

<p>I was literally a rocket scientist at one time and worked on the guidance computer for the Delta rocket, in the guidance and controls group at McDonnell Douglas in Huntington Beach, CA, which is now Boeing.</p>

<p>I understand, but this is an issue.  It&#39;s a logical fallacy.  Everyone you&#39;ve ever met or ever will meet has been wrong about something and probably holds quite a few beliefs that are also false, but that doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t have other knowledge to share or that they&#39;re wrong about everything else.  I&#39;m just saying that I think you&#39;re limiting yourself a bit with this mindset.  Most of history&#39;s greatest geniuses were called crazy more than once.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This corroborates all of the astronauts&#39; pictures from the Apollo missions which show a totally black and empty sky above the Moon&#39;s surface when we&#39;d expect to see the most dazzling array of stars the human eye has ever witnessed.</p>

<p>As far as the Moon landing stuff though?  If you want to discuss it more I&#39;m game but it seems to be a topic that gets people really upset for some reason.  If you&#39;ve never looked at all into some of the claims made by people who doubt NASA&#39;s official story, <a href="http://davesweb.cnchost.com/Apollo1.html">this series</a> is probably a good place to start.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody ever invites me to parties.  Although I going to a bar tomorrow and the girl that tends bar is young, 24, and smoking fucking hot, and I need to recruit her as my associate.  She already told me she would like to be a PI, and I have a big money job for her.  $Millions.  If I don&#39;t get her, there&#39;s a couple other babes I know who are highly intelligent, but barely getting by in life.  But when I was a rocket scientist, I went to parties every week.  When I later got hire at the now defunct Ford Aerospace, Newport Beach, CA, people in my dept. were snorting cocaine right at their desks.</p>

<p>I&#39;m kind of burned out on the moon landing.  There&#39;s some strong arguments either way, so I&#39;ll just reserve judgement.  Recently the govt admitted HAARP was in fact used for weather modification and chemtrails are real, so I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they come out and admit that the moon landings were fake, just to fuck with peoples&#39; minds.  They are extremely good, amazingly good, at mind control, so nothing surprises me.  And I think I have a rare form of synesthesia, where I see patterns and textures, and the pattern I see for the moon landing is slightly bothersome, thus I used the term cognitive dissonance.  The pattern I get for 9-11 is disturbing, which leads me to believe they&#39;re not telling us something.  I used to work in an AI lab, and was deeply involved in pattern recognition.  I also spent many years working on automatic target recognition and tracking, worked with a couple PhDs who had their own company, and became an expert on pattern recognition.  I also worked on a vault project, building a camera for the U2, which was an Air Force project, but it was really the CIA.</p>

<p>What I&#39;ll say is that there&#39;s a lot of actual evidence to support your intuition in both cases if you ever did feel inclined to do some digging.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Check this out... I&#39;m being closely monitored by Homeland Security, or a fusion center.  I opened a new yahoo email account, then put some hopefully secret information in a secure privnote, sent it to that account from a hidden email on Tor, and it was opened by somebody, likely a fusion center, immediately.  Privnote has an option to notify you whenever your privnote msg is read.  I should have sent a test msg instead, dammit.  I was afraid that was going to happen and even sanitized the msg before I sent it.  As soon as I saw my privnote was read, my internet shut off and I had to reset it.  I&#39;m going to do it again and tell them if they want to keep an eye on me to just fucking hire me.</p>

<p>Last week I tried to call an attorney, and as soon as I hung up I got a call from a restricted number and the guy asked me who I was, I said who is this but he wouldn&#39;t tell me.  I hung up and he called back again, and I shut my phone off and pulled out the battery so they couldn&#39;t trace my phone.  This was from an obamaphone and now my phone got cancelled.  Those motherfuckers are right up my ass no matter where I go.  I&#39;m sure they&#39;re reading this message, probably as I type, since I haven&#39;t scanned for a keylogger lately.  I did put tape over the camera the other day.  We&#39;re all so fucked unless we stand together.  I&#39;d like to go someplace quiet, like Crimea.</p>

<p>Literally an <strong>astronomical</strong> difference. Also, you &quot;working on the ISS&quot; is not proof of anything. You were compartmentalized and worked on one small aspect of one small thing and, whether you want to admit or not, you were a tiny part of something much bigger that, in reality, you really have no clue about. And that is not an insult, it is a reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, no shit.  I&#39;m surprised it exists myself.  There were some idiots on that project.  It was a big dumping ground for incompetent engineers.  Our in-circuit emulator was the size of a refrigerator just to have a i386 stuck into a socket on the outside.  We were programming in Ada using a drag and drop tool, Matrix-X, that didn&#39;t work very well.  The emulator did not support breakpoints or traces.  I heard they later switched to C++, but I got out of that group because there was a massive, literally fat fuck, asshole sysadmin who took to hating me.  Fortunately, it was just a temporary assignment.</p>

<p>Ya know... you can see the ISS passing overhead at night sometimes under the right conditions.</p>

<p>Guess what else?  I also worked briefly on the failed billion dollar border security system and I can tell you it was designed from the beginning not to work.  I got fired as a consultant for saying it would never work.</p>

<p>ISS: yeah, I am pretty sure that the ISS exists, its the whole moon landing thing that has me scratching my head these days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well considering the Apollo missions have always been hoaxes, I imagine that many of the arguments have remained fairly consistent over the years.  You need only look over the details of the official story from NASA for a few hours to notice some pretty glaring anomalies.</p>

<p>For instance, why was there no delay between the astronauts and mission control anytime they spoke to each other?  There should have been well over 2 seconds of delay for the sound to travel from Earth to the Moon and back, yet they&#39;re quite clearly conversing in real time in all of the recordings.</p>

<p>Moon rocks have been proven fake, others are &quot;missing&quot;.  All of the over 700 cartons of original video are &quot;missing&quot;.  You know what&#39;s also missing?  Thousands and thousands of reels allegedly containing voice, biomedical monitoring, and telemetry data to monitor the location and functioning of the spaceships and their inhabitants, so basically the entirety of the alleged evidence and record.</p>

<p>So I guess I would ask what evidence you have that convinced you the Apollo missions actually <em>did</em> happen as we were told, aside from NASA just telling you they did.</p>

<p>No, it shows that something made it there <em>and was carefully placed without being damaged, at some point during or prior to 1962</em>. To assert that we had the capability to send an unmanned probe to position retroreflectors in 1962 is asserting that humanity had much greater capabilities then than we would have required to do a manned mission to the moon, so that argument actually undermines your position.</p>

<p>See above but the first one was located immediately and worked how it was supposed to for a year before being lost.  Bottom line is that an unmanned probe can leave a reflector, so therefore the existence of reflectors alone doesn&#39;t prove that a human reached the Moon.</p>

<p>Okay, but I don&#39;t know why you can&#39;t understand that this doesn&#39;t prove a human stepped foot there.  It is entirely possible that NASA also used unmanned probes to place the reflectors and were just better at it than Russia.

<p>Not at all.  This has in fact been my exact argument all along, have you been reading anything I&#39;ve said?  The reflectors in and of themselves don&#39;t prove a human made it to the Moon, period.  Evidence of this is that Russia used an unmanned probe the following year, so it clearly can be done.  It&#39;s not difficult logic to follow...</p>

<p>This is anti-logic.  If the claim is that humans landed on the Moon, which is a pretty extraordinary claim, then that claim needs to be proven.  But all of their evidence has mysteriously vanished.  If the only actual evidence is reflectors then that isn&#39;t very good proof at all since we already know they can be placed without the use of human beings (since Russia did exactly that).</p>

<p>Your only argument that humans needed to be there was that there were problems with both of Russia&#39;s unmanned landers but that in no way means that <em>all</em> unmanned landers would have the same problems.  We can speculate either way, but the point is that it doesn&#39;t prove a human made it to the Moon.</p>

<p>Are the reflectors the only evidence you have that&#39;s convinced you?  They almost have to be since no other evidence really exists.</p>

<p>Did the Russians leave reflectors on the Moon without any human involvement?  Oh, they did?  Then how is the existence of a reflector proof of human involvement in and of itself?  Answer: it isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to hand-wave when the argument you&#39;re making is easily disproven with simple logic.  We <em>know</em> that a human isn&#39;t required to leave a reflector so how is a reflector proof of a human?  It doesn&#39;t even make sense if you would take a few seconds to actually consider it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, if you, personally can&#39;t travel to the moon, then clearly it didn&#39;t happen.</p>

<p>What are you even talking about?  We were discussing a layman being able to build a telescope with which to prove to themselves that the reflectors are there and look like they should.

<p>Disputing a claim is a claim itself?  Hahaha, are you serious?  No, false.</p>

<p>But if you actually want to go this route, tell me why it is that every recording of the Moon landings has no delay at all in the audio between the astronauts and mission control.  Simple math tells us there should have been well over two seconds of delay for the sound to travel from the Moon to Earth and back again - so explain to me how it&#39;s possible that they&#39;re speaking in real time in every recording.</p>

<p>Now you&#39;re just saying words.  This is really quite simple: a reflector can be placed by an unmanned probe, thus a reflector is not proof of a human.  Period.  Now either explain why I&#39;m wrong, using words and logic, or give me something else in the form of evidence that convinced you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which they can, if they have the money and skill.</p>

<p>...which is just about no one on the planet, and that&#39;s exactly the point.  So considering that very, very few people can actually do this, it&#39;s a pretty meaningless argument on your part.  &quot;It can be independently verified.&quot;  Well, no, it really can&#39;t.</p>

<p>Do we agree that all of NASA&#39;s data is missing?  And do we agree that you think NASA is telling the truth?

<p>So two NASA astronauts give a &quot;moon rock&quot; to the leader of a country, it&#39;s proven that they actually gave him a piece of petrified wood, and yet we&#39;re to just assume that this was a once-off anomaly?

<blockquote>
<p>Have you got any response to the independant evidence?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What evidence?  Just read some of it.</p>

<p>&quot;On the left are two photos taken on the lunar surface by the Apollo 15 astronauts August 2, 1971 during EVA 3 at station 9A near Hadley Rille. On the right is a <strong>2008 reconstruction</strong> from images taken by the SELENE terrain camera and 3D projected to the same vantage point as the surface photos.&quot;</p>

<p>So, not a real picture.</p>

<p>&quot;As with SELENE, the Terrain Mapping Camera of India&#39;s Chandrayaan-1 probe <strong>did not have enough resolution to record Apollo hardware</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>So, no real picture.</p>

<p>&quot;China&#39;s second lunar probe, Chang&#39;e 2, which was launched in 2010 is capable of capturing lunar surface images with a resolution of up to 1.3 metres. It claims to have spotted traces of the Apollo landings, <strong>though the relevant imagery has not been publicly identified</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>So, claims without any evidence.</p>

<p>&quot;Aside from NASA, a number of entities and individuals observed, through various means, the Apollo missions as they took place.&quot;</p>

<p>Totally unsubstantiated claim without any evidence.</p>

<p>&quot;The Soviet Union monitored the missions at their Space Transmissions Corps, which was &quot;fully equipped with the latest intelligence-gathering and surveillance equipment.&quot;</p>

<p>Unsubstantiated, no evidence, and neither of the two sources lead anywhere.</p>

<p>Do I need to keep going?  Where is this &quot;evidence&quot; you&#39;re referring to?</p>

Not saying there were holographic planes or demolition charges or anything like that, but....c&#39;mon man. Dig around a little. They at the very very very least facilitated a bunch of guys who made the attack. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve done my digging, thought I was &quot;awake&quot; to the whole thing yada yada yada. Until I actually started examining the reasons I thought this, and they served as no viable alternative when put together.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe the buildings were imploded by thermitic charges if that&#39;s what you&#39;re asking. I find the idea laughable now. The leaps of logic it takes to think that Tower 7 was rigged to implode are gigantic.</p>

<p>Honestly, just try it now. Lay out to me what you believe happened on 9/11. Like a play by play. You can mark what you think is simply guesswork if you&#39;re not sure.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s see if it could up to the same scrutiny that has been applied to the &quot;official story&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate your civil response, and I may yet lay out the points I would ask you to consider, but I don&#39;t really have the time right now to devote to a point-by-point recitation. They&#39;re all over the &#39;net though, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen good ones, i&#39;ve you&#39;ve done the digging that you claim. </p>

<p>But in short, there are SO MANY HOLES in the government&#39;s story, and there are so many points left unaddressed in the Official Report -- including not even a page devoted to Bldg7. </p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t see how anybody who has looked deeply into 9/11 could think the Official Story is honest. I mean, even 6 of the 11 Committee members now say they were hoodwinked! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, no shit.  I&#39;m surprised it exists myself.  There were some idiots on that project.  It was a big dumping ground for incompetent engineers.  Our in-circuit emulator was the size of a refrigerator just to have a i386 stuck into a socket on the outside.  We were programming in Ada using a drag and drop tool, Matrix-X, that didn&#39;t work very well.  The emulator did not support breakpoints or traces.  I heard they later switched to C++, but I got out of that group because there was a massive, literally fat fuck, asshole sysadmin who took to hating me.  Fortunately, it was just a temporary assignment.</p>

<p>Ya know... you can see the ISS passing overhead at night sometimes under the right conditions.</p>

<p>Guess what else?  I also worked briefly on the failed billion dollar border security system and I can tell you it was designed from the beginning not to work.  I got fired as a consultant for saying it would never work.</p>
