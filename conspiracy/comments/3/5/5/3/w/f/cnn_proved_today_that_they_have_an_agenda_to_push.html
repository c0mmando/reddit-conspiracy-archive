       I figured out CNN was a state-run media outlet when they refused to do more than token coverage of the NSA spying scandal as it was blowing up. Even on their site, NSA stories would disappear off the front page quicker than any other stories.

       It has only been since tornados have hit a very populated area and caused that much damage that the news even considers meantioning them at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       There have been thousands of tornados that have come and gone doing extream damage for decades that have not been in the national news.  Over a hundred tornados will hit eazch year.
      </p>
      <p>
       What they do meantion is to support their views on climate change.  If you watched channel 4s nightly news they have a section every day about the horrible weather someone is experiencing somewhere in. this nation.  This goes on every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aren't we tired of being pulled around by our noses in everything we are suppose to feel about?  Its all designed for a purpose.  As long as there is an agenda there will be organizations like the news directing (herding) us into an expected direction.

       Well CNN was founded by a libertarian and remains libertarian and there are two goals to take the Presidency, fear and hate mongering are necessary now. Not to mention tornado talk might spark . . . climate change add that to the new report about the high carbon number in the atmosphere.
