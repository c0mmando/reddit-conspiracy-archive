    <div class="md"><p>It has only been since tornados have hit a very populated area and caused that much damage that the news even considers meantioning them at all.</p>

<p>There have been thousands of tornados that have come and gone doing extream damage for decades that have not been in the national news.  Over a hundred tornados will hit eazch year.</p>

<p>What they do meantion is to support their views on climate change.  If you watched channel 4s nightly news they have a section every day about the horrible weather someone is experiencing somewhere in. this nation.  This goes on every day.  </p>

<p>Aren&#39;t we tired of being pulled around by our noses in everything we are suppose to feel about?  Its all designed for a purpose.  As long as there is an agenda there will be organizations like the news directing (herding) us into an expected direction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well CNN was founded by a libertarian and remains libertarian and there are two goals to take the Presidency, fear and hate mongering are necessary now. Not to mention tornado talk might spark . . . climate change add that to the new report about the high carbon number in the atmosphere. </p>
