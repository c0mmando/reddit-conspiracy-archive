       I'm undecided (still too early in the game to determine anything, really), but Sanders's positions are a far cry from what Obama's positions were prior to his election.  They're very different people with very different beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, pre-election Obama is also a very different person from post-election Obama.  So there's that also.

       Or he is actually a genuine guy.  You are starting from the idea that Sanders has spent decades in Congress lying when he is fighting for his constituents just so that he can run for president in 2016?  He spent all of these years going against the grain to pull the wool over your eyes in this very election?  Isn't it possible that maybe he isn't a piece of shit?

       Well I think he is well aware that he isn't going to win.  He is just trying to bring more awareness to the cause of getting the money out of politics by running a campaign with no PAC where all of his money is from small donations from actual people and not millions of dollars from billionaires and Fortune 500 companies.

       If his role is to be a puppet, then the banks would donate the money for the privilege of shoving their collective hands up his ass to be the puppeteers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at who donates to a candidate. That is who the candidate works for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at Obama's donors. What has he done to corral the big banks, big media, big tech?
      </p>
      <p>
       NOTHING. In fact, it seems like more policies and such get enacted to enable those very organizations to become more powerful. Take, for example, the latest and greatest issue with the big banks where they get to take even more risks, but the government (we, the taxpayers) foot the bill if and when things go awry.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're going to have to do more than simply assert that Bernie is flawed just because he did the prudent thing (declare Democrat) to actually have a chance of geting elected. You're going to have to find something -
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       - that looks shady about him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck, but, again, do let us know if you find anything tangible.

       You've made that assertion many times in this thread, but it's unsupported by the facts, most notably the donor lists and the extent to which candidates actually do work for their donors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you even looked at the donor lists for Obama, Hillary, Romney, and Sanders? If so, have you considered how those donors have impacted their decisions while in office and/or campaigning? Do you understand what I'm talking about?

       Yes. You are talking about donor lists like they are definite proof of where someone's loyalties lie. You seem unable to acknowledge that the government factions are like hockey teams. You join a team, and you do anything you can do to get the puck into the opposing goal. If you joined the team and then started trying to score on your own goal, you wouldn't be on the team very long.

       For an independent candidate, I would tell him to join one of the factions and show how loyal to them you are, so you have a chance of participating in their elections.

       Bernie Sanders is by far the most consistently honest candidate in the race. Agree with him or not, you know what he stands for and you know his voting record. It never depends on what the definition of "is" is.

       Anyone of your neighbors would be less compromised, more open minded to real solutions, willing to decrease our military spending, increase our education programs, reform taxation policies, provide a real working economy to the slave-wage-laborers, punish white collar criminals, make banks &amp; corporations pay their fair share, remove income tax from families who make below a certain realistic level, provide proper health care &amp; nutrition to the impoverished without forcing the middle class to carry that burden, etc, etc.

       Sanders is as close as you are gonna get in our corporate owned "democracy," where the entire political process is driven by big money.

        Due to his long-standing criticism of the influence of big-money interests on government, Sanders has strong online and grassroots appeal, which he hopes to leverage to raise the money needed to fund a presidential campaign. And so far, the strategy looks savvy. The campaign has received roughly 75,000 contributions, and the average amount is $43.
        <strong>
         According to a campaign adviser, 99.4 percent of the donations have been $250 or less
        </strong>
        , and 185,000 supporters have signed up on the website BernieSanders.com.

       You have no shot of getting elected if you arent in one of the factions of the government party. You aren't allowed into one of those factions unless you show how loyal you are. You are not allowed anywhere near their parties or elections if you are not a member of their faction or loyal to their leaders.

       Politics is not a solution. The political process in America is part of the problem.

       Direct democracy is our solution. We do not "need" representatives to in turn tell us what we "need".

       He has way more credibility than Obama (his rhetoric is WAY more hardcore than Obama); just saying these things is helpful as it becomes part of the conversation. But yeah, as Chris Hedges says, and I'm paraphrasing, "you're not going to change anything playing by either parties' cooked rules". Search "Make the Rich Panic", it's a recent Truthdig article, really spells shit out. Technically I'm with you, bit this is one instance where cynicism isn't necessary (yet).
