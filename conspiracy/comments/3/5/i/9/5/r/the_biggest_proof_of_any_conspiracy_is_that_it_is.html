       Aside from all the other mounting evidence supporting various things as conspiracies, the one key thing, I think, that serves as a way to prove that it definitely was a conspiracy is it being something you are not permitted to talk about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or perhaps it is something you
       <em>
        may
       </em>
       talk about, but something that you will be ostracized, hated and mocked because you said it. And this is not just because it is a strange belief, or an outlandish one, or an offensive one, it is because everyone has simply been trained to tell you that you are wrong and should be treated like a monster for believing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you tell the general public that you believe 9/11 was an inside job, what happens? You are insulted and called crazy. Even though scientific fact and the laws of physics agree that there is no way that 9/11 happened exactly as the official story says it did, you will be insulted for pointing out that very simple fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, you truly
       <em>
        don't
       </em>
       have permission to talk about that by the powers that be. That's why they've made sure that any attempt to speak about these things is met with fierce opposition. They convince the public that anyone who does not follow their narrative, who questions or objects to their ways is evil, twisted and crazy, and then the public, dumb as they often are, do as they are told and ostracize people who question conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone tells you that you should never trust the words of another, just because they say so, it is more likely that they are the people that you can't trust.
      </p>

       Reality is a self correcting illusion filled with zealots who believe anything and will die defending the paradigm of their past.

       I truly believe that the current generation is the first one that doesn't have as many qualms of the non-violent habits of other humans (drugs, sexuality, politics).

       A group of young people who don't give a damn about other peoples drug use, sexuality, or politics, surrounded by old people who very much still do. A government believed to have deceived the public in order to lead them into an unpopular war that a large group of people protest while being mocked and having false accusations made against them in MSM about atrocities they have done to returning troops/families. Protests in the streets related to both race and class prejudice are met with national guard forces being deployed on American soil. A great national tragedy occurs, and the result plays out in the media as the perpetrators are found and killed. A portion of the population believes that it was all a conspiracy carried out by the US government, and the general populous ridicules them as nutjobs.

       That basically sums up what is happening now, and also everything I have ever read or seen about the 1960s. Pretty sure this has all happened before.

       I am not sure. My mind tells me we are screwed. My heart wants hope. When I look at history, I see a long string of their wins. And their tech is improving. They control the education system, the media, the publishing houses... We are weak. They take our money and use it against us.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not 3k against 7B. We are divided by language, culture, class, religion and race. They can use our divisions against us. They also have their goons, who I swear are being bred and developed to be goons. They will use violence including murder to protect their high salaries and perks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many good people in the world are slaves or serfs today. They cannot see any possibility for change. We need to lead the charge. We are more free than they are.

       I agree.
source: Eugenics is still being carried out. I have reason to belive I was bred to be a "goon." If you want to be fancy, an unknowing perpetuator of the panopticon. Big, agile, perceptive, abused and neglected youth (results in submissive authoritarianism), family has a shady history and was broken up when I was young, always middle aged or old white people randomly giving my mother just enough aid to survive as she drug us around the country. Break the woman, you break her kids. Makes them more susceptable to coercian. Military looks good to a latchkey kid. If they eat the hook and line, but not the sinker, well then a...frame...can be built.around them. If that doesn't work, their reputation can be assassinated, and they can be driven to drink and drugs through leaning on or leveraging the people they thought they knew their whole life, by fucking with their dreams, the power of suggestion...a shitload of other ways.
Someone you know and love probably works for this gangster system, and you don't know it, because they can't tell you. Good luck you folks. Be virtuous, moderate in your words and actions, and calm. Learn to meditate. If you are wise to this stuff there is a chance they are already on to you, too.

       yeah, there are what appears to be worse examples in the military where the kids are taught to obey first and think about how they are fucked because they obeyed later.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can also see it in their DARE program or just say no to drugs which is designed to get kids to do drugs and then they get kids who have babies who have been doing drugs since before they were born and you wonder why their minds are fucked up? Their minds are fucked up because they are designed to be that way.

       Gen-X has already joined their team too. It's amazing what huge salaries and payoff's can do to a "rebellious" person's opinion. Baby boomers were extremely rebellious until they were offered good jobs and leadership roles. Now they too, are just as bad as their predecessors.

       It was continued on a Chan site not 4. They found some connection to former CIA and military arms dealers among other interesting things. I think that section too was taken down a while ago.

       The day-care specifically, nothing came of it.  At least, nothing that could be verifiably confirmed.  Tax records I received regarding the day-care don't indicate much of anything.  Either a very poorly run money laundering operation at best or a horrendously sloppy drug front at worst, not much more than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       It did open the lid on something more interesting regarding other companies involvement in some shenanigans.  But the evidence for that is circumstantial at best- a lot of "This guy who worked here where shady things happened also worked here with this guy who later worked here with this guy and now that 3rd guy is working at this company over here possibly doing shady things".  I'm still waiting on some paperwork inquiries, but they can take upwards of 90 days just to respond to.  Example: a request for records I made in March was just responded to about 2 weeks ago, and they said it will take them close to 90-days to send the paperwork I requested.  So, it will take a while to get at the information I'd like to.

       Funny thing is, what little information I had at the time (about a week or so after the initial SLC posting) I had made a post over on Voat.  Considering we were told that Voat doesn't censor information I felt confident things would be ok. The post with the theory I put together (that had nothing to do with the day-care, btw) with the links I had at the time, have all been nuked from orbit and no longer exist over there either.  So, take that however you so choose.

       Censorship is a warning sign, but I wouldn't call it "proof" of anything.  For example, a lot of schizophrenics believe there are people with full-time positions (paid for by the government) to send messages into their brains via satellite.  This is of course a taboo belief that will get you labeled as a crazy, but that doesn't mean I think they are correct!  Even if there is some sort of satellite-based technolo0gy being used to drive people crazy, there's no way they can know what you are thinking and have full-time operatives there 24/7 to mess with your head.  It's just not feasible.

        The ratio for the Stasi was one secret policeman per 166 East Germans. When the regular informers are added, these ratios become much higher: In the Stasi's case, there would have been at least one spy watching every 66 citizens! When one adds in the estimated numbers of part-time snoops, the result is nothing short of monstrous: one informer per 6.5 citizens.

       We're talking about 24/7 harrassment of negligent individuals who have no impact on the world.  How do these sadists afford to eat?  Are you trying to say that they can do this with just a cellphone?  What about the thousands of crazies who have been "targeted" for years before cellphones even existed or who are too paranoid to own one?  It just seems awfully far-fetched to me.  On the other hand, being crazy is quite common.  Maybe there is a correlation between rising madness and electromagnetic pollution (which is subconsciously detected by the sufferers themselves), but I don't think it works quite the way paranoid people think it does.

       Less controversy making a no-name person carry out their random acts of perversion and violence for their cause. If a common man commits a crime, it can be pushed as an accusatory label for any common man.

       Exactly. Nobody cares if you believe in UFOs. You might be mocked just because that is what humans do when someone promotes unconventional ideas. But you will not be subject to a highly organized, well-financed smear campaign that will make you lose your job, your marriage, your money and even land you in jail in many European countries, just because you e.g. question the official narrative of the holocaust  - even if you have valid science to back it up.

       The marketers of TPTB are making a big semantic push to conflate "science" to mean "that which has been proven to be true, e.g., if you question the vaccine schedule, you go against "science," and we'll tell you exactly what the "science" says is "true." No scientist who is worth a shit, however, would agree to that leap in meaning. Science should always question and seek to answer, until the questioning becomes unnecessary.

       Meh. The elites know how to consciously target the subconscious...as in your five sense reality is filled with all sorts of ideas and distractions pulling you from what truly makes you happy. Work here, go to school there, use this, believe this...eh you know. I do think we are bit more advanced than living to pay bills and make money..people edit their realities to fit a certain narrative..can't really blame them for it.

       Just found out a reddit admin lives less then 5 miles from that day care.  Maybe this is why it got shut the fuck down.

       Oh, my bad.  I thought that if:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the one key thing, I think, that serves as a way to prove that it definitely was a conspiracy is it being something you are not permitted to talk about.
       </p>
       <p>
        Or perhaps it is something you may talk about, but something that you will be ostracized, hated and mocked because you said it. And this is not just because it is a strange belief, or an outlandish one, or an offensive one, it is because everyone has simply been trained to tell you that you are wrong and should be treated like a monster for believing it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I guess that was wrong.
