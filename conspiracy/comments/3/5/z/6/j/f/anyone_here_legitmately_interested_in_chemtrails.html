       Hi all, I'm from Redding, CA. Im here to hopefully start a real conversation piece over chemtrails. I can post pictures all day long for those of you interested. Ill start it off now. This was from the other day, and is a daily occurrence over here..

       Whether they continue in the same path, or turn around and come back, the sprayer stays on and you can tell right away it isnt commercial. Or you can cheat and check out flightradar24.com to match with whats in the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont want anyone to reply saying, 'well some planes dont show up on flghtradar24.com because they dont have to register', because thats impossible. In order to be a body with two wings in the sky, you must register with the FAA.
      </p>
      <p>
       I realize there are some planes that dont come equipped with the tracking systems new planes have(which would render flightradar24.com useless), but none of those planes exist for commercial use anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets share!
      </p>
      <p>
       Let the storm roll.

       Edit: All info pertaining to the topic is much appreciated!

       How do you tell right away that they aren't commercial? This is something I'm interested in but it seems like there is so much bickering around this subject it's hard to get a grasp on anything.

       Use that tracker I referenced. It works very well. It will tell you that its commercial, and give you the flight number of that current trip. If you look up and see what you think is a sprayer, get on and check out whats in the air above you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many times have I looked up, got onto flightradar24.com and there wont be a flight for miles around me. It just simply happens. Its hard to hide everything from the general public.

       We see the chemtrail gridwork of lines most days in this part of central Texas, I finally convinced my brother and father that they are not just contrails/water vapor. I asked them to watch the sky for a few moonlit nights and tell my if they ever see the long straight lines or gridwork of "contrails" that we constantly see all through the day. After a while they had to admit that they never saw them at night- you'd think that water vapor cooling into contrails would still occur at night and maybe even at a higher rate since average temperatures are lower and humidity higher at night.
       <br/>
       TLDR: Whatever they are spraying has a relationship to sunlight- you never see chemtrails at night- just contrails and clouds.

       I've seen persistent contrails at night, plenty of times (and I've seen chemtrails believers post pictures of them, too).  But they're harder to see in the dark, and there is a lot less commercial air traffic at night.

       Exactly. Commercial flights don't exist at 3AM in the same frequency than they do at 11AM. Doesn't take a genius to understand that one. I feel like we may be getting trolled here.

       It could go either way. Honestly, I'm glad some of us can meet at a common ground. I do know that you are correct though about not seeing as much traffic at night. You can however clearly see trails when there is a full(or close to full) moon.

       Im actually looking into submitting a test myself to a (semi)localish testing facility. Id like to know what Im breathing in on a daily basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       In some reports, biologists have taken samples around the base of Mount Shasta (which by the way is known as a historical land mark) and have found various metals in high concentration. I will post the findings once I locate them.

      <p>
       Some people have even reported black mold and other fungi.

       They key is to compare whatever you find to the normal range.  Ordinary soil and dust naturally contains elements such as aluminum.  Fungal spores are naturally very abundant in the environment.

       I'm just north of you; can confirm. The other day the sky to the west was blue as could be, but overhead and east it was murky with lines. I've tried very hard to be skeptical of chemtrails, but it keeps getting worse.

       I know exactly what you mean. I've really tried to be skeptical of them, but the number of them in our area is really insane. We don't get that much air traffic over us here - not enough to justify that much of it.

       AnonUSCiti, it would be my guess that you're just not using FlightRadar24 correctly.  People tend to under-estimate how far away planes are, and assume that they must be flying right over their position if they are visible. How about posting a picture of a plane leaving a trail, and telling us the time, approximate location, and direction in which the photo was taken, and we'll see if we can locate a likely flight in FR24.

       So you want me to show you a past flight, and you want to go look for it in real time on flight radar to match...Makes sense. Anyways, Im not terrible with judging distances.

       FR24 has a "playback" feature where you can see what flights were in the air at a previous day and time (up to a week before).  I'm sure you're fine at judging distances at ground level, but we humans aren't well set up for making such judgments "by eye" about objects that are tens of thousands of feet high.

       Understandable. But putting 2 and 2 together is very easy for a person like me. I dont just connect one point with another. More thought goes into it. I narrow it down to if there is any traffic in the area.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets say I see a plane that looks like is 5-6 miles away in the distance. I check up on flight radar and look to see if there are even any planes in the northstate within 50 miles of me. If there are, its time to take out the augmented reality or telescope. I dont know, for someone like me, I have the resources to not be stupid about my findings.

       Not saying in any way that you could be wrong but I know of the exsistance of cloud seeding to produce rain clouds. Ionized silver released into the upper atmosphere combines with heavier water particles to produce rain. As we all know rain is what CA needs these days. But keep in mind this information is what I learned in a documentary and its still, what they wanted me to know. Who knows whats really being released. Thanks for the share.

       You're close. Cloud seeding doesn't create clouds - it involves the release of materials into existing clouds, to induce or enhance precipitation.

       You're absolutely correct. Thank you. I wonder how long OP's chemtrails lingered around in the sky. I imagine the the ionized silver would dissapate rather quickly.

       Its quite jaw dropping at just how long they last sometimes.

      <p>
       Ill walk out early morning around 8am ; Trails all across the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
       About noon ; They start spreading wide and hazing over.
      </p>
      <p>
       By 6pm ; You can tell they havent gone away and they stretch for miles, still not dissipating. The day goes from a clear blue sky(with trails throughout) to a light mist over the top of us.

       i have read about them before, but not in great depth. Not sure I entirely believe in it either. I know that airports will fly around their area and control the enviroment so that planes don't land on ice, but as far as top secret government planes spreading chemicals in the air I am not sure about.

       Weather modification (cloud seeding) is a real thing, and it's not secret.  But it doesn't cause those persistent cloud trails across the sky.  It involves the release of materials into existing clouds, to induce or enhance precipitation.  It's not the same thing as geoengineering.

       I don't know why you're being downvoted. One of the current theories is that they are cloud seeding over the pacific so rain doesn't make it to california. In addition to making sure there is less snowfall during the winter, which can also be accomplished by cloud seeding.
      </p>
      <p>
       And before anyone says "why would they want a drought in california" it's so they can kill off all the heritage crops/trees and a big agritech company/companies can come in an buy up all the land. It's all about control.

       People just want to burry their head in the sand and just let life pass them by while playing mind craft and wow. 
All it takes is a quick google search to understand what chemtrails are, but, again that would mean actually doing something aside from their nonexistent life.....you see...until something directly affects someone... they will continue to eat  their cheetos, drink their grape soda while trying to get to the next level of whatever mind sucking game they are playing.

       I had to take some pictures from the other morning on my way home from work because when I went outside and looked at the sky it just looked so unnatural to me. Its pathetic most people are so blind to something so obvious.
