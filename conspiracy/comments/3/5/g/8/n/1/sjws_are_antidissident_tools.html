        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Government wants people subscribing to the SJW viewpoint as it pussifies them, making them useless in the event our Government becomes openly or seriously tyrannical. They&#39;re authoritarian tools, who spread pro-toleration nonsense upon people ignorantly; it affects our individual rights, mainly our freedom of speech. You can&#39;t speak out against degenerate communities or beliefs, like the absurdity of the transgender community and how they negatively influence people and our culture. The feminist and social justice warrior nonsense is supported by the media and Government so they can manipulate the young generations in order to make them useful idiots for the Government. It&#39;s simply subtle manipulation of our culture/society in order to give the Government more control and support. In the future when the young are brainwashed with the same corrupt ideology, authoritarian viewpoints will be welcomed and enforced in the name of a warped perception of justice/equality. Individual free speech will be attacked if it does not conform to their extremist ideology. Free speech is becoming distorted and corrupted openly and wholly in the name of tyranny. </p>

<p>Those of you who support such nonsense will not get a response out of me. I know you&#39;re incapable of objective thought; I will not waste my time on you manipulative tools, and neither will this community I hope. It&#39;s best to not reply, as any logic is disregarded by such people; I&#39;m not saying ignore them, just avoid giving them the fodder they desire they&#39;ll use to spark useless arguments.  </p>

<p>edit; looks like I pissed off the SJW&#39;s, isn&#39;t that a shame. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems to me past historical figures who today would be called &quot;SJWs&quot; include Martin Luther King, Ralph Nader &amp; Gandhi.

Anyone opposed to slavery?  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_abolitionists">SJW</a>.</p>

<p>&quot;SJW&quot; is a re-packaging of the term &quot;Political Correctness&quot; which was basically the same epithet.  Jesus Christ would have been considered a massive SJW.  Even if the story was fiction, the alleged reason he was crucified was for being an SJW.</p>

<p>According to you.  And according to those who intend to smear the phrase and its origins and any type of protest that isn&#39;t Tea Party/gun protest.  Notice you never hear pro-gun protesters called &quot;SJWs&quot;.  Aren&#39;t they also protesting for justice?  &quot;SJW&quot; is intended to be a smear against one part of the political spectrum.  Otherwise, why not just use the word &quot;authoritarian&quot; which covers members of the entire political spectrum?</p>
