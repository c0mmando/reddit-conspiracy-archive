       's highly unpopular comment has already been making its rounds:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We have a problem right now where there are people/communities that exist under the "freedom of expression" point, that do
        <em>
         not
        </em>
        create a safe space to encourage participation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The order of these points is important and a safe space to have discourse is of the upmost importance to reddit. We are working on changes to make reddit a safer space for discourse.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Hm, I wonder what communities he's referring to? Naturally there was quite the backlash to the blog and these comments.

       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/352twf/were_sharing_our_companys_core_values_with_the/cr0f5xz">
        this diatribe

       that has been gilded 5 times over.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It works the other way, too. Reddit refuses to apply the few clear rules that there are in situations where it would apply to a popular post or community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have seen regular brigading from places like
        <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
         /r/Conspiracy
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="/r/HailCorporate">

        <a href="/r/ShitRedditSays">
         /r/ShitRedditSays
        </a>
        ... etc. And nothing is ever done about it because the admins seem worried about the narrative that would come about from doing anything.

       in another gilded comment:

      <blockquote>

        Sometimes it's the other way around.
        <a href="/r/Conspiracy">

        and

        have done so much bannable shit from brigading to doxxing, and yet they are still around.
       </p>
       <p>
        Why? Because the admins are more concerned about the potential backlash and narrative from banning those subreddits than from actually enforcing their own rules consistently.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Two jabs at
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , listing this sub first both times...
       <em>
        someone
       </em>
       has a grudge.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems that both sides in this manufactured drama are reenforcing the narrative that some "communities" on reddit may soon be unwelcome.

       I mean, we're an argumentative and passionate group, absolutely. But that's just asshole behavior, and that's why I have a hard time believing it's happening (much?).
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there any truth to the brigading and doxxing accusations?

       I think the "brigading" is total bullshit. Like this whole np idiocy, where people can be banned from a community forum website for voting outside their privilege. "Sorry, you didn't visit these subreddits in the correct order before voting. You are banned." It seems really setup to attack individual voters and nothing that would deter vote bot groups.

       I think that's a good point. There have been plenty of times I've redirected to another sub or article and found stuff worth of up- or down- voting, but had to refrain because of that insanely stupid rule.

       Funny I was agreeing with Karmanaut up until he started calling us out. His points about brigading and how the admins use it on their own whim are spot on.

       The fact that our new queue is at 0 all the time apparently doesn't bother him though.

       Thanks to comments like the ones singling this subreddit out I can feel the tide changing. It's been changing for awhile but I think the waves are finally crashing into the shore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, I haven't been a redditor that long in the grand scheme of things. I've only been on reddit a little over a year. This has always been one of my favorite subs. I started lurking here a lot after I thought abovetopsecret.com had been infultrated and nullified by shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was my replacement. It was the best place I could come to for conspiracy info.
      </p>
      <p>
       This no longer feels like a safe place to gather this info. It's hard to sort out and you have to dig through a lot of shit posts to find the good ones now and now the admins are trying to silence this subreddit altogether. Perhaps I'm just not savvy enough (even though I work in IT) to discover the hidden niche's in the internet where people can discuss information that informs them of negative government intents.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have not been able to find a decent replacement for this sub. There are some websites that are legit conspiracy sites that simply don't have enough exposure to be popular enough to be able to provide relavent new information as I have become accustomed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either there are places I'm not aware of or more and more these places are disappearing or being subverted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm afraid even though we slowed down SOPA/CISPA it doesn't seem to matter. The internet is slowly going dark...and by that I mean...the parts of it that matter in resisting the powers that be are slowly being removed. I'm afraid the last bastion for freedom of speech outside of person to person conversation is disappearing and I'm not sure how to stop it....

       Yeah, and...    I kind of expect that here, and rightfully so.
It means those of us that question things are making enough noise to generate, "brigades" of response.  As delvers of truth, we have forever been the brunt of jokes, name calling and worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you've been doing it long enough, as I've noticed in my time here, you learn to see through the shitstorm and find the nuggets of truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the mods interfere in either direction, outside of real issues, it takes away from the unvarnished truth, people can see for themselves, or learn to.  but for that, some time in the "shitstorm" is pre-requisite to learning the rules of engagement, and sorting it all out.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: When given the chance to engage in dialog, more often than not, everyone at some point will show their true colors, and that's when you begin to see.  So, it's back to business as usual, don't change the best tool (IMO) to hash shite out.

       I'm just offering my personal testimony here: I've been subscribed to this sub for years and have kept up with it pretty actively all throughout that time, many days loading the sub multiple times throughout the day and opening dozens of threads, and I've never even once seen a deliberate attempt at brigading. Although what I have seen many times is, when some drama on another subreddit is linked or mentioned here, there's always very explicit reinforcement from the community encouraging that our members do NOT brigade. So fuck whoever is talking about this being a brigading sub, it's total nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as doxxing goes, I don't think I've even seen anything marginally doxxing related be mentioned on this board, and any time a discussion goes anywhere near the topic, again, the discouragement is universal. Fucking idiots, I swear.

       organizing a group of people online to attack or overrun a certain subreddit or topic on the internet. Kinda like how the JIDF exists to 'fight anti-semitism'. We're being accused of conducting and organizing similar operations when in fact it's other groups attacking this subreddit. Hell, there's even a subreddit completely dedicated to discrediting places like these (

        /r/conspiritard

       )

       It's a controversial sub to begin with, but only because so many people are so easily offended. I have defended disagreements in discussions, I ban people for being assholes, not because they disagree with me.

       Tried the different Chans.  Maybe I didn't spend enough time there, or maybe I'm getting too old, but I didn't get it.
