       If the Earth were a sphere, airplane pilots would have to constantly correct their altitudes downwards so as to not fly straight off into "outer space"! If the Earth were truly a sphere 25,000 miles circumference curveting 8 inches per mile squared, a pilot wishing to simply maintain their altitude at a typical cruising speed of 500 mph, would have to constantly dip their nose downwards and descend 2,777 feet (over half a mile) every minute! Otherwise, without compensation, in one hour's time the pilot would find themselves 166,666 feet (31.5 miles) higher than expected!
      </p>
      <p>
       Ship captains in navigating great distances at sea, never need to factor the supposed curvature of the Earth into their calculations. Both Plane Sailing and Great Circle Sailing, the most popular navigation methods, use plane, not spherical, trigonometry.
      </p>
      <p>
       "It must be obvious to the reader that, if the earth be the globe of popular belief, the rules observed for navigating a vessel from one part of this globe to another, must be in conformity to its figure. The datum line in navigation would be an arc of a circle, and all computations would be based on the convexity of water and worked out by spherical trigonometry.
       <strong>
        Let me preface my remarks on the important branch of our subject by stating that at sea the datum line is always a horizontal line; spherical trigonometry is never used, and not one out of one thousand shipmasters understands spherical trigonometry

       As a pilot, I can assure you we do not chart routes as if the earth were flat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its actually quite a problem, when you draw a straight line on a map it's not actually a straight line on  the earth. To account for this best we can we distort maps. Hence on the maps you are used to seeing, every country's area is distorted.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most obvious example is Greenland is no where near the size of Africa, yet appears to be rather similar.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you actually want to do some learning here are some terms to search for: Mercator Projection, Lambert Project, Great Circle Navigation, Rhumb Line

       I already know all about the Mercator Projection and just how poor all the maps are that the round earth believers provide. The confusion around the actual depiction of the Earth on a map should clue you in that there might be something more here.

       When you look at
       <a href="https://flightaware.com/live/">
        all the flights
       </a>
       , you'll notice a few things. The northern hemisphere is covered with flight paths but the southern hemisphere is mostly empty. You might also notice that flights disappear off the tracking when passing over the South Pacific.

       As a commercial pilot, do you have to account for 2,777 feet of altitude correction every minute when at cruising speeds of 500 mph?

       Lol. I can't believe I'm getting drawn into this but here goes:
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'poor maps' are because you can't transfer a sphere onto a flat piece of paper. Go and get yourself a football (soccer) ball. Notice you can't wrap it with a piece of paper without folding/wrinkling some of it?
      </p>
      <p>
       as for the "2,777 feet of altitude correction"  a plane flys because its lift force opposes gravity. Imagine gravity as a string between the center of the earth and the aeroplane. As the plane flys around the earth the 'string' keeps it at the same distance.

       One of my previous threads had someone claiming refraction is why we can't observe any curvature, as if refraction perfectly compensated for any and all curvature as to make it invisible.
      </p>
      <p>
       But now gravity perfectly compensates for this lack of any and all expected curvature?

       You'll also notice on flightaware that flight paths aren't straight lines. THat's because the plane is flying on a great circle track (the shortest distance) which appears as a curved line when you distort the map.
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S. you should look up the flight path for Sydney -&gt; buenos aires.

       "Plane Sailing is usually defined to be the art of navigating a ship on the supposition that the earth is a plane ... even when longitude enters into consideration, it is still with the plane triangle only that we have to deal ... but 'the rules for plane sailing would equally hold good though the surface were a plane." -J.R. Young, "Navigation and Nautical Astronomy"
      </p>

       "It must be evident to everyone who understands what a triangle is, that the base of any such figure on a globe would be an arc of a circle, of which the center would be the center of the globe. Thus, instead of a plane triangle, the figure would contain one plane angle and two spherical angles. Hence, if the plane triangle is what we have to deal with, and such is the case, the base of the triangle would be a straight line - the ocean. That all triangulation used at sea is plane, proves that the sea is a plane. The foregoing quotation states that a plane triangle is used for a spherical surface, but 'the rules for plane sailing would equally hold good though the surface were a plane'. What fine reasoning! It is like saying that the rules for describing a circle are those used for drawing a square, but they would equally hold good though the figure were a square." -Thomas Winship, "Zetetic Cosmogeny"

       How does one differentiate between a conspiracy and idiocy? Is this really a conspiracy?

      <p>
       If I would to claim that 2+2=5 would that belong to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ? What if I say that there is a youtube video with irrefutable evidence:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KD_9SNey9E">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KD_9SNey9E
       </a>
       , and that the story of 2+2=4 is only a brainwashing done by the cabal.
