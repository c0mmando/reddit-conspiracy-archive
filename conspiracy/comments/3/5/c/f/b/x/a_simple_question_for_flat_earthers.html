<p>Could be or there are others on the planet with us, ;) lol.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Nazi&#39;s were very interested in Antarctica and did perform explorations, we also brought these very Nazi&#39;s back into various agencies via Operation Paperclip. What did these explorers/scientists really know. Many of them headed the various space/jet programs.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, idk. I think it&#39;s novel to think about, plus I have an over active imagination and do not trust any &quot;authority&quot;. I mean we have never been to space personally, the only ones who &quot;have&quot; are from a government agency and they are telling you.</p>

<p>Not sure how that map shows we are all equal. Looks like hidden in plain site to me, but could be wrong.</p>

<p>Watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R77j9rUuky4">this video</a> a few nights ago and it goes into the Masonic element of it and how the ancients realized the earth was flat, up until the Free Mason&#39;s came along, via Pythagoras..</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Fair point, the only difference is that WWI was a world war, we have footage and civilian testimony. The space program is only verified by the government (NASA and other governments). What civilian has gone to space to testify the validity of what the governments are saying?</p>

<p>Edit: from the doc I linked about the UN flag and the Free Mason connection: <a href="http://imgur.com/MQojJsJ">http://imgur.com/MQojJsJ</a>. 33 is highly symbolic within the Free Masons.</p>

<p>Says who? Have you actually ever saw any of these things with your own eye (telescope), or through the lens of a NASA camera?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How would the earth have formed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why couldn&#39;t a flat earth be formed? Why would it need to be a sphere and not say a cube (hypothetical)?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and what path does the moon follow around a flat earth? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, if the earth is flat it&#39;s pattern would coexist with the sun&#39;s pattern, hence the eclipses. These two celestial bodies would revolve around us, not vice versa.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and what would even be the point of concealing the earths flatness?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many reasons. Extra real estate, extra natural resources, or even there are other species amongst us coexisting. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying I believe it, but, it&#39;s a thought exercise. I question a lot of things and think this is a novel conspiracy theory. That is the point of humans no, to question?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, telescopes Ive seen venus. Its round.</p>

<p>To look at planet formation, you have to understand gravity and fields of influence. Much like a bubble underwater, or a soap bubble in air, or even drops of water.</p>

<p>Youve seen footage of water in space right? or the vomit commit right?</p>

<p>Matter congeals to a focal point. </p>

<p>If the earth was a disk, the moon would have to be orbiting around the perfect edge. We would only be able to see the moon as a half in the horizon.</p>

<p>Otherwise it couldnt hold an orbit and would just be pulled into the earth. You see, there is no force keeping the moon up in the sky. </p>

<p>Post some pics next time. If you get a good pic, post it. I&#39;ve been watching the skies for years, and I&#39;m not convinced it&#39;s a sphere.</p>

<p>Drops of water are pear shape, not a sphere.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen what <em>they&#39;ve</em> shown me, yes. I&#39;m not convinced though, because I&#39;ve never been there. Maybe when civilian outer space travel is a thing, we can clear up all this mumbo-jumbo. Hopefully, it&#39;s in my life time, still young.</p>

<p>Not trolling, but having a discussion. Stop being so butt hurt about people asking questions that go against your world views. I did not see that in the video and checked my faucet (easy experiment). </p>

<p>Why? I never said any of that. Just because they say they zoom around a sphere doesn&#39;t mean they do. It&#39;s all based on classical science. I&#39;m saying something fringe (devil&#39;s advocate). Have you actually seen a satellite orbit a sphere?  </p>

<p>Wrong, the case would be the opposite. If you take a helicopter and hover it for x amount of hours you would land in a different place, maybe Nepal or Europe. But, that doesn&#39;t happen, why? The earth apparently isn&#39;t moving.</p>

Things that are heavier than the medium around it fall, things lighter (like helium) rise, simple as that.  </p>

<p>Here is private balloon footage showing that the horizon is always at eye level and flat.  Often balloons (and the Red Bull jump) always have a fisheye lens so it distorts the image, If there is no fisheye lens the horizon is always flat.</p>

<p>The only crazy thing is believing that we are spinning 1000mph while traveling 67,000 mph around the Sun and never ever feeling any motion.  If you had never been TOLD which was &quot;correct&quot; you would say that theory is much crazier than the obvious flat motionless Earth.  </p>

<p>Pythagoras (who was part of the mystery schools) presented the idea and the Freemason Copernicus picked it up.  If you think that flat earth was invented in the 1800&#39;s you are just ignorant.  Did you not see the Ancient Flat Earth video I linked?</p>

<p>It is just a word made up by the Freemason Issac Newton to magically &quot;explain&quot; all the crazy inconsistencies of the magic spinning ball theory.  Things that are denser than the medium it surrounds fall and things less dense (like helium) rise, that simple.

    <div class="md"><p>you can literally see the ISS with a telescope.</p>

<p>I was annoyed because you refused to understand why water droplets are round. </p>

<p>Now see now see, you just said something that proved your ignorance of physics with the helicopter thing. Lets say youre in a car going 70 mph, and you toss a coin in the air. </p>

<p>tell me why that coin does not shoot to the back of the car at 70 mph. </p>

<p>Traditional thought is that there is a god. That man was created and is special. Maybe you&#39;re the one failing? </p>

<p>P.S. you keep asking what my point is. Every time I answer one of your queries you cant refute, you ask what my point is. Troll tactics</p>

<p>How is there no such thing as gravity?</p>

<p>It is just a word made up by the Freemason Issac Newton to magically &quot;explain&quot; all the crazy inconsistencies of the magic spinning ball theory.  Things that are denser than the medium it surrounds fall and things less dense (like helium) rise, that simple.  The stars are luminaries, the planets are just &#39;wandering stars&#39; they are not terra firma planets like we&#39;ve been told. </p>
