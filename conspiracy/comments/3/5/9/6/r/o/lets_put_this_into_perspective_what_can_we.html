If this is so planned, and so well rehearsed, well, what the fuck can we do? I see so many posts and people talking about a global cabal, I agree. If these sick fucks are so organized and engrained in culture, then what can we actually do? Think about it, I&#39;m a libertarian free market capitalist. We are living under a form of Fascist/crony capitalism/ collectivism. This was the plan for the US and they have a lot of money and power. How the fuck do we change this? Can we change this? I do not think protest or voting works. We all sit here and talk about this shit, but, what can we do. Honestly, I think the game is up. We lost and there is no turning back. Your thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never give up; this is what our ancestors across time have meant by faith. If you let doubt take over it will invite in fear and you will lose your power to do good. There is a spiritual war in you that must be overcome if you are to help yourself much less anyone else. Love will light the way.</p>

<p>For actions, <strong>plant seeds</strong>, seeds that grow food, seeds that change minds. We want to be independent but right now we need the Beast that rules us. We were trained to be ignorant and dependent but we are life and we can grow. You can use the internet to entertain yourself or to learn anything and everything you can, starting with how to grow food to build self-sustaining communities.</p>

<p>Be the change and others will follow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t about religion. Spirituality is different in that it&#39;s an individual practice instead of an organized, group practice that many of us, including myself, are not fans of.</p>

<p>To get a better idea of the spiritual war going on, Google &quot;Pleiadean message&quot;.</p>

<p>Essentially, you need to be able to resist the immoral and corrupt behavior that the general public tends to exhibit. Meditation is key in this quest...learn to center your own energy, make yourself a better person, and be genuinely empathetic to others. We&#39;re not perfect beings and being frustrated isn&#39;t a roadblock to this personal development, but if you meditate 30 min a day, you&#39;ll start to feel amazing...almost like you&#39;re aware of how it feels to be alive, and you&#39;ll also be more considerate and kind...almost by default. You&#39;ll be able to put yourself in someone else&#39;s situation more easily, and understand their point of view. You can feel your energy moving throughout your body, and you can learn how to focus it. </p>

<p>Learning how to focus your mind, center your energy, and promote love as the primary necessity for a happy life, are all huge parts of fighting the Cabalistic influence that is destroying the world.</p>

<p>Please, research Astral Projection...it will lead you down the right path. </p>

<p>Remember: if this all sounds crazy, it&#39;s because the governments of the world told you it sounds crazy by manipulating mass media into ridiculing the idea of any success outside the economic system. Ignore that for a bit and see what it&#39;s like to indulge in all the &quot;what ifs&quot; you can think of...a lot of world events and current goings-on will start to not make any sense, except from a private a interest standpoint.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Go off-grid and help others do the same, if they&#39;re interested. Think of good ways to make life off-grid enjoyable...the Tesla Powerwall will be huge in this movement.</p>

<p>When it comes down to it, personal and spiritual strength is key. Learn survival skills, learn manufacturing and machining skills (blacksmithing is a great starting point), and start learning how to camp effectively. Maybe buy a small plot of land as a getaway spot, where you can set up hidden caches of supplies and secret hiding places in the area. Have fun with it while you can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What can we actually do?</p>

<p>Do what you can do, as often as you can,  and as much as you can that&#39;s in alignment with what you truly believe. </p>

<p>I have my own beliefs and views so I aligned myself with them as best I could for now. They are ever evolving and I am too. </p>

<p>I grow almost all of my organic produce year round, hunt/fish/raise animals, gather, grow all of my organic coffee, soon to be processing my own organic chocolate, barter, make my own wine and beer, use only rainwater catchment for daily use, make my own organic soaps, grow traditional Hawaiian medicinal plants for medicine (la&#39;au lapa&#39; au), and much more. </p>

<p>I gave up a &quot;career&quot; to live a simple life doing what I love, spending time with my family and sharing with others. </p>

<p>But on another level I have aligned myself with what I believe will bring about the needed changes. Shifting the paradigms takes work in another direction building something new. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not waiting for anyone else to change the current crumbling system. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m happy to discuss anything with you. If you get an area ready for a garden I&#39;ll happily mail you some organic heirloom seeds. </p>

<p>I believe the first step is to identify what exactly what you want to do and how it will serve others in your community. If you&#39;re not assisting others on the journey it&#39;ll be a tough road. </p>

<p>Shifting the paradigm is a unique path. It&#39;s not about &quot;me&quot; but about we. And not the &quot;we&quot; of reddit but the community in wich you live and participate in on a daily basis. </p>

<p>You sound younger than I and full of ambition. That&#39;s a good start indeed. </p>

<p>You should start looking into other reddit subs that offer ideas and advice on your personal goals. There&#39;s a ton of information to be gathered here on reddit. </p>

<p>I can answer your question from my personal perspective and works but I will not generalize on what everyone else is doing or can do for those people. </p>

<p>I am a member of a few international seed banks. I am a year round seed saver for these organizations. Many of wich share seeds and assist in teaching folks overseas how to grow organic sustainable foods on a larger scale using permaculture methods. Most of those permaculture methods are traditional indigenous concepts. </p>

<p>So let me ask you <a href="/u/ImprintMemory">/u/ImprintMemory</a>,  what are you doing that contributes to a positive change in today&#39;s world? </p>

<p>Sounds like you have a lot of natural resources that will serve you well on a path to success. Start checking out other subs. Start looking at what questions you have and match that up to what reddit might offer in specific info. </p>

<p>Just go to <a href="/r/gardening">/r/gardening</a> and look at their sidebar list of linked subs. From there keep searching others subs sidebars. You&#39;ll see there&#39;s a lot of communities on reddit with similar dreams and aspirations as well as older folks with knowledgeable info to share. There are a whole lot of younger folks too with tons of concepts, questions and information as well. It&#39;s truly the younger participants on reddit that inspire me a lot. </p>

<p>You really think the Italian Mafia was the last of the  &quot;mobsters&quot;? You really think they would off a president? No, that wasn&#39;t ever their MO in the US. The Italian Mob was absorbed by the real mobsters and those that didn&#39;t play ball were sent to Sing Sing.</p>

<p>Aerospace companies are quite low on that totem. I don&#39;t know why Bush would be considered to be a godfather. He&#39;s small potatoes from what I&#39;ve gathered. IE He doesn&#39;t hold any real strings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If/when it comes to that, they won&#39;t be able to just carpet bomb cities, as much as they&#39;d probably like to. An insurgency in the States would have to be put down with soldiers, not bombs (although surely some would be used). </p>

<p>Think about it, if you&#39;re the elite, do you want to be bombing cities and taking out skyscrapers to kill a handful of insurgents inside? Guess who owns that skyscraper? Someone who is in the elite. Guess who loses if all the infrastructure in America is destroyed? The elite. </p>

<p>In Iraq/Afghanistan, they only gave enough shits to make it at least seem like they cared about civilian deaths (they didn&#39;t, but had to keep that image for now). They didn&#39;t give 1 fuck about brown people&#39;s businesses, economy, or infrastructure. Here they give many fucks about what the country looks like after the insurgency has been put down. </p>

<p>This is why guns actually make some sense, and it&#39;s annoying to always hear &quot;oh if it comes to that your AR-15 isn&#39;t doing shit against the world&#39;s largest and most advanced military&quot;. First of all, there&#39;s about 0 chance that the military would be completely united in an extended insurgency. A lot of them would join the insurgency eventually. Secondly, as stated before, it&#39;s not like they can just level cities to win the war. The purpose of guns is to put up SOME resistance until the military begins to split ranks, then it&#39;s an all out civil war. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Get off the system. </p>

<p>Permaculture and the development of permaculture allows us to decrease demand for government. An Australian family can provide for all its needs at zero input costs after a minimal capital investment, and heavy initial labour investment with 500 hours of labour each year on just an acre of land. As targeted technology allows for the greater use of local resources as well as the decrease in labour, this will soon allow for a higher quality of life than the system provides with less investment than is currently required. </p>

<p>A child should be raised to be able to take care of themselves. When my son is 18, he will be able to feed himself, have a house and space paid for and have the skills to take care of his other basic needs from the land. He will also have time for a full-time job. </p>

<p>The less of your needs that you can fulfill, the greater the power the system has over you. Shelling out taxes to those who will use those taxes to ensure their ability to tax you is like giving money to folks who will &quot;protect your windows&quot; from being broken by them.</p>

<p>Thats the first think we need to deal with before we can do anything.
Stop identifying with or at least announcing a particular ideology.
We can learn more about our world and our ideas can change, the problem is if we are start looking at each other by our titles we start to realized how divided we really are. We need to start dialogs with what unifys us instead of what separates us.</p>
