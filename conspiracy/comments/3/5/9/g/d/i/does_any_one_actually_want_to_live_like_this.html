       I know I'm preaching to the choir here, but ever since I was a kid, I've been semi-bewildered by the modern lifestyle. Like, we get one brief chance to experience consciousness and
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       is how we're going to spend it? I get by, have friends, and wear business casual to work. But I just can't bring myself to care that much about the rat race or entertainment or settling down behind a white picket fence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not even a hippie or anything, but seriously,
       <em>
        why do we live like this?
       </em>
       Why don't we live closer to nature, in tight knit communities where we all know and care for one another? Why don't we emphasize love, freedom, connection, fun, and personal growth?
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess these questions are what initially led me down the rabbit hole and introduced me to the evil that runs our world today. But damn, we can create anything. Why not come up with, for lack of a better term, a cooler lifestyle?

       Because we decided we wanted to regard nature as "resources". A river isn't a being. It's a resource. It doesn't exist for its own purposes, it exists exclusively so humans can overfish it, poison it with waste and pesticide runoff, damn it up or irrigate or divert it and to destroy it. When our ancestors decided that they no longer wanted to regard nature as existing for its own reasons, and as beings just like us, it wasn't very long until they would regard each other as resources. So your company you work at no doubt has a personnel department, otherwise known as "human resources". Get that? Your boss thinks you're a resource to be exploited for your time and labor. Women are resources. Blacks should be rounded up and enslaved because they're resources. There was even a time when kids were resources to work in factories and sweatshops and chances are your business casual shirt and pants were made by children in China who are resources. A river is a being. "But a river is just something water runs through". Yes, and water runs through you too, what's your point? "But other organisms live in a river." And the bacteria that live in your stomach and help you digest your food will outlive you by many decades. You'll be dead and the organisms living inside you will still go on living and reproducing. "But rivers don't speak." Rivers don't speak to you? They don't communicate peace and beauty through their rushing waters and tranquil appearance? Is that not a form of communication?
      </p>
      <p>
       The natural world is alive and is the real world. The world of your home, car, and workplace are places of death. They are made of dead trees (wood), dead mountains (metal and stone), and dead animals (leather) who do not speak to you because they're dead. If you listen, the natural world speaks. You can have a relationship with it. And if we're lucky, humankind will one day return to our birthright as contributing members of an ecosystem rather than its dominators and exploiters.

       A river is controlled on both sides(left and right) by the "banks".

       That's not to say we can't consider them as resources to a certain point. The problem is the abuse or misusage, and lack of respect toward that which is keeping us alive in the first place.

       I agree with you nonetheless. You've got the right mindset, imo.

       I second this thought and ITT the notion"change yourself to change the world" predominates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though u/poptard_friend also asked, why we as a society live the way we live.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is of course a very subjective view, but maybe it contains some truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel, we live under some kind of spell. I think most of us want out of this spell, but we cant, because as soon as we are getting out, we are getting crushed by those, who are still under that spell.
      </p>
      <p>
       The spell is a spell of power and it implements the structure of a pyramid. It is making a pyramid out of our society of humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not being part of the pyramid of power means not using your power or your signs of power to subdue others. This shows others that you are not a perpetrator. So no one, no matter how deep down in the pyramid he is, has to fear you.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are not a perpetrator there is only one other role in the pyramid, that you can take: the victim. In the eyes of those still under the spell, someone who leaves the pyramid of power is a victim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe, if many people together would break out of this spell, that forms a pyramid of power and form a circle of collaboration, they would be harder to crush. Of course groups like this have been already forming in the past, but I am quite sure they have been monitored, sabotaged and disrupted so heavily, that they stopped growing or were divided.

       Insightful and well said. I believe it is more accurate to say we live under 'numerous' spells. In many cases 'competing' spells. Breaking out from under these spells is not easy, but disconnecting from mass media is a huge step in freeing yourself. You are correct the masses still spellbound will see you as victim (I never thought of it that way, thanks for the insight) crazy, or rebellious.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've been conditioned to be followers and dependents. So one must take back control of your life. Become a leader and independent. Then you can interact with fellow 'life' minded persons for mutual benefit.

       I have a dark secret for you. This question you're asking, it isn't about
       <em>
        us
       </em>
       it is about you. You can learn guitar, be a rockstar and tour the country. You can start your own website, get a new job. Forget why
       <em>
        we
       </em>
       live like this. What you
re really asking is "why do I live like this." You're not fulfilled. You're not happy. You're not living up to your expectations. You know that there is more to life than a white picket fence and business casual but you're not doing anything about it. So you live like this anyway. You don't have to, no one has a gun to your head. You're absolutely in charge of starship

       If that's true for him, then that's true for the rest of us; and we all know that's not true for everyone.

       What I mean is not everyone, unfortunately, has the opportunity to change their circumstances. They can certainly try, and I guess that's way better than doing nothing about it and complaining. But we must also realize that the world that we live in (the reality we've created and become accostumed to) is one where opportunities are, suprisingly, scarce. This is not meant to be an excuse, just something to take into account. IMO

       I read it like it was meant to shift the blame from the very real circumstances to the one suffering them, but you were really saying "nah you're the one suffering, so don't worry about everyone else's well-being and stop suffering from the very real circumstances"?
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it plausible that one's optimism stagnates from seeing all that wasted potential going down the drain, and reaches out for people feeling the same, instead of feathering his own nest and watch the world go down with a cold beer in his hand, spiritually speaking.

       I think in it's simplest form I was trying to talk about how everyone involved made the wrong choice. This includes a culture that decides to celebrate one particular right. I think everyone made a stupid wrong choice and the concept of personal responsibility was lost on everyone.

       I agree. The rabbit hole has shown me that we create
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       (even the dark and painful stuff) in our lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that people failing to take responsibility for themselves is the #1 reason the conspiracy (and government in general) exists. Many people subconsciously
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to be dominated and want parent type figures to look up to.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I meant my post more as an observation than anything else. You are correct that, especially with today's technology, we all have a ton of opportunity at our finger tips.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's empowering to remember that great shifts in consciousness are brought about by people just like us. If we can imagine a better world, then we should fight to bring it into existence.

       if i were to apply your question to the great unwashed masses I'd say the answer is simple: They are perfectly content with what they have. They can afford to see the latest block busters, buy the newest games and keep themselves sedated on liqour or OTC prescriptions. Isn't that what our forefathers were fighting for?

       I go back and forth on this. Yes a lot of people are happy to work and consume and aren't consciously suffering. Keeping the people fat and happy is, after all, an important part of any empire.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, this may be politically incorrect to say, but a lot of people are
       <em>
        slaves
       </em>
       . This needs to be talked about more, because it's fucked up.

       I don't think it'd be too hard to, for example, move to Nicaragua, buy some land, and form a little 20 person community. Live in oversized tents or simple cabinas. Have a big garden, raise chickens. Fish at the ocean. Maybe have a car or two. Play music. Help raise each others' kids. Marvel not at each others' possessions, but each others' skills.

       You might want to try some farming (not "gardening") and fishing and living in a tent for a while, before you commit.  There are reasons people like office jobs and houses and such.  Farming and fishing are HARD, unrelenting work.  You won't be playing a lot of music if you really have to depend on farming and fishing for sustenance.

       Hello there.Let me share my story.
My level of education along my lifetime was the best.I always ended up in the classes with the smartest kids in the school.Did 12 years of everything , then did another 4 years on biology , chemistry , physics , geography , maths and programming and did another 4 years of electronic engineering. 
But I was so dissapointed in the world that we live in that I wen`t into depression when I was about 17-18 years old  gain a lot of weight.Starting to lose touch with the outside world by playing games , online stuff , and enclosed and made my own world. Reason for that is that I did not like the idea : You get born , you grow up , going to school , getting a job , marry somebody and have kids. That just seem dull to me and I did not see a good social system at all.The "tribe" living model was long gone.I was giving up on life.
      </p>
      <p>
       But one day I said to me : What the hell ! Why do I LET THEM CONTROL OUR LIVES with all those commercials and all those processed foods that makes you lazy and shit. 
Started to have a healthy life.Eating fresh foods only  , running , biking , loosing weight steady and my way of thinking changed , I see things more clearly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think they want us to feel dull and not move our ass from the couch and start questioning.
Picture this : You wake in the morning , go to work , come back , and the only thing you want to do is lay down and enjoy an episode , or a movie or you just want to entertain yourself somehow . Weekend comes and you want to do stuff that you could not do in the working days like going out , having fun , fixing stuff around the house , doing stuff that you postponed due to work hours. 
Whats the problem here? You don`t have time to QUESTION NOTHING.

       That is the matrix that we try to shine the light on here. There are certain forces in society that have immense power over the human race, and they like having that power. By keeping the whole world focused on resource control and greed, they keep that control.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also an aspect of human nature to it, that makes it easy for them to keep us all in this artificial state. Most mammals are innately greedy. It's an evolutionarily [sic] created trait based on limited resources. We haven't evolved much from the hunter-gatherers we were 100,000 years ago. Sure we're a bit taller and maybe a little smarter, but we're still the same species that succeeded because it learned how to gain and hoard as many resources as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those in control know that all they need to do is keep resources limited, and we'll keep doing what we need to do to get the resources we need. And then we'll want MORE, because that's what we evolved to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Buddha's entire philosophy was to try and teach us another way, and there are many people who live that way. But it's not part of the Western Tradition.

       This has become the model for our generation and there's no easy escape from the societal pressures to be like this. Align your choices and relationships away from perpetuating this model of conformity if you're fed up. Only you can change your mindset.

       I want to live happy. The betterment of man kind is what exactly?

      <p>
       Too many problems will occur when you start giving stuff away. Without something to strive for people become lazy. Without rules there is chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a species we need to find a better way I agree. When humanity is ready the solution will present itself. The mentality within this sub is of anger. Pretty much impotent rage in all reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone wants to bitch about it and "bring awareness" to it. Lol want to get the attention you desperately want for you topic? Purpose a fail proof solution so others want have to work for the answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its about others wanting shit handed to them so they don't have to think. That's the problem today. Others act as if their life is more important the the betterment of mankind.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need a leader. Reason is so when it goes wrong we have someone to blame cause no one wants to make the shitty call. Honestly man I could give a fuck less about people right now. I have tried too many times to join a cause. Help with spreading info. Now I just keep to myself.

       Maybe this is your purpose in life. You should get into philosophy. Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle's main concern was living the "Just Life." They spent their entire lives trying to figure it out and wrote TOMES on it. In my opinion, Plato was smarter than 99.9% of the people on Earth today and he was living 2000 years before electricity was even discovered.

       Doesn't matter where you go. This entire reality is manufactured. Choose to do what makes you happy. "Reality is a creative process" we can have anything we want we just have to grab it. Take control of your life!!

       Thank goodness, I'm trying to manufacture a reality where the idiotic crap you just vomited out onto the keyboard under the guise of intelligentsia doesn't exist.  No luck so far unfortunately.  "Choose to do what makes you happy" is the most useless piece of advice ever uttered, the world is far more complicated than that.

       Spiritual Enlightenment will free you from all this. Even if you need to help things along via low dosing certain psychedelics, they will help open the heart/soul, third eye, flow, openness, you will remember prior to being born here because the memories are in your subconscious.

       A million different lifestyles are available to you.  "The evil that runs our world today" is a bit of a myth.  You can live in nature if you wish, but be prepared for sacrifices.  Farming is not easy.  There are reasons people like air-conditioning, refrigeration, cars, office jobs, etc.

       The world isn't "run" by any one thing, govt, economic system, etc.  It's a sea of competing and conflicting things.  You have a lot of freedom to choose your own path.

       Your money paper is not backed by anything, criminals can print the money you work your pathetic ass off for your whole entire life out of thin air. They are banning gun ammunition and guns slowly, your freedom is a mental illusion you people have, only works on the ignorant ;)

       Dollar is backed by confidence in USA's institutions, our economy, our stability.  Sure, we have many problems.  But we're still better than most other places in the world.  Investors around the world signal their confidence by being willing to invest in our govt debt at extremely low interest rates.  People around the world hold US dollars as safest way to preserve wealth.  People around the world still want to immigrate to the USA.

       I worked for 20 years and saved my money, then quit and went to live on a sailboat for 14 years and counting (see
       <a href="http://www.billdietrich.me/RetireSailboat.html">
        http://www.billdietrich.me/RetireSailboat.html

       ).  You can live pretty cheaply on a boat.  Now I'm planning to move to Spain for a while (see
       <a href="http://www.billdietrich.me/MovingToSpain.html">
        http://www.billdietrich.me/MovingToSpain.html

       ).  It CAN be done.

       I think banning guns (which isn't really happening) would be a GOOD thing.  I don't think people, including myself, should have the "freedom" or power to kill someone else in a fit of anger.  I think we should ban private ownership of guns of all types, maybe except shotguns for home defense (if we can't get a total ban). We're always going to have the crazy, and near-crazy, and fighting drunks, and druggies, and road-ragers, and wacky teenagers, and anger-management problems, and criminals, loose on our streets. Sure, we should try to identify and treat or limit them.  But why have society flooded with guns so these people can cause maximum damage ?

       For "confidence" you could substitute "trust" or "faith".
