        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I seriously question how I could ever MORALLY justify having children if I do not think it is likely they will have a good life. I don&#39;t care to elaborate, but I have reason to believe the next few decades will not be particularly easy for humanity. Couple this with the fact that there are 7 billion humans living on a planet made to hold less than a tenth of that, and the &quot;miracle&quot; of creating life seems to be boiled down to &quot;making the problem of overpopulation worse, further denigrating the quality of life of every other child and adult human&quot;. All this to give birth to a child that will be brainwashed from a young age, and has a high likelihood of dieing of unnatural causes(war, disease, famine). The pain of growing up in a society like this is actually worse when you realize what is going on. My children would be black sheep. Like me. If everybody seriously contemplated this issue, and actually thought before popping out little oxygen sucking, natural resource consuming, planet crowding &quot;miracles&quot;, maybe we wouldn&#39;t be in the predicament we&#39;re in Reddit. I&#39;m curious. Does this honestly cross your minds? I impregnated a girl when I was younger and it didn&#39;t cross my mind once. Only recently have I discovered this burden.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is the same attitude that inspires racists, jingoists, evangelists, etc. to produce more kids... &quot;Somebody&#39;s gotta save this rotten world!&quot;</p>

<p>If you do this as a parent, you are trying to create a bundle-of-meat-and-brains that will have the ability and inclination to fight for the things/changes that <em>you</em> want from this world. Without asking them first.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a terrible reason to have a child.</p>

<p>You wanna fight for something? Do it yourself. You wanna convince other people to fight on your side? I&#39;m right there with you, let&#39;s shed some light, work the channels of communication, and enlist thousands or millions to do it with us.</p>

<p>You wanna create a new person so you can try to enlist them in this without <em>them</em> ever getting a chance to choose?? <strong>Selfish!</strong></p>

<p>You might have a kid who wants to be a regular US army general. Or a Wall Street banker. Or maybe just hates fighting and you&#39;d bring him/her into a tortuous life.</p>

<p>Have we not seen enough unhappiness, in our own culture and among our friends, due to parents applying too much pressure to kids to be some way, reach some goal, earn more, marry someone the parents approve of, be a doctor or a lawyer or a scientist, go to church, be &quot;good&quot;.</p>

<p>We all know people who got fucked up by their parents trying to live vicariously through them, and having a kid that you have expectations of fightin&#39; Tha Man, or revolting against the gov&#39;t is no different.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>So what! If what you say is true, then racists, jingoists, evangelists, etc (pretty inclusive &quot;etc.&quot;) will have a fitness advantage against those trying to maintain some sense of moral purity by not &quot;brainwashing&quot; their children. </p>

<p>There are ways to inculcate moral values that are not coercive, for instance, developing and displaying your character in the world. There are few things that FORCE the issue of character like having a family and children. You know all those sacrifices your parents made for you that have demonstrated the values that you probably hold dear? They probably wouldn&#39;t have happened without you to bring that aspect out of your parents&#39; characters. Left to our own devices, we rarely put ourselves into positions that require that we define ourselves against the world. As such, many have nothing but air (language) to signify their moral/ethical position.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>And I know vastly more people that happily adopt the positions of their parents as a consequence of seeing their parents decisions in action. At 32, the past decade has been a reflection on how bizarrely correct my parents actions have been. This is not due to a strict disciplinarian upbringing, far from it. It is a realization that I am a reflexive individual and that my parents&#39; actions have shaped me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately that is the problem.  That&#39;s the same thought process 99% of humans have(it&#39;s engineered into us pretty hard).  It&#39;s great in theory, but elitism doesn&#39;t work if everybody does it.  Everybody is making kids to grow up and fight other people&#39;s kids.  I&#39;d love to have kids.  And consume tons of resources, because I&#39;m awesome, and my genetics are awesome, and i&#39;m an awesome father, who would teach them awesome things so they would be awesome people(WAYYY better than your kids, and way better at fighting evil).  But it just seems a little too transparent for me.  It&#39;s selfish goals that make children.  Selfish because you consider them a part of you.  You want them(by extension you) to have more(and thus everybody else less).  It&#39;s fine when resources are plentiful(and was helpful through 99% of humanity), but not so much now, because a wise man once said &quot;I looked at my kingdom I was finally there To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can not morally agree with having children in the current state of the world.</p>

<p>It is only a matter of time untill we as a species have bleed the world die. We are spewing pollution in the air, and cutting down the forests that filter it.</p>

<p>We as a species have the fundamental problem of not looking at the future. We rely so heavily on oil that we drill in places like deep seas where when something goes wrong we cant even fix it. No matter how much oil gets poured into the ocean, no one is going to change. It will spark an ecological debate for awhile until it all blows over.</p>

<p>Same with nuclear power plants, relying so heavily on something that has the potential for such devistaton. Chernobyl should have been a wake up call, but no we didnt change, now we have fukushima filling up our oceans with radiation.</p>

<p>Climate change is a huge problem, but they took the issue and monetized it like everything else greedy people do. &quot;Use these light bulbs to save the environment&quot; &quot;buy these carbon offsets so we can keep polluting.&quot;</p>

<p>We are destroying our home. The one place in the entire universe we can call ours, and yet we use the excuse &quot;Well we will probably be on another planet when this one kicks the bucket&quot; like the same thing isn&#39;t going to happen on that one.</p>

<p>When earth finally takes its last breath its not going to be just the human race that is extinct, it will be the extinction of the trillions of life forms that call this planet home. And for what? So that we can sit on our asses and rot our minds infront of tv, after we get home from the jobs that make this fucked up system run. That is unacceptable.</p>

<p>Maybe it won&#39;t change your mind, but people reading the thread may come to a different conclusion than they otherwise would have.

<p>It isn&#39;t a moot point, it reflects a significant change in the lives of everybody that knows your brother&#39;s wife, your brother, you, now me, and on and on and on. This is how every life becomes sacred. It echoes and ripples across lives it isn&#39;t even aware of! </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And this isn&#39;t anti-life, I&#39;m not encouraging murder.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is an anti-life argument because it concludes that some lives are worth living, and others are not. Please don&#39;t get me wrong. There are many reasons to not have children. Your brother and his wife are entirely justified in their decision no matter what that decision is. But to claim that the decision is based on accurate reasoning is faulty. </p>

<p>All lives are difficult and there will always be circumstances that can overwhelm even the hardiest creatures. That method of determination applies to literally every child that has ever been born. This is what I mean &quot;based on faulty reasoning.&quot; </p>

<p>Why is arguing on the internet useless, but fighting in a ring noble? Doesn&#39;t internet debate encourage consideration of alternate points of view? Can&#39;t it encourage research skills? Rhetoric? The ability to cogently and persuasively present an argument? </p>

<p>You&#39;re right, it is useless, but that is exactly what I am indicating. Strength, dedication, intelligence, their physical manifestations, all of that, temporal qualities that do not reflect the character of the individual presenting them.

    <div class="md"><p>Right, because I just hang my dedication off my chest on a chain. Dedication is most definitely not a temporal quality. Strength is a part of character, so is intelligence, and dedication. When strength training, you need discipline and commitment.  When studying, you need much of the same. These characteristics aren&#39;t only manifested on the outside. Develop them, and you&#39;ll know what I mean</p>

<p>Do you think you&#39;ll be able to be as dedicated to any endeavor as you are now when you are elderly? The same goes for intelligence and strength. That is transient. That is temporal. If you hang your hat on that post, your hat will be gone before you leave the room.  </p>

<p>People in this thread manage to simultaneously overestimate and underestimate the power of parenthood in shaping a mind. Your children will be individuals. They will have a subjective view of the world entirely created by them. Within their subjective view, you, as a parent, will have a privileged position. They will judge the character of their interactions against your character. You become the measure. </p>

<p>That is all the influence you actually have. Its direct power is minimal. You can&#39;t force your kid to be a soldier, or a lawyer, or doctor, or whatever. It won&#39;t work. Child will rebel, or, if he/she attempts to live up to your projection, will feel inadequate. Its subtle power is vast! If you show real character you provide an example that will echo through your child&#39;s entire life.</p>

That so many &quot;awakened&quot; people think the answer is to arrest their lineage is a clear indication of a forced narrative of helplessness.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, exactly.  They gave us life before they lost theirs, so we owe them at least that much. I feel duty bound to raise my son in a better place than I was, and if I fail, my hope is that my son can do a better job for his children someday.

<p>Even though I accept a debt to my ancestors, they do not define me. If they have been successful in putting my existence in place, they have done all they need for me to continue the thread. There are many that are poor or powerless that are not fools or quitters. Karma (interpreted as effect of action) oftentimes determines the backdrop into which we are thrust, but cannot speak of the character of the individuals that caused that karma. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. One caveat though, defining success for the future is difficult. At present, the best I can come up with is providing a platform that offers the greatest number of options for my child. In order to allow my child to use the freedom I am trying to secure for him/her, I cannot a priori define any choice as success or failure. </p>

<p>I think that is why traditional society saw the birth of grandchildren as success. Whatever choices your child makes are for him/her alone. Success is represented by those choices leading to continuation.</p>

<p>A perfect example of inverted &quot;morality&quot;. Existence is greater than non-existence is why. The fact that you have continued your existence to this point indicates you accept the same. Actors on the stage make the play. </p>

<p>Why does the development of experience and character get bemoaned so much? You will experience people you love dying, fact. You will experience injustice, infirmity, dark days, oppression, fact. You will grow and develop even in the most sickening environment, fact. </p>

<p>It sounds like you accept some sort of spiritual experience. Why would you limit the type of experiences that get replicated to the beyond? Doesn&#39;t that invalidate the experience itself? Isn&#39;t that a damning indictment to all the souls that have come before, but due to decision or circumstance, were unable to live the ideal/pure life that you think is worthy?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Existence is greater than non-existence is why.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A hypothetical being who never experienced the realities and inevitable heartaches of existence shouldn&#39;t be created from a sperm and egg because &quot;existence is&quot; supposedly &quot;greater than non-existence.  By the way, I want to ask why you believe that.  </p>

<p>Once a human being is an actual entity in the physical realm, their life on earth is all most of them believe to be a guaranteed reality for themselves.  Some believe the spirit, or awareness, continues after death, but the connection to the earthly realm is <em>instinctually</em> strong. That arises from a basic part of ourselves. What might make existence on earth worth staying for is relations with people we love. For others who don&#39;t believe anything exists beyond death, there&#39;s a fear of nothingness.  If nothingness is the primal state, why not let well enough stay as it is?  Why create life when suffering is part of it, and for many it&#39;s going to outweigh the good parts.  I didn&#39;t want to ever take that gamble.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why does the development of experience and character get bemoaned so much?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those are worthwhile acheivements, but it&#39;s reckless and naive to bring life into this world with the idea a kid will attain them, or reach their potential given their talents and abilities, and you might have kids born with not much to work with. This has always been true, because arbitrary factors affect a person&#39;s life that might make self-actualization impossible, but now things are worse than I&#39;ve ever seen in my lifetime.  The world isn&#39;t at all a healthy place with a better future.   It&#39;s apparent many reckless breeders probably don&#39;t have the intellect and forsight to consider their kids&#39; &quot;development of experience and character&quot;, and no idea what TPTB intend for humankind.  Many don&#39;t have the ability to do the simple arithmetic required to realize they can&#39;t afford to have kids, and don&#39;t have any foresight to see what parenting is going to require if they&#39;re going to do a good job of it.  IMHO it means putting your kids wellbeing before anything, and all of our wellbeings are now very much at risk everywhere.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t limit our spiritual experiences to replication to the beyond, and I didn&#39;t say that.  My beliefs are more complicated than that and I don&#39;t want to take time to explain them.  I think we are spirit caught in the physical realm and try our best, and if our intentions are good we can&#39;t always be blamed for bad things that happen.  I don&#39;t remember saying anything about an ideal or pure life.  I intended to say there&#39;s so much trouble on earth-which is only going to get worse-that it&#39;s a bad idea to have kids.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing pathological about comparing the rose colored world of an infant and young child with the shitty reality he or she is going to eventually find themselves in.  The only thing pathological I can see happening is if someone grows and yet manages to keep seeing the world in a rosy haze.</p>

After I met my boyfriend a few years ago (who also suffered from some of the same things) he convinced me that we could be okay and I actually got excited about having children (he&#39;d wanted children for a long time) and I just knew that I would raise them to be free thinkers, not believe all the hype in the media, teach them the &quot;underground&quot; information that mainstream media twists (basically refuse to let them be pawns of the establishment). </p>

<p>After my boyfriend&#39;s death earlier this year I completely shut down the idea of kids, mostly because I could only see myself having a child with him, and partially because I know that the world is only going to get worse and unfortunately I don&#39;t see enough informed people, or people who will actually stand up and try to change it. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Existence is greater than non-existence is why.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A hypothetical being who never experienced the realities and inevitable heartaches of existence shouldn&#39;t be created from a sperm and egg because &quot;existence is&quot; supposedly &quot;greater than non-existence.  By the way, I want to ask why you believe that.  </p>

<p>Once a human being is an actual entity in the physical realm, their life on earth is all most of them believe to be a guaranteed reality for themselves.  Some believe the spirit, or awareness, continues after death, but the connection to the earthly realm is <em>instinctually</em> strong. That arises from a basic part of ourselves. What might make existence on earth worth staying for is relations with people we love. For others who don&#39;t believe anything exists beyond death, there&#39;s a fear of nothingness.  If nothingness is the primal state, why not let well enough stay as it is?  Why create life when suffering is part of it, and for many it&#39;s going to outweigh the good parts.  I didn&#39;t want to ever take that gamble.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why does the development of experience and character get bemoaned so much?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those are worthwhile acheivements, but it&#39;s reckless and naive to bring life into this world with the idea a kid will attain them, or reach their potential given their talents and abilities, and you might have kids born with not much to work with. This has always been true, because arbitrary factors affect a person&#39;s life that might make self-actualization impossible, but now things are worse than I&#39;ve ever seen in my lifetime.  The world isn&#39;t at all a healthy place with a better future.   It&#39;s apparent many reckless breeders probably don&#39;t have the intellect and forsight to consider their kids&#39; &quot;development of experience and character&quot;, and no idea what TPTB intend for humankind.  Many don&#39;t have the ability to do the simple arithmetic required to realize they can&#39;t afford to have kids, and don&#39;t have any foresight to see what parenting is going to require if they&#39;re going to do a good job of it.  IMHO it means putting your kids wellbeing before anything, and all of our wellbeings are now very much at risk everywhere.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t limit our spiritual experiences to replication to the beyond, and I didn&#39;t say that.  My beliefs are more complicated than that and I don&#39;t want to take time to explain them.  I think we are spirit caught in the physical realm and try our best, and if our intentions are good we can&#39;t always be blamed for bad things that happen.  I don&#39;t remember saying anything about an ideal or pure life.  I intended to say there&#39;s so much trouble on earth-which is only going to get worse-that it&#39;s a bad idea to have kids.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing pathological about comparing the rose colored world of an infant and young child with the shitty reality he or she is going to eventually find themselves in.  The only thing pathological I can see happening is if someone grows and yet manages to keep seeing the world in a rosy haze.</p>
