<p>Most notably: Sandy Hook, Geo-engineering, Monsanto, 9/11, Jade Helm 15 and many other topics are constantly under attack by obvious shills. There was even a post ( <a href="http://www.insanemedia.net/forum-shill-gets-busted-ats-and-glp-censor-n-7015a/2924">http://www.insanemedia.net/forum-shill-gets-busted-ats-and-glp-censor-n-7015a/2924</a> ) about how a government shill from a branch of the CIA was caught, with proof, shilling in a Sandy Hook thread. Why would the CIA waste time and money on shilling in Sandy Hook posts if it happened exactly as the media told us?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you aren&#39;t a regular user and haven&#39;t seen it with your own eyes (hang out here long enough and you can see monsanto shills in action pretty often), go to an anti-monsanto thread, find a commenter that ignores the topic and just posts a condescending comment trying to debunk the OP while ignoring all aspects of the post, and then look that user on a site like Redective.com or  snoopsnoo. If all their top keywords are &quot;monsanto&quot; &quot;conspiracy&quot; and their comment history seems normal until a certain point after which the only post pro-monsanto comments, then they are most likely a shill. Of course, it doesn&#39;t 100% confirm it but it shows a shady side to certain posters. </p>

<p>Take the user <a href="/u/adamwho">/u/adamwho</a> in this thread for example and look at the comments under his post: <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/350c5s/does_the_presence_of_shills_confirm_the_existence/">http://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/350c5s/does_the_presence_of_shills_confirm_the_existence/</a></p>

<p>^ He might not be a &quot;paid shill&quot;, but is a shill in the sense that he avidly defends Monsanto or GMOs or whatever in a way that ultimately takes away from discussion and imposes a condescending tone on the OP of the thread.</p>

<p>Lastly, don&#39;t know why I wasted time on this. Regular, non-shady users of this sub can physically see with their own eyes when shills are active so it seems strange when people are so baffled at the concept of shills...</p>

<p>In response to the OP, many times a shill becomes involved in something to distract anything else of import.  Thus they are not always confirming your suspicions because they are not always glomming onto important topics.  Sometimes they simply wish to provoke arguments.</p>

<p>also, even if an actual &quot;shill&quot; (which I believe are much much smaller numbers than you would believe based on the number of times someone is labeled as such here on reddit) why does it actually matter if they present a backed up counter argument or ask for better factual evidence?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have wondered the same op. Here is what I think. First of all when people mention ufo sightings anymore it really isn&#39;t met with much skeptisim.</p>

<p>I think that is cause for a few reasons. One being that its hard to deny that we are alone in the universe anymore. There really isn&#39;t much on either side of the argument except that our presence in it isn&#39;t the only one.</p>

<p>Then some other topics like lizard people. I mean come on this is really really far out there even to me. I will admit I dismiss it completely when someone brings it up. It just isn&#39;t possible.</p>

<p>Then you have hot button topics like the ones you mentioned. Lets look at that. What exactly would one need to do in order to control the world?</p>

<p>What do we as humanity need to survive as a species?</p>

<p>Food, water, shelter.</p>

<p>Ok so Monsanto has the food thing pretty much under control. We can&#39;t argue with it because of what we do know for sure imagine what we don&#39;t. </p>

<p>Now for water. This is the most important really. As we have less and less of this now. Hell even today there are places without access to clean drinking water. Its going to be a big problem here very soon and everyone is focused on the now. What people need to do is look 10 years in the future when picking a cause to join.</p>

<p>Then you have shelter which is eaiser to come by, but I forgot to mention air to breathe. That is becoming a major problem as well lately. </p>

<p>You have things like this shooting of a dog that takes precedence in the sub because FUCK THE POLICE!</p>

<p>I mean really it was a dog. Sorry if I don&#39;t feel as strongly about it as others but I really don&#39;t see a reason to care. Its a lost cause to myself to even persue the case. Sure it looks like he is guilty, but really is anything going to happen? No it will happen again hell probably already has. </p>

<p>Should it stop hell yeah. We need to focus on the shit that is important to worldly matters like the tpp or even more so the bullshit around these walmarts closing. I was on the fence about it but upon closer inspection it makes less and less sence.</p>

<p>These are the things that should be not only discussed but acted upon.</p>

<p>The riots were just kids acting stupid. They are beyond the point of reasoning with them now. They feel as if they won&#39;t be heard or taken seriously so they did what they did. Now there isn&#39;t just racism towards black people in the usa. Its happening to whites as well.</p>

<p>The so called shills are not trying to steer the convo away from the things you mentioned as much as they are trying to sway it to something else they want support on for the ones that pay them. Its all about public view. Make your mind up and stick to it. </p>

<p>That isn&#39;t to say you could be wrong cause I have been many many times and I will admit it when I am. Just don&#39;t let your attention wavier when talking to others on here. They will show you something else shiney to take your attention away from whatever else.</p>

<p>My point is the shot dog story. Why isn&#39;t anything about the police conduct issues being raised to top page lately? Or the TPP, or whatever else. </p>

<p>The dog story is a lost cause. NOTHING will happen. Even if it does what will change? One police station? Whats the point of that? </p>

<p>That is quite normal. It&#39;s unfortunate. There are real people here, though. Just ignore the trash. I thought the main idea of your post was extremely easy to understand. I do see at least one ignorant skeptic in here who didn&#39;t even know shills were real. Perhaps you could avoid people like that by simply providing some information about shills, which has been thoroughly covered in various mainstream outlets. </p>

<p>Why would i want a circlejerk about the existence of shills? I specifically DIDN&#39;T want to discuss whether they are real or not (if you read the OP you would have figured out that isn&#39;t the point of the thread) as there have been a bunch of links with proof of shills posted already by myself and others in this thread.</p>

<p>Read the whole OP, then read all the comments I posted, specifically the one about how I don&#39;t care if you disagree with me, I care if you&#39;re an arrogant, condescending, derailing poster who doesn&#39;t even seem like they read the OP.</p>

<p>The accusation that that user is a shill is for this reason, not because they disagreed with me. Try another talking point :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are definitely a few shills in this subreddit that get here through keyword searches. I&#39;ve noticed the trolls and dissenters (when i say dissenters I don&#39;t mean people that have an opposing viewpoint. I mean people who say things like &quot;no that&#39;s retarded not everything is a conspiracy&quot; or people who nitpick at one point and miss the whole point of the original post, instead of people who can still entertain an idea and express an opposing view without being condescending). When the subreddit seems like it had a collective age of 30 and then suddenly seems to feel like it is occupied by a bunch of teenagers it seems strange to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know the people you mean - and don&#39;t have much time for those who reject something without looking into it, and more than those who accept something due to confirmation bias. But I wonder if this may perhaps be more to do with a post getting outside <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>? Certainly, when a post hits the front page of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, etc. that exposes it to a host of new eyes, who tend to have a very different approach and tone in their comments from regulars here.</p>

<p>This is true. The problem is not people with dissenting views coming in and commenting when it hits frontpage of r/all.</p>

<p>The problem is the same people (I RES tag people that are simply blatant) constantly brigading the /new section, and will gang up on posts that have keywords, depending on who their employer is.</p>

<p>I specifically tag people that focus heavily on one topic, such as just GMOS, or just vaccines etc. And I don&#39;t mean people that will try to argue about it or are interested about this topic or that. I mean people that ONLY come into <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> with the intent to support the &quot;official story&quot; or &quot;status quo opinions&quot; etc. etc.</p>

<p>The HUGE majority of regular users looking at /new posts are going to have a variety of interests/posts etc. They will believe one thing such as 9/11, and disagree with something else, such as moon landings.</p>

<p>Shills typically only focus on one or two issues, and if they have ANY resemblance to regular users, it is only on them commenting on cops, the usual &quot;police are out of control&quot; opinion. </p>

<p>Users that only come in to defend monsanto/government etc. and do nothing else in r/conspiracy are the ones I&#39;m talking about. </p>

<p>Actually, I&#39;m stating the exact opposite. TIL and worldnews are far <strong>more</strong> likely to be gamed, because they cross so many more eyeballs.

<p>And you would be correct. TIL and the larger subreddits actually have more people assigned to them than r/conspiracy. But that does not mean there is not a significant squad assigned here as well, for obvious reasons. </p>
