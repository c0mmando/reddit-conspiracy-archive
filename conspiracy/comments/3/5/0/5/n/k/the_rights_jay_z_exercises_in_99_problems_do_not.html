And here are the lyrics where he talks about &#39;knowing his rights&#39;. 
Rights that don&#39;t exist for any of us anymore:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The year is &#39;94, in my trunk is raw
In my rearview mirror is the motherfucking law
Got two choices y&#39;all, pull over the car or
Bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor
And I ain&#39;t tryna see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case
So I, pull over to the side of the road, I heard
&quot;Son do you know why I&#39;m stopping you for?&quot;
Cause I&#39;m young and I&#39;m black and my hat&#39;s real low
Do I look like a mind reader sir, I don&#39;t know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some more?
&quot;Well you was doing fifty-five in a fifty-four
License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carrying a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are&quot;
<strong>I ain&#39;t stepping out of shit, all my paper&#39;s legit</strong>
&quot;Well, do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?&quot;
<strong>Well, my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights, so you gon&#39; need a warrant for that</strong>
&quot;Aren&#39;t you sharp as a tack
You some type of lawyer or something
Somebody important or something&quot;
<strong>Well, I ain&#39;t passed the bar but I know a little bit
Enough that you won&#39;t illegally search my shit</strong>
&quot;Well we&#39;ll see how smart you are when the K9 come&quot;
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain&#39;t one, hit me </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously! You can and should stand up for yourself. Most cops are just trying to get through their shift. They&#39;ll back down if you remain firm and confident. I happen to think general politeness is useful as well, but all these slaves griping about how bad cops are probably aren&#39;t getting out enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You say this but it does not take a majority of interactions to give a bad impression to people.  If 1 in 5 pizzas you got were rotten and an additional 1 in 5 just incorrect that&#39;s all in all 80% good pizzas but you&#39;d have some impression that something is going on with pizza. </p>

<p>For work I drive 40-50k miles a year and often at night.  The police in many towns are nice,  they might run your plate and move on,  most often they sit and monitor traffic if nothing more pressing is happening. </p>

<p>I&#39;m in Massachusetts and our state police are all but militarized.   They don&#39;t just patrol highways they patrol areas that have existing local police forces essentially because they have an unlimited budget.   I&#39;ve been pulled over for no reason with a random excuse alot,  it seems to be part of their organizations culture, random stop and checks especially at night because you know we must have a curfew or something.   I&#39;ve been very compliant because if you aren&#39;t they can essentially say anything.   They start often by insulting you,  knowing you can&#39;t insult back.   I&#39;ve had everything from telling me my wallet is shitty and him pulling out an open money clip full of 50s to compare,  to being told keeping my distance from parked cars (which I wasn&#39;t doing more than usual) will startle drunk drivers and cause accidents.  Just strange shit and lots of random critique and degrading comments or outright fabrications about my driving conduct going so far as being told he didn&#39;t want to see me driving there again after he wasn&#39;t able to find anything wrong with me or my vehicle to justify the stop.  This is just in the last couple years.   I&#39;m a white male,  early 30s, I dress business casual to work and my vehicles aren&#39;t modified or in disrepair.  Instead of accepting there is nothing to see the police- again mostly state police in my area farm revenue and perform random stops.  If you drive only say 10k miles a year its one thing , drive 5x that and it gets tricky.  </p>

<p>I know you can read this and think there must be more to it,  I must be DOING something.   A year ago I was pulled over legitimately for speeding on a local highway,  an officer pulled 3 cars over at once and lined us up,  we were all traveling together and I wasn&#39;t watching my speed so it was justified.  He came to the passenger side (not usual for safety on a highway stop ) smacking loudly on chewing gum and almost screaming for the registration,  when I opened my glove box he grabbed everything out of it,  my cars manual fell on the ground outside, he told me pick it up after but stay in the car til then,  he took the registration and threw the rest of the papers and maintenance receipts onto the passenger side floor missing the glove box , asked for my license and went back to his cruiser, threw them in I guess and went for the next guys documents.  A few minutes later he comes back and we literally have the&quot; would you jump off a bridge if they did&quot; conversation , I had acknowledged I wasnt watching my speedo and was going with traffic, he throws a ticket at me,  tells me if I appeal I&#39;ll lose , suddenly changes his tone saying slow down and get where you&#39;re going safely and walks away.  I was the last car there and he had shut off his lights and prepared to pull away,  at this point I get out and walk around the front of my car to get my cars manual which is trampled... he pulled up next to me with his lights on and seemingly accused me of trying to dispose of something,  I showed him what I was doing and he says something about &quot;pick up your fucking shit&quot; and floored .</p>

<p>Sadly, this isn&#39;t nearly the worst I&#39;ve dealt with but it&#39;s the only time in a decade I was actually doing what I was accused of.</p>

<p>This is a huge rant... but just figured I&#39;d speak up.</p>

<p>And I get out plenty so it&#39;s not just my armchair bandwagon opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what. Everything you&#39;ve said applies to me as well. Stand up for yourself. I do. I get tickets. I have to go to court. I get my car made fun of. So what. You&#39;re not likely to get shot. Your compliance is in large measure your issue. Once you start pushing back you become too much trouble to deal with. Be confident, firm, and polite. Know your rights, record your interactions, and file harassment claims if it gets bad enough. But stop being a slave about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re making alot of assumptions about me and you&#39;re wrong. I told you I&#39;ve been accused of doing things I havent. I have been compliant during stops not admitting fault where there is none. Never argue with a state cop he&#39;ll take it out on you on the spot.   I never said anything about being shot by the police, I&#39;m talking about civil bullying like pulling you over because they can , and if you drive 10k a year and get one ticket every 20k you will keep your license... if I do I could lose my livelihood. When I receive a ticket which is rare I fight it.  If I didn&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t have a license or at least my insurance would be insane.  My issue is with the police organization not the system or the rights I&#39;m supposed to have... when you&#39;re alone on a dead silent road at night with the officer and he&#39;s already suspicious of you because of the time of day and the fact that you&#39;re headed from a city the ball is not in your court to act belligerent.</p>

<p>So please get over yourself I&#39;m sure you are very firm with the police but explain how that would have helped me in the events I&#39;ve described. When would I have stood up for myself big man? Tell him to spit out his gum? Tell him fuck you pick up my manual or I&#39;m getting out of the car?   Or what would I have said in retort to his cursing about my shit before speeding off, when he was already gone?  Or are you saying I should stand up for myself by not pulling over?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a doormat , I&#39;m not bitchin about them not being nice to me I&#39;m saying first of all I shouldn&#39;t be pulled over for no reason.  I&#39;ve been driving this much my whole adult life sa field Engineer,   and it&#39;s gotten steadily worse since is began and I used to drive much more suspicious cars... I&#39;m still followed or pulled over more often now.  It&#39;s not daily but I see it enough that I have the right to mention it without being dismissed, you&#39;re the one being submissive by refusing to acknowledge there is any actual issue and that it must be the fault of citizens for being too compliant? ?? Explain how that&#39;s a good outlook please.  </p>

<p>Sorry if my wish to drive for work without the idea in the back of my mind that I could do nothing wrong but be accused or even ticketed for it... nobody wants to spend their morning in the courthouse fighting a bs ticket.  I have other stories but this isn&#39;t a blog.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry for sounding like a dick to you I&#39;m not lashing out at you but really I&#39;m not pulling this out of my ass, I&#39;m not anti law enforcement.</p>

<p>On the flipside the police in my town are awesome, I&#39;ve never seen them pull anyone over for no reason but we are talking about a small force and a few part timers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uggg! Another screed. You could have just copy/pasted your previous response, no need to rehash the whole scenario. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m sure you are very firm with the police but explain how that would have helped me in the events I&#39;ve described</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, after 15-30 minutes of fucking with you, they&#39;ll leave. If you do it, then the next guy does it, then the next guy does it, they&#39;ll stop. Its schoolyard bullies all over again, and it seems like you failed to learn the lesson the first time through. </p>

<p>You stand up for yourself against bullies, not to prevent being bullied, but because by standing up for yourself you contribute to an environment in which it is difficult to be a bully. You fail to see that because, apparently, its all about you. You couldn&#39;t even read my response from the point of view of someone else reading the thread in order to develop an idea of consensus. Nope, it was an attack against you that required a page of text to indicate how in the right you are to grovel. Fine, you&#39;re right to grovel. You should probably grovel harder. Have you considered handing out sloppy blowies to every cop that stops you? I think they like it when your eyes tear up, so go deep.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you&#39;re the one being submissive by refusing to acknowledge there is any actual issue </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except of course that I indicated that all that happens to me. Guess how I spent monday morning, in court! Guess who got his case dismissed, me! Guess how I did it, by being &quot;firm, confident and courteous.&quot; If you&#39;re getting harassed, record your interactions and submit complaints. Create a history, hire a lawyer, and pursue civil and criminal penalties against the aggressors. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t care your intent. I don&#39;t care if what you&#39;ve described &quot;actually happened&quot;. You should be anti-law enforcement. They&#39;re harassing you. Did you laugh at your bully&#39;s jokes as he shook you down for your lunch money? Are you not anti-asshole? More groveling. </p>

<p>So rather than just state that you think you&#39;re my better, you slide in a passive aggressive knock at my perceived character. That&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m talking about. That&#39;s what makes you a slave. Have some confidence about your position, at least. Are you afraid that I&#39;ll retort? I will, but so what. If you think you&#39;re superior in some quality, state it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok I am inclined to believe you embellished some of that. Not all thou. </p>

<p>I drive quite a bit for my job, and have been to MA a few times. I have now refused to go to Boston airport to do the inspections for the deicers there for the reason of the Mass port have the security.</p>

<p>Last year when I was there I didn&#39;t take their shit. He wanted to be a dick sooooo I proved I was a bigger one. </p>

<p>I am a smoker... So what my choice. Well I smoke in my vehicle. I always roll down the windows so the smell isn&#39;t that bad. Well when I get to the gate masshole cop says.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you got any of those Marlboro air fresheners for my car too?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I said</p>

<blockquote>
<p>do you happen to have any more of that I am a dickheaded cop who thinks they can say whatever cause I have a gun citizen classes I can take?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He got pissed cause I said this in front of a female officer. Lol he used his only defence saying there is a lady present. You had better apologize. </p>

<p>I looked at him with the most puzzled look and said no. Just a monotone no.</p>

<p>He went to grab me and I said.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you think about the family you have at home and how they depepend on your income. There is anyone able to be a cop in this state. But only one of me on the east coast. Now since you are a dick I am going to make you tell me you are sorry then I am going to make you get reassigned. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I called my point of contact and explained the situation and how I felt retribution would surely happen if this officer was to stay at this location. I went further to say that it would be a great exercise in humility for the others here that saw the incident if he was placed somewhere else that had less interaction with people because he was obviously inept to deal with contact unless he could be forceful.</p>

<p>The airline agreed. Within moments his supervisor was there and ordered him to apologize to me in front of everyone. I looked him in the eyes and said.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you fucked with the wrong mother fucker today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is how you deal with assholes. You make sure you have an ace up your sleeve. All cops are like roaches they scurry away when the light is on them. </p>

<p>Shine the spotlight of shame by any means you can. It works. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t fail at shit, you have to realize he will be a dick, leave your window and wall back with a ticket for whatever he decides to.  You can&#39;t argue it once it&#39;s written up.  Your place to stand up is your hearing if you try to argue on the side of the road he&#39;s going to call you a street lawyer and write you a ticket.  If he makes an accusation which is incorrect and actually gives me a chance I&#39;ll say what I believe is true and if that adds up he usually let&#39;s it go, if he gives you that chance.   Sometimes it&#39;s license and registration,  comes back with ticket written,  sometimes he asks  questions. Depends on who you get. The side of a road isn&#39;t a courtroom there are no citizens to rise up its two guys, one is a civilian and one has authority.  Please be realistic.  I&#39;m not a politician I have responsibilities in life, my entity is not devoted to fighting civil injustice and I&#39;ve found my place well enough to hold my ground, I&#39;m not the one you should lecture on this.</p>
