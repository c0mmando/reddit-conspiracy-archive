       I guess you aren't familiar with inflation?
      </p>
      <p>
       Total cost of Twin Towers construction cost in 1972 was $900million.  So one tower at approx $450million.  In 2015 dollars that is $2.5billion dollars.   Plus the cost of the plane.  Plus the cost of the real estate.

       um, the "collateral" costs of 9/11 had ZERO relationship to the cost of building the towers in the first place...these were, um, different millennia.
      </p>
      <p>
       sorry, you are rambling here.   you ask:  what would it cost to build a replica crash a plane into it.   You say it would be "cheaper" than the first time because you have somehow magically added the cost of (what I presume) to be 9/11 clean up, afghan war, who knows what else to this number.   But those these had nothing to do with the cost of the buildings.

       It wouldn't settle anything. You can get your hands on software used to model buildings and build replicas of them in there running as many sims as you need.

       I'm going to go out on a limb here and say with 99% certainty that no one is going to build an exact replica of WTC1/2 and then fly a 767 into it.

       Maybe AE911T should do it instead of wasting money on billboards in time square.   Or they could at least create a model that demonstrates the impossibility of gravity driven collapse.  Or you know, do

       yes, I'm certain that it is that improbable.  1) no point, 2) hugely expensive, 3) the vast majority of structural engineers are not "disbelieving" of a gravity driven collapse caused by fire.

       The technology certainly exists to run a legit simulation.  The problem is, its such a complicated system that you couldnt expect it to act exactly the same.  What NIST SHOULD have done was be completely transparent.   And run the simulation 100,000 times.  And if  ONE TIME, it even slightly resembled what happened on 911, then that would shut everyone up!  a 1/100000 result, if they were smart could be sold to the public.  The fact that they didnt do this speaks volumes.   This is not a hard simulation to run, relative to the type of simulations going on these days.

       I think you are severely underestimating the complexity of modeling the collapse of the buildings.  Even a second of FEA for something like this requires gross simplification of the components and many many CPU cycles and the complexity only increases as the model continues and more components interact with other components.

       I guarantee you I'm not.  Off the top of my head I can think of one legitimate reason they would keep the code secret.  If you've ever heard of the concept of "resonance" , when you know the EXACT building specifications of a structure, it allows you to know the resonance frequencies of it.  If you are unaware of what im taking about, look up tacoma bridge, or the famous tesla legend when he almost collapsed a building by putting a little device that tapped on the structures support beam at its resonance frequency.   Idk why they would want to keep the resonance frequency of structures that no longer exist a secret, but it's not ridiculous to think that could be a motive, its one of the reasons why EXACT building specifications for most structures aren't available to the public.  It would allow  anyone with the right computer program to figure out how to collapse the building with nothing more than a tiny electric motor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think a simulation like this is out of the range of possible?  Its complex, ill give that to you, but certainly well within the range of stuff going on today.

       High rises are built to dampen resonance via wind or earthquake with a variety of tuned dampers.

       And yes, FEA of the magnitude you are envisioning is fantastically complex and probably months of computation.

       Of all the things to add into the code, that would be fairly straight forward.  Simply vary youngs modulus of each steel beam randomly throughout the structure as you run the simulation over and over.  Remember, it would only have to resemble the actual collapse a small number of times.

       That's true. To be honest the reason I think they haven't done this is because they just don't want to. It's either A; it was a controlled demolition, which could very well result in a civil war, B; they were right all along and they'll be criticized for wasting resources by the media, or C; It turns out the construction crews did a really shitty job and the tower was a 50th as strong as advertised.

       The cost of the two planes would equal about 80.5 million for UA 175, and 100-110 million for AA 11. The cost of the remote control system and fuel load would be negligible compared to that so we can put the cost at roughly $190,000,000 for the planes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The twin towers cost about 2.3 billion to build when adjusted for inflation. If we include all the office furnishings for the two building we can probably assume that $1 million per floor in furnishings is reasonable for cost so tack another $200 million +.

      <p>
       Total cost(rough estimate) 2,700,000,000

       This of course doesn't include cost of land to build it on or the cost of clean up.

       And the land would be a big part of it, because different ground strengths could affect the foundations, and therefore the fall. Short answer is it'd be impossible to do, because you'd need to do the test a dozen times to get any baseline.

       Billions is peanuts compared to the trillions of dollars and millions of lives 9/11 cost. But it would be useless. Even if (say) China had a 100% accurate copy, and had everything 100% documented -- neither of which is possible -- it would be neutered by western media.
