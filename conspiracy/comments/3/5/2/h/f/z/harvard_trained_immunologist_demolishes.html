        From State of the Nation:

      </p>
      <h2>
       SOTN Editor’s Note:
      </h2>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The following open letter written by a PhD Immunologist completely demolishes the current California legislative initiative to remove all vaccine exemptions.
       </p>
       <p>
        That such a draconian and cynical state statute is under consideration in the ‘Golden State’ is as shocking as it is predictable. After all, the legislation was mysteriously written and submitted shortly after the manufactured-in-Disneyland measles ‘outbreak’.
       </p>
       <p>
        The indisputable science that is employed by Tetyana Obukhanych, PhD ought to be read by every California legislator who is entertaining an affirmative vote for SB277.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dr. Obukhanych skillfully deconstructs the many false and fabricated arguments that are advanced by Big Pharma and the U.S Federal Government as they attempt to implement a nationwide Super-Vaccination agenda.
       </p>
       <p>
        When the California Senate refuses to consider authoritative scientific evidence which categorically proves the dangerous vaccine side effects on the schoolchildren, something is very wrong.
       </p>
       <p>
        Such conduct by the Senate constitutes a criminal conspiracy (as in a real conspiracy to inflict harm) which endangers the lives and welfare of children. Their official behavior must therefore be acknowledged for what it is — CRIMINAL — and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>
       An Open Letter to Legislators Currently Considering Vaccine Legislation from Tetyana Obukhanych, PhD in Immunology
      </h2>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Dear Legislator:
       </p>
       <p>
        My name is Tetyana Obukhanych. I hold a PhD in Immunology. I am writing this letter in the hope that it will correct several common misperceptions about vaccines in order to help you formulate a fair and balanced understanding that is supported by accepted vaccine theory and new scientific findings.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>
       Do unvaccinated children pose a higher threat to the public than the vaccinated?
      </h2>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It is often stated that those who choose not to vaccinate their children for reasons of conscience endanger the rest of the public, and this is the rationale behind most of the legislation to end vaccine exemptions currently being considered by federal and state legislators country-wide.
       </p>
       <p>
        You should be aware that the nature of protection afforded by many modern vaccines – and that includes most of the vaccines recommended by the CDC for children – is not consistent with such a statement.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have outlined below the recommended vaccines that cannot prevent transmission of disease either because they are not designed to prevent the transmission of infection (rather, they are intended to prevent disease symptoms), or because they are for non-communicable diseases.
       </p>
       <p>
        People who have not received the vaccines mentioned below pose no higher threat to the general public than those who have, implying that discrimination against non-immunized children in a public school setting may not be warranted.
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li>
         <p>
          <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17429085">
           IPV (inactivated poliovirus vaccine) cannot prevent transmission of poliovirus
          </a>
          . Wild poliovirus has been non-existent in the USA for at least two decades. Even if wild poliovirus were to be re-imported by travel, vaccinating for polio with IPV cannot affect the safety of public spaces. Please note that wild poliovirus eradication is attributed to the use of a different vaccine, OPV or oral poliovirus vaccine. Despite being capable of preventing wild poliovirus transmission, use of OPV was phased out long ago in the USA and replaced with IPV due to safety concerns.
         </p>
        </li>

         <p>
          <em>
           Tetanus is not a contagious disease,
          </em>
          but rather acquired from deep-puncture wounds contaminated with C. tetani spores. Vaccinating for tetanus (via the DTaP combination vaccine) cannot alter the safety of public spaces; it is intended to render personal protection only.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          While intended to prevent the disease-causing effects of the diphtheria toxin,
          <em>
           the diphtheria toxoid vaccine (also contained in the DTaP vaccine) is not designed to prevent colonization and transmission of C. diphtheriae.
          </em>
          Vaccinating for diphtheria cannot alter the safety of public spaces; it is likewise intended for personal protection only.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          The acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine (the final element of the DTaP combined vaccine), now in use in the USA, replaced the whole cell pertussis vaccine in the late 1990s, which was followed by an unprecedented resurgence of whooping cough.
          <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24277828">
           An experiment with deliberate pertussis infection in primates
          </a>
          revealed that
          <em>
           the aP vaccine is not capable of preventing colonization and transmission of B. pertussis
          </em>
          . The FDA has issued a warning regarding this crucial finding. Furthermore, the 2013 meeting of the Board of Scientific Counselors at the CDC
          <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/maso/facm/pdfs/BSCOID/2013121112_BSCOID_Minutes.pdf">
           revealed additional alarming data
          </a>
          that
          <em>
           pertussis variants (PRN-negative strains) currently circulating in the USA acquired a selective advantage to infect those who are up-to-date for their DTaP boosters
          </em>
          , meaning that people who are up-to-date are more likely to be infected, and thus contagious, than people who are not vaccinated.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Among numerous types of H. influenzae, the Hib vaccine covers only type b. Despite its sole intention to reduce symptomatic and asymptomatic (disease-less) Hib carriage,
          <em>
           the introduction of the Hib vaccine has inadvertently shifted strain dominance towards other types of H. influenzae (types a through f).
          </em>
          <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21888789">
           These types have been causing invasive disease of high severity and increasing incidence in adults in the era of Hib vaccination of children
          </a>
          . The general population is more vulnerable to the invasive disease now than it was prior to the start of the Hib vaccination campaign. Discriminating against children who are not vaccinated for Hib does not make any scientific sense in the era of non-type b H. influenzae disease.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Hepatitis B is a blood-borne virus. It does not spread in a community setting, especially among children who are unlikely to engage in high-risk behaviors, such as needle sharing or sex. Vaccinating children for hepatitis B cannot significantly alter the safety of public spaces. Further, school admission is not prohibited for children who are chronic hepatitis B carriers. To prohibit school admission for those who are simply unvaccinated – and do not even carry hepatitis B – would constitute unreasonable and illogical discrimination.
         </p>
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        <em>
         In summary, a person who is not vaccinated with IPV, DTaP, HepB, and Hib vaccines due to reasons of conscience poses no extra danger to the public than a person who is. No discrimination is warranted.
        </em>

      <h2>
       How often do serious vaccine adverse events happen?
      </h2>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It is often stated that vaccination rarely leads to serious adverse events. Unfortunately, this statement is not supported by science.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22174753">
         A recent study done in Ontario, Canada,
        </a>
        established that
        <em>
         vaccination actually leads to an emergency room visit for 1 in 168 children following their 12-month vaccination appointment and for 1 in 730 children following their 18-month vaccination appointment.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        When the risk of an adverse event requiring an ER visit after well-baby vaccinations is demonstrably so high, vaccination must remain a choice for parents, who may understandably be unwilling to assume this immediate risk in order to protect their children from diseases that are generally considered mild or that their children may never be exposed to.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>
       Can discrimination against families who oppose vaccines for reasons of conscience prevent future disease outbreaks of communicable viral diseases, such as measles?
      </h2>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Measles research scientists have for a long time been aware of the “measles paradox.” I quote from the article by Poland &amp; Jacobson (1994) “Failure to Reach the Goal of Measles Elimination: Apparent Paradox of Measles Infections in Immunized Persons.”
        <em>
         Arch Intern Med
        </em>
        154:1815-1820:
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       “The apparent paradox is that as measles immunization rates rise to high levels in a population, measles becomes a disease of immunized persons.”
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Further research determined that behind the “measles paradox” is a fraction of the population called LOW VACCINE RESPONDERS. Low-responders are those who respond poorly to the first dose of the measles vaccine. These individuals then mount a weak immune response to subsequent RE-vaccination and quickly return to the pool of “susceptibles’’ within 2-5 years, despite being fully vaccinated.
       </p>
       <p>
        Re-vaccination cannot correct low-responsiveness: it appears to be an immuno-genetic trait.
        <a href="http://thinkingmomsrevolution.com/an-open-letter-to-legislators-currently-considering-vaccine-legislation-from-tetyana-obukhanych-phd-in-immunology/#_ftn5">
         The proportion of low-responders among children was estimated to be 4.7% in the USA.
        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23264672">
         Studies
        </a>
        of measles outbreaks in Quebec, Canada,
        <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24586717">
         and China
        </a>
        attest that
        <em>
         outbreaks of measles still happen, even when vaccination compliance is in the highest bracket (95-97% or even 99%).
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        This is because even in high vaccine responders, vaccine-induced antibodies wane over time. Vaccine immunity does not equal life-long immunity acquired after natural exposure.
       </p>
       <p>
        It has been documented that vaccinated persons who develop breakthrough measles are contagious. In fact, two major measles outbreaks in 2011 (in Quebec, Canada, and in New York, NY) were re-imported by previously vaccinated individuals.
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         Taken together, these data make it apparent that elimination of vaccine exemptions, currently only utilized by a small percentage of families anyway, will neither solve the problem of disease resurgence nor prevent re-importation and outbreaks of previously eliminated diseases.

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>
       Is discrimination against conscientious vaccine objectors the only practical solution?
      </h2>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The majority of measles cases in recent US outbreaks (including the recent Disneyland outbreak) are adults and very young babies, whereas in the pre-vaccination era, measles occurred mainly between the ages 1 and 15.
       </p>
       <p>
        Natural exposure to measles was followed by lifelong immunity from re-infection, whereas vaccine immunity wanes over time, leaving adults unprotected by their childhood shots. Measles is more dangerous for infants and for adults than for school-aged children.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite high chances of exposure in the pre-vaccination era, measles practically never happened in babies much younger than one year of age due to the robust maternal immunity transfer mechanism.
       </p>
       <p>
        The vulnerability of very young babies to measles today is the direct outcome of the prolonged mass vaccination campaign of the past, during which their mothers, themselves vaccinated in their childhood, were not able to experience measles naturally at a safe school age and establish the lifelong immunity that would also be transferred to their babies and protect them from measles for the first year of life.
       </p>
       <p>
        Luckily,
        <a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140714084352/http:/www.hpa.org.uk/webc/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1242198450982">
         a therapeutic backup exists
        </a>
        to mimic now-eroded maternal immunity. Infants as well as other vulnerable or immunocompromised individuals,
        <em>
         are eligible to receive immunoglobulin, a potentially life-saving measure that supplies antibodies directed against the virus to prevent or ameliorate disease upon exposure.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        In summary:
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li>
         <p>
          due to the properties of modern vaccines, non-vaccinated individuals pose no greater risk of transmission of polio, diphtheria, pertussis, and numerous non-type b H. influenzae strains than vaccinated individuals do, non-vaccinated individuals pose virtually no danger of transmission of hepatitis B in a school setting, and tetanus is not transmissible at all;
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          there is a significantly elevated risk of emergency room visits after childhood vaccination appointments attesting that vaccination is  not risk-free;
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          outbreaks of measles cannot be entirely prevented even if we had nearly perfect vaccination compliance; and
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          an effective method of preventing measles and other viral diseases in vaccine-ineligible infants and the immunocompromised, immunoglobulin, is available for those who may be exposed to these diseases.
         </p>
        </li>
       </ol>

      <h2>
       Taken together, these four facts make it clear that discrimination in a public school setting against children who are not vaccinated for reasons of conscience is completely unwarranted as the vaccine status of conscientious objectors poses no undue public health risk.

       Even the top immunologists are speaking out about the madness now, funny the pro-vaccine crowd have the strange idea that anti-vaxx people get their info from Jenny McCarthy, they seem oblivious to the fact anti-vaxx information comes from the top doctors, researchers and immunologists in the world.  If you believe in science then you do not believe in the current vaccines on the market; they are not based on sound science, but rather on assumption and corruption.

       Maybe, but calling her an idiot because she counters your biases is disingenuous too. If you have some counter points to her summary arguments against forced vaccination then you should enlighten us all. Ad hominem attacks aren't typically convincing to those with "bias".

       This is only part of the picture, she implies that it is the whole picture.

      <blockquote>

       </p>

      <p>
       Again, only part of the picture.  Immunologic memory pertains to the pool of plasma cells stored in the body that can rapidly produce antibodies to antigens an individual has previously come into contact with.

       The thing is, you have a belief and this idiot confirms your belief so you are willing to believe any kind of bullshit she writes.  The truth of the matter is, that entire statement you posted is 100% not true.  Now, I'm not going to argue with a true believer, but it would behoove you to pick up a basic college level physiology text and read the chapter(s) about immunology.  You'll clearly see that what she is saying is not right.

       Immunoglobulin?  That's real cost effective.  Let's see.  $ 26,000 for a four dose course.
Oh, that's much better than vaccines.

       I agree mandatory vaccines are not right but let's be serious.  There is no evil conspiracy to dumb down your children with vaccines.  Most of the questionable chemicals in vaccines are due to the manufacturing process.
