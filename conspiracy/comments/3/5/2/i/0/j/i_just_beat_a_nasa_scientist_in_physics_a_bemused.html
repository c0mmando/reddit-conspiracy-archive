       I had one contact me to discuss the moon landing. I was able to debunk all of their proof except for 1. The moon dust brought back from the moon (which they claim is different than the moon rocks on earth, I have no way of telling if this is true though).

       The more we learn the more we find out NASA is a bunch of indoctrinated religious scientist extremists who will defend incorrect data simply because it has to be true if it's taught to everyone.

       You can always tell when the Government lied about something because all of the evidence disappears. Supposedly all of the Telemetry data from the Apollo 11 Moon Landings as well as the original high quality video recordings have all disappeared.

       Well that's interesting. I thought just like Antarctica, no one can own the Moon. It always bothered me that we supposedly had the technology to land on the moon in 1969 but we can't seem to take a decent, high res photo of the landing sites either from Earth or from LEO. I've seen pictures of the landing sites taken from the Moons orbit but they're really blurry and hard to make out. When you zoom in, its just a pixelated mess. When I heard China was sending rovers to the Moon, I hoped that they would take some pictures of the landing sites. I don't trust NASA to take the pictures because I'm sure they would be edited.

       The world powers have agreements at this point, anyone allowed to go to the moon will be forced to sign non disclosures.
      </p>
      <p>
       I imagine soon we'll start seeing rovers and other things on the moon that seem very realistic due to modern tech, but aren't actually there.

       I was watching something on the TR3B the other day and I also watch and read a lot of Richard Dolan's talks so I'm on the fence about the Secret Space Program. I've also seen a UFO in Northern California that I believe is part of this Secret Space Program. It looked exactly like the Phoenix Lights UFO. A massive flying wing that had 5 to 7 lights on the bottom, 1 in the nose and the rest spaced evenly along the wings. It was about 3,000 to 5,000 feet above the ground. I was on a fire crew and we were out on a lightning fire in Kern County, Northern California sitting on top of a mountain. The whole fire crew saw this thing. We were wearing helmets with headlamps and all of our headlamps shut off as this thing approached and flew over us. The color was strange, it looked black but it shimmered and it seemed like you could see right through it to the stars behind it so it was hard to tell if the lights you were seeing on it were actually lights or the stars above it. The video I saw on the TR3B said that it has a cloaking device, made using thousands of micro lens cameras that record the sky above and project it on the surface below and this cloaking tech is used on everything from planes to armored personnel carriers. It didn't make any noise as it went over us and the sighting lasted about 8-10 minutes. It glided slowly over and then accelerated after it passed over the mountain and took off going south. The TR3B is also rumored to have some kind of anti=grav device that reduces the effects of gravity so that only 11% is felt by the craft and it's occupants. When it left, it was actually headed in the direction of Nevada and Arizona. This UFO has been frequently seen in this corridor so I have a feeling they test it in this area.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still don't believe we landed on the moon but then it seems like an awfully expensive charade to make people believe that our technology is still limited to rockets. The military has the X34B up in space as we speak but is that also just a diversion? I believe the Black Triangles are all Secret Space Program Tech and were responsible for the sightings in Belgium and elsewhere. Everyone says, "Why would they test top secret craft over populated areas, that doesn't make sense?" But when you think about it, they're using real world scenarios to see if they can evade radar and defense systems over a NATO ally so if they do get caught or one goes down, it isn't as bad as getting caught in Russia or China. They can just slap a gag order on them and not have to worry about the "enemy" getting their hands on one of them. But I have no idea if they're capable of leaving LEO because they're always sighted in Earth's atmosphere.

       There are real conspiracies that are overshadowed by "believable conspiracies" when presented to the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       They allow the "crazies" to comment/post whatever they want as long as it doesn't reveal any info whatsoever on what is actually happening, this allows them to control people without them even being aware of it. People view "conspiracy" as a social no no and steer clear of it because of the crazies allowed to present their theories that give the genuine truth seekers a bad image.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are certain truths people are aware of as well but the human psyche views them as so heinous that even thinking about them is forbidden (such as 9/11), this is a powerful tool being used right now to hide information from the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few of us (I assume "us" because I can't be the only person to have seen through the manipulation) can see what is going on behind the scenes through the lies and missing information (think of it as finding a black hole in space going off of what science tells us).

       Is that really a conspiracy?

       Moogega tried to answer the question by, presumably, using her own knowledge of physics. She has a BS in Physics from Hapton University and a MS and Ph.D from Drexel University. So she should definitely be qualified to answer the question. One thing to note is that both of these universities aren't exactly the best in teaching engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Danielle tried to answer the question by collaborating the answers of many people. In my time browsing info about 9/11 I've found many people who seem to be very educated in the field of physics, and many of those people were currently in fields related to engineering and physics. Not only that, all those websites had already done the math surrounding that particular problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was 1 VS however many people contributed to the websites that Danielle used. I have no problem believing that the many beat the one in this situation.

       The
       <em>
        conspiracy
       </em>
       is that the math applied in "truther" websites is correct and reliable.  And that
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       got attention in a mass media vehicle is extremely important. Not that it's a game changer, but quite possibly will havea few

       (most of which never cared in researching) scratching their heads.

       So because she's a black woman she automatically is the result of affirmative action? I get that women and African Americans are statistically less likely to be involved in physics, but there's no reason to see it and scream "affirmative action"

       When you get to the tail of the distribution (eg, NASA scientists), yes, it's most likely that she's just filling a quota. If you're not sure what I mean, I can give you a specific example with numbers using medical school (the only field that publishes a lot of data on applicants).
