       I am all for honest reporting of events, but does anyone think we're getting a LOT of police misconduct stories these days?
      </p>
      <p>
       There must be a reason for all of this candor; police misconduct happened just plenty before it was the fad to report on.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is extremely rare that the media attack an actual part of the government but they are relentless on this one. I believe it to be directed or even orchestrated to create a rift between the People and the Police so we don't get together and do something about the more serious corruption of the nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       In an election season, it's also a trap for a Leftist candidate while not being one for a Republican. Sanders may be tempted to weigh in on either side and be misinterpreted by the Media, then soundbited into an attack ad. A Republican candidate like Huckabee or Clinton is and will forever be pro-establishment and so not only will their "few bad apples" comments to come be pointlessly bland, but the Media will have nothing but good spin to offer.

       The media is not designed to give you useful information, especially actual news. Modern news media and its abhorrent, sensationalized entirety showed up during the 1980's, and helped create the massive cultural divisions that America experiences.
    In response to your speaking about the rift between police and people, it is again another rift purposefully created by those seeking to divide America so that they can take complete control. Militarization of police, by which I mean the utilization of police officers as pseudo-military outfits extends to the gilded age, when large monopolies used federal, state and private police units to suppress labor protests and demonstrations.
      And if I remember correctly Hillary's emails have an order on them for investigation( I can't remember the term for it) and if the courts do their job then she doesn't have a snowball's chance in hell of becoming president and she will hopefully be locked up for fraud and corruption, and hopefully live the rest of her life in disgrace.

       Hillary is protected. Just like anyone else in her particular class, she'd have to shoot a cop in the middle of Maddison WI to get a day in jail.

       True, but the emails hopefully will remove her chances of becoming president. We can only wait and see how the puppeteers twist everything to their wants.

       Its of my opinion that the Democratic party wants to give more power to the Federal Gov't. They want a federal Police who can go anywhere and do anything. Fuck your State's rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media is trying to sway public opinion that the police are out of control. Whats a good way to correct the problem? Offer them Federal training and assign Federal Employees to watch over them to make sure everyone is behaving. Also, to help with these cost they will get Federal Grants. And if you don't cooperate and let the Feds pretty much make the calls, they will yank that Federal Funding away and when they can't afford budget while the neighboring Police departments get cool military shit for cheap, they will break like a Crack head needing crack.
