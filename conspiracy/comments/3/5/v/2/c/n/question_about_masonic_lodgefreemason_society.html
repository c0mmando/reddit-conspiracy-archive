Is this something anyone has heard of before?</p>

<p>He wouldn&#39;t have to be old to be &quot;off his rocker&quot;, but walking into a random gelato shop with that story and that question certainly suggests that to be the case.</p>

<p>Hell, he could just be confused (Alzheimers) that someone put a hearing aid in one of his ears and now (surprisingly) he hears a lot of shit he couldn&#39;t hear before.</p>

<p>Gelato shops, for whatever reason, are commonly used as intelligence agency fronts.  Do gelato shops have a lot of ammonia for the refrigeration?  I confess I&#39;ve been curious for some while as to why gelato shops are in vogue for clandestine fronts.</p>

<p>Now, if you need a lecture on the philosophical nature of morality as distilled from the philosophers of the West... that we can help you on, but you can usually pass anything about Freemasonry through this filter: did the technology exist in the 18th century? No? Not a Freemason thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just a coincidence that this is my screen name and you work in a gelato shop. I thought it was clever. There are probably no GMO&#39;s in your gelato.</p>

<p>The guy you met could be telling the truth. Not only is this a &quot;thing&quot; in the really deep conspiracy world, but I knew a woman who was in the Army (I don&#39;t know the details) that claimed they put something in her ear that plays transmissions to her.</p>

<p>If you ask <a href="/r/digitalcartel">/r/digitalcartel</a>, we are all fitted with hardly-detectible prosthetic technology. In any case, gangstalking is a real thing.... in some capacity. I can link you to a couple things but I must admit- it never reads very sensibly..</p>
