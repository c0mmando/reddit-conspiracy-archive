<p>&#39;Chemtrails&#39;, on the other hand, stick around a <strong>lot</strong> longer and spread across the sky like a giant spray.</p>

<p>Has anyone ever come up with a legit reason as to why this is? Or have we literally just been given the line &quot;they&#39;re both the same, trust us&quot;? How do they explain some trails disappearing moments later and some taking hours?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because whether contrails form (and whether they persist) depends on the temperature and RH of the air that the plane is traveling through. Those conditions are not uniform - they vary with altitude, and also laterally across the sky. It&#39;s for the same reasons that natural cloud cover is often patchy; the plane moves in and out of regions that are &quot;ready&quot; for cloud formation to be triggered.</p>

<p>No, since the scientists more than 60 years ago started saying so. See the 1951 report from Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory to the Office of Naval Research, &quot;<a href="http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/692117.pdf">Prediction of Aircraft Condensation Trails: Project Contrails</a>&quot;: &quot;Contrails of ice particles, the more common situation, will persist for hours if environmental conditions exceed ice supersaturation, i.e., exceed ambient relative humidities of approximately 60 to 70%.&quot;</p>

<p>See also Knollenberg, RG. 1972. &quot;<a href="http://cires1.colorado.edu/science/groups/pielke/classes/atoc7500/knollenberg72.pdf">Measurements of the growth of the ice budget in a persisting contrail</a>,&quot; stating: &quot;If sufficient air carrier traffic exists, an entire overcast of contrail cirrus may develop and persist for hours with rapid growth in the ice budget of individual contrails.&quot;</p>

<p>There is a lot of documentation, in everything from books about clouds to scientific journal articles, going back to the WW2 era.  You have to ignore, deny, or dismiss all of that in order to believe that contrails can&#39;t persist.</p>

<p>Cirrus clouds are composed of ice crystals suspended in the air. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I gave you your source to your initial reaction, now its morphed into something greater since I jacked up your first inquistion. Interesting.</p>

<p>Its simple to look up into the sky, then go to flightradar24.com to match. 90% of the time, its amazing how there is no commercial flight anywhere near the area to go with the plane spitting shit out, and in a drunken curve nonetheless.</p>

<p>Its a daily occurrence. Hazy, not cloudy. Some days you&#39;ll see a pilot fly from one end of the sky to the other, turn around a mountain range, and come back to where he/she started, spraying the entire time. Its easy to tell, because the trails curve like the one in the picture, but instead of continuing in the same direction they&#39;ll just turn around. Its insane... </p>

<p>For the past few years, Ive regretted moving here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Roynerer, scientists have understood for decades why some contrails dissipate quickly, while others persist and spread as cirrus clouds.  It&#39;s based on the atmospheric conditions that the plane is traveling through.  When the air is very cold (less than about -40 deg) and very humid (higher than about 70% RH), that makes it &quot;ice-supersaturated.&quot;  In this condition, the ice formed from the exhaust moisture doesn&#39;t dissipate - instead, it initiates the further development of cirrus clouds from the moisture in the surrounding air.</p>

<p>Though this doesn&#39;t explain what I just saw: one plane with a short, dissipating trail and then another almost right next to it at seemingly the same height but its trails stays and spreads out.</p>

<p>How does this correlate with varying temperatures?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most likely they were at different altitudes.  The human eye can&#39;t really distinguish between one plane traveling at (for example) 30,000 feet, and another at 32,000 feet, but the atmospheric conditions can easily be different enough at that distance to change whether contrails persist.</p>

<p>The whole thing doesn&#39;t even make sense. </p>

<p>And I quote</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The very existence of the Grand Conspiracy required to administer chemtrails may be challenged on the basis of the difficulty of maintaining such a conspiracy for so long. Aerial spraying from high-altitude would be an extremely inefficient and inexact mode of delivering chemicals to ground-based targets. Pesticides, for example, are often sprayed on crops from airplanes flying at 30 feet. Wide-area mosquito spraying may be done from an altitude of 150 feet. Chemtrails are supposedly deposited at 30,000 feet or higher, where winds would likely disperse them unpredictably. If there were a campaign to introduce foreign chemicals to the population, it would be simpler and more effective to put them in the water supply (see water fluoridation), or the food supply; or if inhalation were necessary, to release them from ground-based vehicles — have you seen the smoke coming suspiciously out of some cars?
In addition, said Grand Conspiracy would require that all of the world&#39;s governments, including the supposedly hostile nations that [insert your favorite government overlords] would have to be in cahoots with, would be agreeing to spray the chemtrails over their own populace, since there are very few national airspaces that do not have at least some aircraft flying to, from, within or over them.[30] Considering the amount of ongoing research on trace components of the atmosphere, the Grand Conspiracy would also have to be suppressing scientific documentation of anomalous chemical presences in the stratosphere, everywhere in the world, without anybody noticing or any authors anywhere crying foul.
But wait! How many international flights go over water where there are no nations, or over the poles where no humans live? Clearly these chemtrails are then responsible for ozone depletion/withdrawal of ice shelves/reduction of polar bear populations/desalination of the world&#39;s oceans/whatever you want to suggest they are.[citation NOT needed]
All evidence presented by the conspiracy theorists focuses on pictures of the sky. It is all perfectly consistent with contrails. No other evidence such as detection of chemicals or pictures of actual chemical spraying planes or documentation detailing the government&#39;s plan has ever been forthcoming. Notably absent are potentially convincing evidence such as spectrographic analyses — after all, the contents of an aircraft&#39;s trail can&#39;t be hidden from a spectrograph. Or, for that matter, air sampling, which became so refined during the Cold War that scientists could not only pick up the residual traces of a nuclear test thousands of miles downwind, but analyse them finely enough to reconstruct the design of the device tested. If these exquisitely sensitive technologies cannot detect the enormous amounts of &quot;chemicals&quot; supposedly being released into the atmosphere via &quot;chemtrails&quot;, then those who believe in those chemicals need not only far better evidence that they exist than they have ever offered, but also a credible explanation of why they&#39;re undetectable.</p>

<p>Well… Discovery Channel performed an analysis on chemtrails, and hasn&#39;t seen evidence of strange gases.[31]. Strange is bolded because in the video referenced, there&#39;s a heavy quote-mine, so that the uploader can rant about how bad nitrogen dioxide (who refuses to mention that we&#39;d smell the gas if it came anywhere near the surface[32]), nitric acid (again, anywhere near the surface, things would be eaten away[33]), carbon dioxide (We breathed in before airplanes), and carbon monoxide (Meanwhile, Chemtards have no issues with cars) are.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t say &quot;fuck you&quot; and walk away, I know what I am talking about. I am calling bullshit and all you can do is make vague statements about &quot;oh, but they admitted it but didn&#39;t say it was harmful&quot;. Well no fucking way. Ever hear of cloud seeding? Likely not. Because you have zero idea on how any of these things work. Shocking. </p>

<p>Not only the fact it requires thousands of people to not make a single peep. </p>

<p>So no, you such it up grandpa. You know your wrong.</p>

<p>Two planes cashing won&#39;t raise the temperature. That is insane and impossible. So I don&#39;t know what that is trying to prove. correlation does not mean causation. Anybody with a basic understanding of science would know this.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, you mean the ones where a bunch of people made some videos to see if the conspiracy theorists would bite? Or what about that faked translation of a German news video? Because I remember.</p>

<p>By independent studies, you mean your little conspiracy theorist blog buddy&#39;s go out and stand in a yard while eating paint chips?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see these study&#39;s. So I don&#39;t know if they took in account of the massive amount of variables that likely would be there. </p>

<p>You know the same people who made the documentary isn&#39;t the same people actually doing this? Crazy right? Blows your fucking mind, don&#39;t it?</p>
