<p>I have only recently been looking into his podcasts and they are really well researched and informative. </p>

<p>Why does he not get too much press round these parts</p>

<p>He is the man behind the short 5 min 911 video that gets posted here a lot but that is it.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed that Corbett gets massive respect around here and almost all of his content gets posted and upvoted, but I think the long form and lack of hysteria in his content just makes it the kind of stuff that doesn&#39;t generate a lot of discussion here.</p>

<p>Unfortunately reddit, this sub and the internet in general prefers a flashy headline and easy to digest content over the well thought out stuff Corbett does.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve ever seen anyone say a bad thing about him though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve said it here before and I&#39;ll say it again, James Corbett is the antidote to Alex Jones. </p>

<p>Furthermore, IMHO he was our best AMA guest, the man recorded video responses to questions, <em>video responses</em>. </p>

<p>He&#39;s an indispensable source of information and what I would consider to be the best alternative news source ever. He provides citations and always maintains a certain professorial presence, even when discussing atrocities. </p>

<p>I really can&#39;t say enough good things about James Corbett. If you like his work, you should see his documentary, its called <em>Century of Enslavement: The Federal Reserve</em>. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/federalreserve/">Here&#39;s a link to the documentary on his website.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Corbett is my favorite researcher. I&#39;ll put his channel on while I clean up around the house. He&#39;s very sure to let you know when he&#39;s speculating and when he&#39;s pulling from a source he trusts. He&#39;s quite well respected the world over, and for good reason. </p>

<p>I saw a conference when he went to... I think one of the Nordic countries? Can&#39;t remember which one... but he was greeted like a hero and people were hanging on his every word. But it wasn&#39;t sycophants in the crowd, they asked very intelligent and difficult questions after his presentation. People like James are demonstrating that there&#39;s a LOT of people out there that just want answers, what ever they mean and where ever they lead. </p>

<p>He is the answer to the Alex Jones problem.</p>

<p>The first one is really good about Timothy Mcveigh.</p>

<p>How I stumbled around was, to look for one I knew a fair bit about already and hear his take on it.</p>

<p>Here are a couple of his videos I enjoyed</p>

<p>His co-host wants to go full Jonesretard but there is a bit where Corbett says something llike
&quot; I&#39;m not fucking around with little details anymore, takes to much time. I want to focus on the overall plan.&quot;</p>

An erudite, honest and overall very likeable chap with a knack for comprehensive story telling and straight to the point answers too. Doesn&#39;t get nearly the respect or following he deserves for his outstanding journalism, but that&#39;s a fate he shares with nearly every brilliant human who walked this planet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.  And seriously man, if you haven&#39;t watched it you really should.  Hearing about second hand just isn&#39;t enough.</p>

<p>Otherwise I can go through the bullet points one by one of how totally fucked up it is and how the cop broke just about every possible protocol for interviewing a witness, let alone interviewing small children who have been physically/mentally abused.  I say again: he should be fired, 100%, and he should also be ashamed of himself whether the kids&#39; story is true or not (and based on everything I&#39;ve seen, including that interview - which is really a coercive interrogation - I think it is to be totally frank).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Compare it to any other interrogation you&#39;ve read about or seen or heard described.  It doesn&#39;t pass the smell test.</p>

<p>The kids are in the care of the state, no adult or guardian is present in the interview.  The first five minutes the interviewer is explaining &quot;ground rules&quot; to the kids.  He evidently discussed what would be said in the interview with the kids in the car on the way over (since he blatantly says he did although he frames it as, &quot;Wasn&#39;t there something you were dying to tell me on the way over here?&quot;).</p>

<p>There&#39;s some absurd claim about the kids seeing the movie <em>Zorro</em> and getting their ideas about Satanic ritual abuse and murdered babies from that.  Nevermind that this is totally idiotic since none of these things are in the film - why invent an entire elaborate story implicating the school, details of the anatomy of the teachers, various sexual and violent details, etc. if the only purpose was to discredit the father in a custody battle?  It doesn&#39;t even make any sense.</p>

<p>And if you look at the retractions themselves, the boy affirms that babies were killed <strong>7 times</strong> and the interviewer simply refuses to follow that line of questioning, instead continuing to badger the point until the child understands that he&#39;s giving the &quot;wrong answer&quot;.</p>

<p>At one point during this, after the seventh time the boy states babies were killed, the interviewer says: &quot;Are you sure?  It&#39;s okay if it hasn&#39;t happened - it&#39;s okay <strong>as long as we talk about it now</strong>&quot;.  This is a veiled threat, blatantly, and one any child will respond to when it comes from an adult.</p>

<p>Talking about the secret rooms, the child again corroborates his earlier story and says the rooms did exist.  He apparently gets a non-verbal cue that happens off camera basically telling him he&#39;s saying the wrong thing again and halfway through his sentence where he&#39;s again affirming the rooms exist he stops, makes a weird face, and then says the exact opposite of what he&#39;s just been saying.</p>

<p>I can go on - the entire interview is simple coercion and bullying tactics used by the interviewer and it&#39;s pretty obvious even without any training as an interrogator.</p>

<p><a href="http://educate-yourself.org/cn/hampsteadvideosbackonline24feb15.shtml#top">Check some of these links out</a>, but this is the site I watched it on originally and it seems to be a dead link now.</p>

<p>The interview with &quot;child G&quot; took place on September 17th so search for that date and hopefully you&#39;ll be able to find it somewhere.</p>
