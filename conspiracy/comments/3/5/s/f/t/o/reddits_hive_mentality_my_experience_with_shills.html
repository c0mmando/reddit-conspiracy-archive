        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When I first started using Reddit, I was really excited at what I had found. It seemed like a laid back, open minded community that legitimately wanted to converse and debate. As someone who had grown tired of Youtube 13 year olds, and Yahoo conservatives, I was thrilled to have found this place. For about a year, I commented, posted, played the upvote/downvote game, and generally had a fun time.</p>

<p>As time went on, I started noticing signs of hive mentality.... as well as things not adding up. For a site that thinks of itself as progressive, there sure were a lot of conservative, unreasonable comments that had thousands of upvotes. Communicating with the users of these comments was impossible, as they already reached the top comment section, and weren&#39;t responding to replies anymore. However what I <em>did</em> discover, was that responding to these massively upvoted comments with a disagreement, got you some bad karma within minutes. Like, -30 or more, karma, in 5 minutes,</p>

<p>As more time went on, I started seeing replies to posts and users that seemed plastic. Obvious cheerleader comments, very biased and angry replies, especially on <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> &amp; <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>. Massive <em>massive</em> circlejerks that were anti-arab, pro-military, pro-Israel, etc. Especially once the Gaza bullshit, and Boston Bombings (not in that order) occurred. All of the reasoning, all of the free conversation, started turning into CNN/Fox News, Yahoo type shit. Which seemed so bizarre to me, because I knew for a <em>fact</em> that most of the users I dealt with on Reddit were not this ignorant and prejudice. And I also noticed that if I changed the comment filter from &quot;top&quot; to &quot;new&quot; (clever, how you are automatically taken to &quot;top&quot; so you are forced to see the comments they want you to read first) people were commenting <em>on</em> the top comments. &quot;Anyone freaked out about how biased these guys are?&quot; It was a sick feeling.</p>

<p>One day, a baseball player named Chipper Jones tweeted about the FBI admitting that Sandy Hook was staged. He got trashed (naturally) on both <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> and <a href="/r/baseball">/r/baseball</a>. As a frequent visitor of <a href="/r/baseball">/r/baseball</a>, and skeptic of Sandy Hook (among other things) I started giving my opinion on the whole deal. The result, was, well...... <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/2v2837/chipper_jones_buys_into_the_sandy_hook_conspiracy/">this</a> </p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/2v1mpb/chipper_jones_is_apparently_a_nutjob_and_believes/codsbu9">Original post</a> </p>

<p>The replies I was getting were such BS. People claiming they knew Sandy Hook teachers and students who died, people who claimed they were school shooting survivors, how DARE I.....etc. It almost became comical, how fake the outrage was. I was being called anti-Semetic (for referencing Larry Silverstein) sociopathic, evil, NUTJOB......all sorts of fun things. I ended up deleting my account, as my inbox became littered daily. Personal attacks, threats, and all sorts of other hilarity. </p>

<p>I created another account (not this one), and for awhile I went back to making &quot;Reddit-esque&quot; comments. Making snarky, cutsie, &quot;wow what a lelful post OP&quot; comments. Then I just couldn&#39;t stomach it. Lately, almost <em>every</em> post I have come across, in <em>every</em> front page story, has gone out of it&#39;s way to bash &quot;<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>&quot; And they are using the most obvious tactics. It&#39;s ALWAYS &quot;they are anti-Semetic,&quot; &quot;Reptilians LOL&quot; &quot;JET FUEL CAN&#39;T BURN <em>insert stupid object here</em> crap. Of course, with just a village of people upvoting them. </p>

<p>It&#39;s become obvious to me that this is a shill run website. Ever since Aaron passed, this site has changed itself suspiciously.... ironic, since he died suspiciously. I think Reddit became too real, and appealed to too many freethinkers,  and was taken over by various MSM puppets. Now it&#39;s the cesspool we see now. Not sure if I want to play this game anymore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;People claiming they knew Sandy Hook teachers and students who died&quot;</p>

<p>I got that a lot as well.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe most of the people that claim this are paid shills, I suspect they are just people who know there&#39;s no way for you to not know they are lying, and any attempt you use to say they are lying will only serve to make you look like an uncaring bastard.</p>

<p>See, this is how this whole operation works.  It&#39;s all about manipulating people&#39;s empathy into making people accepting the beliefs they want them to believe, such as taking away people&#39;s guns and installing security everywhere.</p>

<p>Funny enough, this type of tactic (using one&#39;s empathy to manipulate them) is a common trait of a sociopath.  I&#39;m not saying these people are all sociopaths, but sociopaths thrive because they force others into also behaving as sociopaths, and most times they don&#39;t even realize it.</p>

<p>Sure, I&#39;ve no doubt there are shills here, but most are just people too stupid to understand what they are really doing, people that are too scared to not go with the group, or people that really just like picking on people and know no one will call them out for it.</p>

<p>My advice; don&#39;t let them get to you.  Try to develop a sense of humor about it.  For example; you&#39;ve seen a crack in their system.  Why do they need to bring up &quot;reptilians&quot;?  Why do they need to rely so much upon the &quot;jet fuel can&#39;t melt&quot; line?  Who are they trying to convince, and what are they trying to convince them of?</p>

<p>They aren&#39;t even talking to you, man.  They are talking to their peers, saying, &quot;Look how socially acceptable I am!  ACCEPT ME!&quot;</p>

<p>Laugh them off for the pathetic things they are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who had lived in CT for 10 years prior to Sandy Hook, I have to admit, and this is by no means quantifiable to any letter, but I&#39;d never even heard of Newtown prior to the &quot;shooting.&quot; After the event I talked with people from CT (I&#39;d already moved away) and it seemed like nobody I knew was a friend or relative or acquaintance or knew anybody from the town. The only people who seemed in any sort of way connected were the officials - troopers, firefighters, Dr. Carver, etc. Those who are from CT who believe it was a hoax are by far, in my experience, the most ardent deniers I&#39;ve met, and they will call people out in public, regardless of how their reputation may be harmed for doing so.</p>

<p>Although, conversely, there are numerous people in CT who get all teary-eyed and offended at the suggestion it didn&#39;t happen, because they <em>knew people who knew people</em> who were affected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Newtown is the name of the town, not the school. Considering I studied Geography in college in Connecticut, I think it was rather startling that after looking at maps of CT for years I had never noticed this town. That was all I was saying. The news made it seem like so many people in CT were affected by the tragedy but, having lived there for a decade, I wasn&#39;t connected to anyone in Newtown by any less than 3 degrees of separation, which is saying a lot considering the population of CT, the proximity of my town to Newtown, the close relationship between CT school sports, and the fact that New Englanders don&#39;t leave New England.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say I could name all of anything, just that this place had never made itself known to me. It never had an obligation to either, so it&#39;s not all that surprising. In a state as small as CT, there are a lot of things residents are unaware of, but in a state as small as CT, when the entire country and some parts of the world are more aware of and affected by things that happened in CT than residents across the state, red flags go up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amen, brother. That requires an incredible sense of self awareness though. So we mustn&#39;t forget to look out for each other. Great that you had the empathy to think of their part of the story. And empathy is exactly what makes the difference! I&#39;m constantly trying to make my peers think outside the box and empathise with their counterparts. Having the ability to see yourself from an outside perspective is what represents being awake to me. Wishing you the greatest day, Rick. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. That sandy hook thread in r/baseball is fucking disgusting.</p>

<p>The most obvious shill tactic is whenever anyone brings up &quot;lizard people or reptillians&quot; it&#39;s obvious disinfo and honestly as someone who has been in r/conspiracy for over 4 years, the last time I saw anyone post about reptiles was over 3 years ago, and they were destroyed for it.</p>

<p>Most people (rightfully so) in this sub believe reptillian theories to be disinfo, and so if anyone ever mentions reptillians as something r/conspiracy believes in, it&#39;s pretty obvious they are disinfo/shills or just simply ignorant. </p>

<p>And rightly so, for the FBI never &quot;admitted&quot; anything of the sort. Anyone making that claim is a gullible idiot who deserves whatever derision they get. This kind of nonsense and those who promote it, do unquantifiable damage to the field of conspiracies as a whole. </p>

<p>Sadly, a lot of the criticisms leveled at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are not unjustified. Some of the shit which gets massively upvoted here, e.g. satire, fake quotes, etc. is just cringeworthy. That the rest of Reddit realizes this, does not make it &quot;a shill run website.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve just provided all the proof necessary here to show that nothing will convince you. Im sorry to hear that is going to be the case here. Your link does an excellent job of exactly what you are claiming im guilty of... &quot;misrepresenting data&quot; while not properly showing the FBI stats are wrong.</p>

<p>If you did any amount of following the source you provide and claim as true you would see on Page 245 of the PDF they cite as the &quot;contradiction&quot;... the one with the lovely dedication to the victims, that is also lists 0 murders in Newtown. Page 12, which they cite as the debunk to alexjones? (idk why he&#39;s involved at all and sort of discredits this site by needing to mentioning him... we are talking facts here not  &quot;he said she said&quot;). Page 12 is the overall stats for CT and yes there are more then 27 murders though through cross reference with FBI numbers would be the exact same outcome. It is not until you examin the break down given by city that you find newtown sitting at 0. There is an note saying &quot;not including sandy hook victims&quot; (weird) but provides no place to reference such statistics. It should also be noted that no other links in this article do anything to provde proof of anything other then what the FBI, and now CT gov have provided as fact. Basically you gave us one more bit of info proving out point. </p>

<p>Im sure your intention was to just have us read this poorly framed attack on Alex Jones and feel satisfied that this random website owner is correct? im not sure what you were going for but it was a poor attempt. The one thing that would settle my dispute is if you could pull up the &quot;see state police misc.&quot; referenced on page 245. Until then i think the FBI stats hold firm.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>data maintained elsewhere by state police reports does account for the 27 deaths, which coincides with 27 rifle-related murders reported</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing to this claim is provided upon my assessment. And I hate being wrong, so trust me I checked. Hopefully you can put my question to rest, and hopefully not with some random website hating Jones (lol i cant get over how dumb that is. who cares about jones! hahaha) good luck friend</p>

<p>What? I couldn&#39;t parse anything approaching sense from your analysis. It&#39;s perfectly clear. The numbers for the cities don&#39;t include murders handled by state police - including Sandy Hook. You can squirm all you like, but the numbers 100% make sense. </p>

<p>It takes a phenomenally skewed prejudice to think this constitutes any kind of &quot;admission&quot; as alleged. But that&#39;s about par for the course with Sandy Hoaxers, who choose to interpret house-price place-holder data and even hair salon names as &quot;proof&quot; of their theories. This is just another case. </p>

<p>I guess when you&#39;ve no actual evidence, you need to interpret everything to fit your world view. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never really got into the comments or discussion except here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and <a href="/r/korea">/r/korea</a> my two favorite subreddits.  The reason for that is it&#39;s so anonymous.  Nobody knows if you&#39;re a shill or a real person.  Now there are tools to check your reddit stream and get a sense of whether you are real or not.  I use that service before commenting.</p>

<p>Mostly I share posts that are interesting to me, my comments lately have been mostly negative.</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t give a shit about karma.  Downvote me all you want...karma is useless IRL</p>
