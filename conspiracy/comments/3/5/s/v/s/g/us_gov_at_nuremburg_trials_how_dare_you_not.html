<p>but you really do spend a lot of your time and mental energy thinking about this nearly irrelevant thing that happened over half a century ago which is basically not even used in the social narrative in the western world anymore beyond Israel justifying a massive defense budget and aggression against it&#39;s neighbors (which the arab states in the region are fond of as well, as you can see is happening in Yemen right now).</p>

<p>What is it that you think would change about the world <em>at all</em> if suddenly everyone &quot;revised their view&quot; of the holocaust to &quot;something less dramatic&quot;?</p>

<p>absolutely nothing - that&#39;s the answer - so why do you care about it? Why do you not spend your time on issues of importance or actual relevance to the world that you live in today?

<p>I&#39;ve previously pointed out that it doesn&#39;t matter if the holocaust was a lie because of the contemporary struggle for freedom.  Moreover, hard evidence could never be uncovered without toppling the current power structure.  They either do not care or have a vested interest in distracting people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They say that those who don&#39;t know history are doomed to repeat it, but if our version of history is based on post-war propaganda, and we imprison/insult/discredit anyone who challenges this, how exactly are we supposed to learn?</p>

<p>The way I see it, I learned the Allies&#39; version of the Holocaust at school, and have been exposed to it ever since, so I&#39;m pretty well-versed in their version of events. Now I just want to look at it from another perspective. I really don&#39;t see why people should risk being insulted/discredited just for wanting to look at other points of view. Surely it&#39;s just common sense, especially when there are so many glaring inconsistencies in the official narrative. It&#39;s like a jury only being allowed to listen to the prosecution&#39;s case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“To initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.” The U.S.’s invasion and occupation of Iraq was a gratuitous enterprise of aggression that could be seen as justified only through the same “lens” used by Nazi Germany to justify what would later be seen as paradigmatic wars of aggression. There can be little doubt that the U.S. embarked on what it quite consciously and deliberately knew was a gratuitous war of aggression against Iraq, when measured according to the respected standards of Nuremberg.</p>

<p>The Nuremberg chief prosecutor’s statement may be read not only proscriptively, but also descriptively, and even prescriptively: i.e. the statement not only prohibits, following its logic, &quot;wars of aggression,&quot; it also describes with effective economy a thesis which may, in fact, be read as a determinative theory of what such wars of aggression inherently (either auto-dynamically or calculatedly) entail, namely: “the accumulated evil of the whole [of all other war crimes].” A given description may of course also be read as a prescription or, at least, as a concision of actual utilizable prescriptions contained elsewhere, so that in the case of the text in question one may reasonably conclude that its determinative--even tautological--theory (“it contains” [not it “may contain,” and not because it does, but because it is]) of totalizing “evil” inherent in all aggressive war may serve implicitly as a sort of “recipe,” or at the least as an instrumental prognosticator of the conditions requisite for the generation of such “supreme…accumulated evil.” In any case, Cheney, Rumsfeld, et al. were, of course, aware of the multifarious implications of this famous Nurembergian declaration and there can be little doubt that they perceived with the utmost clarity the tautological inerrancy of such statements where the belligerent aggressor is possessed of a war machine of the kind Nazi Germany or they themselves had at their disposal, and when the will (and the circuitous/reversible reasoning) is there to commit to a genuine war of aggression, i.e. to one that is sure, because it was so intended, to contain “the accumulated evil of the whole.” Abu Ghraib, we now know, was part of that intention and reasoning: of that project to create conditions of supreme evil, of the accumulated evil of the whole that still has not stopped accumulating, indeed, that now encompasses not only great swathes of the Middle East, but, in fact, the majority of the world, almost in the manner (ideologically, militarily, jurisprudentially, even constitutionally, etc.) of a Third World War (ostensibly, to be sure, on “terror”) which is the metastatic product and materialized reflect of that &quot;supreme evil which contains the accumulated evil of the whole,&quot; and which is itself a calculated, oscillative, and reciprocative function of the U.S.’s war of aggression against Iraq.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Nuremberg tribunal’s words have either proved of unexpected prophetic worth in the case of the Iraq War (unrivaled manifestation of the “accumulated evil of the whole” in the world today) or they shine an “abstractive” light, through a half open door, as it were, onto more of the intentions of the architects of said war. The Nuremberg tribunal was privy not only to the raisons d’État of Nazi Germany’s but of its constituent nations’ as well; such knowledge would surely be reflected in the most famous (because most communicative) phraseology of the tribunal’s, phraseology that cannot but shed light on the dynamics/logic of Great-Power wars today as well as then. Total aggressive war (“fascist war”) was not only a potential and realized strategy of Nazi Germany’s, it certainly was consistent with the plans/practices of other Great Powers as well; the empirical manifestation of war “contain[ing] within itself the accumulated evil of the whole” in Iraq, its metastasization to Libya, Syria, Yemen, etc, is a testimony to the tautological truth of a phrase that must be so because it was intended to be so and because it was so effectively realized; otherwise there would be no definitional guarantee that it would indeed be so (an aggressive war “contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole,” not it “may,” but it “does,” and it does because it must to be a completely realized “aggressive war,” which contains as part of its intrinsic purpose, as part of its “good” the effectuation of the “accumulated evil of the whole”–which is a legitimate use of certain wars if so judged by the only reason that operatively matters, that of raison d’État). Iraq surely qualifies on all fronts, as illegality of cause and of consequences (“the accumulated evil of the whole”) compels one to conclude illegality of purpose as well (e.g. fascist total war).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s because the definition of antisemitism is so broad. For example, expressing horror at watching Palestinian children being blown up is considered antisemitic in some circles.</p>

<p>I hate to think of a world where basic human compassion for parents watching their children being melted by white phosphorus is completely suppressed because some people equate that to racism, but that seems to be the way that some people/groups want it, unfortunately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>jesus, I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re so obsessed with this TTrns, I really thought you were just a troll here to stir up bullshit with constant links to &quot;jews are evil&quot; and &quot;the holocaust was really just a fun time at fun summer camps&quot; websites.</p>

<p>but you really do spend a lot of your time and mental energy thinking about this nearly irrelevant thing that happened over half a century ago which is basically not even used in the social narrative in the western world anymore beyond Israel justifying a massive defense budget and aggression against it&#39;s neighbors (which the arab states in the region are fond of as well, as you can see is happening in Yemen right now).</p>

<p>What is it that you think would change about the world <em>at all</em> if suddenly everyone &quot;revised their view&quot; of the holocaust to &quot;something less dramatic&quot;?</p>

<p>absolutely nothing - that&#39;s the answer - so why do you care about it? Why do you not spend your time on issues of importance or actual relevance to the world that you live in today? There are many - why not pick one of them instead? Not enough aryan nation backing for those other issues in your neo nazi punk social scene or something?</p>
