<p>The thermodynamic concept of blackbody radiation allows us to deduce the temperature of the molten streams by looking at their color (note: it does not matter what type of metal it is. All metals, once they reach their respective emissive/glowing temperature, will then glow the same color at the same temperature).</p>

<p>The color of those molten streams reveals that they are well above 1400 Celsius (way hotter than jet fuel can ever burn, no matter the conditions). And those towers had no natural gas lines; they were all electric. And accidental electrical arching could not produce that much molten metal before burning itself out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also interesting about this is that those towers used Asbestos as fireproofing and insulation &quot;extensively&quot; in it&#39;s construction, though the extent of which isn&#39;t really known. <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/01/18/asbestos-fireproofing-might-have-prevented-world-trade-center-collapse/">Fox news</a> says they got to the 38th floor, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos">one page</a> on wikipedia says it made it to the 64th floor, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_of_the_World_Trade_Center">this page</a> isn&#39;t really clear on where they stopped, but it cites an article from NYT from april 28, 1970 (which I&#39;m not able to locate) that claims either the Port Authority or the New York City Department of Air Resources or some other organization ordered workers to stop using spray-on insulation. WTC was completed in 1971 if i recall, and (I guess, hard to determine) the rest of the fireproofing was done with Vermiculite, although <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermiculite">until 1991</a> these products probably contained asbestos.</p>

<p>More interesting is <a href="http://www.nist.gov/manuscript-publication-search.cfm?pub_id=101279">this</a> : After the 1993 bombing, inspections found fireproofing to be deficient. The Port Authority was in the process of replacing it, but replacement had been completed on only 18 floors in WTC 1, including all the floors affected by the aircraft impact and fires on September 11, and on 13 floors in WTC 2, although only three of these floors (77, 78, and 85) were directly affected by the aircraft impact. </p>

<p>Wow what are the chances? The information surrounding the <em>actual</em> amount of fireproofing done, what materials were used and where, and the amount of asbestos that went into all that are difficult to get, apparently. Asbestos is one of the most effective fireproofing and insulation materials available, and certainly was at the time of WTC&#39;s construction. </p>

<p>NIST concluded that &quot;The existing condition of the fireproofing prior to aircraft impact and the fireproofing thickness on the WTC floor system did not play a significant role.&quot; </p>

<p>Read my original post. In trying to see the BEST the WTC conspirators have to offer in logical thought, so far I&#39;m not impressed that much. Tell me, why do you believe WTC was sketch when you have no hard evidence? Of course there are many answers that can&#39;t be answered, but to me your trying to insinuate and insert some bullshit cover up theory as your conclusion am I right?</p>

<p>&quot;We don&#39;t have all the information needed&quot; thus the CIA agent from Pluto must have planted bombs right?</p>

<p>is why you will never accept anything that will burst your precious princess bubble.</p>

<p>to say this:</p>

<p>then say this:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good question. We don&#39;t need to, and anyone who insists on that aspect is trying to distract from the important information there. What matters is the <em>temperature</em> of the metal, because that&#39;s what reveals that jet fuel could not have been responsible. It&#39;s constitution is irrelevant because all metals are blackbodies, so they will all emit the same wavelength of light at a given temperature (once they start glowing, that is. Different metals do <em>start</em> glowing at different temps, but once they&#39;re glowing, the color depends only on the temp). </p>

<li><p>Where did all the <strong><em>molten steel</em></strong> come from? There are several video recordings and 100&#39;s eye witnesses. Thermal satellite images from the WTC area, take the next day, clearly show the surface in the area, where the 3 buildings stood, having a very temperature. Fire fighters reported that their shoes would melt, when they walked across certain sections of the rubble, and that it continued like that for days. Why would fire fighters report seeing pools of molten steel beneath the WTC ruin for weeks after the attack? Jet fuel doesn&#39;t even burn at that high a temperature!

    <div class="md"><p>Okay. So the main argument is that per the B767&#39;s type certificate, the aircraft&#39;s Vd (design dive speed) is 420 kts calibrated airspeed, at or below 17,854 ft. The dive speed is the speed that the aircraft should never exceed to avoid structural damage. So, the conspiratards say,  it must be impossible for the plane to exceed that airspeed without damage, right? That makes sense... if you don&#39;t understand how that airspeed is defined. </p>

<p>The critical word here is DESIGN dive speed. Vd is not the speed at which an aircraft falls apart. It is the speed that the designers have SELECTED in order to MAKE SURE the aircraft never experiences structural damage. So this speed includes a hefty factor of safety to account for any gust loads, manufacturing defects, part wear over time, etc, etc. The reality is the aircraft could probably exceed this speed by over 50% and be no worse for wear.</p>

<p>In other words, Vd is the speed that the aircraft SHOULD NOT ever exceed - not the speed that it CANNOT ever exceed.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t believe me, read the FARs, the regulations that all aircraft flying in the US must comply with. The main concern when talking about dive speeds is aerodynamic flutter - oscillations in the wings and control surfaces that occur at very high speeds and eventually damage the airframe. FAR 23.629 states that up to <strong>1.2Vd - that&#39;s 504 kts in this case</strong> - the aircraft must be shown to be <strong>totally free</strong> of flutter. In order for actual structural failure to occur, there needs to be <em>extreme</em> flutter  going on that deflects the wings to the point where the airframe is stressed 1.5 times beyond its design limit load (this is the factor of safety applied to all airframe components). For reference, <a href="http://imgur.com/yU15gOt">this</a> is what a modern airplane wing looks like when it approaches structural failure.</p>

<p>To summarize, United 175 was traveling at a speed where engineers have calculated that it theoretically could, just barely, start to experience measurable flutter, which can lead to structural damage if it increases to the point of extreme oscillations.</p>

<p>Edit: Aaaaaand crickets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>The best proof we have is actually that the 767 can and did ly at 510kEAS</em> -   </p>

<p>The best proof is my <strong>1000ft Proof</strong> I recently completed, which prooves that the UA175 767 could not possibly have been flown by an amateur untrained pilot.
It is irrefutable.
Here is the main points:  </p>

<p>The 767 was built in about 1984 and was tested to meet the <a href="http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgFAR.nsf/0/1AF764F921FAD01C862568E900643105?OpenDocument">FAA/FAR regulations at the time</a>.<br/>
These require the plane to prove it can fly stable at Vd +20%.  This means at dive speed + 20%.<br/>
This is the maximum the plane can go without risk of crashing due to problems like flutter.  </p>

<p>The <a href="http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgMakeModel.nsf/0/a8694be7b7ac6c178625731e006944bc/$FILE/A1NM%20Rev%2026.pdf">Vd of this 767 (being a 767-200) was  420KCAS</a> at 1000ft.  which is easily converted to 420kEAS (at 1000ft it makes no difference).  </p>

<p>420 x 1.2 = 504 KEAS.  <em>(so this is what the plane was capable of with zero crash risk, provided it was diving)</em></p>

<p>UA175 was in a complex diving maneover right up to hitting the south tower, and was recorded doing 510knots ground speed, which after accounting for various factors/altitude wind etc is exactly...<br/>
...<a href="http://imgur.com/lxwoMK0">504KEAS</a>    </p>

<p>So on approach to the tower the plane was constantly doing 504KEAS, the maximum proven stable speed it can sustain without crashing.<br/>
Coincidence?  of course not.  An amateur pilot could not have sustained performance exactly on the knife edge like that.  </p>

<p><strong>This proves the plane was (at the very least) remotely controlled. They designed it to fly as fast as possible, with zero risk of any embarrassing crash that might expose the plot. (there are not convenient old underground mines everywhere you know ;)</strong></p>

<p>The official story does have holes, of course. As an engineering student, the NIST story does have holes. You can&#39;t make everything perfect. But the NIST hypothesis is far, far better than any alternative hypothesis out there. The only people who have problems with WTC for the most parts are people who never did and can&#39;t do the math. Go get an engineering degree. Claiming the government is &quot;hiding&quot; stuff proves nothing and isn&#39;t a groundbreaking thought. You could easily say Mexicans or aliens are hiding stuff. If you don&#39;t have exact names, or concrete plots, then you shouldn&#39;t be making nonsensical statements. And I think that is the problem with conspiracy theorist. They don&#39;t agree with X so it must be Y. Saying controlled demolition is ridiculous, but what is 10000x more ridiculous is automatically assuming that is <strong>must</strong> have been a &quot;government&quot; job. Why is that your conclusion? Its far more rational to just say terrorist planted the bombs there. Its just dumb to make hypothetical claims with no substance and expect others to believe it. Or I guess I&#39;m just not that dumb.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP why are you making arguments based on your own ignorance? You keep talking about how dumb it is to make hypothetical claims with no substance but have you actually done the research behind these &#39;hypothetical claims&#39;? Furthermore, you take one variable strand of thought within the conspiracy community and assume that the majority share an irrefutable belief in it. Again, this is because of your ignorance.</p>

<p>&quot;I too reject evolution as a scientific theory because I have never studied the subject and thus am qualified to assert that there is no evidence.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I too reject 9/11 conspiracy theories because I have never studied them and thus am qualified to assert that there is no substance behind them.&quot;</p>

<p>This is basically what you are demonstrating. Please, your ignorance DOES NOT qualify you as an expert on what is rational or not.</p>

<p>There are researchers who base their work on official documents, official policies and what was said on the record by government officials and qualified experts regarding 9/11. There are researchers who stick with their knowledge of their personal domains (be it piloting, engineering, physics, etc). There are some researchers who do work on hypotheticals and explore why it was possible that xxx could have been done (eg outlying the possibility of how explosives could be set up). There are some who see 9/11 as just another piece of the puzzle and see it as part of a grander narrative.</p>

<p>The comments you replied to only stuck to how the official story doesn&#39;t add up. You are the one projecting your assumptions of &#39;SO YOU ARE SAYING THEY SNUCK EXPLOSIVES IN?&quot;, &#39;dae martians&#39;, &#39;they dont agree with x so it must be y&#39;, &#39;secret goal of world power&#39;. You have a childish and naive idea on what the &#39;typical conspiracy theorist&#39; must be like and you have demonstrated your projections when the comments you replied to simply stated that the official story didn&#39;t add up and that the physics of the collapse of the buildings was off.</p>

You people never do any manth, you just run your mouth. If you SERIOUSLY want me to take you seriously, and also the general public, do the freaking mathematics like NIST, crunch numbers, do the stress and failure analysis, and then publish it.

<p>Did your mommy and daddy never teach you to ignore those kinds of people? It&#39;s not very &quot;scientific&quot; of you... </p>

<p>Just because one person or a few people may have said something stupid or rude (and forgive me if I don&#39;t see any of this mass persecution you&#39;re claiming) doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s OK for you to act like an asshat towards everyone. </p>

<p>There were a number of people here who took you seriously and responded in kind. Maybe you didn&#39;t like the information they provided, or how they provided it. Fair enough. A reasonable response to this would have been &quot;do you have a source on that information?&quot; or &quot;I disagree with you and here is why...&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s any sold evidence for that claim.&quot; </p>

<p>Not &quot;you&#39;re not an engineer so you&#39;re full of shit.&quot; And not &quot;so aliens put bombs into the WTC.&quot;</p>

<p>You&#39;re not an engineer. But that doesn&#39;t seem to bother you because you know stuff. Has it occurred to you that people who disagree with you might also know stuff? Furthermore, there are engineers on both sides of the argument (if you&#39;d cared to pay attention to what some others were telling you, you might have noticed this), so I&#39;m not entirely sure what your crusade is about on this notion. A superiority complex maybe? </p>

<p>Nobody here, other than you, said anything about aliens. And people here were right to call you out on that bullshit, and you just continued to peddle it.</p>

<p>Quite frankly, I don&#39;t blame any of them for not having a shred of respect for you or anything you have to say after you pulled that kind of shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are you talking about? Nist claims it has done some math, but hasn&#39;t released its mathmatical Model, because it would jeopardize public safety.

    <div class="md"><p>The whole idea that a structural engineer would actual need those files in order to evaluate NIST&#39;s work has always been ridiculous. NIST released over 8000 files and NIST released all of the blueprints and architectural drawings for the building. Moreover, NIST released about 2000 pages documenting its major assumptions and methodologies in the form of the NIST reports. Why would someone need NIST&#39;s files to create a collapse model? NIST didn&#39;t need NIST&#39;s files to create a collapse model. All of the evidence NIST had is now in the public domain. Actual structural engineers who do serious work have absolutely no problem evaluating, and even using as a basis for further research, NIST&#39;s methodologies and conclusions. </p>

<p>So you can lie and make that claim all you want. Just becsuse they didnt release it doesn&#39;t mean a model of the collapse cannot be made, unless you want to assert that only NIST&#39;s engineers are capable of making such a model, which doesn&#39;t bode well for all the conspiracy theorists who claim to be able to evaluate it.</p>

<p>Yes Terrorists, ones who would use fear as a political tool did this. But who are these terrorists?

<p>In all other matters of truth it&#39;s simple to gather scientific evidence and convince a crowd of people.

    <div class="md"><p>That is irrelevant to the point I am making.  The government is something we know is real and exists and has been involved in covert affairs and coverups in the past.  Thus, assuming that people working within our government were involved (even just tacitly) in allowing 9-11 to occur or in covering up some of the actual findings (which we know is the case from the 28 pages they redacted which implicate countries that our supposed to be our allies in the funding of the attack) is MORE PROBABLE than saying &quot;aliens did it.&quot;  You are trying to say that if you don&#39;t know WHO SPECIFICALLY did WHAT EXACTLY then you can&#39;t make a broad assessment of what you think COULD HAVE happened.  That&#39;s just not the case.  It isn&#39;t 50/50.  &quot;If you don&#39;t know WHO EXACTLY did it then it has to be the official story!&quot;  That&#39;s not the way it works.  There is a lot of grey area in between.  It is reasonable for someone to assume that the government has been overly and unnecessarily secretive about what happened before and after the fact.  </p>

<p>Do I think elements of our government orchestrated this whole thing and had explosives planted in the towers to bring them down? No, not likely.  However I do think that factions within our government had intel from Israel and other Mid-Eastern allies informing us that an attack was likely and didn&#39;t do everything they could to stop it and then covered up just how much they knew and redacted intel implicating Saudi Arabia and Pakistan (and possibly Israel) in the funding of the attack because we wanted to remain allies with them and THEN hijacked the attack as an excuse to run into Iraq while everyone in America was bloodthirsty for revenge (and kick off the PNAC foreign policy of prolonged war in the Middle East).  That scenario is much more likely than &quot;aliens did it.&quot;  If you don&#39;t understand that then I dunno what to tell ya.  That&#39;s probability theory.  If you wanna use &quot;science and math&quot; as the backbone of your arguments surely you can appreciate probability theory.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are the one who said saying &quot;the government could have been involved&quot; is the same as saying &quot;aliens did it&quot; which is a mathematically false statement on your behalf.  And with the &quot;hard evidence&quot; you deal with.. Is the testimony of congressmen who have seen the 28 pages of redacted Intel from the 9-11 commission report &quot;hard evidence?&quot;  Because they said it implicates middle eastern allies of ours in funding the attack but our government released edition of the report (after removing the 28 pages) says Al-Qaeda under the direction of Bin Laden and no country or government funding.  Soooo somebody is lying.  Either congressmen who saw the unedited report or the government official report released to the public.. Either way elements in the government are being deceptive.. That&#39;s a fact.</p>

<p>And just so you know, mr. &quot;I only deal with science!&quot; Just because I don&#39;t offer specific names doesn&#39;t mean nothing I say can be right.

<p>Either way, I&#39;m somewhere between the official story and they knew about it but let it happen.

Possibly the president and his staff, maybe just some generals. There is literally no way I can know who.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were 3 violations of physics in the twin tower collapses.</p>

<p>Once the top portion of the south tower began tilting</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/Kwb8A">http://imgur.com/Kwb8A</a></p>

<p>It should have conserved it&#39;s momentum and continued to tilt, falling over beside the lower undamaged floors.
It did not. Having hit nothing in mid air to change its direction of motion, it changed direction anyway from tilting sideways to falling straight down. The only explanation possible for this that does not defy physics is that at the  instant that picture was taken the entire top portion of the building was shattered into small pieces which then conserved momentum by each small piece taking a much smaller arc in its fall and thereby changing its direction in mid air.The government position doesn&#39;t allow for this.  The second violation of physical law was that both towers fell in the direction of most resistance. That cannot happen normally.</p>

<p>It can be made to happen only by having the entire building become tiny fragments before they fell.. Those fragments could then  fall the way they did and also be falling in the direction of least resistance as they should.</p>

<p>The third violation of physics ( If the government position is to be believed) is in the debris piles which I have described in another comment in this thread.</p>

<p>On explosives could make the debris accumulate the way it did. Gravity would leave a completely different configuration of the debris at the end of collapse.</p>

<p>Not even the government can violate the laws of physics. </p>

<p>If their version was true then they did. If our version is true,  and it is,  no such violations were necessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When the structural integrity of a floor changes (which could happen because, oh I don&#39;t know, a plane filled with fuel flew into it and burst into flames heating the metal construction) , it will fail and the upper floors will start to move downwards. When they impact the floor below the one that has just failed, a force will be exerted on them.</p>

<p>Newton&#39;s 3rd Law is all well and good but all three laws should be taken into account as they are a homogenous set</p>

<p>In the following example I&#39;m going to be using some actual physics calculations here (Potential Energy formula - P=mgh). If you disagree with them then can I suggest you publish your amended formulae and await your Nobel prize?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll keep the numbers simple so that we can all understand
Imagine a column (built in a similar fashion to WTC 1+2 and not a Jenga pile) that is 100 levels tall. Each level weighs a metric tonne and is a metre high.</p>

<p>Now imagine that the structural integrity of level 80 is compromised and fails. In an instant, there is a mass 21 tonnes (21000 kg) in free fall. After falling for 1m, this mass impacts onto level 79 with a kinetic energy of 205.8kJ. Not all energy is conserved as it will be converted into heat, noise etc but it will affect the integrity of level 79 and the end result is the failure of level 79 pretty quickly.</p>

<p>We now have a mass of 22 tonnes falling and impacting level 78. Even if we imagine the mass had come to a complete top and a free-fall of only 1m occurs, 78 would encounter an impact producing 215.6kJ. However, I would imagine that levels 79 to 100 would not stop completely free-falling and so the energy would be higher. Again, some energy will be converted into heat, affect level 78 and fall again. Repeat until levels 2-80 have failed
By the time levels 2-100 have collapsed, even if they only impacted level 1 as if they free-fell 1m, the energy produced would be 1455.3kJ. Once floor 1 collapses, levels 2-99 are still falling. Once the mass of levels 2-80 is at ground level, levels 81-100 would the give way due to the shockwave going back up through the tower.</p>

<p>Each floor is only designed to support (repel) the energy produced by mass bearing down on it (with some tolerance). This energy is dispersed into the surrounding structure. When half the structure of a few floors has been removed (by, possibly, a place flying into it and exploding), the energy is forced into the remaining structure and the remaining tolerance is lowered. The kinetic energy of a mass falling onto it (K=0.5mv2) means that that tolerance is exceeded and a failure is an almost certainty.</p>

<p>Read them. Here&#39;s the difference between me and you, I will actually read your weak ass link when I get to it, and offer a refutation.

Because I&#39;ve had too many of these discussions to know the behavior or people like yourself. The dead giveaway is that you don&#39;t have technical knowledge. This is always a 99% certain failure of discussions, when one party isn&#39;t technical in their understanding. You posted a link you don&#39;t fuckin understand to begin with, probably just read the title, didn&#39;t read the methodology, or do the fucking math, but then post it and expect me to offer a response, and when I do (because I damn will) your going to dismiss it, because you never understood it in the first place.

He will say the burden of proof is on all of you but there is no proof. It is all hypothesis and speculation. Maybe in a hundred years we will know the truth or maybe we wont. Its in the past now. What&#39;s done is done and whether it was some super secret government inside job agenda to steal away our civil liberties and take us into a pre-emptive war in the middle east  or was a legitimate terrorist attack, the damage is done. No one will ever know the truth of it and those who learn may very possibly find themselves &quot;missing&quot;. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all very interesting to speculate on the what ifs but does it really matter when no one but us is paying the price? What if it was true that the government orchestrated it all and we had proof positive and the proverbial smoking gun? what would you do about it? Nothing.. That&#39;s what.. You would read the headlines and outrage on social media would ensue but ultimately nothing would happen. maybe a few fall guys would go down for it but again.. the damage is done.. </p>

 Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9/11 World Trade Center Catastrophe
pp.7-31 (25) Authors:

<p>Abstract</p>

<p>We have discovered distinctive red/gray chips in all the samples we have studied of the dust produced by the destruction of the World Trade Center. Examination of four of these samples, collected from separate sites, is reported in this paper. These red/gray chips show marked similarities in all four samples. One sample was collected by a Manhattan resident about ten minutes after the collapse of the second WTC Tower, two the next day, and a fourth about a week later. The properties of these chips were analyzed using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The red material contains grains approximately 100 nm across which are largely iron oxide, while aluminum is contained in tiny plate-like structures. Separation of components using methyl ethyl ketone demonstrated that elemental aluminum is present. The iron oxide and aluminum are intimately mixed in the red material. When ignited in a DSC device the chips exhibit large but narrow exotherms occurring at approximately 430 °C, far below the normal ignition temperature for conventional thermite. Numerous iron-rich spheres are clearly observed in the residue following the ignition of these peculiar red/gray chips. The red portion of these chips is found to be an unreacted thermitic material and highly energetic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is not a single major professional engineering organization that has spoken out against the NIST report&#39;s conclusions and many that have explicitly endorsed it:</p>

<p>• The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitats explicitly endorsed NIST&#39;s WTC 7 findings: <a href="http://www.ctbuh.org/Publications/TechnicalGuides/CommentsonNISTWTC7/tabid/739/language/en-US/Default.aspx">http://www.ctbuh.org/Publications/TechnicalGuides/CommentsonNISTWTC7/tabid/739/language/en-US/Default.aspx</a></p>

<p>• The AIA not only explicitly endorsed NIST&#39;s WTC 7 findings, <a href="http://911blogger.com/news/2009-08-22/letter-aia-president-richard-gage-aia">http://911blogger.com/news/2009-08-22/letter-aia-president-richard-gage-aia</a>, it explicitly rejected Richard Gage&#39;s contrary claims: <a href="http://www.architectmagazine.com/architecture/architects-shy-from-truther-conspiracy-theory_1.aspx">http://www.architectmagazine.com/architecture/architects-shy-from-truther-conspiracy-theory_1.aspx</a></p>

<p>• The ICC has also accepted NIST&#39;s conclusions as valid and commenced debate on NIST&#39;s recommendations: <a href="http://www.iccsafe.org/cs/CTC/Pages/NIST-WorldTradeCenterRecommendations.aspx">http://www.iccsafe.org/cs/CTC/Pages/NIST-WorldTradeCenterRecommendations.aspx</a></p>

<p>• Stanford&#39;s engineering department has also endorsed NIST&#39;s conclusions, <a href="https://blume.stanford.edu/content/collapse-performance-assessment-steel-framed-buildings-under-fires">https://blume.stanford.edu/content/collapse-performance-assessment-steel-framed-buildings-under-fires</a>, and engineers there continue to research based on NIST&#39;s findings: <a href="https://engineering.stanford.edu/news/stanford-engineers-study-911-lessons-how-help-buildings-withstand-threats">https://engineering.stanford.edu/news/stanford-engineers-study-911-lessons-how-help-buildings-withstand-threats</a></p>

<p>• And many other prominent structural engineers and building code experts are on record explicitly endorsing NIST&#39;s conclusions: <a href="http://enr.construction.com/news/buildings/archives/080903.asp">http://enr.construction.com/news/buildings/archives/080903.asp</a></p>

<p>In short, the support for NIST&#39;s WTC 7 conclusions is incredibly extensive, robust, and nearly universal among actual structural engineers. In contrast, there are ZERO peer reviewed critiques of NIST&#39;s WTC 7 report, ZERO PhD structural engineers on record supporting an alternative collapse hypothesis, and ZERO high-rise specialized structural engineers with any level of degree on record supporting an alternative hypothesis. (For example, there are less than 50 members of ae911truth who claim to be structural engineers, none of them claim to be high-rise experts, none of them have PhDs, and less than half of them even have masters degrees: <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/signatures/ae.html.">http://www.ae911truth.org/signatures/ae.html.</a>) The support for NIST&#39;s WTC 7 report&#39;s methodologies and conclusions is thus overwhelming among those qualified to truly evaluated it. If that isn&#39;t a scientific consensus, I don&#39;t know what one is.</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>The failure of shear studs is surprising, and has been modeled in a simplistic way, which may overstate the failure of this element. Prior studies and real fire cases have not previously identified shear stud failures as a significant  possibility.  </p>

<hr/>

<p>It is difficult to understand why the top bolts of the girder would fail at Column 79. Such failure would mean the slab had moved relative to column 79.  </p>

<p>The report is rather confusing because the floor alalysis is considered in Sections 8, 11 and 12. It would be better if there was a complete reconciliation of the analysis model.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lets go ahead and use the entire section of the report that you pulled their disagreement from.</p>

<p>&quot;The Draft NIST Report on World Trade Center 7 is a COMPREHENSIVE<br/>
assessment of the events that led to its collapse. </p>

<p>The Council does not agree with the NIST statement that the failure was a 
result of the buckling of Column 79. We believe that the failure was a result of the collapse of the floor structure that led to loss of lateral restraint and then buckling of internal columns. This is an important distinction, as NIST appears 
to be seeking improved performance from floors rather than columns.&quot; </p>

<p>As you can see, the council agrees with the report but has some minor issues. They do not contradict the NIST&#39;s conclusion that fire induced progressive collapse was the cause of the building&#39;s collapse instead show some concerns regarding the conclusions that column 79 buckled instead of the floor below. Again, they fully support fire induced progressive collapse which conspiracy theorists claim cannot happen. There are again no professional engineering organizations with expertise in structural engineering or even achiteture that disagrees with the NIST report. Only YouTubers and a few fringe scientists.</p>

Cause they still agreed with the report and they still agreed with the over aching conclusion that WTC 7 fell through progressive collapse after the structural members had been suffeciently weakened by fire. You still haven&#39;t even put a dent into the mountian of support for the official narrative and even weakened your arguement by showing that only 99 of the 6700 achitects in the IAI even support the vote coming in fall. </p>

<p>Edit: and those 99 signing a petition doesn&#39;t change the fact that the IAI has already shown support for the NIST report and will most likely will continue to support the report since this vote will likely only feature the 99 names on the petition voting to reopen the investigation and the other 6600 voting to keep the original narrative. If in the fall, the IAI actually does choose to reopen the investigation then the conspiracy theorists might actually have an authority organization to back them up. Until then, the official stance has not changed therefore they still report the official narrative. </p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>The specific objectives were:</p>

<ol>
<li>Determine why and how WTC 1 and WTC 2 collapsed following the initial impacts of the aircraft and why and how WTC 7 collapsed. [...]</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>(NIST NCSTAR 1, p. xxxix)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The focus of the investigation was on the sequence of events from the instant of aircraft impact to the initiation of collapse for each tower. For brevity in this report, this sequence is referred to as the ‘probable collapse sequence,’ although it includes little analysis of the structural behaviour of the tower after the conditions for collapse initiation were reached and collapse became inevitable.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>(ibidem, p. 82)</p>

<hr/>

<p>Note 1: The official NIST report explicitly states it failed to meet its prime objective and does not cover the collapse mode at all. </p>

<p>Instead, it refers to Bazant/Zhou, a paper outlined on September 13th, 2001: &quot;Why did the WTC towers collapse - A Simple Analysis&quot;, which also does not cover the collapse mode at all and instead only proves that after a one-floor free-fall of the top block on the base, the impacted floor would be crushed - and infers that therefor, the whole tower was &quot;doomed&quot;. </p>

<p>Note 2: The work on which the official explanation hinges is unscientific and not backed by experiments and does not cover the collapse mode at all. </p>

<p>It is therefor not clear how you can find the official story explains things the best if they do not at all explain the collapse mode, and do not even try to. </p>

<p>All other theories (domino effect, fracture wave, pancake) are to be discarded as &quot;non-canonical&quot; and shall not be the subject of my debunking, but I will give Bazant/Verdure a second chance to explain the first work: in &quot;Mechanics of Progressive Collapse&quot;, it is said in Eq. 6 that the gravitational potential energy of the towers was greater - by an order of magnitude - than the potential, tensile, internal energy keeping it all together and standing up, so in other words, that the towers were heavier than they could support. By an order of magnitude. </p>

<p>Note 3: One of the world&#39;s leading authorities says that W[g] &gt; W[p].</p>

<hr/>

<p>Wait, that was not it. That was the foreplay.</p>

<p>Because those are experts, and experts have their ways to quarrel among themselves, and the most of us are probably laypeople. </p>

<p>So what can we do? We can trust this expert and discard the other, we can choose who puts forward the best arguments - or we can experiment. </p>

<p>I therefor challenge you to name, to build, to come up with an example, model, experiment or Gedankenexperiment where a free-standing, tall, slender structure does what the Twins did. </p>

<p>No matter at which scale and of which material it is built.</p>

<p>It must totally, completely, rapidly fall through and/or out of itself from top to bottom when the top third is dropped on the lower two thirds, and do so roughly within 200% free fall time. </p>

<p>It must not be WTC 1 or 2, of course. </p>

<p>It must not fall over, topple, or lean; or buckle or shear or break as a whole. Just come down from top to bottom, ejaculating the stuff it is made of in all directions, if need be. </p>

<p>Depending on how you are inclined, </p>

<ul>
<li><p>the length to which you will go to explain that any experimentation or comparison would be useless because the sheer size of the towers nullifies any attempt at a layman&#39;s review of Bazants allegations, or </p></li>
<li><p>the lengths to which you will have to go to build such a contraption and make it work <em>reliably</em>, </p></li>
</ul>

<p>is <em>my</em> best scientific argument that the WTC was a dirty, but one of the best and most complicated CDs ever: the energy required to bring the towers down was already hidden INSIDE them, in one form or another, and was not introduced with a plane. </p>

<p>Because things don&#39;t suddenly, completely collapse from top to bottom through and out of themselves without being specifically designed to do so. </p>

<p>Have I cross-checked my facts? You bet I did. I did the experiments, I did the math, I read the literature, I understood the physics, and if you wish, I&#39;ll assist you in doing the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Newton&#39;s first law (conservation of momentum).</p>

<p>Yes, I know gravity is accelerating whatever part of the tower is already falling downwards.</p>

<p>Assume the official &quot;pancake theory&quot; fairy tale has any truth to it.   At the moment that the upper floors impact each other floor to send it moving with them, that next floor added to the falling set is starting from rest, and there is a momentum transfer from the upper floors to it <strong>which must slow the upper floors down</strong>.  Even assuming the towers have <strong>zero</strong> structural integrity, and a light tap starts each floor falling, without any momentum transfer from the building to the ground, whatsoever, and even treating the floors as having uniform mass throughout the building, ignoring any air resistance, etc, this slight slowdown as each floor is pancaked adds up to meaning the collapse would take <strong>at least</strong> ~45 seconds.</p>

<p>Actually, it would need to be much slower than that because a) there were actually 3 sets of floors in the towers, with the top set being the lightest and the bottom set the most massive, built to support the weight above it, and b) the towers were not a house if cards, so there would be substantial momentum transfer into the ground.</p>

<p>Instead, we see one of the towers fall in 9-10 seconds, and the other in 10-11 seconds, both near freefall speeds from the top.   The only way this is possible is if the <strong>lower</strong> portion of the building is actually falling <strong>first</strong>, and nearly all structural support is removed, as in a controlled demolition, not a fire near the top.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best proof is my <strong>1000ft Proof</strong> I recently completed, which prooves that the UA175 767 could not possibly have been flown by an amateur untrained pilot.<br/>
It is irrefutable.  </p>

<p>Here is the main points:  </p>

<p>The 767 was built in about 1984 and was tested to meet the <a href="http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgFAR.nsf/0/1AF764F921FAD01C862568E900643105?OpenDocument">FAA/FAR regulations at the time</a>.<br/>
These require the plane to prove it can fly stable at Vd +20%.  This means at dive speed + 20%.<br/>
This is the maximum the plane can go without risk of crashing due to problems like flutter.  </p>

<p>The <a href="http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgMakeModel.nsf/0/a8694be7b7ac6c178625731e006944bc/$FILE/A1NM%20Rev%2026.pdf">Vd of this 767 (being a 767-200) was  420KCAS</a> at 1000ft.  which is easily converted to 420kEAS (at 1000ft it makes no difference).  </p>

<p>420*1.2 = 504 KEAS.</p>

<p>UA175 was in a complex diving maneover right up to hitting the south tower, and was recorded doing 510knots ground speed, which after accounting for various factors/altitude wind etc is exactly...<br/>
...<a href="http://imgur.com/lxwoMK0">504KEAS</a>    </p>

<p>So on approach to the tower the plane was constantly doing 504KEAS, the maximum proven stable speed it can sustain without crashing.<br/>
Coincidence?  of course not.  An amateur pilot could not have sustained performance exactly on the knife edge like that.  </p>

<p><strong>This proves the plane was (at the very least) remotely controlled. They designed it to fly as fast as possible, with zero risk of any embarrassing crash that might expose the plot. (there are not convenient old underground mines everywhere you know ;)</strong></p>

Sure it kills more people but who are the conspirators and what are their motives? Not merely killing people, something bigger than that I guess?
Ok, it creates a more memorable disaster but at greater risk of exposure.
Ensuring insurance payout? Who are we assuming to be the conspirators? If it&#39;s the government, why would they care about insurance payout?</p>

<p>The buildings turned to dust in mid-air as they fell.  <a href="https://youtu.be/dueVm1UGvXo">Stop this video at any point</a>, and huge trails of dust can be seen trailing behind everything that is falling.  It&#39;s not smoke, nor is it ash, as the walls of the building were not on fire.  It is dust.  The buildings turned to dust as they fell.  <a href="http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories/images/groundzero.jpg">There weren&#39;t 2 piles of &quot;110 pancaked floors&quot; when it was all over.</a>  </p>

<p>The next morning, people were asking questions...&quot;Where is all the debris?&quot;  Peter Jennings asked shithead tool-on-the-scene George Stephanopoulos what happened to all the debris.  He said he spoke to a volunteer worker (Robert Gurlinsky?) who told him <a href="https://youtu.be/GdBQOe85i3M">both buildings &quot;simply fell down into the ground and were pulverized-evaporated.&quot;</a></p>

<p><em>Simply.</em></p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how it was done, but the top 20 floors didn&#39;t crush the lower 90 floors into dust, then turn themselves into dust.  It doesn&#39;t matter how many times the lie is told, it&#39;s still a lie.  God didn&#39;t change the basic laws of physics that day to please Bin Laden.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All we have is speculation.  As I said, I don&#39;t know what caused them to turn to dust.  But they did.  If you look through all my comments, you&#39;ll find I&#39;ve never once used the term &quot;energy weapon&quot;, or &quot;space-based&quot; or anything like that.  </p>

<p>And I doubt nuclear weapons were used---at least not conventional nuclear weapons---because the electricity remained on and no one complained that their digital clocks stopped working.  Whatever was used to turn the buildings to dust was &quot;unconventional&quot;, in that we&#39;ve never seen it used before.</p>

<p>But when you get right down to the nut-cutting, it doesn&#39;t matter what method or device was used, because we have enough information to know the official story is a lie, and the people responsible must be brought to justice.</p>

If you do you&#39;ll come to the conclusion that 9/11 was a nuclear demolition. What you&#39;re describing about the buildings turning into dust in mid-air is a direct effect of a nuclear bomb as it atomizes the object. This theory may sound crazy, but I urge looking into it. The reason it sounds crazy to someone at first is because they&#39;re used to thinking of atmospheric nuclear explosions with a huge mushroom cloud etc.., this was an underground detonation however. The bombs were required to be placed under the towers so that they had a way to bring them down if need be. The twin towers underground foundations were 27 meters beneath the surface, the 150 kiloton thermo-nuclear demolition charges were positioned at depths of 77 meters (measuring from the surface), or 50 meters below their underground foundations under granite rock. The bomb explodes underneath and then goes to the point of least resistance going up the tower above and pulverizing it and everything in it into dust. <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_uranium26.htm">This article</a> explains it a bit better and has descriptive pictures also. Interesting that if you look in any dictionary before 9/11, &#39;Ground Zero&#39; has one definition, &quot;the point at, or above or below of a nuclear detonation&quot;. </p>

<p>The nuke theory does fit the mass pulverization and lack of building material, but there are a few holes.   </p>

<p>Why were there no EMP outages reported?</p>

<p>I like the underground nuke theory, but one problem is when they detonate the 1st nuke the blast radius would compromise the area where the 2nd nuke was.  There would be no way to detonate the 2nd tower, it would have to be done at the the same time; but wasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>I dunno, something doesn&#39;t add up to turn all those buildings to dust.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t get me wrong... I have no doubt &#39;scalar weapons&#39; are capable of things like this ... and <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xrcu9h_history-channel-that-s-impossible-weather-warfare_tech">other, wider alterations</a> to things we&#39;d otherwise not imagine possible....</p>

<p>..... but, why take it there? Why not just &#39;assume&#39; that there was an insurance policy on the building where the providers gave those insured a &#39;discount&#39; on price if they implemented additional systems/measures that limited collateral damage?</p>

<p>Ex: if i have side-impact airbags, my insurance is cheaper. </p>

<p>in such that, if a building is about to collapse (for &#39;whatever&#39; reason... plane, earthquake, terrorist attack, tornado, &#39;whatever&#39;) ... instead of that building coming down in an uncontrolled manner and directly affecting other buildings that the policy would <em>also</em> have to cover...</p>

<p>....instead of having to risk the lives of demolitions experts going in to plant charges post-damage.... </p>

<p>....just have the systems already installed to bring the building down in a controlled manner.</p>

<p>of course there would need to be protections against the public knowing about this... but that&#39;s nothing that a city... esp a city the size, with the complexity, and with the number of large buildings that NYC has... ...couldn&#39;t agree to do and to keep a secret within the upper political ranks, building codes, FEMA ordinances, etc.</p>

<p>For the sake of <em>not</em> raising a hooha over all the people that could&#39;ve been &#39;potentially saved&#39; as the building sit there in shambles... a decision to &#39;pull it&#39; is made... <em>during</em> the heat of the attack... and, well, viola, building collapses.</p>

<p>from an insurance (<em>and</em> re-insurance) perspective, it was probably cheaper to do a pay out to the families of the deceased than to deal with countless <em>more</em> medical expenses... and <em>then</em> deal with payout towards those... and potential death likely associated with them.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that the technical capabilities to take down the WTCs... or any other building, fault line, or &#39;other&#39; <em>doesn&#39;t</em> exist (I personally believe that it <em>does</em>) ... but there are simpler explanations for it.</p>

<p>colder in many ways ... because they&#39;re more widespread precalculated, and involve more parties.</p>

<p>also,... going with the idea that it <em>was</em> a conspiracy... the buildings <em>not</em> falling down <em>doesn&#39;t</em> have the same effect ... ....when you&#39;re trying to get 1) global sympathy and 2) populous support for multi-trillion dollar wars that will last well over a decade... ... an effect of that magnitude is all but necessary.   ...vs to buildings hit, f&#39;ed up, <em>eventually</em> brought down (possibly) ... and, well, months to <em>years</em> of debate over whether or not to do so.</p>

<p>again... I believe it&#39;s technologically plausible that it happened the way the &#39;scalar weapon theory&#39; purports... but, Occam&#39;s razor kinda leans me towards thinking thermite is the more likely cause</p>

<p>the top floors would just need to be designed <em>to</em> turn into dust in such that it&#39;s harder to predict where they&#39;ll fall ... vs the ones closer to the ground. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is irrelevant to the point I am making.  The government is something we know is real and exists and has been involved in covert affairs and coverups in the past.  Thus, assuming that people working within our government were involved (even just tacitly) in allowing 9-11 to occur or in covering up some of the actual findings (which we know is the case from the 28 pages they redacted which implicate countries that our supposed to be our allies in the funding of the attack) is MORE PROBABLE than saying &quot;aliens did it.&quot;  You are trying to say that if you don&#39;t know WHO SPECIFICALLY did WHAT EXACTLY then you can&#39;t make a broad assessment of what you think COULD HAVE happened.  That&#39;s just not the case.  It isn&#39;t 50/50.  &quot;If you don&#39;t know WHO EXACTLY did it then it has to be the official story!&quot;  That&#39;s not the way it works.  There is a lot of grey area in between.  It is reasonable for someone to assume that the government has been overly and unnecessarily secretive about what happened before and after the fact.  </p>

<p>Do I think elements of our government orchestrated this whole thing and had explosives planted in the towers to bring them down? No, not likely.  However I do think that factions within our government had intel from Israel and other Mid-Eastern allies informing us that an attack was likely and didn&#39;t do everything they could to stop it and then covered up just how much they knew and redacted intel implicating Saudi Arabia and Pakistan (and possibly Israel) in the funding of the attack because we wanted to remain allies with them and THEN hijacked the attack as an excuse to run into Iraq while everyone in America was bloodthirsty for revenge (and kick off the PNAC foreign policy of prolonged war in the Middle East).  That scenario is much more likely than &quot;aliens did it.&quot;  If you don&#39;t understand that then I dunno what to tell ya.  That&#39;s probability theory.  If you wanna use &quot;science and math&quot; as the backbone of your arguments surely you can appreciate probability theory.  </p>

The action and the reaction are simultaneous, and it does not matter which is called the action and which is called reaction; both forces are part of a single interaction, and neither force exists without the other.[24]</p>
