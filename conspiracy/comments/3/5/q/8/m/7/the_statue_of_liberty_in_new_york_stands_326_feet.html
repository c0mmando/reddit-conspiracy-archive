        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;The distance at which lights can be seen at sea entirely disposes of the idea that we are living on a huge ball.&quot; -Thomas Winship</p>

<p>NASA and modern astronomers claim we are living on an oblate spheroid 25,000 statute miles in equatorial circumference with a curvature of 7.395 inches to the mile, varying inversely as the square of the distance, meaning in 3 miles there is a declination of nearly 6 feet, in 30 miles 600 feet, in 300 miles 60,000 feet and so on. Therefore, if we wish to prove or disprove the validity of their convexity claim, it is a fairly simple, straight forward matter of measurements and calculations.</p>

<p>Please try this at home and see for yourself. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/6dXYC">Here</a> are some figures to help you out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Prove how at 60 miles away the drop is 2,072 feet. Show your results.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using 3963 miles as the radius of the Earth (R), we&#39;ll use the 3rd equation from the figures and skip the derivation. For our &quot;x&quot; value we use 60 miles that Lady Liberty is visible from.</p>

<p>Î´ = sqrt( R<sup>2</sup> + x<sup>2</sup> ) - R = sqrt( (3963 mi)<sup>2</sup> + (60 mi)<sup>2</sup> ) - 3963 mi = 0.45417533746692364446424758347828 mi</p>

<p>0.45417533746692364446424758347828 mi = 2398.0458 ft</p>

<p>The tip of Lady Liberty&#39;s torch is approximately 326 feet above sea level.</p>

<p>2398.0458 ft - 326 ft = 2072.0458 ft</p>

<p>The Statue of Liberty should be occluded by 2,072 feet of the curvature of the Earth when viewed from a distance of 60 miles; instead it is visible and identifiable, as if the Earth were just a flat extended plane. This is indisputable and irrefutable proof, and can be repeated for every lighthouse.</p>

<p>EDIT: Once again, another flat Earth thread at 0 points, anyone trying to discuss flat Earth heavily downvoted, and yet over 150 comments!</p>

<p>EDIT: I&#39;ve been shadowbanned because once I was linked to by <a href="/r/subredditdrama">/r/subredditdrama</a> and <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a> all of my posts were downvoted to oblivion. Flat Earth is the mother of all conspiracies and real discussion of it is censored on reddit, look into it yourself.</p>

However, if you are viewing things from above the horizon the angle dips below 90 degrees and the a<sup>2+b<sup>2=c<sup>2</sup></sup></sup> thing doesn&#39;t work. You can see much further from a height of 100 feet(like on a big boat) or 700 feet(like in a big building in Philadelphia).</p>

<p>&quot;Why can we see stars that should be occluded by the shape of the Earth? Oh the light bends around the curvature so you can&#39;t see any curvature but you can see stars you shouldn&#39;t be able to see!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A Truman Show type analogy seems to best depict this &quot;reality&quot;.  A snow globe.  The dome shows a projection of the stars and the sun and moon rotate inside the dome.  If you travel to the outside perimeter edge it gets colder and colder eventually becoming an ice wall.  Nobody travels beyond the ice wall for any distance because it gets colder and colder.  </p>

<p>Both Quantum Mechanics and Spirituality agree that the world that you PERCEIVE and the world that REALLY EXISTS are quite different.  Scientists are increasingly suggesting that we live in a holographic universe.  </p>

<p>Scientists tell us that an atom is 99.9% empty space and that the proton, electron, and neutron will not bump into each other, yet when you press down on your skin it moves.  No atoms touched each other.</p>

<p>Spirituality (Mystics, Enlightened Ones, Sages, Saints) suggests that you are not the body.  You are a spirit identifying with the 1st hand experiences of a body.</p>

<p>Then the &quot;holographic universe&quot; explanations by scientists and &quot;lack of curvature evidence&quot; begin to make more sense.</p>

<p>Are we living in a HOLOGRAM? For the first time, scientists prove strange theory could be true in &#39;realistic models&#39; of our universe
Holographic principle suggests there is a 2D surface that we can&#39;t see
This surface contains all the information needed to describe 3D objects
Since 1997, equations used to show holographic principle could be true have been based on models that contradict theories about our universe
Now scientists have shown how it works in universe that is largely flat

<p>&quot;However, all may not be lost.</p>

<p>The Integral polarization results depend on spacetime being constructed from discrete quanta that behave in a way that fits with quantum theory. The holographic universe hypothesis goes one step further, constructing 3-dimensional spacetime from projections of a 2-dimensional âshellâ â perhaps gamma-ray photons behave differently in this fuzzy, projected, quantum world, and this could be why no polarization difference between gamma-ray photons are detected.</p>

<p>Proving or disproving a holographic universe, of course, isnât the focus of this Integral study; it is an attempt at revealing the very fabric of spacetime, helping physicists understand what our Universe is made of.</p>

<p>âThis is a very important result in fundamental physics and will rule out some string theories and quantum loop gravity theories,â said Laurent in the ESA press release.</p>

<p>âFundamental physics is a less obvious application for the gamma-ray observatory, Integral,â added Christoph Winkler, ESAâs Integral Project Scientist. âNevertheless, it has allowed us to take a big step forward in investigating the nature of space itself.â&quot;</p>

<p>This could also be proven at the north pole. Why are you obsessed with the south pole? Here is one of the north pole. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll think it and all the others like it are fake.</p>

<p>I mean you realize how fucking big Antarctica is? Like it&#39;s so hard to travel you can&#39;t fly to it for 6 months out of the year. You can however go work on the base there and get jobs there. Why not do that and take a compass? I mean the basic reason no one is allowed to go there is because they&#39;ll die and or fuck up the ecosystem. I get you really want to go there but I really don&#39;t see how that proves the world is flat in the face of the ass tons of evidence that it isn&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The author&#39;s &quot;no refraction&quot; argument is pretty much the same idea behind the calculations in my OP, from a different direction. The author rearranges the equations in order to provide you with an equation to determine &quot;how far you away you could physically see the horizon if the Earth was curved because at a certain point the curvature will occlude your view&quot;. The 22 miles that you calculated based on his simplified equation would be the maximum distance you could see the torch if the Earth were curved.</p>

<p>When the Statue operated as a lighthouse from 1886-1902, the official claim was that it was capable of lighting a distance of up to 24 miles away.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really think I need to source the &quot;60 miles&quot; claim for the Statue of Liberty because this same concept and process can be applied to every single lighthouse in the world. My argument does not rest upon the Statute of Liberty but upon each and every lighthouse in the entire world. They can all be viewed at distances at which they should be occluded.</p>

<p>And it extends beyond that; there are many islands throughout the world that can be seen across distances of water that should completely occlude them if there was any curvature. There are many islands long enough to show visible curvature if the Earth was curved, and yet which when viewed from a distance are just as flat as the horizon in every direction.</p>

<p>Read my comment again. Quoting myself: &quot;<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/35q8m7/the_statue_of_liberty_in_new_york_stands_326_feet/cr71dkk">It places the horizon 22 miles away viewed from the top of the statue. Even with refraction considered, the horizon is 24 miles.</a>&quot;</p>

<p>Without refraction- &quot;1.23 miles times the square root of the eye height in feet&quot;</p>

<p>1.23 x â326 = 1.23 x 18.056 = 22.21 miles</p>

<p>With refraction - &quot;1.32 miles times the square root of the eye height in feet&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure either nor am I claiming that the Earth is definitely flat, I just haven&#39;t seen a good rebuttal to the idea put forth in the OP yet and instead a lot of personal attacks directed his way.</p>

<p>Since both these numbers are variable an &#39;exact fit&#39; is not a viable description. You don&#39;t get points for near-misses.</p>

<p>With regard to your second point - this is a phenomenon called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking">Tidal Locking</a>, and it is a natural result of tidal forces. Most moons in the solar system are tidally locked to their host planet, and many exoplanets close to their star are also tidally locked. There&#39;s nothing coincidental about it - it&#39;s physics. Pluto and Charon are a cool version where both worlds are tidally locked with each other, which means the moon will always hang over the same spot of Pluto, like in Zelda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many of them would cover up the sun from the perspective of their planet, sure, but our Moon seems to be the only one in our solar system which is near the ballpark for similar subjective size (although I haven&#39;t done the calculations for the distant moons, I&#39;ll assume as much.) </p>

<p>Of course, that&#39;s not saying much, as in the past our own Moon was closer to the Earth (thereby duplicating what&#39;s going on with many of the other moons) and in the future it will be further away, thereby making total eclipses an impossibility. We already see the latter now, when the moon is as far away as it can get - you get an <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Annular_Eclipse._Taken_from_Middlegate%2C_Nevada_on_May_20%2C_2012.jpg/1024px-Annular_Eclipse._Taken_from_Middlegate%2C_Nevada_on_May_20%2C_2012.jpg">annular</a> eclipse rather than a neat fit because the moon is too small to cover the sun. </p>

<p>The main takeaway is that though the relative similarity in size is an interesting observation, one has to jump through a lot of hoops to dismiss other observations which make the odds far more in our favor. If the Moon was actually exactly the right distance away for a total eclipse, I could buy the argument. The fact that &#39;exact&#39; has to be defined with several percent of wiggle room removes the strength from that argument entirely.</p>

<p>It&#39;s basically like arguing that, say, a guitar is made specifically for a certain guitar case... but only to within an inch or five. Don&#39;t mind the bits sticking out, or the rambling around inside, it&#39;s clearly intended to be that way. </p>

What you are describing here is an illusion of which I don&#39;t have any math for.(Think of a mirage though, that definitely can create the illusion of an endless, and flat landscape.)

Now I&#39;ve been seeing you posting about this sort of thing for a couple of days; so allow me to ask you a couple of questions that might help you come around to the idea of spherical heavenly bodies. </p>

<p>First: Do you believe that every picture of our spherical earth is false? How do you explain the way that asteroids are shaped? Or the fact that every planet we&#39;ve ever photographed is also spherical? How do you explain the fact that most planets have spherical moons (and oblong shaped ones) including our own? How do you explain away the effect that gravity has on objects in a vacuum? (I.E. A sphere is the most stable shape, and over time more debris is added to this sphere until it creates a planet.) </p>

<p>I could go on and on, we really have ALL of the proof we need when talking about the Earth being a sphere. </p>

<p>Eratosthenes experiment is a great example in how to use &quot;science&quot; to lie. The experiment only proves a ball Earth if you assume a ball Earth to begin with; otherwise the exact same experiment and result gives you an accurate distance to the sun, much closer than the millions of miles away the globalists claim.</p>

<p>Yes, there are conditions that need to be met to see the curve. Just like you need to open your eyes to see in front of you, there must be a set of rules in place to return an outcome.  At the altitudes being dealt with, the curve of the earth is still nearly imperceptible. You can&#39;t just look at it and go &quot;oh hey i don&#39;t see a curve ergo no curve&quot;. You need a ridig system of measurement.  Demanding one be used is not the same as saying &quot;I&#39;ve set up the metric and only my metric matters&quot;</p>

Measure the shadow of the sticks for length and angle off of magnetic north at the exact same time of day. The length and angle will both be different.

<p>No, a much better explanation that requires less assumptions is that the difference in lengths and angles can be used to calculate the actual distance to the sun, which by all observations (the results of that experiment) is much closer than the 93 million miles away claimed by globalists.</p>

<p>Heat and light from 93 million miles away allegedly and yet the few thousand miles in difference between the equator and the poles is apparently enough to explain the extremes in temperature.</p>

And finally, here is something you can actually do.  Go to Boulder, Colorado climb the 3rd Flat Iron, (it&#39;s a slab, not too hard), any time after you are up around halfway or so, turn around and look out over the plains.

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t have to take my word for it. Go do it. Or are you unwilling to prove it to yourself?<br/>
Also the reason the north star can be seen that far south is <em>because</em> the tilt of the Earth (23.4 degrees), and that&#39;s also why you can&#39;t continue to see it as you continue curve farther south under the ball of the planet. It maintains its position <em>because</em> it is near the axis of our spin in the sky. Our orbit creates no real effect on position because it is a star, and it is very, very, very far away. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If a 23.5 degree tilt were responsible for being able to see the Polaris that far south then after 6 months of orbit you wouldn&#39;t be able to see it. So they tack on wobbles and fluctuations that just happen to compensate enough that its as if there is no rotation or orbit at all.</p>

<p>Just as convenient as the refraction that perfectly hides any and all visible evidence of curvature. No one can capture this curvature on film but you just keep clinging to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s start with your first example, the hello kitty. Once I got to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5REsCTG4-Gg">youtube video</a>, I realized you must not have watched it <strong>at all</strong>. The entire video is shot with a fisheye lens, and I&#39;ve specifically linked a moment where the horizon is concave.</p>

<p>The second article is from Popular Science, which despite the name is a corporation&#39;s blog mostly associated with photography but also <a href="http://www.bonniercorp.com/other-brands/">some interesting other &#39;brands&#39;</a>. The article doesn&#39;t provide any source that can be examined for the photographs, just a single shot from each, unable to tell context or the type of photography and lens used. It can&#39;t be held up either way.</p>

<p>The Italians of the ISAA are also using a fisheye lens, look at the <a href="http://www.stratospera.com/archives/1429">array</a> of <a href="http://www.stratospera.com/archives/category/missioni/stsp-3">different curvatures</a> you can see from their photos.</p>

<p>As for Redbull, the stunt also used a fisheye lens and you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8u0p2w_Lvo">see the proof for it here</a>.</p>

<p>I have to ask: did you really look at each of these in depth or did you just see a quick screenshot you agreed with and posted them?</p>
