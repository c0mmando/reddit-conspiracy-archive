       Reddit users seem more intellectual as a whole it's worse on Facebook with the data mining etc but the majority of Facebook users are dumb as rocks and see Facebook as "ohhhhhhh shiny"  so yeah it's made reddit more aware but Facebook and other social media? Forget about it.

       I keep seeing posts about Victoria being a smoke screen for other things.  Mainly to diminish support for bernie, and to distract us from tpp and false flag attacks.

       Edit: I browse new though, so maybe that's the difference, they are not getting upvotes.

       Some people make the weirdest connections. Most of it originates from thinking that the whole fucking internet/world orbits around Reddit. And if Reddit is down, some monumental deal is going to take place within a 3 hour timeframe.

       I've seen it brought up in the comments sections quite a bit because people are noticing their gifs, comments, posts etc are being censored/deleted/curated however you want to word it. I got a little heat yesterday in worldnews commenting about the TPP and what could
       <em>

       </em>
       happen but at least it started the discussion.

       I don't know how I feel about this, but my gut feeling is that the "Reverend" Jesse Jackson has something to do about this. This dude has a really strange following, and he's super Sue crazy. He has the power to put a lot of attention on any given subject.

       ...and our oh-so-cliche'd Stars&amp;Bars Boy, about whom interesting questions are circulating elsewhere:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Some interesting facts about the shooter, according to all mainstream sources:
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li>
         <p>
          22 years old, living in his car, grew up dirt poor, sometimes in a rural trailer park, sometimes in a majority black area.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          On serious, hard drugs for at least the last year, arrested twice.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          A facebook page was set up two years ago, hardly used,
          <em>
           half of the Facebook friends are Blacks he went to high school with
          </em>
          . He has no other typical online presence – no twitter, no chats. Just a Facebook page that has no use expect for posing as a “White Supremacist” in the recent past.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          All of a sudden, poses with two flag patches on his jacket – Rhodesia and South Africa – that he could not have purchased in South Carolina and would have a damn hard time ordering online – especially since he almost certainly didn’t have a credit card. Where the HELL does some poor white trash druggie from South Carolina even get access to such novelty patches? How does a poor white trash trailer park boy in South Carolina even LEARN about these historical regimes that were overthrown before he was even born?
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          A few months ago, his parents and friends say he started talking about “racial groups” he was “getting involved” in. (
          <em>
           COUGH
          </em>
          FBI
          <em>
           COUGH
          </em>
          ) How does this NOT fit in the typical FBI entrapment category that has been discussed in very mainstream media – BBC, NYT, WSJ – for
          <em>
           years
          </em>
          now?
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Hillary Clinton was campaining a HALF MILE AWAY ONE HOUR before the shooting? If this was ANY other country, we would call this a “warning” or a “botched assassination” of a political figure. Of course, the STATE SENATOR that he shot – the target – was a huge Hillary supporter.
         </p>
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        This is just shades of RFK, isn’t it? I want to find who was handling him – you know, the “FBI informant” that had “infiltrated” the “radical racist” scene … in rural South Carolina trailer parks.
