       Alright, let's walk through this post which has somehow received 30 upvotes. It's a good example of why people think you (conspiracy theorists) are so full of bullshit.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This correctly describes the purpose of the Daubert test, but is entirely inaccurate when it says that the NCSTAR is inadmissible because it fails the Daubert test. OP has failed to provide any evidence that any court has ever so held or has ever even applied to Daubert test to the NCSTAR at all. OP additionally fails (as discussed below) to provide support for his assertions that the NCSTAR would fail the Daubert test if ever subjected to it. Most importantly, OP's effort to misguide readers on this point is made clear below:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <blockquote>
        <p>

        </p>
       </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       THIS is why the NCSTAR is inadmissible. The statutory authorization for expressly prohibits it from being used as evidence. The Daubert standard thus has nothing to do with its inadmissibility. OP is attempting to fool readers into believing that the NCSTAR is inadmissible because of its poor reliability/credibility. But the content of the report has nothing to do with it. The report is simply inadmissible by statute.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is pure conjecture, especially given that there is no need to apply Daubert to the NCSTAR given its statutory inadmissibility. But let's look at the analysis OP provides anyway.
      </p>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       OP provides no sources for any of this. Is it an invitation to review the entire NCSTAR to determine the accuracy of OP's claims? I politely decline. Given the obvious effort OP put into this post, OP's failure to provide a source gives the impression that there is no source to be cited because his statements are inaccurate.

       What? According the link you provided, it's inadmissible because 15 U.S. Code § 281a doesn't allow it to be admitted. Has it ever failed the Daubert test in court? Has any court ever even applied the Daubert test to it?

       The report is of such poor worth that it would be unlikely to be submitted, because it is inadmissible as scientific evidence and thus by proxy fails the

       the tallest building brought down with explosives was, in fact, only 32 storeys. So, we are expected to believe that on one day, three buildings, up to 360% of the previous highest ever, were perfectly demolished, something never done before or since. Yeah, that's a 0% rate.

       The problem is, the majority was so overwhelming - 96%! - that even if only one in ten had read the NIST report, that would still be a 2-1 majority over the pitiful 4% [as I've mentioned before, that's the same percentage who think alien lizards run the planet] in favor of re-opening the report. And that also presumes everyone who voted in favor had analyzed the NIST report, which is about as credible as believing everyone in

       has done so.
      </p>
      <p>
       I certainly don't argue the NIST report is perfect [my own theory is that, if there is a cover-up, it's more to do with weaknesses in the construction, that could potentially be a threat to other buildings of that era]. But it's much more substantial than anything the 9/11 Truth movement has been able to offer, which is little better than "Magic fairies sprinkled nanothermite pixie dust on the buildings."

       You conveniently ignore the fact that never ever a tall, slender, free-standing structure completely collapsed straight down through itself progressively from top to bottom; that the only explanation given is the assumtion that such a collapse mode is "inevitable" when the top 1/4 of a tower drops on the lower 3/4; and that in 14 years, there has been no experimental model proving that premise right. 9/11 Truth does not require magix pixie dust; finding it only served as

       Bullshit. The goalposts are where they were. There is a huge difference between partial collapses/disproportional collapses and a "total" or "global" progressive collapse. One is trivial to replicate in experiment, the other isn't, your guess which is which.

       Bottom line. On 9/11, two 100+ storey skyscrapers were separately and independently hit by Jumbo Jets. Both subsequently collapsed. How many more examples do you need?

       Skyscrapers were hit by planes before. Smaller and slower planes, into smaller and much older and heavier skyscrapers. So what. The Twins swayed a little and stood. The planes can't have caused
       <em>
        that

       Oh, yeah. The B-25 into the Empire State Building. A plane about 1/7th the mass, traveling at less than one-half the speed. In other words, packing about 3% of the kinetic energy of the planes on 9/11, even ignoring completely the much smaller fuel load.

       Were they tied together by a string or something? They were totally separate impacts. Of course, you apparently reckon "correlation is not causation" and that the towers would have collapsed without being hit or something. The logic is feeble in this one.

       Actually, it is according to
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       science that they would have collapsed without being hit or something. All you would need to do is simultaneously blow away all the columns in one floor 3/4 way up and the thing would totally collapse. Heck, it would suffice to slowly pull one story down with a strong steel cable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compared with something such as a relatively small plane that barely manages to pass the perimeter and a huge deflagration and a few subsequent office fires that is an EXTREMELY  generous model.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that model is clearly wrong for a million reasons. The best of which is that there is no experiment proving it right - and the experiments that

       <p>
        The formal scientific definition of “theory” is quite different from the everyday meaning of the word. It refers to a comprehensive explanation of some aspect of nature that is supported by a vast body of evidence. Many scientific theories are so well established that no new evidence is likely to alter them substantially. For example, no new evidence will demonstrate that the Earth does not orbit around the sun (heliocentric theory), or that living things are not made of cells (cell theory), that matter is not composed of atoms, or that the surface of the Earth is not divided into solid plates that have moved over geological timescales (the theory of plate tectonics)…One of the most useful properties of scientific theories is that they can be used to make predictions about natural events or phenomena that have not yet been observed.[1]

        A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment. Such fact-supported theories are not “guesses” but reliable accounts of the real world. The theory of biological evolution is more than “just a theory.” It is as factual an explanation of the universe as the atomic theory of matter or the germ theory of disease. Our understanding of gravity is still a work in progress. But the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is an accepted fact.

       <p>
        One piece Dr. Astaneh-Asl saw was a charred horizontal I-beam from 7 World Trade Center, a 47-story skyscraper that collapsed from fire eight hours after the attacks. The beam, so named because its cross-section looks like a capital I, had clearly endured searing temperatures. Parts of the flat top of the I, once five-eighths of an inch thick, had vaporized.
       </p>
       <p>
        Less clear was whether the beam had been charred after the collapse, as it lay in the pile of burning rubble, or whether it had been engulfed in the fire that led to the building's collapse, which would provide a more telling clue.
       </p>
       <p>
        The answer lay in the beam's twisted shape. As weight pushed down, the center portion had buckled outward.
       </p>
       <p>
        ''This tells me it buckled while it was attached to the column,'' not as it fell, Dr. Astaneh-Asl said, adding, ''It had burned first, then buckled.''

        For example, valuable information could come from analysis of the blackened steel from the floors engulfed in flame after the airplane collisions. Steel flanges had been reduced from an inch thick to paper thin, Astaneh said.

       We need to know how the "eutectic action" happened that's why astaneh's timeframe is important.

       Plenty of suggestions there, including gypsum wallboard, used extensively in the WTC, and which is 19% sulfur by weight. The study also does the chemical math and concludes that even if your magic pixie dust existed, it would NOT have been capable of producing enough sulfur to fuel the reaction.

       But, unlike the OP is trying to fool you into believing, that "problem" doesn't have anything to do with the content of the report. It is statutorily inadmissible. OP's assertion that it is inadmissible because it fails Daubert is unfounded and an intentional misdirection.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Given the magnitude of 9/11 and all that has followed in its wake, it is not unreasonable to inquire whether we, the people of the United States of America, indeed the people of the World, are entitled to a Daubert hearing on the question of the cause(s) of the destruction of WTC 1, 2 and 7 on September 11, 2001.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this paper the reader has been provided with a reasonably sufficient introduction to the question of the cause(s) of the destruction of WTC 1, 2 and 7, as well as citations to several sources and documents addressing both sides of the debate on this subject. It is beyond the scope of this paper to go into greater detail. Indeed, it is incumbent upon the readers who are so inclined to dig deeper into the available information and conduct their own research with respect to investigating the facts, proved or alleged, and the science and technology involved in connection with the question of the cause(s) of the destruction of WTC 1, 2 and 7 on September 11, 2001. I will endeavor, however so briefly here, to apply the Daubert factors to the expert opinions on this important issue.
       </p>
       <p>
        The official theory as pronounced by NIST (and FEMA) has been scrutinized by numerous architects, engineers, physicists, demolition, and explosive experts. While some members of the scientific community have chosen to accept the official theory, there is no general acceptance of the theory in the scientific community. Indeed, the official theory has been rejected by many qualified experts who have reviewed and scrutinized the NIST reports and the data that NIST has made available.

       Haha. I'm not going to read that until you recognize that it is irrelevant to report's inadmissibility. Maybe what you're quoting is correct. Maybe it demonstrates the problems of the NIST report. I'm open to that possibility and open to reading it. But not until you recognize that the paper's critique of the report can't be relevant to its inadmissibility. Admit that and we can move forward from there.
