<p>Ok, let&#39;s start here...</p>

<p>Look at the list of mods in the sidebar and tell me which of them you see as being the most &quot;diplomatic&quot; (ala, &quot;we don&#39;t want to shut down discussion, we just want to shut down discussion of &lt;that&gt; [whatever that may be]).</p>

<p>It&#39;s obviously not illuminatedwax, that&#39;s a reddit controlled account of no consequence.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not Sarah_Conner; this person rarely even participates here unless there&#39;s some kind of hubbub.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not Mr_Dong, he&#39;s our resident UFOlogist (or, since I&#39;ve been binge-watching &quot;Fringe&quot; the past couple weeks, I&#39;ll call him our resident &quot;Fringe Event Enthuseast&quot;).</p>

<p>AssuredlyAThrowaway - HOLY SHIT!! all of my diplomacy alarm bells just went off!! Now, wait-a-minute... isn&#39;t he the one who wants to see the demise of Alexis Ohanion as retribution for the suicide of Aaron Swartz?</p>

<p>Ok. we&#39;ve got a hit now, let&#39;s go see if it matches up at voat...</p>

<p>Oh, look.. AssuredlyAThrowaway is also a mod of v/conspiracy. WTF?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll let you take it from here.</p>

<p>I teach my children that &quot;the people&quot; are often underestimated. Yes, we can be fooled. But you can&#39;t do it all the time. At a certain point, when about 10% of the population/community is fed up with it.

<p>Agreed. kn0thing&#39;s response reflected that quite well (&quot;nice prank gang, now get your lazy fucking volunteer asses back to work for our corporate interests!&quot;).</p>

<p>So, it was noticed, but not taken seriously (as has been the case numerous times in the history of this website).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People act like Reddit is some kind of reflection of our democracy, like what we say here matters, like we all have equal votes that matter. But it&#39;s a site run by a company, a company that will do whatever the fuck it wants. Kinda like our government. So, I guess Reddit is a reflection of our democracy. It&#39;s all a fuckathon. Happy 4th of July!!!</p>
