       I'm sure admins had something to do with  bringing back certain subreddits. I hope. Because otherwise this is a terrible protest. Utterly pathetic if we gave in that quickly.

       I think that's because voat was originally intended as a hobby project and does not have enough resources to support all the hundreds of thousands of new users in Reddit's audience trying to get on at the same time. We joke about the Reddit, "Hug of Death" because that's a real thing that happens when a smaller site is suddenly forced to take on a bunch of new users all coming on at the same time.

       There's nothing suspicious. The site is run by two broke college kids and their servers have the power of a toaster. What do you expect when 700,000 people go to the website at the same time?

       Yes. And many of the mirrored subs have exactly mirrored the same mods who leverage diplomatic control on reddit.

       The message will be controlled whether it's here on reddit, or over there on voat.

       So, you want a more developed conspiracy theory, eh?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, let's start here...
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the list of mods in the sidebar and tell me which of them you see as being the most "diplomatic" (ala, "we don't want to shut down discussion, we just want to shut down discussion of &lt;that&gt; [whatever that may be]).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's obviously not illuminatedwax, that's a reddit controlled account of no consequence.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not Sarah_Conner; this person rarely even participates here unless there's some kind of hubbub.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not Mr_Dong, he's our resident UFOlogist (or, since I've been binge-watching "Fringe" the past couple weeks, I'll call him our resident "Fringe Event Enthuseast").
      </p>
      <p>
       AssuredlyAThrowaway - HOLY SHIT!! all of my diplomacy alarm bells just went off!! Now, wait-a-minute... isn't he the one who wants to see the demise of Alexis Ohanion as retribution for the suicide of Aaron Swartz?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok. we've got a hit now, let's go see if it matches up at voat...
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, look.. AssuredlyAThrowaway is also a mod of v/conspiracy. WTF?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll let you take it from here.

       Not all have the same mods, and even if some do there's no way to know who's a good user or not.  We can't assume every reddit mod is corrupt.  Try not to stereotype and overgeneralize.

       Proof?  Voat is still down.  Why would they keep it down if they own both.  Wouldn't they want to split us up into two?  Divide then conquer.  If Voat was up and had the traffic it should then I'd believe that more.

       That was the exact excuse last time when FPH got sacked and everyone swarmed to Voat.  They had a couple weeks to get better servers and try again and they still didn't handle it well.  As much as I'd like them to be a good option they've already had their chances and been passed over due to poor planning.

       You don't 'buy' servers these days. They could have brought up some more or bigger instances on whatever host they use, and then turned them off when the traffic slowed down again. This assumes of course that their architecture scales well, which it probably doesn't

       I teach my children that "the people" are often underestimated. Yes, we can be fooled. But you can't do it all the time. At a certain point, when about 10% of the population/community is fed up with it. Radical changes happen that shift the paradigm, and could therefore result in a revolution that may render reddit a platform shunned like cancer infused aids that spreads like ebola.

       People act like Reddit is some kind of reflection of our democracy, like what we say here matters, like we all have equal votes that matter. But it's a site run by a company, a company that will do whatever the fuck it wants. Kinda like our government. So, I guess Reddit is a reflection of our democracy. It's all a fuckathon.

       Once you have awareness  you have to put the time in to make it hurt. 24 hours is laughable for a company of reddits size. Maybe if they were a local small businesses  24 hours would sting more.

       What is the purpose? It's not like they're going to reinstate Victoria over a few days of Reddit blackouts. If they did, that would mean they fired her over something small.

       If the mods want change they should have pressed it. That the only way they can get anything done. By stopping the black out they showed that they can do whatever they want and the worst that will happen is 24 hours worth of loss.

       My guess is that it's same algorithm they tested with the FPH banning.  It's not vote manipulation, just flat out censoring the front page so anything that has specific identifiers will not even show up in the first place.

       None.  It's reddit trying to codify the ability to eliminate or at the very least severely curtail the streisand effect to appease advertisers.  "See, even if there is a controversy, we can keep it off the front page."

       On the one hand, yes, that was pretty weak. On the other hand, I still think this is going to be a major turning point for reddit. At the time there is no good alternative that is ready to take our traffic, etc., but now it is clear that people are ready for mass exodus (and the word has been spread to the more-or-less clueless masses), and something will pop up pretty soon, and then we'll be gone.

       This was just a tremor. The problem here was that there was no useful plan in place for what to do next. Same problem is what destroyed Occupy - lack of an actual game plan.

       Can't flee reddit until there's an alternative, and as long as Voat is essentially a leaky rowboat, Voat isn't an alternative.

       Squared Circle didn't even shut down because they and the members there felt that while it was a shitty thing for them to do to Victoria, she doesn't handle the AMAs there, it's all in-house and the mindset was "why should we shut down in protest when we could stay open as protest instead and show that we won't back down in the face of supposed tyranny".

       They mostly had an image of a former wrestler who was known in WWE as Victoria and had videos of her stuff while working there as a meta way of mocking Reddit for this stuff.

       What did anyone expect to happen? The site is changing and people will still visit whether older users get pissed or not. Pao and anyone she wants to hear from care about money, they get that from page views. It doesn't matter to them if it's 20,000 twelve year olds posting in Advice Animals/Awww or just as many thirty year olds having in depth discussions on any topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is about one thing and one thing only, making Reddit profitable, and people who seem to care either really don't or are realizing they can't make a difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       They literally cannot. Nobody is forcing you to browse reddit or moderate a sub. If you don't like how it's run, go somewhere else.

       Simple. Mods got an ultimatum; do what we want or we will find someone who will. Sad that when it comes down to it the majority of people will save their own asses instead of standing up for what they believe in. This shows how the general population will react to sheer corporate take over. "As long as I've got my internet and I'm comfortable then what's the problem".

       I'm not saying it's a ddos but when you get so much traffic in so little time it's bound to happen. Also when michael jackson died Google search went up like 20% which caused them to go offline and think they were being ddosed. But if it was a ddos it would've been much easier.
