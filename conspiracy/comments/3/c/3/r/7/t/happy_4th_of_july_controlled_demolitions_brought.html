       I hope I live to see the day when we celebrate America not for being the greatest country on earth (when in fact it is so far from it) but for the day we woke up to see we live in an increasingly corporate controlled dictatorship where intelligence, free thought and the poor and middle class are actively suppressed. The day when we all can agree and talk openly about how JFK was knocked off by the state, how our own government killed 3K+ citizens and millions across the globe in the war on terror
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no Independence Day to celebrate today as we are still dependent on our corporate overlords.

       I've spoken with an ex-cop, farmers, people who sell seed, and just your average dominos workers about this over the last few years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Man, the ex-cop really had a lot to say about this. He, and many others I've spoke with feel like a revolution is coming, the biggest since our separation from Britain.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really hope to see the day where we can really,
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       be proud to be Americans because we stopped taking the big government, corrupt corportacracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people I've talked to makes me confident that even though they don't see 9/11 for what it is (an inside job), as soon as they realize their rights and fellow Americans are being oppressed, they will not follow the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I hope to hell law enforcement and especially the military realize it too if shit ever hits the fan. We will probably need them to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, we are just smart
       <em>
        enough
       </em>
       for the elite to lose if they try anything. Even though they try to divide us and turn us on one another,  I'm confident the people of this nation will fight to protect one another.

       I always love how conspiracy theorists fantasize about the end game revolution where they are the hero's and their love for freedom is too much for the big mean Illuminati and we win and live happily ever after. In reality, if any nutjobs go crazy and try to overthrow anyone, they will be put down with an iron fist

       Well, in fact I watched the video (only takes about 4 minutes) and I learned something new today, which indicates that 3 of the buildings (WTC1 and 2, as well as Bldg 7, which I understood) were well-timed controlled demolition.  Just view it, and see if you don't agree with ME, not with that douchebag D14RRH34...  Yeah, you...

       Smoking Gun: Free fall occurred in Building 7's collapse for 2.25 seconds. NIST was attempting to cover this up, but a physics teacher called them out at the public draft hearing. Surprisingly, in its final report released in November 2008, NIST finally acknowledged freefall, but dishonestly placed it in bizarre framework that continues to deny its clear significance. This video series was created by the man who forced NIST to admit free fall occurred and displays the brazenness of the NIST WTC7 coverup.

       I awkwardly spent 12 year or so not knowing 3 buildings went down on 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was told it was 2, i remember hearing something odd about a 3rd tower being involved, and then saw CNN call every person who said there was a third tower then went down, a nut job, and that appeared to be that...
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't care until years later, or understand the full context, but what stuck with me the most was the media campaign to push this terrorist naravtive where if you even so much as looked cross at the 9/11 event, you were "an Al-Qaeda" or "A conspiracy theorist" or "A 9/11 truther nut job"
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, it was weird when i realized somthing was off in the world around me, then i didn't sleep for days finding out all of this new information hiding in plain sight..
      </p>
      <p>
       The 9/11 coverup was the best and worst coverup ever done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Best because of i'll admit it, it worked on me, and EVERY ONE AROUND ME.
      </p>
      <p>
       Worst because, if you lay out all the information before you, it's elementary level connect the dots, untill you draw a picture of Washington

The particles range in size from tens to hundreds of nanometers. Elemental aluminum was present in thin plate-like structures, while iron oxide was present as faceted grains, roughly 100 nm across – about a thousand times smaller than a human hair.

         The authors also obtained and examined additional samples of WTC dust which had been collected by independent observers on, or very soon after, 9/11. All of the samples examined contained these very small, peculiar red/gray chips. Previous studies discussing observations of the WTC dust include reports by the RJ Lee Company [14], the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) [15], McGee et al. [13] and Lioy et al. [16] Some of these studies confirmed the finding of iron-rich microspheres, which are also peculiar [5, 8, 11, 13-15] but the red/gray chips analyzed in this study have apparently not been discussed in previously published reports.

       <p>
        A complex modulated structure of reactive elements that have the capability of considerably more heat than organic explosives while generating a working fluid or gas. The explosive and method of fabricating same involves a plurality of very thin, stacked, multilayer structures, each composed of reactive components, such as aluminum, separated from a less reactive element, such as copper oxide, by a separator material, such as carbon. The separator material not only separates the reactive materials, but it reacts therewith when detonated to generate higher temperatures. The various layers of material, thickness of 10 to 10,000 angstroms, can be deposited by magnetron sputter deposition. The explosive detonates and combusts a high velocity generating a gas, such as CO, and high temperatures.

       Harrit's samples were good enough to pass a scientific peer review, so I think you've been listening to too much Zionist propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       He had five samples, all from independent sources who were unknown to each other. All of them produced identical results. So, either there was an intricate conspiracy which involved hoaxers breaking into a military compound, stealing nano-thermite residue and part-igniting it, before dropping it off at strategic locations and then sending a wireless telepathic message to each of the collectors for them to pick it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or...
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody had any reason to lie about where they obtained the samples.

       <strong>
        The 2009 publication in The Open Chemical Physics Journal (TOCPJ) of a fabulous paper by Harrit et al. entitled “Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9/11 World Trade Center Catastrophe” Some disparagers of the 9/11 Truth movement have alleged that TOCPJ is a place on the web where anybody can buy a publication without peer review. Absolutely false! I know this because I was one of the referees of the Harrit et al. paper. The editors asked for my opinion. And after about two weeks of studying what the authors had written, checking relevant references, and gathering my thoughts, I finally provided my advice to authors in 12 single-spaced pages, together with my recommendation to the Editors that they publish the paper after the authors had considered my suggestions. Still, some skeptical readers may ask how anyone can rate a scientific paper as “fabulous.” Well, I am the principal author of 109 papers (and a co-author of an additional 81) in peer-review journals. And have refereed a least 600, and possibly as many as 1000, manuscripts. So you would be right in calling me an aficionado of articles published in scientific journals. And I found absolutely nothing to criticize in the final version of the Harrit et al. paper! Apropos, twelve of my own publications have appeared in the American Institute of Physics’ Journal of Chemical Physics (an old fashioned paper journal), so it is accurate to say that chemical physics (of inorganic materials) is my main specialty."

       Contradictorily, not only is the NIST fraud
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       peer-reviewed, but NIST refuses to even release its data so that it
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       be peer-reviewed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, you apparently see fit to snort in derision at a paper which
       <em>
        has
       </em>
       been peer-reviewed, simply because it reaches a conclusion which you find unpalatable.
      </p>

       Fortunately, science is not qualified by your idiotic opinion.

       Because you try and make up truth and insult him and then deny or change the subject like this when you are proven wrong. Being wrong is hard but we all are some time, it's better to accept truth and move on then live in denial.

        (Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9/11 World Trade Center Catastrophe) consists of intimately mixed particles of iron oxide and aluminum embedded in a carbon-rich matrix. The particles range in size from tens to hundreds of nanometers. Elemental aluminum was present in thin plate-like structures, while iron oxide was present as faceted grains, roughly 100 nm across – about a thousand times smaller than a human hair.

         The authors also obtained and examined additional samples of WTC dust which had been collected by independent observers on, or very soon after, 9/11. All of the samples examined contained these very small, peculiar red/gray chips. Previous studies discussing observations of the WTC dust include reports by the RJ Lee Company [14], the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) [15], McGee et al. [13] and Lioy et al. [16] Some of these studies confirmed the finding of iron-rich microspheres, which are also peculiar [5, 8, 11, 13-15] but the red/gray chips analyzed in this study have apparently not been discussed in previously published reports.

       </p>
       <p>
        A complex modulated structure of reactive elements that have the capability of considerably more heat than organic explosives while generating a working fluid or gas. The explosive and method of fabricating same involves a plurality of very thin, stacked, multilayer structures, each composed of reactive components, such as aluminum, separated from a less reactive element, such as copper oxide, by a separator material, such as carbon. The separator material not only separates the reactive materials, but it reacts therewith when detonated to generate higher temperatures. The various layers of material, thickness of 10 to 10,000 angstroms, can be deposited by magnetron sputter deposition. The explosive detonates and combusts a high velocity generating a gas, such as CO, and high temperatures.
