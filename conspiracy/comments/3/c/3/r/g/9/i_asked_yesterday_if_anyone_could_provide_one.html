        same question
       </a>
       8 days ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       You received answers in that post. You claimed Salk's development of the standard you are questioning does not qualify.  It seems like you think everybody and everything should be questioned except you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, Jonas Salk devised the double-blind randomized experiment to test the Polio vaccine in 1954.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, RDBPC is not ethical in some situations.

       Edit: Reviewed the Links..
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you for your response. So far it is the only one that addressed the question.
      </p>
      <p>
       The criteria we are looking for here is simple and it is not mine, it is research standard. A clinical trial where a vaccine and an inactive placebo are used (RCT), and the vaccine is shown to be both safe and effective. Then this is repeated by other researchers and the results are replicated. From the link you posted 'To conclude, the major advantage of trial over an observational study is the ability to demonstrate causality i.e., cause-effect relationship. When RDBPC is compared with other research designs, the level of evidence given by RDBPC is nearly 100% and hence it is considered “gold standards” for comparison.'
      </p>
      <p>
       I did ask this 8 days ago and you posted about the Salk trial from 60 + years ago.The Salk Trial was not completed, it ended prematurely because it was found to be infecting people with Polio. It did not determine that the vaccine was safe and effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was not repeated and there were no results to replicate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone interested can read the detailed response I put together here
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3b5c18/the_gold_standard_in_research_design_is_the/">
        https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3b5c18/the_gold_standard_in_research_design_is_the/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It should bother everyone reading this that the only response so far relates to a failed trial over 60 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that we have again covered that situation we can fast forward a bit. here is the current vaccine schedule from the CDC.
       <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/downloads/child/0-18yrs-child-combined-schedule.pdf">
        http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/downloads/child/0-18yrs-child-combined-schedule.pdf
       </a>
       . Rather than point to a trial done on a vaccine no longer given, which does not meet with the clinical standards of a placebo controlled RCT, let's focus on one of the many that are now required?
      </p>
      <p>
       The ethical argument is an interesting one. When a new drug comes out it is not known without proper trials if it is either safe or effective. But asking to prove that vaccines are both safe and effective is unethical?

       The good thing is that the CA vaccination Senate bill has painted Big Pharma into a corner. Now, with a nearly 100% vaccination compliance rate, it'll be interesting to see the excuses fly when
       <em>
        vaccinated children
       </em>
       contract diseases that they are supposedly "protected" against.
      </p>
      <p>
       I love it. This bill is going to show us a LOT. The companies will no longer be able to control the narrative; the full truth will be out there for all to see.

       People seem to think these subReddits, r/Medicine, r/Science, etc. are composed of open-minded, discussion-loving experts. In my experience they are more a sounding board for the status quo where dissenting points of view are deleted or ridiculed.

       Ok firstly stop treating all vaccines as the same. They are hugely different with a wide variety of ingredients. Just because pharma companies have tried to make a quick buck with some shitty flu vaccines doesn't mean you can't trust them all. You doubt vaccines work? What happened to polio? How many cases of rubella have you seen?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now to answer your question. I just googled vaccine double blind study.  I guess you can't do that so I will link the top 5 results for you.

       In order to determine if a vaccine is safe and effective the placebo cannot be another vaccine. There must be a control group that is a true control with an inactive placebo.
      </p>

       Every one of the above links has this flaw. 'A double blind randomized controlled trial to determine if vaccine x does ----- compared to vaccine y.'

       . In the 3 studies I addressed in the link we had to at least find the full text of the studies to see that the trials were conducted against other vaccines. In all 10 that you posted it is plainly stated in the link.

       There is a wealth of fucking articles out there. The only way you could have not seen them is if you never looked. As I said above yes some vaccines have been shonky dangerous products that shouldn't have been on the market. The issue with this is the amount of control big pharma has over drug administrations. Vaccines are not dangerous corporate lobbying is dangerous.

       Just because it has the keywords in the title doesn't not mean it is what we are looking for.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are looking for a vaccine trial that uses 2 groups. 1 is given the vaccine, the other is not. Then we want to analyze the results.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again all these entries are comparing one vaccine to another vaccine. This does not tell us if a vaccine is safe, it only tells us if the vaccine is safe (or effective) compared to another vaccine. The criteria was outlined in the original post.

       I'm actually disappointed in you.  I would think someone who CLAIMS to be a Harvard grad would have much better arguments and responses.  Anyways, here is why there are no placebo-controlled studies for vaccines.  The argument you make works on stupid people, it doesn't work on people who actually have some semblance of intelligence . I guess that's why the cognitive-dissonance-having fools on this sub lap up your lunacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Infants wouldn't be able to undergo a placebo-controlled study for the same reason they don't work on animals - they are ignorant of what treatment and prevention are. The placebo effect, which is what is tested in a placebo-controlled study is a psycho-physiological response predicated on the individual receiving the sham treatment thinking they are getting the actual treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Due to ethical concerns there never will be a placebo-controlled study for vaccines that are not novel. Medications in general don't always undergo true placebo trials. Instead, they are tested against already-existing medications. When someone is suffering from an illness it is completely unethical to give them a sugar pill instead of some form of treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is what the WHO says about placebos (
       <a href="http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/94056/1/9789241506250_eng.pdf">
        http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/94056/1/9789241506250_eng.pdf
       </a>
       ) – I can’t wait to hear you call me a “shill” for using the WHO…I’m already laughing at the thought:
      </p>
      <p>
       First: Informed consent is necessary. Using children in placebo-controlled studies is already an ethically shaky idea to begin with, but withholding a preventive measure in an infant is even more so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second: “the study must be based on sound scientific rationale, and must be socially valuable and use scientifically valid methods.” Vaccines work – there is 200+ years of evidence showing that they work, so the rationale to use a placebo-controlled study for vaccines is not there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third: “The research must have a risk-benefit profile judged to be favorable, based on sufficient evidence from previous clinical and non-clinical studies.” Since vaccine work, and we know they work, there is no risk-benefit reward from conducting a placebo-controlled trial on vaccines. If you want titers, go get a vaccine and then have the titers drawn…they’ll show antibodies against the antigen (unless you are one of the rare few who does not have an immune response to the vaccine).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fourth: “The benefits and burdens of the research must be justly distributed. For example, research must not be carried out on vulnerable populations for the benefit of more advantaged populations.” You can’t get any more vulnerable than an infant, so placebo-controlled studies wouldn’t be conducted on infants to satisfy the whims of some vaccine deniers who are ignorant of the science behind vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fifth: “Should an intervention be proven efficacious in a trial, research sponsors and other collaborators (such as national or local governments) have a duty to make provisions to ensure reasonable access to the intervention by the population from which the research participants were drawn.” So, as you most certainly already know, vaccines work so the infants would be vaccinated anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since vaccines work, placebo-controls would never be used, instead when a new vaccine formulation is created for an already existing vaccine (I.e., a new formulation of the MMR vaccine) it is tested against vaccines already in use.
      </p>
      <p>
       Placebo-controlled studies are only acceptable in two circumstances..and they BOTH need to be applicable to the vaccine:
      </p>
      <p>
       First: ”no effective vaccine exists” such as is the case with the Ebola and Maleria vaccines being worked on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second: **”The vaccine under consideration is intended to benefit the population in which the vaccine is to be tested.” So a vaccine placebo-controlled trial to benefit the whims of vaccine denier clearly fails on these two points.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moving on, the WHO states that vaccines are never acceptable when:
      </p>
      <p>
       First: ”an effective (or partially effective) and safe vaccine exists and is currently accessible in the public health system of the country in which the trial is planned.” So there goes your idea about using a placebo-controlled trial to test vaccines already in use.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second: ”The risk to participants of not receiving the current vaccine cannot be mitigated adequately.” Considering there are epidemics of pertussis and mumps in many regions of the US and a measles outbreak as well, the risks cannot be adequately mitigated to ensure placebo-receiving infants wouldn’t contract these horrendous diseases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Calling for placebo-controlled studies for already-existing vaccines is a joke that vaccine deniers like to play. In short, it shows their lack of understanding of ethics, medicine, and science.

       OMG. Now you think vaccines are related to SIDS???  Where in the world?!?!? No wonder educated people just ignore you.  SIDS has been ASSOCIATED with a number of things, none of them being vaccines.

       Are you living under a rock? Since the widespread administration of vaccines fewer people have died from the disease the vaccine prevented.  No question that some of the those vaccines haven't been tainted with substances that may have contributed to unwanted effects, but scientists are human beings just like you, flawed.

       No massive outbreaks yet, but a kid has died of whopping cough in California, a disease that had been eradicated by vaccines until people like yourself decided against vaccinated their kids.  I guess you probably thought that kid wasn't fit enough to survive.
      </p>
      <p>
       You contradict yourself in the same post, in the same paragraph.  You state that correlation does not equal causation but mention minimal autism with less vaccination - hypocrisy.  Also, Amish avoid doctors until their lives are threatened, so it is unlikely their autism would be diagnosed.

       Prove it.  A very simple request.

      <p>
       They are NOT tested together, as nearly every child is forced to have.  Double blind, independent studies HAVE NOT ever been performed to prove their efficacy OR safety.   Normal courts with juries of one's peers ARE NOT used for the many individuals damaged by vaccines.

       I find many of this worth questioning and at one point I questioned everything (cow's milk, pacifiers, medications etc.) and I came to the conclusion that many of these creations have been developed to advance and improve the lives of human beings, often prolonging our lives. Yes, all of them can be scrutinized and criticized to expose harmful effects, which the creator may not have foreseen, but ultimately science and technology have prolonged human life, including yours.  I'm sure I can find instances in your life where you use products that benefit BIG _______ and harm you in some way.  There is a benefit to vaccines and yes there are side effects.

       If you're claiming that vaccines aren't safe, it's up to you to prove that they aren't safe; it's not up to everyone else to prove to you that they are. Either you have no clue what
       <em>
        burden of proof
       </em>
       is or how it works, or you're simply demonstrating the flawed, irrational, and illogical way of thinking that makes it impossible to convince anyone of anything they simply choose to not believe. Either way, trying to convince someone who thinks the way you do that vaccines offer a huge benefit to society for very little (almost zero) risk would be a waste of time.

       For someone who presumably attended an ivy league school, you're certainly demonstrating a disturbing level of ignorance, and inability to think critically and rationally.
       <strong>
        Unlike most other drugs, vaccines are required to meet an even more strict set of standards, because they play a critically important role in ensuring  public health
       </strong>
       . Not everyone needs to take Viagra, but every child in this country and in most countries of the world have to be vaccinated, but you seem to think that all it takes is a couple of greedy executives to cause a public health catastrophe, and that there aren't any systems in place to ensure that a new vaccine doesn't cause more harm than good. You should've saved your money and gone to community college. At least you would've learned some common sense.

       Please do not say vaccines are held to a higher standard, show how they are. From the research I have found this is simply not true.

       Just as the advent of antibiotics kept people from dying as result of a minor infection, vaccines have prevented the incidence of many lethal diseases.  There are side effects to everything.  The progression of humanity is a work in progress.  I bet the product you sell for a living can be improved.  Vaccines are better than no vaccines.

       And we're supposed to just believe you, right? We shouldn't trust science, because all those scientists are a bunch of corrupt, greedy bastards who only care about funding, but we should all believe you, even though you offer absolutely nothing in the way of proof.

       Science, which seems foreign to you, provides evidence.  And as a clinical scientist, I do not trust blindly any scientific article that is presented to me.  I evaluate it with the knowledge, training, and scientific acumen I have to determine whether it would benefit a patient.  Scientist do not claim to know it all and you surely do not give them a break for trying.  How are you helping mankind?

       If you really believe some studies are "avoided" then why don't you embark on a scientific journey and endorse a hypothesis you believe to be true?  Too much work for you?

       Its not up to BigPharma to compare the outcomes of treatments, it's up to scientists like yourself.  And this dude is concerned about aluminum and mercury, as I presume you are.   Do you wear deodorant? So many foods and products you use have aluminum and mercury but are probably not preventing you from a debilitating disease.  Like you said risk vs benefit.

       Most countries have health agencies that tasked with approving or rejecting medical products.

      <p>
       In USA, FDA is the agency with that mandate, and apparently many of the folks wearing the fda hat have very close ties with BigPharma.

       This is old news.  Maybe you are just discovering that BIG Anything colludes with the gov't, allowing their product to be fast tracked onto the market.  So your skepticism is warranted, but completely rejecting vaccines is clearly petulant.   Would you say every medication is harmful without benefits?  Why do you pick on vaccines; they were invented long before BIG industry influenced politicians.  If you were to reject products based on the industries influence on politicians, you might as well live the life of Thoreau for the rest of your life.

       I am by no means a doctor.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue is not really that vaccines are based on what I call "filtered" science, the data they show is used to sell the product.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue is that more and more people are clamoring for obligatory vaccination, and this ... in my humble opinion would be a crime against humanity.  Folks that want to believe in the hype can go stand in line all they want, I prefer to develop natural immunity to whatever comes my way. Always have, always will.

       The safety and effectiveness of vaccines is something that is widely accepted all over the world.
       <strong>
        The vast majority of people all over the world agree that vaccines are safe, and that they offer the most effective way to prevent life threatening diseases from wiping out mass numbers of human beings
       </strong>
       . It is, therefore, not unreasonable to suggest that it is up to the few misinformed, irrational people who oppose the use of vaccines to prove their case. The burden to prove that vaccines are harmful rests on those few to convince the vast majority of humankind that we're wrong and you're right. While it is true that there are  some risks, the number of cases where a vaccine may have adverse effects is so small that, when compared to the benefits, it really doesn't make much sense to even worry about it. The reason we know about those risks is precisely because there is, in fact, a system in place where every vaccine must meet a very strict set of requirements before it is ever approved.

        Dr. Diane Harper was the lead researcher in the development of the human papilloma virus vaccines, Gardasil and Cervarix. She made a surprising announcement at the 4th International Public Conference on Vaccination, which took place in Reston, Virginia on Oct. 2nd through 4th, 2009. Her speech was supposed to promote the Gardasil and Cervarix vaccines, but she instead turned on her corporate bosses in a very public way. When questioned about the presentation, audience members remarked that they came away feeling that the vaccines should not be used.

       We are looking for a vaccine trial that uses 2 groups. 1 is given the vaccine, the other is not. Then we want to analyze the results.

       Again all these entries are comparing one vaccine to another vaccine. This does not tell us if a vaccine is safe, it only tells us if the vaccine is safe (or effective) compared to another vaccine. The criteria was outlined in the original post.
