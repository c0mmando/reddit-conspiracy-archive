    <div class="md"><p>This is just scratching the surface; the truth is that the &#39;education&#39; that we all received was a <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3a6agc/education/">Rockefeller indoctrination program</a>, designed to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErL9zPHdH4A">dumb us down deliberately</a>. John Taylor Gatto, former New York State Teacher of the Year, <a href="https://www.educationrevolution.org/blog/i-quit-i-think/">quit</a> his 26 year public teaching career when he could no longer teach &quot;a curriculum of confusion, class position, arbitrary justice, vulgarity, rudeness, disrespect for privacy, indifference to quality, and utter dependency, ... how to fit into a world I don’t want to live in.&quot; John Taylor Gatto has gone on to write several books about the power of education, including <em>Weapons of Mass Instruction</em> and <em>Dumbing Us Down</em>.</p>

<p>Common Core is currently being implemented all across America under the guise of grass-roots state-level action, but we can <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/36ertu/common_core_following_the_money/">follow the money</a>. Dr. Sandra Stotsky and Dr. James Milgram gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrxbU_UfaQE">speech on Common Core</a> before the Alaska State Senate on January 7, 2014 that lays out a cautious tentative case, but it&#39;s simple to point out that Common Core is the next step in making <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX7ddVUuf-E">mathematics unintelligible</a> to the public. </p>

<p>Besides just absurd <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5JdoK-JuOI">standardized testing</a> as you mentioned, Common Core includes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSHoxWaVeto">social justice activism indoctrination</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1OuDns8rmI">increasingly hyper-sexualized agendas</a>. Dr. Duke Pesta is an activist against Common Core specifically and you can hear him try to explain it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl6Batr2IVA">in a few minutes</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si-kx5-MKSE">or a few hours</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My children attend a private religious school that follows common core standards. It&#39;s very difficult even for private schools to opt out because the state ELA and Math exams follow common core principles, and at least in my city those scores are used to determine high school placement. The regents exams are also aligned to common core. Without a regents diploma state colleges will refuse to grant diplomas even to 4.0 students (this has been an issue for homeschoolers who attend state colleges).</p>

<p>My impression of the common core curricula is that it&#39;s poorly put together, riddled with typos and errors. This could be deliberate to make it unintelligible to most students, or maybe it was just rushed. For the first two years of its implementation, my girls weren&#39;t even given math text books because they were &quot;in development.&quot; Teachers of 30+ years experience were being told to teach from a script. The math is fuzzy/ constructivist which will leave a lot of kids confused. The especially smart ones, or the ones with affluent parents, will figure it out or have tutors to coach them through it. And of course the elite will have their children in private schools that don&#39;t follow common core (i.e. I believe Obama&#39;s daughters are in a non CC school) and thus will be exempted from high stakes testing, at least until the SAT/ ACT. </p>

<p>The social studies is <strong>heavily</strong> SJW and there is frequent testing starting in kindergarten. And of course, prepping for testing. I believe the testing is a $$$ racket for the testing companies but also serves a dual purpose of demoralizing students,parents and sidelining non-conformist thinkers.</p>

<p>Did you know that in NYS the state tests are not disclosed to the public even after they&#39;ve been graded, and teachers must sign non-disclosure agreements?</p>

<p>I have a daughter who despite all this consistently scores 4s on the state tests (only ~10% of students statewide score 4s) and she describes the questions as muddled and designed to confuse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for sharing your experiences. We would all benefit if you continued to elaborate the insights you&#39;ve gained from your personal perspective on this subject: there is not enough information on this subject right now.</p>

<p>This is also how they are pressuring homeschoolers, and in California homeschooling just became the only option to avoid mandatory mass vaccination.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This was the state of calculus in the generation prior to Common Core. There is a clear delineation between those who can understand calculus, and those who have been convinced by a broken and confusing system that they are unable to understand calculus. Now Common Core again lowers the bar, introducing confusion to normal arithmetic and algebra, and we will no doubt see a new generation increasingly hobbled by their education.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there is frequent testing starting in kindergarten. And of course, prepping for testing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The academic testing occurring nowadays is terrifying. The students sign non-disclosure agreements, swearing to never reveal the contents of the tests. There is no outside independent auditing of the content of these tests. Teachers have lost their entire careers over accidentally allowing tests to be revealed. And the more you can get children to talk about them, the more you&#39;ll hear examples of social programming interwoven into every question. But the children are very hesitant to talk about any of this, because we&#39;ve installed surveillance cameras into most of our schools and it&#39;s become just another cultural joke that the government is always watching you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/3cam61/high_school_math_i_just_want_somewhere_to_learn/cstsy40">Here is something I just posted</a> in <a href="/r/learnmath">/r/learnmath</a> so I&#39;ll just post it here as well:</em> </p>

<p>Let me tell you about how I learned how to love and appreciate the power of math. And math is super powerful, and it is one of the best things you can do to improve your life. Just so you know where this is coming from, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/chychochycho">I&#39;m chycho</a>. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>First, math is a language. It offers a perspective that you cannot have from any other source. This is very important to keep in mind. </p></li>
<li><p>Second, even though I received my minor in mathematics I really didn&#39;t understand math, or have such an appreciation for it, until I taught math. When teaching math I would get bombarded with <em>&quot;why&quot;</em> questions, questions that I really didn&#39;t ask myself since I knew how to do something. When I started to try and answer these questions is when I really started to appreciate the power of math. So, if you want to love math, teach math. Doesn&#39;t make a difference what level. You will be asked why you do something. Try and find out why and that is when you will really understand math. </p></li>
<li><p>Third, IMHO, math is not taught properly in schools by design. If we had a society that understood mathematics then our governments and corporations would lose power. They would not be able to do a fraction of what they do and get away with. It&#39;s as simple as that. Math education has been decimated because those in control cannot afford to have an educated populace.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL463AA90FD04EC7A2">See John Taylor Gatto’s “Ultimate History Lesson” for more on this.</a></p></li>
<li><p>There are a lot of shity text books out there, find the ones that aren&#39;t, and start with the level that you&#39;re comfortable with. Build from there. Read this to learn why schools are full of bad textbooks: <a href="http://www.textbookleague.org/103feyn.htm">“Judging Books by Their Covers” by Richard P. Feynman</a></p></li>
<li><p>Here is a video I put together giving 5 reasons why math is important. You might find it useful: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fDnjPre1GA">Five Reasons Why Math is Important</a> ... <em>edit: here is part 2: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqVAqhT9OTs">Why is Math Important? Because it&#39;s part of evolution, part of what makes us human</a></em></p></li>
<li><p>What was missing from your education is love. If you want to know more read the following short book: <a href="http://www.holybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/J-Krishnamurti-Education-and-the-Significance-of-life.pdf">Jiddu Krishnamurti’s “Education and The Significance of Life” (pdf)</a>. </p></li>
<li><p>Here is an article I put together providing further info on what I just posted above: <a href="http://chycho.blogspot.ca/2013/05/paradigm-shift-in-education.html">Paradigm Shift in Education: Krishnamurti on the Educator, RAW on Ignorance, Gato on the System, and Hamming on Learning</a>. </p></li>
<li><p>Keep in mind what you just asked is not just about learning math, it&#39;s about trying to learn anything in our current education system. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Let me know if you need clarification on anything. </p>

<p>Peace :) </p>

I&#39;ve found it most economical and easy for me to purchase the large water cooler jugs of locally distilled water.

Rather the dose is entirely dependent on the amount of water consumed.  It isn&#39;t even medical grade sodium fluoride.

    <div class="md"><p>It would seem that at least <em>some</em> evidence is needed in order for a person to feel that any particular idea they have is true or justified or not.  This evidence might be physical and external and able to be seen by others, or it may be personal and internal and specific only to the person in question.  However, epistemologically-speaking, even on a subconscious level, the human mind seems to require some sort of validation upon any particular action or thought before the individual in question moves forward for or against a thing.  Even if that particular validation is mistaken, it seems it must be taken as valid by the individual in question at the very least.</p>

<p>I may be mistaken in this, but this seems to be the way things are as far as I can see.</p>

Edit: Wanted to clarify, I do not think they are &quot;the worst&quot; because they were favoring the minority(white kids), I think they were the worst because they legitimately did things like allow those students to spend hours of their day with them in the office, and would rush other students out ASAP whenever we would come to them with our issues.</p>

<p>But to the topic at hand, as a 28 year old college student working my way through a degree, I am infuriated to think that adults point blank told me to &quot;give up&quot; in high school because I had lukewarm grades.

If you work a bit harder, and I know you can, you can definitely make it into college.&quot; Not that I don&#39;t take responsibility, but I can&#39;t help but feel that I was convinced by multiple adults not to even bother.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;With respect to the responsibility of intellectuals, there are still other, equally disturbing questions. Intellectuals are in a position to expose the lies of governments, to analyze actions according to their causes and motives and often hidden intentions. In the Western world, at least, they have the power that comes from political liberty, from access to information and freedom of expression. For a privileged minority, Western democracy provides the leisure, the facilities, and the training to seek the truth lying hidden behind the veil of distortion and misrepresentation, ideology and class interest, through which the events of current history are presented to us. The responsibilities of intellectuals, then, are much deeper than what Macdonald calls the “responsibility of people,” given the unique privileges that intellectuals enjoy. &quot;</p>

<p>From an article I found after googling the sentence &quot;they go after the intellectuals first&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You act like the government has made these tests.</p>

<p>No. People like me make these tests.</p>

<p>The people who design tests are psychometricians. We have to try to figure out how to put people in a line based on their knowledge of abstract concepts like &quot;math ability.&quot; In fact, we call these &quot;constructs,&quot; because they don&#39;t actually exist. What is &quot;math ability?&quot; What is &quot;reading ability?&quot; We all think we know, but just try writing it down. Pretty soon you&#39;ll realize that everything is confounded and confused. Everything is connected.</p>

<p>The challenge of the test designer is to cut out as much &quot;noise&quot; from the scores as possible. We need to make sure that if you got this history question right, it&#39;s because you know the answer, not that you are just really good at reading or guessing. What this does, though, is end up requiring very dry, very narrow questions that end up asking things that are maybe not even that important, simply because the item stats work well.</p>

<p>This is the failing of basing an &quot;education&quot; system on standardized tests. Standardized tests are really only good for getting a quick snapshot of the overall comparative ability of the group. At the individual level, they don&#39;t really tell us that much. If we really wanted people to demonstrate the skills we say we value, we would go back to writing a lot of papers and doing large projects and things like that. Highly integrated tasks that draw from the whole person&#39;s abilities. </p>

<p>Those are just <em>phenomenally</em> expensive to do at scale. Fine for a teacher with 30 kids (although if you&#39;ve ever had to grade even 30 short papers, you might disagree with this), impossible for a school district with 30,000 (and that&#39;s a pretty small one!). So what do we do instead?</p>

<p>Multiple-choice, discrete-point tests.</p>

<p>They are the best value for time/money. It&#39;s just that the value isn&#39;t that high, and gets lower the moment you give them more than once a few years, or base funding on them, or prep the students for them. Any test will only be a test of the test. We try to divine meaning from the 1s and 0s that come off of them (through some pretty cool stats), but at the end of the day, that&#39;s all we really know. This student got this item &quot;right.&quot; This one didn&#39;t. When they have prepped for the test, we don&#39;t even know why.</p>

<p>As is often the case, I&#39;m sorry to disappoint, but this can be chalked up to incompetence, not malice. It&#39;s not like the psychometricians lobbied for the current state of affairs. In fact, many letters were sent warning policymakers of exactly what has happened. But politicians like to pretend to care about education, and want to be seen doing something, so they just cooked up this nonsense of giving multiple choice tests all the time because it was the cheapest possible way of pretending to address the actual problems. Oh, and the test publishers are making bank, so that helps, too.</p>

<p>Every test developer I know (and that&#39;s a lot) knows this is all bullshit. So why do we do it? Basically, here&#39;s what everyone decided: The government and the publishers are going to go ahead with this no matter what. At least if we do the work we can try to mitigate the worst effects of these policies. We can at least try to make these things as fair as they can be. We can at least do damage control.</p>

<p>If I had kids, I&#39;d home school. And that&#39;s coming from a guy with a PhD, who has always enjoyed school and feels like he has gotten a lot out of it. The system I see my friends&#39; kids going through is alien to me, and seems to strip the very things that ended up benefiting me the most.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My children attend a private religious school that follows common core standards. It&#39;s very difficult even for private schools to opt out because the state ELA and Math exams follow common core principles, and at least in my city those scores are used to determine high school placement. The regents exams are also aligned to common core. Without a regents diploma state colleges will refuse to grant diplomas even to 4.0 students (this has been an issue for homeschoolers who attend state colleges).</p>

<p>My impression of the common core curricula is that it&#39;s poorly put together, riddled with typos and errors. This could be deliberate to make it unintelligible to most students, or maybe it was just rushed. For the first two years of its implementation, my girls weren&#39;t even given math text books because they were &quot;in development.&quot; Teachers of 30+ years experience were being told to teach from a script. The math is fuzzy/ constructivist which will leave a lot of kids confused. The especially smart ones, or the ones with affluent parents, will figure it out or have tutors to coach them through it. And of course the elite will have their children in private schools that don&#39;t follow common core (i.e. I believe Obama&#39;s daughters are in a non CC school) and thus will be exempted from high stakes testing, at least until the SAT/ ACT. </p>

<p>The social studies is <strong>heavily</strong> SJW and there is frequent testing starting in kindergarten. And of course, prepping for testing. I believe the testing is a $$$ racket for the testing companies but also serves a dual purpose of demoralizing students,parents and sidelining non-conformist thinkers.</p>

<p>Did you know that in NYS the state tests are not disclosed to the public even after they&#39;ve been graded, and teachers must sign non-disclosure agreements?</p>

<p>I have a daughter who despite all this consistently scores 4s on the state tests (only ~10% of students statewide score 4s) and she describes the questions as muddled and designed to confuse.</p>
