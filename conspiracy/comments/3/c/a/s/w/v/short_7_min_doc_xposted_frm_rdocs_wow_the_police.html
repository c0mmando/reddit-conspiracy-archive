<p>I just watched this right now and...am quite a bit flabbergasted.  I understand there can be many different sides to every story, and there may very well be multiple sides to this one...but...wat?...what the <em>fuck?</em>  I mean I just don&#39;t even...If what&#39;s being reported on here is accurate, then the level of abject corruption displayed here by the police department is just...it seems almost unprecedented to me.  I know it&#39;s <em>not</em> unprecedented, unfortunately, but...this is just some really horrible shit by the &quot;police&quot; being done here, and...I can&#39;t say I don&#39;t wish some <em>really</em> bad shit upon them.  That is all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus that just makes it all the more unimaginably fucked up.  That we as a citizenry aren&#39;t literally waging civil <em>war</em> against this kind of corruption and are allowing this kind of shit to happen in this country and world makes me feel that we as a species almost really <em>do</em> deserve this kind of shit to happen to us.</p>

<p>I mean...what we&#39;re doing/not doing with all this rampant police corruption reminds me of the type of situation where you have a female in an abusive relationship that she should <em>definitely</em> get out of, but instead of getting out, her Stockholm Syndrome actually <em>protects</em> the abuser from anyone that might jump in to, say, beat the abuser up.</p>

<p>It seems we as a country should almost raise up and fight directly against this corruption, but we&#39;re not...we don&#39;t - even in the face of it <em>blatantly</em> happening like it seems to be happening here - and, as a result, we just sit there like a herd of scared rabbits continuously getting slowly picked off and bitten by a small group of snakes we outnumber 100 to 1.</p>

<p>I know civil war wouldn&#39;t necessarily solve anything in and of itself, and it could create even more problems, but our continuing to allow ourselves as a people to get trampled on like this seems...<em>really</em> not good.</p>

<p>This on one level would most definitely seem true.  However, I&#39;ve come across various rumblings on various occasions where military personnel say that they would defend the civilians if things came down to some sort of state crackdown on the people.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it is a one world brutality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Certainly seems that way.  Yes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>my suggestion is learn to fight, and to smile when you have a gun in your face.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not the worst suggestion.  I&#39;ve followed both of those, for my part.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you didnt ask to be on this earth</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would seem that the physical, Earthly vehicle certainly didn&#39;t anyway.  The intelligent energy that animates that vehicle, however, might have had <em>some</em> say in it perhaps.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and you won&#39;t be asked when you&#39;d like to leave it.</p>

<p>Not on the third dimensional plane anyway.  Other realms might have some idea.</p>

<p>People always say &quot;rappers&quot; or &quot;gang members&quot; are garbage, but the police are a gang.</p>

<p>Chicago has plenty of rappers that will tell you all about the police in there. Chief Keef, one of the most prolific artists pointed a gun in a police officer&#39;s face as a juvenile.</p>

<p>The crime rate is higher than many countries involved in Civil War (Honduras for example) </p>

<p>First of all, why is it &quot;hilarious&quot;?  What&#39;s &quot;hilarious&quot; about it?  Secondly, it&#39;s not &quot;news&quot; to me that corruption exists in this country, and that you think the only reason I would react like this is because it&#39;s &quot;news&quot; to me is...well, plainly wrong.</p>

<p>I can understand this perspective, and it is most definitely unfortunate.  I tend to have respect for everyone, and judge each situation on an individual basis, but am definitely at least very wary of the police.</p>
