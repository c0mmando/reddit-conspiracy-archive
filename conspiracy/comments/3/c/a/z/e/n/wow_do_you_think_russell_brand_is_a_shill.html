       It's so sad if he is. But thinking about it damn his last GF was jemima khan/goldsmith and her brother is married to alice rothschild (not sure if thats how the link with alice is for jemima but there is a link) he had a movie, he had a book (can you imagine bill cooper getting that much coverage lol), he doesnt mention zionists (but in the is this a debate his most popular video he puts complete blame on israel), he says 9/11 isnt an inside job (or maybe thats because someone his stature doesnt want to give the mainstream media an easy mocking point since the mass are unaware that it was infact a hoax). At the same time he seems so genuine and cant imagine him being so secretive especially with his background.
      </p>
      <p>
       do you guys think he is?

       Controlled opposition - there are people out there with opposing views to the mainstream that touch on very valid issues - but are never as hard hitting as one might expect. They often just skim the surface of an issue and reinforce the narrative. They express our outrage for us - so we can go back to our lives thinking someone else is handling it.

       i think he is playing the game carefully, he knows the truth and how to play the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       *i dont believe has has every focused on zionism
*talked about israel
*briefly touched on 9/11 in his book but stays away from speaking about it publicly
      </p>
      <p>
       maybe he doesnt need to do any of the above, but he is the only voice who has an alternative take on the mainstream media which is more logical and makes more sense...

       Watch the trews and make your mind up yourself. He has never talked about 9/11 except referencing that it caused all the imperialism in the middle east.

       He preaches anti-capitalism and tries to blame everything on capitalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what is "not" capitalism? It would be the corrupt politicians and government owning and controlling everything. Should you trust anyone that thinks that is a good idea?

       There are only 2 types of anti-capitalists. Those that don't know the definition of capitalism and have gullibly fallen for communist propaganda talking points. And those that know the difference but use double speak and deception to push the communist agenda.

       Lol with this fear of 'communism' and support for 'capitalism' that is SO 50 years ago.  Isn't it clear by now that the kind of capitalism we have destroys individual rights and the environment so that multinational corporations can make more money?

       Fracking, vaccines, for profit prisons, private healthcare, a shadow banking system large enough to destabilize the global economy, exploitation of the third world, private mercenary forces like Blackwater - all brought to you by capitalism.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of capital goods, by investments that are determined by private decision, and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that are determined mainly by competition in a free market.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Two problems - I don't think private ownership of absolutely everything is by definition a good thing, and taken to it's logical extreme it leads to many of the problems we are now facing.  Should someone be able to own the ocean?  What about water that falls from the sky?  Oxygen?  Collective commons are a good thing.  Everyone should be entitled to land, housing, food, water, etc as a basic human right, not on whether they have enough money to buy these things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, can you give me a real world example of a free market?  I have a theory that there are none.  It is a complete myth, used to justify the current system.  "Oh, Capitalism is great it's just that the government is corrupt, if only we had a free market."  There are no free markets and perhaps there never have been.

       Of course if it is taken to an extreme it can cause problems. But it isn't. We have state owned land, state owned healthcare systems, state owned utilities.. exc... America is not pure capitalism or capitalism taken to an extreme.

       A free market would need a capitalist system to exist but capitalism does not need a free market to exist.  To keep my answer short. I do not ascribe to Laissez-faire free market ideas and completely support tarrifs, logical regulation, and protection from monopolies.

       He's not a shill in my opinion, and I've watched all his episodes of 'The Trews'. I honestly think that privately, he would be in agreement  with us. He just doesn't go there in his vids because, frankly, he's not sufficiently well informed to tackle any of those issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       His angle isn't to offer scholarly analyses on geopolitical matters, he's there to generate anti-establishment enthusiasm. He's trying to remind people that they're independent beings with a right to freedom, and to highlight that voting in elections has nearly 0% possibility of effecting social change.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only extent to which he is 'controlled opposition' is the extent to which his own interests (about being an entertainer, public figure, popular thinker, etc.) rely on him maintaining sufficient credibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       When asked about 9/11 he said that he "didn't want to talk about daft conspiracy theories," but that's really smart. He doesn't want to be known as a conspiracy theorist because that would badly weaken his credibility for all the other stuff he's saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       He generally restricts his commentary to ludicrous stories coming out of the MSM, which seems like shooting fish in a barrel and not particularly important to us, but to young people who don't realize any of this stuff yet, finding out how universally Fox News lies probably comes as something of a shock!
      </p>
      <p>
       If you pay attention to the way he says things, his mannerisms, turns of phrase, etc., I think it's possible to detect that of course he knows many things he can't say and that he's doing the best he can, within the limits of his time and knowledge, to do some socially-responsible content marketing for his movies and comedy tours. Which is what it is.
