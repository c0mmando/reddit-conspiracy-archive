<p>The only reason Reddit is worth anything anymore is because of the audience. Just like they did with 4chan earlier this year, they are trying to drive you away. They don&#39;t want informed individuals here; they don&#39;t want critical thinkers asking questions. They want safe spaces for corporate campaigns like vaccines and GMOs.</p>

<p>And they want to convince you to leave. Divide and conquer yourself. Find an echo chamber with limited visibility and hide there.</p>

<p>P.S. I wrote the above post <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/39fxk0/this_sub_is_being_spammed_and_most_of_these/">3 weeks ago</a> the last time that manufactured reddit drama was used to attack <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True. Though, I&#39;m not the expert on Cyberspace I&#39;m more of an observer in the digital world. I think, honestly, that enough people now realize what time it is; whether it&#39;s for the right reasons or the wrong reasons. Things have been shaken up the last couple of years; were gaining ground. Enough so, that if and when TPTB continue to make mistakes, we can continue to push them over the cliff, ever so slowly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People on here need to step up and become content producers, and if you can&#39;t, then support the ones who do in any way you possibly can. Put your money where your mouth is! Donate to AE911, buy a paid subscription to Red Ice Radio, support whoever <em>you deem worthy</em>. Also, we need to meet locally, and increase the thrust of this movement. Where I live, there is a We Are Change chapter that I am going to be introducing myself to next week (I recetnly moved here so I haven&#39;t had a chance to before). It is boots on the ground time! Read &quot;Rules For Radicals&quot; by Saul Alinsky and I have also heard of a book called Repressive Tolerance being very important as well although I haven&#39;t read it yet (it goes into the Cultural Marxist techniques of division through ideals of &quot;tolerance&quot;). </p>

<p>We need to OPENLY reject policies of mass immigration, war, usury, false flags, forced vaccinations, all of it! This time is our coming out of the closet, voicing ourselves LOUD and STRONG. The fact is, right now the system needs our consent to continue, which is what makes this time critical. Look at how open it is that US is providing aid to ISIS, for instance. It&#39;s there for all eyes to see! This is PR gold for our movement, we just need to <em>exploit it</em> and not become complacent when we start to acheive real victories but allowing these victories to snowball and actually achieve real power. I want to see men like Ron Paul on the thrones of this world. </p>

<p>For too long awakening to how the world really works has made us all feel isolated and alone, well look how many of us realizing this stuff now, realizing how at every step we are lied to, and purposefully manipulated in incredibly calculated ways by those who you can&#39;t descibe in any other way than of having emerged from Satans Infernal Asshole. Strength and Unity Now (SUN) let it&#39;s light shine on this shit! Let the light destroy all this shit! Blazing fires of truth and burning the towers of these fucks to the fucking ground and dancing in the fucking ashes. I&#39;m <em>so tired</em> of living in a world surrounded by lies and people who don&#39;t realize what&#39;s going on or how we have the power to take it all back. But I don&#39;t feel alone anymore, I feel like we are stronger now than we&#39;ve ever been, and we need to take advantage of this. Opportunity only knocks once. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. But distraction can be a really good thing sometimes. We aren&#39;t built for 24/7 shitstorms. With all of the obsession over the government making us fat, sick, weak, etc., you&#39;d think sports would be held in pretty high regard here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why did you post this, delete it, then post it again?</p>

<p>People focus on your last two links all the time. We&#39;re constantly hit with war, fighting, politics, etc. This sub of 300k+ talks about it constantly.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re so worried about the women who post in gone wild, or other people who watch movies, sports, etc. Crowley wrote homoerotic literature. You have no hobbies? No downtime? Sport has existed for a very, very, very long time. </p>

<p>Edit: what does Crowley mean by this? &quot;The joy of life consists in the exercise of one&#39;s energies, continual growth, constant change, the enjoyment of every new experience. To stop means simply to die. The eternal mistake of mankind is to set up an attainable ideal.” </p>

<p>2nd edit: also, I can find no record of him saying that.</p>

<p>quoting your whole comment so you can&#39;t change it.</p>

<p>so let&#39;s start one by one </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dancing and documenting Israelis were intercepted on 9/11/2001.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I assume you mean the post you linked to where five Israelis were questions by police for filiming the WTCs</p>

<p><a href="http://www.911myths.com/index.php/Dancing_Israelis">well let&#39;s dig a little deeper</a> and by deeper I mean literally googling those words together. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>MARIA: Like a few minutes must have gone on, and all of a sudden down there I see this van park. And I see three guys on top of the van, and I&#39;m trying, you know, to look at the building but what caught my attention, they seemed to be taking a movie.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So WTC gets hit by first plane. and some people stop and start filiming it? There was no fore knowledge here. She&#39;d been watching the WTC burn before they stopped the car and started filming</p>

<p>The dancing part?</p>

<p>Completely made up</p>

<p>What she said was</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They--they--they weren&#39;t--they didn&#39;t look shocked to me, you know. They didn&#39;t look shocked. I thought it was very strange.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So ex solders weren&#39;t shocked or scared by a plane hitting a building? And started filiming it? That&#39;s really all you got ? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Israel attacked the USS Liberty, an easily identifiable US Navy vessel, killing 34 American sailors and injuring 172 others on June 8th, 1967.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At least this one sorta happened. Except a few hours after it did Israel publicly admitted doing it. I&#39;ve been in this argument a few time on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> . If Israel had tried to cover it up and frame Egypt or something I could see it but they told the US they&#39;d done it and screwed up a few hours after it happened (and keep in mind this was in 67 not 2015, information took hours to flow through Israel command that there had been a screw up they told the US as quickly as they could AND they paid the families of the sailors)</p>

<p>The Holocaust Myth that was used to traumatize me early in my government indoctrination is provably false. There was no extermination order, there were no gassings, and the six million figure is a technical impossibility.</p>
