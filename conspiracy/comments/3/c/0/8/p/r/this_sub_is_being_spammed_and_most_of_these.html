       Reddit hasn't supported free speech from it's beginning. In 2015, America's Empire will not allow any true free speech places online, and they infiltrate as many in the real world as they can.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason Reddit is worth anything anymore is because of the audience. Just like they did with 4chan earlier this year, they are trying to drive you away. They don't want informed individuals here; they don't want critical thinkers asking questions. They want safe spaces for corporate campaigns like vaccines and GMOs.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they want to convince you to leave. Divide and conquer yourself. Find an echo chamber with limited visibility and hide there.

       We need a platform to convene though, everyone knows reddit is no longer a viable option and people are leaving, but we need to find somewhere and make sure we take as many people with us otherwise everyone is just going to be scattered around all over in smaller numbers.

       True. Though, I'm not the expert on Cyberspace I'm more of an observer in the digital world. I think, honestly, that enough people now realize what time it is; whether it's for the right reasons or the wrong reasons. Things have been shaken up the last couple of years; were gaining ground. Enough so, that if and when TPTB continue to make mistakes, we can continue to push them over the cliff, ever so slowly.

       This is true, more and more conspiracy theories are becoming confirmed conspiracy fact, and more and more people are waking up now each day. It's gaining momentum and it's only a matter of time before things come to an head now.

       People on here need to step up and become content producers, and if you can't, then support the ones who do in any way you possibly can. Put your money where your mouth is! Donate to AE911, buy a paid subscription to Red Ice Radio, support whoever
       <em>
        you deem worthy
       </em>
       . Also, we need to meet locally, and increase the thrust of this movement. Where I live, there is a We Are Change chapter that I am going to be introducing myself to next week (I recetnly moved here so I haven't had a chance to before). It is boots on the ground time! Read "Rules For Radicals" by Saul Alinsky and I have also heard of a book called Repressive Tolerance being very important as well although I haven't read it yet (it goes into the Cultural Marxist techniques of division through ideals of "tolerance").
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to OPENLY reject policies of mass immigration, war, usury, false flags, forced vaccinations, all of it! This time is our coming out of the closet, voicing ourselves LOUD and STRONG. The fact is, right now the system needs our consent to continue, which is what makes this time critical. Look at how open it is that US is providing aid to ISIS, for instance. It's there for all eyes to see! This is PR gold for our movement, we just need to
       <em>
        exploit it
       </em>
       and not become complacent when we start to acheive real victories but allowing these victories to snowball and actually achieve real power. I want to see men like Ron Paul on the thrones of this world.
      </p>
      <p>
       For too long awakening to how the world really works has made us all feel isolated and alone, well look how many of us realizing this stuff now, realizing how at every step we are lied to, and purposefully manipulated in incredibly calculated ways by those who you can't descibe in any other way than of having emerged from Satans Infernal Asshole. Strength and Unity Now (SUN) let it's light shine on this shit! Let the light destroy all this shit! Blazing fires of truth and burning the towers of these fucks to the fucking ground and dancing in the fucking ashes. I'm
       <em>
        so tired
       </em>
       of living in a world surrounded by lies and people who don't realize what's going on or how we have the power to take it all back. But I don't feel alone anymore, I feel like we are stronger now than we've ever been, and we need to take advantage of this. Opportunity only knocks once.

       That is one possibility, I suspect they already have one over there anyway. My main concern is that everyone is going to end up going to different sites and rather than staying together as one big collective we will be spread out and thinning out.

       A lot of it seems to be relentless bandwagonism - someone sees a hot button story do well, and they submit some very similar story for the possibility of karma (pointless!) and personal recognition.

       The reddit drama, happening along side all the jade helm stuff, the fbi and cia terror watches, all the political bs and civil unrest should be giving r/conspiracy users the hebie jebies. Anytime anything happens I check reddit first because I can usually find the best information here. The fact that this is happening now is too coincidental for my taste, and freaks me out that whatever "they" are possibly planning is big enough to need a huge distraction on social media.

       Yeah. But distraction can be a really good thing sometimes. We aren't built for 24/7 shitstorms. With all of the obsession over the government making us fat, sick, weak, etc., you'd think sports would be held in pretty high regard here.

       Why did you post this, delete it, then post it again?
      </p>
      <p>
       People focus on your last two links all the time. We're constantly hit with war, fighting, politics, etc. This sub of 300k+ talks about it constantly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know why you're so worried about the women who post in gone wild, or other people who watch movies, sports, etc. Crowley wrote homoerotic literature. You have no hobbies? No downtime? Sport has existed for a very, very, very long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: what does Crowley mean by this? "The joy of life consists in the exercise of one's energies, continual growth, constant change, the enjoyment of every new experience. To stop means simply to die. The eternal mistake of mankind is to set up an attainable ideal.”

       I agree with him though, the hivemind absolutely brigades anything to do with antivax or gmo posts outside of this sub, most of reddit thinks we're all nuts, so while I get the narrative you're trying to convey, in reality it doesn't make much sense.

       You bring up good arguments and it's true that Israel is a villain. That doesn't include Jews abroad, or really even the population of Israel; though they are being brainwashed. Do you think that Israel is the head of the Black Octopus? Or just another tentacle?

       At least this one sorta happened. Except a few hours after it did Israel publicly admitted doing it. I've been in this argument a few time on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . If Israel had tried to cover it up and frame Egypt or something I could see it but they told the US they'd done it and screwed up a few hours after it happened (and keep in mind this was in 67 not 2015, information took hours to flow through Israel command that there had been a screw up they told the US as quickly as they could AND they paid the families of the sailors)
