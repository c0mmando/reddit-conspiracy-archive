       To me, it seems more plausible with each passing day. "She" "ruins" the site as thoroughly as possible, and just when it seems like reddit might
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       start losing enough traffic that it becomes statistically significant, they'll eventually "let her go" or she'll "quit" in the most embarrassing, satisfying way. Then, all they have to do is scale back the damage
       <em>
        just enough
       </em>
       to appease the masses, but still get away with more changes than they could have otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ta-da, Bob's your uncle: you now have a squeaky clean, thoroughly corporate-culture-ized, "safe", and mass-appealing "entertainment" aggregator. Ripe for monetization and integration with the mainstream spotlight; instead of the unprofitable, un-marketable mess of "free speech" it was before.

       That makes a lot of sense. Especially since she is just the interim CEO, as in temporarily filling the position as long as she's willing to toe the line.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given her background, Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from Princeton, Doctorate in Law and MBA in Business from Harvard, she is obviously a very determined individual.  If the board of directors tells her that they want to make reddit more profitable, that is going to be her sole focus.  She doesn't give a fuck about the community, the mods or the integrity of the site.
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole shit storm after firing Victoria really could not have happened any better for the Board of Directors because now they have the perfect out.  It's not like Pao can sue them for gender discrimination when the entire site is blaming her for the fiasco.  The petition to get her fired already has 100,000 signatures.

       Pretty much exactly what I was thinking; It's not exactly news that reddit has never been profitable. They've had plenty of investors over the years, and it's been a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of years. There
       <em>
        has
       </em>
       to be a fire under
       <em>
        someone's
       </em>
       ass to get this site making money asap.
      </p>
      <p>
       That would require making lots of changes, very quickly. Lots of unpopular changes. Enough to cripple the userbase. It's a tricky, potential suicide mission.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, IIRC, I think I read somewhere that said exactly that she was brought in to make reddit "profitable". This might just be what they ment the whole time.

        In general, probably not worth it. In my opion Reddit is not near the
upper crust of the social sharing, RSS feed, user-generated links sites
and certainly not compatible with paid content. If you look at their
topics, it's actually quite lowbrow. We'd probably get better mileage out
of StumbleUpon or Digg, if it's something we're thinking about pursuing.

       Reddit was a threat to the elite due to the exchange of uncensored ideas and with so many member and being such a tightknit group of people,  it had to be stopped.

      <p>
       Recently, more and more evidence has emerged that there is something very wrong going on with Reddit. While the concept is brilliant, the corporation and its administration are corrupt. In early 2012, a hacker named Jeremy Hammond leaked (through Wikileaks) the emails of the private intelligence firm Stratfor, and his cache included emails showing that the Chairman of Reddit (Alexis Ohanian) had met with the CEO of Stratfor (George Friedman), and sought to work with Stratfor as a consultant.[1] Hammond is currently in jail, having been served a ten-year long sentence for having hacked and leaked these emails.

        To me, it seems more plausible with each passing day. "She" "ruins" the site as thoroughly as possible, and just when it seems like reddit might actually start losing enough traffic that it becomes statistically significant, they'll eventually "let her go" or she'll "quit" in the most embarrassing, satisfying way. Then, all they have to do is scale back the damage just enough to appease the masses, but still get away with more changes than they could have otherwise.

       Definitely makes sense as a theory, and you might well be right, but without any physical evidence it's just speculation.

       Not even. That post still implies that Ellen Pao is orchestrating some grand scheme to rip-off the reddit shareholders. I'm saying that the reddit
       <em>
        Board of Directors
       </em>
       is the puppet-master to an unwitting (or very much
       <em>
        already
       </em>
       paid-off/willing scapegoat, who owes a lot of money and could use the gig) to instigate changes they've wanted to make all along but otherwise couldn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two slightly different takes on the same situation, but then again, we're all speculating, so I refuse to say anyone is
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       right than the other. I think we can all agree this smells fishy, either way.

       You're giving them too much credit. She was a nepotism hire, and they liked her politics. She promised to monetize Reddit, and she is taking (wrong-headed) steps to do so.

       The conclusion of conspiracy requires that we credit them with competence...and none of their actions suggest foresight.
