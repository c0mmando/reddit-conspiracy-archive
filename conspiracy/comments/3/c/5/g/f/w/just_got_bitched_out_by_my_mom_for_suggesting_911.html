    <div class="md"><p>Saying 9/11 was fake is technically incorrect. Because it was a REAL event.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t bombshell your near and dear ones with the climax. </p>

<p>Ask them legit questions (depending on her background and knowledge). Let them answer your questions one by one. </p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ol>
<li>How many buildings fell on 9/11 in NYC?</li>
</ol>

<p>Ans: 3. Wtc 1, 2, 7. (Sheeple will answer only &quot; 2 &quot; -  twin towers)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why did the 9/11 commission report did not mention the collapse of 3rd building(wtc 7)</p></li>
<li><p>Why is the FBI not releasing the boarding flight footage of Atta?</p></li>
<li><p>If there are so many cameras inside airport, why only release few selected ones?</p></li>
<li><p>Why was one of the airport footage without a time stamp? How can anyone verify the legitimacy of such footage?</p></li>
<li><p>BBC reports 7 of 19 hijackers are still alive. Why didn&#39;t the FBI take any action ?</p></li>
<li><p>If 17 of 19 hijackers were Saudis, then why did the US invade Afghanistan?</p></li>
<li><p>How come Bush family have relations with Shafiq Bin Laden in US via Carlyle Group?</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok here we go with the <a href="http://en.metapedia.org/wiki/Anti-Semitism">Anti Semitism</a>. That guy was disappointing because he was perpetuating a stereotype that is increasing everyday. If you&#39;ve ever been on one of the chan websites or one of those christian pride sites or Israel.</p>

<p>The whole Jews thing is inaccurate since Zionists do not have to be Jewish. It is almost a disambiguation like illuminati because they(whoever doesn&#39;t research enough) do not know of the term Zionism. But it is not entirely false, as the majority of Zionists(whether victims or not) live in Israel. Like the guy I replied to. Heck he might be <a href="http://en.metapedia.org/wiki/JIDF">JIDF</a>.</p>

<p>You know one of my black friends who goes to Cornell was the first person to ever tell me Jews run the world. That was the weirdest thing he&#39;s ever said to me, but he was the smartest guy I knew and that stereotype turned out to be true. Offensive or not, it is true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whatever you do, don&#39;t let this issue get between you and your mom. You can have the debate with the rest of the world. No need to bring it into your home and give your mother grief. </p>

<p>The fact is that most Americans are never going to accept that 911 was an inside job. That includes your mom and almost everyone else you will ever know. The reasons for this range from (a) people just don&#39;t want to think their own government would do such a thing, to (b) a large number of the people associated with the truth movement are creepy and flaky, to (c) there are wildly inconsistent theories about what &quot;really&quot; happened on 9/11, proving that even the &quot;truthers&quot; don&#39;t know what happened, to (d) in my opinion, and it will not be popular here, 9/11 was not an inside job.</p>

<p>I&#39;m open minded to the possibility that 9/11 was an inside job; after all, <em>someone</em> was behind it, and there is no reason why it <em>had</em> to be non-Americans. But if people are going to make a claim of that magnitude, they need overwhelming evidence, and that evidence just doesn&#39;t exist. (I&#39;ve been looking closely at the evidence for 15 years; it just doesn&#39;t add up.)</p>

<p>Anyway, giving you a non-9/11 truther&#39;s perspective, and I really wouldn&#39;t hold it against you if you continued to believe it <em>was</em> an inside job. My only advice is don&#39;t let it become a thing between you and your mom. That&#39;s too important a relationship for you to let this get in the way of.</p>

<p>In my experience with my own mother, I&#39;ve learned that she will always love and care for me and my opinion, regardless of how different it may be from her own.</p>

<p>When I say &quot;Gotta keep going,&quot; I think that <a href="/u/denmaradi">/u/denmaradi</a> is giving you a perfect example of how to slowly chip away at what you feel could be the truth.</p>

<p>The key here is to open up the critical thinking vein and perhaps, someday,  she or anyone you feel like talking about this to could come to the same thoughts and conclusions you have.  They could be right, they could be wrong, but ultimately if they get to a point on their own with the questions you ask, where this is a plausible theory, we&#39;re one step closer to a better world.</p>

<p>No, I think my mother is generally dumb of her own volition (think &quot;helpless&quot; and childish).</p>

<p>Well there&#39;s your problem.  Where the fuck is the respect for your mother?  Newsflash, people don&#39;t respond well when you talk down to them.</p>

<p>If you want to help your mom understand 9/11 BE RESPECTFUL and talk with her (on her level), NOT at her.  Ask for her insight and understanding of the world to help you answer some of the question you struggle with in regards to 9/11.  Attempt to work together, finding the common ground.  If no common ground can be found and the other person is unwilling to have a discussion in a reasonable fashion, it&#39;s best to disengage.  </p>

<p>Family and friends are some to the hardest people to wake up.  They know YOU all too well.  The best way to wake up those closest to you is to lead by example.  Be the change you wish to see in the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think of it this way. As long as you love your mom and would like her to know the truth then you have to be firm. Weren&#39;t you punished as a child? She didn&#39;t punish you to hurt you she did it because she loved you and wanted to correct you. She&#39;ll always be your mom but you&#39;re no longer a child. If need be, yell, get heated, don&#39;t back down to her denials. Sure you&#39;ll get mad at each other and you&#39;ll be sour for a while but eventually you&#39;ll talk again. As your mom She&#39;s always going to love you even when she doesn&#39;t like you. Be confident that the truth is more important than ignorant feelings (not saying all feelings are ignorant) and she&#39;ll thank and respect you for being an adult. She raised you and now it is your obligation to inform her about the world that changed around her. Direct her emotional responses to their proper place but never apologize for speaking the truth. </p>

<p>This goes for anyone you encounter that is asleep not just loved ones. Sheep are sleep because they follow evil dominant voices. You&#39;re closer be an honest dominant voice and let them follow your lead, eventually most people will awaken and we can all enjoy peace.</p>
