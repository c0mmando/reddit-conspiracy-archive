<p>This is the thing that really gives me pause. Of course we should care! What a bizarre thing to say. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t make sense. He&#39;s critical of the war but he won&#39;t admit 9/11 was an inside job :/ I think its because he is an established professor who would get shunned among the intellectual community for supporting &quot;fringe nonsense&quot; as they see it.

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, but that will never happen, and if it did it would come to the same conclusions as the 911 commission. I mean, get real, who do you think will run whatever trial there would be (which there will not be).</p>

<p>It is not defeatist, it is obvious. The only way these conspiracies will come out is after everyone is dead. Chomsky is not stupid, he knows that it won&#39;t be resolved in our lifetime, so what does it matter? Chasing old conspiracies is a job for someone, but it is not going to change the world as much as changing opinions about things that have yet to happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its called cognitive dissonance. Any time someone is presented with information that contradicts or even completely refutes their established beliefs, they encounter a kind of mental stress. That stress is best relieved by simply excusing the person objecting to the belief as being either a crackpot, or part of the conspiracy. This is why the word &quot;shill&quot; is thrown around a lot in subs like this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. I mean I do have a master&#39;s degree in Mechanical Engineering, but anyone with a stopwatch can tell it was a controlled demolition -- not a &quot;pancake collapse&quot; as it&#39;s characterized. If it was a controlled demolition, it was an inside job.</p>

<p>And all the people helping cover for it are complicit in mass murder -- not just the 3000 dead on that day, but the over 1 million Iraqis and Afghans murdered, thanks largely to the deception being maintained.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I don&#39;t think your reasoning could be called &quot;logical&quot;, because your argument rests on the fallacious &#39;appeal to authority&#39;.</p>

<p>You accept what someone says, simply because they said so. The entity in question, which we have generalized as &quot;the government&quot;, has put forward something we have called the &quot;official explanation&quot;. This explanation is sourced upon primarily 2 organizations (9/11 commission, NIST).</p>

<p>As I have already pointed out, to either you or one of your sockpuppets, both of these entities have produced explanations I find less than satisfactory. Every other viewpoint about this issue (that is specifically if a satisfactory explanation was produced) is inconsequential to my viewpoint. I have read the material in question, and big questions remain. They spent more money on investigating Monica Lewinsky <em>and</em> the people doing the investigation <em>weren&#39;t</em> a potential conflict of interest. </p>

<p>You or any other Useful Idiot that comes along parroting a misinformed viewpoint promoting some kind of blanket explanation for the questionable contexts involved in the investigation have little relevance to the conversation I&#39;m having.</p>

<p>What you perceive as a &quot;vendetta against authority&quot; in this instance is actually a repeated attempt to point out to you that your reasoning isn&#39;t as sound as you may think it is.</p>

<p>If you can present a more complete, compelling, and correct explanation of the events and are able to answer questions and articulate your specific meanings, I would be more than happy to engage you in a civil dialectic. Otherwise, your opinion to me is largely inconsequential. </p>

<p>Please don&#39;t misunderstand, I know totally what you mean. My point is there were many, many &quot;mailmen&quot; before, on and after 9/11, doing their jobs as always, unknowingly helping a plan come together.

<p>Do you mean knowingly or unknowingly? The math has been done several times now, with most different numbers, and different qualifiers. A few who had the big picture, a few more who acted on a need-to-know basis, and a lot more who were doing just their everyday jobs or following orders. The mailman did not have to know how the towers would come down. The demo worker did not have to know there would be a plane. The jet pilot would just fly his exercise and never wonder how the last honest politicians would be swayed to keep their mouths shut. That&#39;s the nature and beauty of compartmentalization. </p>

<p>That would consequently include every trucker, steel worker and other people who helped to clean up Ground Zero in record time and destroy the evidence with thermal lances, buckets and by shipping off the steel to China at Vmax.

<p>They are, in a sense. Unknowingly, against their will even, but they are complicit, and so are all taxpayers of Natoland. From mailman to milkman. </p>

<p>Did you not pay attention in history class? Who allowed 9/11 and its wars to happen, who voted the &quot;order givers&quot; into office, who empowered the industrials and banksters? Natoland&#39;s peoples will have to answer for their &quot;negligence&quot; for generations to come just like the peoples of the Third Reich did, and they must be glad that the verdict was not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_Must_Perish!">Germany must perish</a>! </p>

<p>Collective responsibility is a thing. </p>

<p>Look, you do&#39;t have to yell at me. My &quot;technically...&quot; interjection was but half a jest.I&#39;m cool. All I&#39;m saying is that 9/11 is a complete system failure on so many levels that there&#39;s no &quot;only these are guilty of giving orders and knowing the whole plan and the rest innocent by following them&quot; - including the mailman, of course. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not advocating revenge, I was seeking discourse. </p>

<p>What about, for example, the guys sitting in those huge machines cutting the steel columns into small pieces and putting them on a barge? Did they not understand they were destroying evidence for the greatest crime of the New American Century - at Vmax?</p>

<p>Nope. They were to busy trying to not get killed by falling debris while they were working. I&#39;m pretty sure even the owner/s of the top general contractor on clean up didn&#39;t even consider evidence. They just picked up a job to bring in revenue. Do you think a bum cares if they got a dollar from a murderer who passed by and handed it over? Whoever ordered the cleanup is were your pitchfork should be pointed. </p>

<p>Why speculate if you can know better? I recommend whole-heartedly <a href="http://www.911conspiracy.tv/pdf/9-11_Debris_An_Investigation_of_Ground_Zero_by_Matt_Nelson.pdf">9/11 Debris</a> by Matt Nelson.</p>

<p>The contractors for debris removal were  AMEC, Bovis Lend Lease, Turner Construction and Tully Construction. It&#39;s an open secret that <a href="http://www.911conspiracy.tv/cache/nydailynews-com_2005-12-05_exposed__map_of_ground_zero_.html">THE MOB</a> got a share of the spoils. New York, New York! Does that make them Vulkans, innocent opportunists, or do I have a point hypothesizing compartmentalization, need-to-know basis, and systemic failure?</p>

<p>That would be the hijacking we&#39;ve been talking about, yes. They only tore down the last bastion on 9/11. </p>

<p>Nobody says that. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure it&#39;s 100000 guilty employees too.</p>

<p>Do you mean knowingly or unknowingly? The math has been done several times now, with most different numbers, and different qualifiers. A few who had the big picture, a few more who acted on a need-to-know basis, and a lot more who were doing just their everyday jobs or following orders. The mailman did not have to know how the towers would come down. The demo worker did not have to know there would be a plane. The jet pilot would just fly his exercise and never wonder how the last honest politicians would be swayed to keep their mouths shut. That&#39;s the nature and beauty of compartmentalization. </p>
