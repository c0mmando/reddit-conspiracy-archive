       It seems as though, based on his various interviews, as if Noam Chomsky does not openly admit, to a public audience, that he believes 9/11 to be committed by the U.S. government. Who does he believe committed the events on 9/11/2001, if anyone would happen to know?

       This is the thing that really gives me pause. Of course we should care! What a bizarre thing to say.

      <p>
       It is this singular statement that made me realize Chomsky is compromised. Whether self-censoring (less likely) or controlled opposition (highly likely).

       It was a distressing revelation for me. I always highly respected the man.

       Will you look at that: Chomsky single-handedly dismantles the logic behind the truther movement in one fell swoop.

       It doesn't make sense. He's critical of the war but he won't admit 9/11 was an inside job :/ I think its because he is an established professor who would get shunned among the intellectual community for supporting "fringe nonsense" as they see it. Or he won't admit it was an inside job because he's part of the "tribe" that orchestrated the whole thing.

       That's a self-fulfilling prophecy and defeatist attitude unfit for an anyone calling themselves an activist. And we already have the truth; what we need now is a criminal trial and evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.

       Sure, but that will never happen, and if it did it would come to the same conclusions as the 911 commission. I mean, get real, who do you think will run whatever trial there would be (which there will not be).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not defeatist, it is obvious. The only way these conspiracies will come out is after everyone is dead. Chomsky is not stupid, he knows that it won't be resolved in our lifetime, so what does it matter? Chasing old conspiracies is a job for someone, but it is not going to change the world as much as changing opinions about things that have yet to happen.

       No, just heavily conditioned people. Imo Chomsky doesn't want to be marginalized as a 9/11 truther. We have seen many famous people become demonized for entertaining the idea that the official story of 9/11 is not everything we are being told.

       Its called cognitive dissonance. Any time someone is presented with information that contradicts or even completely refutes their established beliefs, they encounter a kind of mental stress. That stress is best relieved by simply excusing the person objecting to the belief as being either a crackpot, or part of the conspiracy. This is why the word "shill" is thrown around a lot in subs like this.

       Nope. I mean I do have a master's degree in Mechanical Engineering, but anyone with a stopwatch can tell it was a controlled demolition -- not a "pancake collapse" as it's characterized. If it was a controlled demolition, it was an inside job.
      </p>
      <p>
       And all the people helping cover for it are complicit in mass murder -- not just the 3000 dead on that day, but the over 1 million Iraqis and Afghans murdered, thanks largely to the deception being maintained. Won't surprise me to see mass executions in the near future. Shit always flows downhill, and they already have the guillotines.

       Well, I don't think your reasoning could be called "logical", because your argument rests on the fallacious 'appeal to authority'.
      </p>
      <p>
       You accept what someone says, simply because they said so. The entity in question, which we have generalized as "the government", has put forward something we have called the "official explanation". This explanation is sourced upon primarily 2 organizations (9/11 commission, NIST).
      </p>
      <p>
       As I have already pointed out, to either you or one of your sockpuppets, both of these entities have produced explanations I find less than satisfactory. Every other viewpoint about this issue (that is specifically if a satisfactory explanation was produced) is inconsequential to my viewpoint. I have read the material in question, and big questions remain. They spent more money on investigating Monica Lewinsky
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       the people doing the investigation
       <em>
        weren't
       </em>
       a potential conflict of interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       You or any other Useful Idiot that comes along parroting a misinformed viewpoint promoting some kind of blanket explanation for the questionable contexts involved in the investigation have little relevance to the conversation I'm having.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you perceive as a "vendetta against authority" in this instance is actually a repeated attempt to point out to you that your reasoning isn't as sound as you may think it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can present a more complete, compelling, and correct explanation of the events and are able to answer questions and articulate your specific meanings, I would be more than happy to engage you in a civil dialectic. Otherwise, your opinion to me is largely inconsequential.

       The fire in WTC 7 was not fought. It was allowed to rage free because two of the world's tallest buildings were next door and had just been hit by jet airliners. That's why you can't find another example: that situation has only happened one time.

       Exactly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please don't misunderstand, I know totally what you mean. My point is there were many, many "mailmen" before, on and after 9/11, doing their jobs as always, unknowingly helping a plan come together. I agree "the government did it" is too simple. The government got hijacked, long before 9/11, and unknowingly helped perpetrate 9/11. Even the mailman.

       The government looked stupid while private corporations attacked on 9/11. That doesn't make all government employees complicit with murder. I'm sure it's 100000 guilty employees too. Innocent until proven guilty applies to everyone.

       Do you mean knowingly or unknowingly? The math has been done several times now, with most different numbers, and different qualifiers. A few who had the big picture, a few more who acted on a need-to-know basis, and a lot more who were doing just their everyday jobs or following orders. The mailman did not have to know how the towers would come down. The demo worker did not have to know there would be a plane. The jet pilot would just fly his exercise and never wonder how the last honest politicians would be swayed to keep their mouths shut. That's the nature and beauty of compartmentalization.

       That would consequently include every trucker, steel worker and other people who helped to clean up Ground Zero in record time and destroy the evidence with thermal lances, buckets and by shipping off the steel to China at Vmax. Mailmen all the way down. Of course there was compartmentalization.

       Did you not pay attention in history class? Who allowed 9/11 and its wars to happen, who voted the "order givers" into office, who empowered the industrials and banksters? Natoland's peoples will have to answer for their "negligence" for generations to come just like the peoples of the Third Reich did, and they must be glad that the verdict was not

       Look, you do't have to yell at me. My "technically..." interjection was but half a jest.I'm cool. All I'm saying is that 9/11 is a complete system failure on so many levels that there's no "only these are guilty of giving orders and knowing the whole plan and the rest innocent by following them" - including the mailman, of course.

       Nope. They were to busy trying to not get killed by falling debris while they were working. I'm pretty sure even the owner/s of the top general contractor on clean up didn't even consider evidence. They just picked up a job to bring in revenue. Do you think a bum cares if they got a dollar from a murderer who passed by and handed it over? Whoever ordered the cleanup is were your pitchfork should be pointed.
