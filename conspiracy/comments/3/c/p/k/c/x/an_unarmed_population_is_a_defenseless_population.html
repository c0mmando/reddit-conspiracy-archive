       I understand that everyone is worried about our guns being taken away but there really is no way for that to happen.  It's too late, everyone already has guns. Hell, if they even tried it would cause an uprising.

       It won't be a quick thing.  They are masters of public manipulation.  A few more false flag shootings, more prominent people paid to make anti-gun statements.  Demonize gun owners, associate them with terrorism.  Then slowly start increasing the restrictions on who can own and what they can own.

       Try getting a simple Glock 43.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a very reliable and safe gun. The whole reason I want one is because it's safe and reliable. I can't get one because of the California gun ban. The list is huge. You wouldn't believe how many guns are banned in California. And that ten round mag limit is bullshit. "Round indicators" giving you more parts to break. It's awful here.

       You can't buy it because Glock has not submitted it to California for approval to be sold within California. It's not banned or illegal, it's just not available for sale until Glock submits it to be added to the roster. Learn your facts.

       Tell Glock to observe state law and submit their pistol for approval for sale then or buy it another way.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not a de facto ban in the same way that an effective drug  available in another country, unavailable in the US until the drug manufacturer submits it to the FDA for approval, is not a banned drug

       If I machine the barrel so that the suppressor is part of the barrel, that is currently illegal, thus it is an infringement on my ability to own arms with built in suppressors.

       By kidnap and torture you he means they will arrest you and send you to jail.  OP is an anarchocapitalist, I can tell because the video he posted is by the famous ancap
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Kokesh">
        adam kokesh

       and because referring to arrest and imprisonment as kidnapping and torture is classic ancap retoric.

       Okay, well words have specific meanings. You may not agree with the actions of the government (hell, I don't a lot of the time), but calling "arrest and imprison" "kidnap and torture" is disingenuous and patently false giving the literal definitions of those words.

       Where in California do you live? I'm asking because I may be moving to Los Angeles and have been doubting the decision. 
I am afraid things shit will hit the fan and I wouldn't want to be there of all places.

       I live on the West Side. It's incrementally better. Less crime. Fantastically expensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a shit hits the fan scenario Los Angeles will burn. There isn't enough water naturally in this basin to sustain more than a couple hundred thousand people. Without the Colorado River and the valley giving us their water we'd have nothing. You can't grow anything here which means all of the food must be imported.
      </p>
      <p>
       If something catastrophic happened it would be something between Seven Samurai and Mad Max 2. I'm getting out of here in the next couple years just in case things go sour. I'm moving close enough to Canada that I can bug out in a worst case scenario. That or I'll just move to Mexico. I can pick up some basic Spanish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah in a shit hits the fan scenario any major city will be trouble. Dallas, Philly, Miami, New York, Chicago and so on. These are the places that will burn. Rural areas will be just fine. Especially in the south where they have guns and can protect their property.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you move here it's best to be rich.

       Maybe its just because I am from the south. But the shootings only truly accomplish one thing in my mind and the minds of just about everyone I know.  That is making smart, good, law abiding folks like me want

       For me, this is semi-true.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I now want fire arms is because I've finally realized that the weapon bans are all about disarming and controlling the population. The shootings are used as justification for bans and confiscations. Which means an encroaching security state. Which makes me leery of the government all the more. Which makes me more distrustful and makes me want to protect myself from their violence should they ever decide that the general population, myself included, are a threat to be "handled."

       You are so right. But let's face it. Your factual observation won't make a dent in the conservative psyche. If conservatives didn't have their irrational fear of having their guns taken away, they would not know what to do with themselves. It's what defines them.

       I cannot get the gun I want (Glock 43). Because of a gun ban. By Feinstein.

       There are new people being born now who will want to be able to defend themselves and they'll be denied the ability to defend themselves because of villains like Feinstein. Look at the California gun ban on a timeline and the guns will disappear over a couple generations. Only old guns are alowed here. And the really reliable ones are being actively discouraged and banned.

       Yes, that's right. There
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       huge differences between liberals and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans. In fact, the differences are greater today, in 2015, than they have been for
       <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21591190-united-states-amoeba">
        a long, long time
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Are the parties different on every issue? No. Not at all. They are disturbingly aligned on a number of important issues, mainly economics and foreign policy. (Although, still, there are important differences.)
      </p>
      <p>
       But the parties are wildly different on a long list of extremely important issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gay marriage. Campaign finance. Union rights. Social Security. Medicare. Medicaid. Obamacare. Immigration. Etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Romney or McCain had been elected in 2008 or 2012, the main entitlement programs (like Social Security) would have been wiped out. They survive because Obama won and defended them.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Republicans had won in 2008 or 2012, there would be no Obamacare, and tens of millions of people would not have access to health care. That's millions of lives improved because a Democrat got elected instead of a Republican.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Republicans had won in 2008 or 2012, we would never have pulled out of Iraq; the war would have continued at the pace it was on when Bush left office.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Republicans had won in 2008 or 2012, we would have more conservative justices like Scalia, Alito, Roberts, and Thomas, instead of the Justices Obama appointed, Kagen and Sotomayor. Obama's two Justices opposed the Citizens United decision that unleashed unlimited cash in political campaigns. The Republicans supported it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could go on and on; the differences between the two parties are drastic and incredibly important.

       I don't count owning a gun as a right.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm an anarchist and do not believe in the U.S. Federal government or the U.S. Constitution. Governments do not grant rights. The moment you buy into that bullshit you're a slave begging them to "allow" you to live your own life. What I do believe in is treating people with respect and dignity like you would anyone. Since the government does not do this I choose to be able to defend myself against such psychopaths whether they like it or not.

       What right do they have to take away my gun?

       BTW I don't fucking live in Illinois, so what the fuck do I care!  I live in a state where it takes only about $500 and a few classes to get the proper permits for a suppressor and an automatic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now on to your next completely invalid point. I have a pretty good understanding of constitutional law as had to take classes on it to get my degree. The right to bear arms, means the right to own and carry a
       <strong>
        firearm
       </strong>
       and
       <strong>
        ammunition
       </strong>
       only.  Since there was no such thing as suppressor back when the constitution was drafted that left such modifications or attachments open to further legislation, because a suppressor is neither a gun or ammo it is not protected by the 2nd amendment. There is a
       <strong>
        ton
       </strong>
       of case law on this stuff whether it be suppressors, fully autos, the difference between open and concealed, and much much more. It's all pretty interesting, I suggest you check it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway all I'm saying is that phrase you seem to love so much
       <em>
        shall not be infringed
       </em>
       , it only covers the weapon and the ammo. Not any attachments or mods.  I for one like the fact that permitting required to get those things, it keeps basket cases like you from getting them, meanwhile I had the money and time to get my permits.

       I didn't call you an idiot, I asked if you were an idiot or ignorant,using hyperbole to express that what you are saying is not true, and basic factual information which you should be aware of proves that statement being made to be incorrect.
      </p>
      <p>
       No need to directly insult man, though we may differ in opinion on this issue, that is not grounds to falsely label me "crazy".
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to use rhetoric, say that my position is extreme and that i am misinterpreting the amendment.

       <p>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So then I manufacture a rifle with a non-detachable suppressor and it will be legal because it is not a modification or attachment, it's a suppressed barrel, and when that is the inherent base design, it is not a modification on the barrel.
      </p>

      <p>
       Why? Why do citizens need permits to own quiet guns?
      </p>
      <p>
       My .22lr is already pretty damn quiet, so your thinly veiled reason of "can't trust certain people with suppressed weapons" is completely unfounded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if I really wanted to suppress my weapons I do not need to purchase an actual suppressor, let's not play stupid here man you and I both know how to make homemade suppressors, it's not hard, and not that either of us are but any moron can pull up a how to online.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>

      <p>
       So are you alleging that people who have less time and money do not have the right to own suppressors? That's very elitist.

       If only it wasn't $200 per silencer. In fact. Fuck it. I think I've got $200 to spare. It'd be totally worth it to be able to shoot without hearing protection.

       My body turned down a $20 plea deal today and dropping two felony charges to stand up for his principals. The jury found him guilty of the two misdemeanors and innocent of the two felonies. Two months ago the same trial was over a single felony and the jury returned a hung verdict. Thus round two wherein the prosecutor threw an additional tree charges to load the dice.
      </p>
      <p>
       I support him fully. He's facing a year of jail time. He flinched when a prison guard hoisted him up by a pressure point in the armpit because he was passively resisting an unlawful incarceration over contempt for refusing to pay attorney fees of his ex in a child visitation suit he brought to enforce his right to father his child.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's kicking himself in the ass a bit now. $20 + $380 in court fees seems a small price to pay for freedom. It isn't freedom if you have to buy it. The prosecutor is absolutely vindictive and the case should a been dropped. For fucks sake, $20 fine for striking a prison guard?!? (Which he didn't do btw I've seen the video the jury saw wherein he flinches before they literally break his face against the wall.) Maybe I won't mention the lack of medical care for three days, the extra two days in solitary he wasn't sentenced to, and fuckkkkkk
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeh. Fuck the State. My friend is free for now the judge put sentencing off for two months. (Crazy right?)

       Anyway. Stand by your principles. Every time you do you make the world a better place and inspire others to do the same.

       Grow a survival food forest a la Geoff Lawton. The best PDW in my mind is a secluded oasis of food, fuel, fodder, fiber, and farmaceuticals. Oh and a paper library. The Beretta CX4 is pretty sweet too. Also California compliant!

       . . . Beretta CX4.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to go with an M&amp;P Shield 9mm, but my pick was the Glock 43. Slightly shorter and less possibility of printing. Since the Shield is heavier this is actually good because I'm a new shooter and the recoil will be muted. I wanted the Glock 43, but, for my purposes, the Shield will be fine. The take-down isn't too bad either so it should be easy to clean even for a lazy punk like me.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, yeah, the food forest / permaculture thing is the way to go. I have a buddy up in Portland who does that. He's growing close to 70% of his own food. That's incredible. He's got close to the ideal lifestyle.

       70% is incredible. Not literally. Commendable might be a better word. I personally don't believe in self sufficiency I think it takes a whole village to feed a village. Heart, mind, body, and soul. I'm working toward that myself, only just began and currently am watching the trees grow and focusing on earthworks.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeh, I got a Beretta 92 and fuck if I never shoot the thing. Rifles are just so much more easier to handle and more fun. The only thing the pistol has got going is my state permits loaded handguns but not rifles in cars. Loading a CX4 takes less time than picking it up tho. The concealability of the pistol could be mentioned but need a permit for that here and in a shtf situation, openly carrying seems a more effective deterrent.
      </p>
      <p>
       But follow your own drum. I'm sure you've done your homework and picked what suits your needs best. I never much liked Glocks myself. Steel frames make better cudgels and can take more abuse. Honestly considering trading the 92 for a wheelgun. That would solve all my limpwristing problems. I'm such a bitch. Lol.

       I'm a big believer in the village concept myself. It's nice to hear of someone who understands this basic notion of community in the proper sense. People cooperating because they wish to rather than because they're forced to.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the pistol, I only like the pistol because in a catastrophic scenario the pistol will likely be your life line out of the home. As where the rifle / carbine / shotgun will likely be more of a home defense weapon. Since I think I have a bead on a CCW permit I'm going to train first with what I would expect to be my first choice in a pinch: a hand gun. Simple, but effective.

       I just want a revolver and learn to shoot from the hip. I'll probably get a 10 round 22, as they're more utilitarian and less loud for shtf purposes. Something tells me a .357 or a .45 long colt would be a helluva lot of fun though.

       I was thinking about a ten round .22lr for a while too. The primary reason I decided on a single stack auto is because of the CCW aspect. With reloads coming in a close second. I want a revolver too. There's something very satisfying about a minimalistic operation. The only way it could possibly get any more simple was if it was a single shot. Which would make it borderline useless in my opinion.

       Get a gun anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where I live the police are hyper violent and the only way I can carry a gun is to get a permission slip (like a little bitch), but if I don't I risk being murdered. You gotta weigh your options.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also leaving this state at some point so I'll be able to get a proper gun later. For now, though, I'll be okay with an M&amp;P Shield for personal defense. If the U.S. Federal government goes full potato I'm screwed. Hopefully I'll get out of here before it gets really bad.

       Canadian checking in. The last thing on earth I would ever want is a gun. Objectively, I don't think it matters what anyone else does, no matter how heinous, if I'm dead. Seems if I have a gun there's going to be a far greater likelihood of getting shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand this is a luxury Americans simply don't have. Up here (almost) no one has handguns, so there's nothing to be afraid of. In fact, I'd wager the general feeling in the Canadian consciousness is that cowards carry guns. Like bringing a knife to a fist fight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Down there everyone has them already, so what can you do? If I lived there I would probably take the course myself (or whatever you have to do to get one).
      </p>
      <p>
       What I do question, however, is how bullets are going to show us the truth about anything except "violence begets violence." I too believe civil disobedience has an important role in society. I just don't believe guns have a place in civil disobedience.

      <p>
       You've been sold fear. You've been told everything is a threat, and you bought it. Thankfully, there's a big corporation who is willing to sell you the solution to your fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's kind of sad, actually, thinking there are people who will live their entire livers in a state of hyper-vigilance, ready to defend themselves against mortal attacks from every direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       And all the while they hype the fear machine, sell you more bullets, sell you more guns, sell you more "solutions." Don't worry though, I'm sure those big multinational corporations have nothing to do with the evil that rules us all. Because if you're into guns, you can't be corrupt, right?!
      </p>
      <p>
       Because guns = Opposition to the evil! Yeah!
      </p>
      <p>
       Give me an example of when you've done this? Gone against the evil that rules us all with your gun?

       Enjoy your fear.

       Guns have nothing to do with civil disobedience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Disobeying an order or commandment is a mental act. Not a physical one. The manner in which you do it may manifest as a physical action, but it's something that happens in the mind.

       Anti-gun people often fail to consider the instinct to protect.

       Imagine your family is being attacked. Would you defend them?

      <p>
       I would.

       Of course I would defend them. But in 100 years here, no one in my family (a visible minority no less) has ever been attacked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Justifying a gun to protect my family? Seems a lot like justifying never going outside because I'm afraid of being hit by lightning.
      </p>
      <p>
       An accident, now that seems a little more likely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do accidents happen with guns in the USA? For whatever reason I think I've heard about more accidents than I have people heroically defending their families with a rain of gunfire. But maybe that's just our left-wing media.

       Next time we hear about a gun ban?
      </p>
      <p>
       LOL, a  gun ban? What are you smoking?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's be fair: The only people who ever talk about "a gun ban" are conservatives who have overactive imaginations. No one else in America ever seriously talks about banning guns. At least not anyone with an ounce of influence. Or intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The absolute most you will ever hear is talk of gun registration, closing the gun show loophole, limiting gun ownership by convicted violent felons, or people with violent mental illness, maybe the banning of a few types of firearms or a few types of ammo.
      </p>
      <p>
       But a gun ban? There is no such thing outside of the imaginations of fearful conservatives.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know conservatives take it as an article of faith that liberals are waiting behind every corner to take away every gun in America - but that's because they have been relentlessly lied to and propagandized by self-serving politicians and pundits. A whole industry has been built making real cash money off making conservatives think someone is coming for their guns any day now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Time to grow up, conservatives, time to grow a pair of balls. Time to stop shitting your pants and running around in terror because of scary stories that Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, and Alex Jones told you so they could get higher ratings and get rich by making you curl up in the fetal position shitting yourselves.

       My biggest gripe about the gun hoarders is this: if it comes down to martial law, and the government starts grabbing everybodys guns, if you don't give them up, and plan on having a Ruby Ridge style barricade situation, they're not going to send soldiers to your door to confiscate your guns. they're just going to take your whole house out with Hellfires being shot from drones a half mile away. There is nothing you can do, if it ever comes down to gun confiscation.

       80% of humanity's food comes from small farms. Most factory farmed produce gets tossed, lost, burned for fuel, turned into pseudofood, or left to rot in the field. The myth of factory farmed sustenance is as pervasive as the myth of GMOs feeding the world.

       Did our guns prevent the Bush administration from weakening some of our key Constitutional rights after 9/11, and prevent the Obama administration from continuing those policies ?  Stop them from using torture, secret prisons, mercenaries ?  Stop them from ginning up fake reasons to start a decade-long war in Iraq ?  Stop them from starting the NSA spying ?  No, our guns did NOTHING to protect us from tyrannical government.

       Maybe we just shouldn't bother to have the guns.  After all, they cost us a lot, in homicides and accidents and suicides and crime.  And we don't use them to stop the government.

       First line: courts. It's the best non-violent option.

       Second line: physical defense. Which is a last resort.

       Physical defense is a delusion.  You can't successfully defend yourself against the local police dept, much less against the full weight of the govt.

       Most other countries (e.g. Britain, Canada, Australia) have far lower gun-ownership than USA does, yet they're not constantly falling to tyrannical govt.  I think your fears are nonsense.

       Sure, society could decide that guns are bad, and ban them.  Society has the "right" to set rules.  Other major countries have far lower gun-ownership levels, and aren't overrun by crime or tyrannical govts.  The percent of households owning guns in USA is declining; eventually they will be a small minority and we can restrict or ban guns.

       If you choose to live in such a society, you either live by those rules or (legally) try to change them.  If you fail to change them, you either accept those rules or leave or keep trying to change them.  But the society has the "right" to set its rules.

       At no point have I ever asserted a right - that's in your head. Not mine.

       True; my mistake.  You have cleverly asserted a right without ever calling it a right.

       Sounds like you don't believe in laws or legal systems.  I guess the 2nd amendment is not important to you ?  "...  the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed".  Okay if we got rid of that ?

       Courts, legal documents and lawyers have nothing to do with defending yourself.

       One more thing I wanna say on this topic is that we can have all the guns we want but if the government did want us dead they have tanks and bombers and fighter jets, and artillery. So it really doesn't matter we have an AR-15 they would still win unfortunately.

       So we have a strawman, then ad-hominem about "feeling sorry."  On top of that, it's the same tired propaganda line "it would be civil war!" if we tried to overthrow 1% of the population's grasp on the rest of us, which is of course insane BS.

       Why? Government is real, you should believe in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also works and is very good at getting things done.

       I believe what you truly feel is that humans are not trust worthy, thus you do not put faith into human ran systems.

       Government is a mental object. Just like ghosts, unicorns and the number one.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I say I do not believe in government what I mean is, I do not observe government as being of any legitimacy. Yes, it gets certain things done. Like genocide (war), oppression (laws) and theft (taxation). I'm not interested in those things and do not wish to participate in my own subjugation. So I don't play their game.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the opposite is the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       I trust humans very much. I do not trust government. The only reason you'd have a government is because you don't trust people or you want to rule them. All government laws are prohibition laws on pain of violence. All taxation is compulsory and on pain of violence. The only thing government does - literally - is threaten people with violence for doing things it doesn't like. The worst part is the government gives itself immunity for ruining people's lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       I prefer peaceful cooperation without the threat of violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why I'm an anarchist.

       I'm not really into rap.

      <p>
       I'm more of a beat man. That is to say, I'm more into MF Doom's instrumentals than I am his raps (even though he's hands down my favorite rapper ever). It's hard to explain. Clever lyrics are fun and I do enjoy them, but I've always liked jazz and concertos more so than songs. I don't know why.

       Good, and there's nothing wrong with that, I try my hardest and do the same minimal amount of participation.

       Where I participate the most in governmental politics is in calling my representatives and signing petitions and going out in public with protest signs and all of that stuff where I am actually communicating with the agencies who are trying to shift the laws to eviscerate what little rights we have left that I would prefer to keep.

       Sweden isn't a Utopia, be realistic and I'm serious here, because their population is NOTHING compared to America.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you can't use Sweden as an example to compare to America EVER, they have NOWHERE near the same population size, population density, economic diversity, ethnic diversity, and a whole other LITANY of factors which are REQUIRED in order to form a proper comparative example.

       I'm getting real sick and tired of the juvenile level of discussion which occurs on

        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       due to peoples personal ideological biases which are founded on incorrect information.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to have a conversation about "anarchy", then go to
       <a href="/r/anarchy">

       with all of the other children.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a 25 year old adult and refuse to waste my time when I know as a matter of fact that currently it is an impossible system to implement, as the US Federal Government can and will obliterate any anarchist uprising.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get serious, there's already enough bullshit in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       with all these damn shills 1 month old accounts blasting this place with garbage on a daily basis worse than they ever have in the course of the past 7 years here in

       Start talking about anarchy once this currently system isn't in place and isn't being facilitated by over 350 million people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until then, let's focus on fixing the system we are currently trapped in so that it doesn't further screw us on a daily basis.

      <p>
       I know about the 16th amendment and how it needs to be repealed, I know more about the Smith-Mundt Modernization act of 2012 as attached to the NDAA 2013 than most everybody in this sub ignorant to the fact that domestic propaganda has always been legal in the United States, and a whole lot more.

       I am an adult living in reality, which is why I ignore anarchism, it's not realistic.

       Clearly the way in which people currently want to live with technology is not realistic, especially in terms of not having third world countries where impoverished slaves are forced to make these goods and suffer those miserable conditions which allow these unrealistic lifestyles.

       We are all under threat, duress, and coercion. We are all subject to the conditions which we allow ourselves to be subjugated to.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you are always and forever lying when you say you are not taking part in by choice, because you could choose to not take part, but because you are aware of the consequences, you choose to live the life which allows you to sit at a damn computer which was made able to communicate with everybody in the world due to the government.

       I'll say again, I'm not perfect, I can be a hypocrite too.

       Yes, it does, as we can live in houses with full plumbing, gas, and electrical, and internet, and roads which are mostly maintained.

       It currently is completely corrupted, so unless drastic action is taken, things are going to remain the same.

       People band together and bind/restrain that individual, and make them leave that place where they are causing the offense, and if there is no place to send them, hopefully you have a place to hold them like a jail or something so you can rehabilitate them safely.

       That does NOT need to be "updated" into modern "parlance", why do YOU claim that while using such "antiquated" words as "parlance" when "dialect" or "vernacular" is much more in line with the secularist nonsense ideas you are pushing?

       It is NOT outdated, it is sadly tied down with a few unfortunate amendments like the 16th, and the 2nd and 4th are being continually massively violated on a daily basis.

       Tell that to Iraq, Afganistan, Vietnam, Kurdistan, Cuba, etc.  And they had way less arms, and WAY smaller populations.

       You are thinking what they want you to think.  If we rise there would be nothing they could do.  Also you really think the majority of American troops and police would kill their fellow Americans and families?  Think again.  There would be mass defections, and with it would flow huge sums of arms.

       Rofl, I love how you ignored how entirely FALSE your entire initial statement is, and ignored 2/3's of my post which totally invalidates it.

       You realize you just contradicted your first post then right?  Those machines don't use themselves, they need people willing to follow orders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your inability to think, reply to my post, and the fact that you managed to contradict yourself so quickly is all I need to know to not pay any more attention.  The lack of knowledge demonstrated is just shocking.  The only thing here that's bullshit is that you think you can have a valid opinion about something knowing so very little about it.

       EDIT:  Your reply only further cements my findings about you.

       What I mean is a majority of the troops would defect if those orders were given, but it only takes a crew of 2 to man a bomber capable of destroying a city and I'm sure some would stay loyal if the government for some reason flipped the script and decided to become the evil entity so many think it is.

       I often think the same thing, it's a troubling thought to say the least. If the gov has much better weapons, you're basically screwed if they want to do something. Not to mention the spying that goes on. It's all very creepy and sad. I guess the one small bright spot, if you can call it that, is that they've had tanks, jets, bombers for a while and either haven't been able to, or (more likely) haven't decided to use them yet.

       It's a mental game.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as people believe in government the mindless bureaucrats will operate as though government is like God and must be obeyed on pain of death. Think of the Milgram Experiment. As soon as people realize it's all shadow puppets and theater the game is over. They go back to being normal people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop playing their game. Stop treating them like they're your superiors. They aren't. They're just people more willing to use violence than you. When they see the sham that is their lives they might even transition to "our side." Look at Adam Kokesh. He's one such person out of thousands you can find.

       Vietnam. The middle east. Africa. North Korea. Quit joking yourself. Outside militaries would rush to arm and train us in every toy they've got. That's how war works.

       Well, Adam got in trouble for loading a weapon in a public area where its illegal to do that. Then drugs show up. He can act as he sees fit but that's the kind of civil disobedience that hurts the cause a lot more than helps it.

       It doesn't take a fortune teller to figure that out what was going to happen if you go to DC and load a shotgun in a place where it is illegal to do so.
      </p>

       Why didn't he just try and get his two cents out in a more civil manner instead of all this maverick crap? (rhetorical question only)

       This kind of protest just screws up the people that are actually working to change and protect laws because it doesn't matter what his intent was down there, now its just a "man arrested with shotgun in DC" narrative.

       I don't think you underastand the situation.

      <p>
       Gun manufacturers are not the ones threatening me with kidnapping and torture - that would be the government. You see, the gun manufacturers are happy to sell me a high quality gun. They want the profit. When the sale is over that's it. The threats of kidnapping and torture are from the state.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason I don't go to Nevada and pick up a Glock 43 is because in California I'll be kidnapped and tortured by the police if they catch me buying something deemed "illegal" by a bureaucrat that has never met me and has no legal authority over me.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not the manufacturers.

       It has everything to do with your post.  I've been hearing "they are taking our guns" for the last 20 years, and yet once again I state, here we are with nobody taking our guns, guns sales are skyrocketing because of this information, the USA has more guns than any other nation.  Scare tactics.

       ....and they have been.  Just because the people are winning in SOME places doesn't mean they are in ALL places.  If you lived in Cali, or France etc, it would be the reverse.  It is only due to the hard work of so many dedicated citizens that we have fought off the pro-disarmament corporate fascists who have slowly but surely attempt to seize them for far more than 20 years.

       So no it actually has nothing to do with my post.  It only shows your cognitive dissonance, inability to think outside a fallacy, inability to produce any actual evidence (unlike myself), and lack of general knowledge about this issue.

       Every single astroturf billionaire shill-factory lobbying firm has stated they want guns gone for the people for good (but want to keep them for the ruling elite and their lackeys of course).  Just like in France, England, Cali, etc.

       Those kids who got the wedding party drone strike? They didn't have guns either.

       Your reasoning is retarded.

       People kill people.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I want a gun to defend myself against such murderers.

       Why do the police have guns? In the UK most do not because guns are very rare.

       The police have guns so that they may defend themselves and force compliance through threats of violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the police have no duty to protect me I must protect myself.

       If there were far fewer guns then police would be less likely to carry guns.

       So we have a strawman, then ad-hominem about "feeling sorry."  On top of that, it's the same tired propaganda line "it would be civil war!" if we tried to overthrow 1% of the population's grasp on the rest of us, which is of course insane BS.
