<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/07tdYEP.png">Reddit employee leaks info to /b/</a></p>

<p>............................................</p>

<p>I called this many, many months ago. It has been a part of the &quot;How Reddit Was Destroyed&quot; updates.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>3) Once the default subreddits were controlled, drastic changes began to occur.</p>

<p>I remember when [5] r/IAma was open to anyone and the popularity was decided by voting. Now it is nothing more than a cheap place for celebrities to whore out their products and you need to be &quot;approved&quot;. Someone named [6] Victoria is involved and how does that makes any sense whatsoever? <strong>Celebrities have entire teams of branding/PR/social media teams that work for them. Why do they need to be at reddit HQ and/or required to have a reddit rep? Because these AMA&#39;s are extremely organized and sponsored with money.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>............................................</p>

<p>and it is frankly disturbing how many people harassed me for even implying such a thing was happening. For example, <strong>look what happened 2 months ago when I made a post in r/c_s_t about my AMA theory:</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I mean, they didn&#39;t really give me any reason to believe that they worked there.  Everything they said was either something you could find on Google, or common speculation in the community.</p>

<p>Also, the speaker tells us that she&#39;s technologically ignorant.  She has a fucking degree in electrical engineering from Princeton and worked in Silicon valley for over 10 years.  This doesn&#39;t add up.</p>

<p>Now, I know that due to the nature of this subreddit, nearly any attempt to discredit and anonymous post that agrees with popular opinion will not be received well.  Just try to take some time to do some research yourself.  See what you find out.</p>

<p>Also, last thing.  In  the post, they talk about how they refuse to identify himself for fear of being fired, then goes into describing personal memorable experiences with the CEO.  I mean, that&#39;s pretty inconsistent.</p>

I have my doubts that it was really Obama and not his or team. How much do you think Obama paid to do an ama? I stopped watching ufc when I watched some fights that were complete works - same with ama and some other subreddits. I hope they do add the Facebook integration.
