    <div class="md"><p>By that standard anyone here calling for mass action could be interpreted as terrorism. It doesn&#39;t make sense there and it doesn&#39;t make sense here either.</p>

<p>This is not a serious discussion. There are plenty of problems with modern media and plenty of ways to talk about it. Equating it to terrorism is not one.</p>

<p>For one thing it&#39;s beyond stupid, but that&#39;s personal. It&#39;s also the most adolescent possible response, equating a relatively free press to suicide bombings, mass shootings etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Yes, it does. The MSM uses violence and intimidation to create political change. They fit the definition I provided, which is the definition of terrorism. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>By &quot;uses&quot; you mean &quot;talk about and display&quot;. The definition you supplied is, in my view, perfectly clear in that &quot;uses&quot; means &quot;employs&quot;.</p>

<p>Do you mean to say that <em>discussing</em> or <em>showing images of</em> violence in order to create political change equates to terrorism?</p>

<p>That is unless your idea is based on mainstream media committing violent acts, if so please say so.</p>

<p>Also, source that definition please. It&#39;s getting more wobbly by the second.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Call it childish all you want, you have not refuted the fact that the main stream media does in fact meet the definition of terrorism. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s really neither here nor there, considering the way you&#39;re interpreting that definition.</p>

<p>It meets your definition, according to your interpretation of the word &quot;uses&quot;. I think a violent and intimidating act needs to have some violence in it. You clearly state that talking about violence is enough to count as a violent act. Going by your interpretation of your definition, of course.</p>

<p>As I see it it&#39;s childish and almost incomprehensibly stupid to lump media discussion of violence under the same heading as actual violence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you believe that terrorism is only suicide bombs, planes flying into buildings and mass shootings then that is on you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never said that. Don&#39;t be that guy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Terrorism can take many forms, the MSM is one of those forms. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>How? You said terrorism is violence and intimidation. Where&#39;s the violence committed by the media?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The definition is from the Oxford English dictionary. Since we are talking in English I assumed the actual definition of the word we are using would be sufficient. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s clearly not sufficient as I&#39;ve asked a bunch of questions about your interpretation which you&#39;ve avoided by pointing to the definition again. A definition that supports multiple views.</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost like words can be interpreted in different ways. Oh my God the world is collapsing.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll ask it straight up then - do you consider the discussion and broadcast of violent events to be terrorism? </p>

<p>That&#39;s what your interpretation of the definition suggests and I find this interpretation <em>absurd</em>.</p>

<p>If I&#39;m misunderstanding please say so.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And yes, it uses violence, in the definition it did not use the word employ, it used the word uses. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, what do you mean by &quot;use&quot;. I&#39;ve told you what I consider it to mean, tell me if I&#39;m wrong.</p>

<p>Multiple interpretations can exist, but hiding behind ambiguous definitions is <em>really boring</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The mainstream media no longer just reports the news, it is used to shape opinion and that is obvious to anyone with a brain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That differs between outlets. For some true, for others not. This is not terrorism.</p>

<p>For me, terrorism has to include the commission of a violent act by the terrorising party. Do you agree? Previous comments indicate you don&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see that the MSM simply broadcasts and discusses the violence. They are selective in what they broadcast to fit a narative. If they were broadcasting violence for the sake of informing then of course it isn&#39;t terrrorism, but that isn&#39;t what they are doing. They broadcast these images, videos etc to create political change through nurturing a culture of fear. It is the purpose of the broadcasting that makes all the difference. </p>

<p>And I don&#39;t see how I can be clearer in this, I see that the MSM USES violence, which fits the definition. You are the one changing the definition to perpetrates violence, not me. </p>

<p>EDIT. Obviously I don&#39;t agree, I stated that the MSM doesn&#39;t commit violent acts yet I stated that I believe they fit the definition of terrorists. You are the one selectively interpreting the definition, not me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly what I was wondering with the posts this weekend. I can&#39;t think of a single event where everyone, including the MSM, said &quot;something will happen on x date&quot; and something actually happened. It&#39;s too on-the-nose. Surprise is a huge part of the fear they want to cause. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same. Every year it seems like the internet forums have been saying &quot;the big event is coming, nuclear weapons, martial law, the end of the world, etc&quot; but it never happens. Same with threats. All the attacks/incidents whether you think they are false flags or legit have been surprises.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there are occurrences of what some have termed &quot;predictive programming,&quot; which just a term for conditioning/priming the mass conscience using media laced with subconscious &quot;clues&quot; which are, as some believe, the Elite&#39;s way of &quot;warning&quot; the public of catastrophic events. A good example of such a phenomenon is Family Guy, a show perfect for subconscious brainwashing due to its off-the-wall, seemingly &quot;random&quot; nature, correctly &quot;predicting&quot; some major occurrences, such as the Boston Marathon bombings and Bruce Jenner&#39;s transition into Caitlyn. Saturday Night Live has also supposedly been used to push secret agendas (including that of the 9/11 attacks) before they had come to full fruition. If anyone else has more info/examples, I&#39;d certainly appreciate it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah there&#39;s no hard evidence of anything in her videos about family guy at all though. It&#39;s merely her picking tiny coincidences and making them into what she claims is evidence of the elite warning people of an event. I don&#39;t know why you&#39;d choose to believe anything she says, let alone actually telling people about it. </p>

<p>This is not a serious discussion. There are plenty of problems with modern media and plenty of ways to talk about it. Equating it to terrorism is not one.</p>

<p>For one thing it&#39;s beyond stupid, but that&#39;s personal. It&#39;s also the most adolescent possible response, equating a relatively free press to suicide bombings, mass shootings etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Yes, it does. The MSM uses violence and intimidation to create political change. They fit the definition I provided, which is the definition of terrorism. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>By &quot;uses&quot; you mean &quot;talk about and display&quot;. The definition you supplied is, in my view, perfectly clear in that &quot;uses&quot; means &quot;employs&quot;.</p>

<p>Do you mean to say that <em>discussing</em> or <em>showing images of</em> violence in order to create political change equates to terrorism?</p>

<p>That is unless your idea is based on mainstream media committing violent acts, if so please say so.</p>

<p>Also, source that definition please. It&#39;s getting more wobbly by the second.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Call it childish all you want, you have not refuted the fact that the main stream media does in fact meet the definition of terrorism. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s really neither here nor there, considering the way you&#39;re interpreting that definition.</p>

<p>It meets your definition, according to your interpretation of the word &quot;uses&quot;. I think a violent and intimidating act needs to have some violence in it. You clearly state that talking about violence is enough to count as a violent act. Going by your interpretation of your definition, of course.</p>

<p>As I see it it&#39;s childish and almost incomprehensibly stupid to lump media discussion of violence under the same heading as actual violence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you believe that terrorism is only suicide bombs, planes flying into buildings and mass shootings then that is on you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never said that. Don&#39;t be that guy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Terrorism can take many forms, the MSM is one of those forms. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>How? You said terrorism is violence and intimidation. Where&#39;s the violence committed by the media?</p>
