<p>I&#39;ve seen plenty of footage with helicopters in the air after the first impact. Helicopters are an integral part of modern news delivery and documentation.</p>

<p>Was the air space cleared? Are there any statements that exist from pilots?</p>

<p>It just seems out of place that there is no footage from that angle that I can easily find.</p>

<p>On a second note, I&#39;ve also never seen a single image that shows the 2nd plane clearly from the top, as opposed to from the bottom.</p>

<p>Anybody have any footage to help?</p>

<p>All those Morning News Shows <em>that used to Air</em> and Run, really had News Choppers but they also had Off-Site Stationary Locations that sent back <em>Live Feeds</em>. POOF!</p>

<p><em>Good Morning</em>, <em>New York</em>! <em>It&#39;s a beautiful September morning and here&#39;s your day in News, Weather, and the Stock Market Opening Bell</em>!</p>

<p><strong>What</strong>? <strong>Shit</strong>? <strong>What</strong>? </p>

<p>Fade to black...</p>

<p>Only that didn&#39;t happen on 9/11 because it was all scripted and none of those <em>off-site</em> remote locations gave any live feeds from the <em>stationary prime locations</em> that morning.</p>

<p>All the News Choppers were grounded and video <em>confiscated</em>.</p>

<p>Credit to: swim32...</p>

<p><em>Just as all the video from private businesses around the Pentagon were confiscated</em>. </p>

<p><strong>POOF</strong>!</p>

<p>The few shots you can scrounge off the internet are what there is. </p>

<p>Some rabid scoundrels pulled this off!</p>

<p>IMHO, your questions require answers and all the people, from every Nation deserves an honest Investigation into 9/11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair point, i did not save all this, but as you have realized now, Spiegel&#39;s document is easily found, then you&#39;d have to sort through NIST archives to find the right one, i&#39;ll save you the hassle (or provide the motivation): it&#39;s a tiny extract of the full video, one that doesn&#39;t show any helicopter, in fact it cuts right before the shady parts :)</p>

<p>edit: well fuck me, i went through it all for you (or because i wanted to save it for myself :), can&#39;t find it, i vividly remember syncing them back then to find out where it was cut off in the NIST videos... I&#39;ll try again but it doesn&#39;t seem to be in there, there is another Hoboken video but it&#39;s handfilmed by a retard...</p>

<p>No. That&#39;s why I used the closed parenthesis.</p>

<p>This is in the <em>more</em> information link <em>from the person that used Spiegels footage</em>... </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Published on May 9, 2012</p>

<p>9/11 Eyewitness is a DVD by Rick Siegel purporting to teach the truth about the attack on the World Trade Center. Instead of elucidating the truth, however, the piece seems designed to hide the reality of the explosive demolition of the Twin Towers by surrounding footage of the demolitions with a verneer of vapid claims and pseudo-scientific analysis. The DVD teaches us that helicopters were instrumental in the Towers&#39; destruction and that it was a &quot;nuclear attack&quot;.</p>
