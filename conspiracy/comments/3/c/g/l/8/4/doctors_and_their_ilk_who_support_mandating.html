       <p>
        Doctors refuse to take sick days, even when they know it puts their patients at risk. In a recent survey, 95% said they believed working while sick could cause harm. But 83% said they do it anyway.

       I am aware that hospitals require vaccinations for all employees... this is not that debate.  Read on.
      </p>
      <p>
       The hypocritical medical establishment lobbies and enacts mandatory vaccinations for children in public schools because an un-vaccinated child "is a threat" to the immunized (a joke in itself) that he/she shares a space with.....
      </p>
      <p>
       YET, when you look at this recent news article, it shows how doctors, who share a space with patients (who have suppressed or compromised immune systems even worse off than children) couldn't give a flying fuck if they infect you if they're sick when they come to work.  How does this make any sense?  Where are the pitchforks and torches to mandate (paid) sick days/leave for workers (doctors/nurses/janitors etc) in hospitals and other health-care facilities?  These sick doctors are endangering (even more-so than an un-vaccinated child) their surroundings by their very presence, risking the lives of patients without a second thought.

       If you read the

       Most vaccines lose effectiveness within 10 years of being administered, meaning that the huge majority of people in the US are unquestionably not protected from any of the diseases they were vaccinated for as children.  So where are all of the epidemics from these millions of un-vaccinated adults walking around every day and coming in contact with each other?

       Did you have a particular vaccine in mind? 
Some vaccines like the popular flu shot are to be taken yearly.

       Others you should get whenever visiting risky countries.

       Yes, and I posted in there saying that if their establishment can't take into account that someone MIGHT EVER get sick and need more than a day to recover, then their system is flawed.  If they can't have one person going sick without every thing going to shit, that's a problem that's easily fixed.  They just don't want to spend the money to hire more people.  I see it in every commercial establishment too.  It's a poor excuse, if you're a doctor in a hospital, to say "Well, because scheduling sucks and I really can't take a day off, I'll endanger everyone in my vicinity at work and possibly kill them."

       Well yeah the system has major issues if they can't be afforded time for sick leave, but how is that a criticism on vaccines?

      <p>
       If anything, it's more if a reason to get vaccinated to help protect against potentially sick doctors lol.

       You might as well be saying that there's no point in washing your hands, because doctors work whilst sick.

       In BC, Canada, nurses and health care aides are mandated to be vaccinated and yet the doctors and the patients are not. Mandating vaccination is wrong and makes no sense and the smart doctors know that. The largest population of unvaccinated children comes from very educated people...not from hippies or luddites but from people who can rub two brain cells together enough to realize that it's all about the benjamins and not your good health.

       No, requiring vaccinations is exactly the debate. Not cancelling appointments people made a month in advance and have likely had to take time off of work for is a completely different issue.

       A vaccinated doctor who is able to work, even when carrying a contagious disease, is still contagious.
I always say that I'd rather nurses and doctors stay at home when they fall ill. 
Vaccinations just make them able to work when they really shouldn't.
If they want a vaccine, then so be it but under no circumstances should anyone be forced to.
