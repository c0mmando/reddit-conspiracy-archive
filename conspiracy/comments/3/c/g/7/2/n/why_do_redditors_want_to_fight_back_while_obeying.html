       It's simple. Who owns the largest enforcement forces in the world? And who are those hired to control? Those two questions hold the answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       To actually break the law on a massive scale would upset the balance of society and frankly create a huge nationwide event, and who the hell has the effort right now for that kind of stuff. To break the law on a small scale by yourself is just asking to be arrested by a goon and put into prison for a long time.

       If we broke or disregarded the law we would be creating our own law and declaring existing law as inapplicable to us. We would become the new elites.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question is, would the systems we put in place by word or deed be more, or less, subject to the tyrannies experienced in our current system? While the people who create the new system matter, in the long run it is the system itself which will determine the outcome.
      </p>
      <p>
       A system which rewards tyrants will produce tyranny.
      </p>
      <p>
       What sort of organization are you suggesting we create? We can procure weapons to defend it, but let us first be sure that what we are making is something which we wish to defend.

       The idea of due process is a wonderful and powerful base on which to build upon. It gives a space for people to create and amend rules on which to build a community. It even allows us to talk and argue with people long dead. It is amazing! And it is precious! Just because some people don't use it doesn't mean we should abandon it. We should fight for this wholeheartedly. The scum bags who are riding ruffshot over this want us to abandon it. Don't! People before us fought for this and we must protect it.

       I think religiosity like what you describe is just one aspect of the cultural programming we are subjected to the second we're born. The elites, while mostly nonreligious themselves, love religion because it teaches deference to authority. Combine that with corporal punishment for the sins of disobeying orders(gasp) and the "because I said so" mentality whenever inquiry('but why?') occurs, so a child is always in an environment where "authority is good; to disobey is bad." no matter what, regardless of merit. Curiosity is to be squashed and replaced with acquiescence and the 'even if you don't like it you still have to do it because I'm in charge' mentality.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are programmed from birth to view authority as a separate entity that is apart from the rest of us, benevolent and perhaps even ordained by God himself. They wouldn't be in a position of authority if God didn't desire it, right? Better listen to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw a childhood/raising children meme going around facebook a couple years back among my religious relatives that was incredibly popular with that crowd that said, "Because I love you, I must teach you to obey me." That is the filth that is being taught to children across the entire country every single day and reinforced with corporal punishment every time one steps too far out of the paradigm.

       This is why people get dogs. You can't make verbal threats against a dog that if they don't do what you say, you'll punish them. If a dog feels the need to defend itself, it will. You need to have someone like that on your side around certain people.
