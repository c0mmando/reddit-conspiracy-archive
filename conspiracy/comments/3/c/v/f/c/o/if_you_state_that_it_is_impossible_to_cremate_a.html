       We have the crematoria fuel (coke + wood) receipts for Auschwitz-Birkenau between March and October 1943. There were 16,000 confirmed deaths during this period (according to camp documentation) and establishment historians argue that 116,800 additional people were gassed. For a total of 132,800 bodies, there was the equivalent of 628.5 tons of coke delivered, i.e. an average of 4.7 kg of coke per corpse.
      </p>
      <p>
       How much coke was required for Topf Double-Muffle Cremation Ovens? A study by Prof. P. Schl√§pfer in 1936, based on practical experiments, shows that after initially requiring 400 kg for the first body, once the oven had completely warmed up after 10 cremations (reaching thermal equilibrium), it then used 37.5 kg of coke per body.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Note also that F. Piper confirms that no open pit cremations took place in 1943 after Krema II was put into service. As far as the claimed open pit cremations are concerned, at Auschwitz you hit ground water at 4ft, so these would also likely not have been possible as described. For a more complete analysis, see Mattogno's book

       In the camps or in the east? Executed for being Jewish, executed for being a partisan or terrorist, executed for being associated with partisans, died fighting as a partisan or in the Soviet army, died from disease or other wartime conditions, [or transported east by the Soviets and died in the Soviet Union], (etc)? It's a complex question, and nobody has solid numbers for any of these -- even the estimates of mainstream historians vary wildly.

      <p>
       If you're interested purely in the demographic issues,
       <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/holocaust/wiki/articles#wiki_-_demography">
        here are some resources

        this article

       is a good starting place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise, I recommend starting at the beginning. Presumably you're familiar with the mainstream narrative, so the next step is to familiarize yourself with the critical historiography (which is illegal in many parts of Europe.) My recommendation would be to watch this

       , then

        this one

       In
       <em>
        Auschwitz: Open Air Incinerations
       </em>
       , the author repeatedly states that open pits were used for mass cremations because it was quicker and more economical than crematoriums.  According to that book, many crematoriums were then used to incinerate bodies of registered detainees who died of natural causes.  The author also describes the fire-hooks that were designed to arrange the corpses and stoke the fire in open air cremations.

      <p>
       Mattogno states that pits wouldn't have worked due to the high ground water level, and points out that occasionally bodies were burned on pyres. [Note: Franciszek Piper claims that the large-scale open pit cremations began during 1944. This does not relate to the period under examination here, during 1943, when we have the fuel receipts, and when it is not claimed there were open pit cremations.]

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yes, 4 fire hooks, which Mattogno notes would not have been sufficient for the scale of mass cremations in giant trenches as alleged by Holocaust activists -- and which aerial photography shows no sign of.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the essay linked in the OP details, the new kremas at Birkenau were built in 1943 to cope with the high number of deaths during typhus outbreaks (
       <a href="http://www.vho.org/GB/Books/dth/fndcrema.html">
        see section 7.5
       </a>
       ) and the planned expansion of the camp to accommodate 200,000 people. The crematoria were often out of service (
       <a href="http://www.vho.org/GB/Books/dth/fndcrema.html">
        see section 8
       </a>
       ), and small-scale outdoor cremation of bodies on pyres (not in pits) would have been necessary occasionally.
