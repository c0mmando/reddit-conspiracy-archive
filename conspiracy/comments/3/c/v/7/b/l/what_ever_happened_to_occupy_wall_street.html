<p>It made me think about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy">synergy</a>.</p>

<p>My dream is a new movement like Occupy where everyone joins in. The left, the right, the Oath Keepers, The Ron Paul/Bernie Sanders crews, the Unions, The police and militias, the artists, the blue collars, the black, the white and all in between. The boomers, the genX&#39;ers, the millenials, the &quot;y&#39;s&quot;.  </p>

<p>Everyone minus the status quo, greedy cunts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That mix was basically my experience of Occupy at ground level. Don&#39;t believe anything you read about it. It was incredibly diverse when I was there. Lots of Anarchists, Libertarians, old hippies, young people, families, every economic class from richest to poorest. It was really wild. 
And what happened was we got harassed out of existence by a bunch of nasty cops and infiltrators.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The police did so much dirty shit, it was impossible to keep up. They went around telling drug addicts all over Manhattan that they should head to Zuccotti Park so they could get free food and clothes. The place filled up with junkies and then the media got to film it and say look at all these dirty protestors. A lot of the cops were sympathetic but then some group would show up with orders to intimidate people, driving motorcycles through groups of people on the sidewalk trying to provoke a reaction. There were a bunch of weird break ins in apartments right around that time where nothing was stolen, drawers gone through.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just curious why the <em>Adbusters</em> founder of Occupy chose Zuccotti Park, which was private property, which enabled the police to legally and easily evict the Occupiers.</p>

<p>Instead of choosing a public park, where cops would have still tried to evict the Occupiers, but would have been challenged in court.  And possibly resurrected.  And possibly still there now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that was because the landlord that owns the buildings around Zuccotti Park had to sign a lease on the park allowing people to use it 24/7 which wasn&#39;t the case anywhere else. That was a loophole that delayed eviction for a few weeks, where the police had power to remove protestors from other parks including Washington Square. In fact, they did remove people from Washington Square whenever the police decided they might be trying to set up shop. There was a lot of discussion about moving to Washington Square park but most people were scared of the police reaction. There was at least one general assembly there which I went to.</p>

<p>Also, one funny fact, almost nobody at Zuccotti Park knew that Adbusters started the protest!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem we inevitably, always run up against, is that on the middle and bottom rungs we have limited resources to continue a resistance, and always the fear that it will peter out, we will be forced to return to &quot;the grind&quot; only worse off than we were before and having fought a futile battle.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with you on this. I also visited occupy and marched with them a couple times from union square to Wall Street. It was diverse. The media mainly focussed on the eccentric types who probably would have been hanging out in New York City on any other given day. But I listened to speakers who gave educated talks and listened to protest music from major recording artists and it was a brilliant time to be present. I really felt like we had a chance for some real change. I didn&#39;t feel alone, people were raising concerns for the world that I completely stood behind. It was like a breath of fresh air. And then the media bashing started, the jokes started hitting, even people here on reddit began turning against it. It is such a sadness how the occupy movement was taken down. </p>

<p>The media effectively dismissed the movement as &quot;frustrated humanities majors&quot;. Then we have SJW, racial conflict, takers-makers, and so on. </p>

<p>Unlike the 1%, there is no union among the 99% to effectively bring forth change. And even if there was TPTB through their media spin doctors and psyop tactics will effectively disrupt any successful group. </p>

<p>What must be done, massive reeducation and deprogramming. I believe it has started, but it&#39;s too slow, and we get constantly sidetracked by distractions from the newest celebrity gossip, fabricated threats, and even &quot; token victories&quot; (a black president, gay marriage, marijuana legalization). </p>

<p>Occupy Wall Street was endorsed by the most entrenched, powerful politicians at the time.  The speaker of the house of representatives spoke about how wonderful they were.  Many powerful and entrenched politicians had their back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two possibilities:</p>

<p>1) Occupy was an organic movement that could be used by politicians to serve their purposes, through infiltration, etc.</p>

<p>2) Occupy was a misguided slow-motion riot by a bunch of indoctrinated kids that could serve, as is, the motives of certain chaotic politicians.</p>

<p>I definitely lean toward #2, but #1 could be possible.  My own conclusions are because the people I knew that were in occupy had no central guiding philosophy, they just mobbed up, and when probed, could not espouse rational or non-contradictory opinions on the subject.  Naturally I cannot draw any conclusions except through my own experience.  </p>

<p>But even lacking that experience, I&#39;d rationally lean #2 because Occupy people wanted to end tyranny by-- get this-- granting the government more power. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I first heard about occupy, before it even launched, here on r/conspiracy. People were counting down the start date and reminding everybody to attend. I didn&#39;t hear about it anywhere else. Then the numbers of how successful it was started coming in and suddenly the occupy wall street movement was making the front page of reddit. For me, it started here on this subreddit. I&#39;m not just saying this, after the occupy movement&#39;s success, r/conspiracy was NEVER the same, this place got a lot more attention after that and a lot of it wasn&#39;t good. Downvotes, discussion derailments, and junk posts became a normal thing. I still love it here, but it really was different before occupy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.  Very lame - especially since the citizenry fell <em>right</em> for it, hook, line, and sinker.  We were <em>not</em> together as a citizenry on that one <em>at all</em>.  I took part in the protests, and we allowed ourselves to get sideswiped, overtaken, infiltrated, and undermined.</p>

<p>We would have to step our game up as a citizenry <em>big time</em> if we want to come together and fight the power better again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see what you&#39;re saying, and you don&#39;t have a bad point at all.  It was a success in the sense that it helped <em>slightly</em> open certain eyes a bit more than they were opened before.  However, I feel that we should be SOOO much further along as a citizenry and as a people.  I feel that we are SO far behind as a species.  We are SO allowing ourselves to be dragged by TPTB around like sheep (yes, sheep), and we really aren&#39;t exercising the power we really TRULY have as a people.</p>

<p>Compared to what we can and SHOULD be doing - compared to what we can and <em>should</em> be accomplishing as a unified species/race of beings, compared to where we SHOULD be at at this point - I feel we are a <em>looong</em> way from the finish line that we should have been a lot closer to by now.  :/</p>

A lot of trivial shit to be sure, but also a lot of increasingly radical opinions popping up in unexpected subs. There are comments sections of papers where people commenting have things figured out to a degree that the journalists writing the articles still haven&#39;t. 90% of people are basically asleep, but 10% aren&#39;t and that equates to a fuckload of people. And after all, how many do you need awake to have a revolution? Not 100% Maybe 15 to 20 % would do the trick. It&#39;s coming. You want proof?

<p>We need a leader because an outside party (or sheep, call it what you will) looking in cannot understand a thousand differing opinions.

<p><strong>We</strong> don&#39;t need a leader - the world needs us to have a leader so it can digest our message.
And yeah, 2+2 will always be 4, no one can say you are wrong, and certainly no one did... but if we start our sentences with <em>you&#39;ll probably never come to this in your own intellectual pursuit without outside assistance, but</em> 2+2=4... then you&#39;ll probably turn off your listener before they get to the truth and absorb its implications. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>If the movement is motivated by the proper ideal, then there <em>wouldn’t</em> be “a thousand differing opinions”.  There might be a thousand (a <em>million</em>) voices, but they would all basically be saying the same thing in terms of needing to work together as one people toward a common goal of union and communal support through the difficulties before us.</p>

<p>You don’t need any one leader for that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think what original poster was trying to iterate - albeit simply - is that the world needs a resistance group (like Occupy) to have a leader so the group&#39;s message is digestible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I say focus on truth whether it’s digestible or not.</p>

<p>Not only that, but, as I’ve always said, no sooner does a group get “one leader” than that group is SUPER easy to defeat by simply killing, corrupting, or otherwise undermining that “one leader”.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As much as I hate it too, the public sphere is simply still too delicate for assertive truth delivery.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So then we need to just continue being okay excepting that stiff PTB cock up our ass like good, obedient citizens, because what is needed in order to change what’s going on in this world is simply not delicate or subtle.  Some <em>serious</em> changes are needed, and some SERIOUS truth has to be looked at very directly, and until and unless we are willing and able to do that, it seems we will not see any real changes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They - we - cannot put aside our ego to objectively digest information without taking our emotional reaction to the information into account.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So then - again - we need to just STFU and get right back to our shitty 9-5 and stop talking about “fighting the power” if we aren’t willing to do what really is necessary to help ourselves, because it seems that anything short of us really standing up and taking charge for our lives will simply NOT WORK.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This really sucks because it attaches stipulations to what we perceive as credible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It also really sucks because it seems to me that those stipulations will simply prevent success from actually happening.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know that one day, man will have the balls to face the truth regardless how it is delivered or how hard it is to swallow, and we will not have to sugar-coat the obvious hard truths as if we speak to babies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s, perhaps, when we’ll be able to stand up and move forward.  Until that time, however, we’ll need to simply shut up, sit down, and accept the fact that, collectively, we are sheep.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>We</strong> don&#39;t need a leader - the world needs us to have a leader so it can digest our message.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><del>The world</del> Humanity will not move forward until it understands that it doesn’t need a leader outside of its very own self guided by the proper principle(s).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if we start our sentences with you&#39;ll probably never come to this in your own intellectual pursuit without outside assistance, but 2+2=4... then you&#39;ll probably turn off your listener before they get to the truth and absorb its implications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand this, and don’t disagree with it…but…well, sometimes that’ <em>is</em> how some sentences get started nonetheless.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So call on bullshit, yes... but in a non-violent manner!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It wasn’t violent, sir.  It might have been effronterous, it might have been offensive, but it wasn’t violent, per se.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At a round table of equality, you will see everyone can be a great listener.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fair enough, but the user I was responding to in the effronterous manner actually wasn’t exercising great equality himself.  That’s part of why I responded to him the way I did.  I’m hoping you can see by the fact that I’ve been (generally) responding in a (generally) level-headed way with you that I <em>do</em> have the capacity to reciprocate cordiality and can be considerate.  I might have a short(ish) fuse, but I also know how to reciprocate amiability.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Love and comradery! With those intentions, we can defeat any untruths.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed, sir, but sometimes comrades need to slap each other straight if one or the other is saying things that are <em>too</em> wrong.  I understand that I can get a little fiery sometimes, and I’ve no problem with you calling it out, but sometimes - just sometimes - getting a bit fiery is not <em>entirely</em> uncalled for.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I tend not to put too much stock in faith (none at all if I can at all help it).  I, instead, tend to work more with actual evidence, information, and the data that’s presented before me.  Then I try to arrive at a level of knowledge with regard to the subject at hand.  With the acquiring of actual knowledge, one can do away entirely with faith because they will at that point actually <em>know</em>.  They won’t need to “believe” or have any faith in the thing in question.  That in mind, It seems to me that many aspects of humanity leave quit a bit to be desired at this point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is hope. Our conversation embodies it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wouldn’t deny that.  We need much more impetus, however.  Much more.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Together, people like you and I can bring about that visualization! </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wouldn’t disagree with that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Amiable reciprocation (love that) might not necessarily be enough; we must pull others up with us, to us, even if they do not respond in kind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would not disagree with that either.  To that point, however, it seems to me that “pulling others up” sometimes involves shaking them out of their stupor…and sometimes, if they’re <em>very</em> much asleep, the shaking must be quite vigorous.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our patience must be undefeatable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct - but so must our discipline.  We can almost be said, you and I, to also be talking about different two different forms of child-rearing here.  Your method seems to be one which involves love in the form of gradual patience - which, of course, can be a very good thing.  My method is one which shows love in the form of a patience that is also more willing to be more harsh if need be.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our focus on being the ideal citizen we want to see reflected must not waver.  Then there will be no sheep, only wolves, and we can turn our collective frustrations into motivation, not unfocused aggression.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do not disagree with this.  I do not think that advocating for one specific individual to lead everyone forward like a herd of lemmings is the answer, however.  That abdicates the masses’ power, and undermines whatever strength the group could otherwise have.</p>

<p>We must find that power within and individually.  I’m completely okay with one specific individual occasionally helping teach others how to find their own individual power, but this is a far cry from the traditional “leader” role where one person assumes the role for all others where it regards what to do and how to do it.  I stand firmly against that type of modus operandi.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Be fire, for fire is change, fire is yang. But beware, as fire is indiscriminate in who and what it burns.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=cus%20d%27amato">great trainer of pugilism</a> once said that if you learn to control fire and get it to work for you, it can cook for you, clean for you, help you eat, help you warm and protect yourself and your loved ones around you…but if you <em>can’t</em> control it, then it can burn you, your house, and everything you love down to a cinder.</p>

<p>Fire is good - even necessary.  We must just learn how to control it.</p>

<p>Correct enough, but I would rather say that se must all <em>lead ourselves</em>, lest we be lemmings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We will control the fire and burn the tradition of the leader and the follower!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And we can burn the tradition not by refusing to follow it under any circumstances, but by realizing that the main goal is to simply be the leaders we wish to follow and lead ourselves while still also realizing that the best leaders are sometimes those individuals who know when listen to what others have to say as well and know when to go with <em>their</em> information too.</p>

<p>It&#39;s ultimately all about intelligent cooperation with a foundation of critical thinking that&#39;s unafraid to admit mistakes.  That&#39;s how we grow and learn.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I will find peace in my heart, and you will, too, and our fires will make way for this peace to materialize and revolutionize our seemingly hopeless world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would certainly hope so, and I at least try to lead a life that is focused upon these general tenets as best as possible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I, my friend, will help restore your faith in humanity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a SUUUUPER tall order, my brother, but at least you have given me another example here and now that we <em>can</em> indeed treat each other with kindness, honor, and respect.</p>

<p>That itself is significantly appreciated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Liberals don&#39;t understand the problem. Nor do conservatives.</p>

<p>Which is why there was no solution.</p>

<p>Occupy was little more than people finally realizing that there is a problem.</p>

<p>But they failed to identify it.</p>

<p>Which is why nothing happened.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t solve a problem you don&#39;t fully understand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I gave you &quot;the megaphone&quot; and allowed you to frame what &quot;the problem&quot; is, how would you frame it, and what means of achieving change would you go for? </p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to agitate or anything, I just genuinely wonder what the best popular narrative is to try to go for and what other would say given the change. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it&#39;s simple, really. A tiny segment of the population is controlling everything and trying to enslave everyone else! So let&#39;s just all relearn how to survive in little communities by working together again, forget all about money... And they&#39;ll have nothing to offer us anymore. Supply and demand! They will have a lot of useless money with which to burn for warmth. Elegance in simplicity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>okay! We can use our own currency, then. But I think it&#39;d be best if the primary form of trade was actual trade and currency was just used to supplement trade.
Also IMHO electronic currency has been a pretty bad idea. Too easy to manipulate, doesn&#39;t exist on the material plane, can be hijacked. Gross.</p>
