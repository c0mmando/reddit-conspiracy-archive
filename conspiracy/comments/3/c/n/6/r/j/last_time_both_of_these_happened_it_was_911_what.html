It&#39;s interesting to note that the NYSE has halted after 2001; however, the June 8th closure was the last one that was halted during the day, the other closures were ending the day just a few minutes early. </p>

<p>There are so many posts like this that dangle some supposedly ominous fact in front of your face, but never explain why it&#39;s supposed to be such a big deal.</p>

<p>Go ahead, OP. Please tell us. What does it mean that this AMAZING COINCIDENCE happened again yesterday?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many have pointed out, that Obama may have decried the previous presidents policies, he has continued them, and gotten away with more in some ways.</p>

<p>Obama seems to mirror what Bush did in many ways, but with better PR. It&#39;s like watching a child learn the secret behind a magic trick. Or how rats get smarter the more you kill. The government seems to run tests on us, to see how we&#39;ll react before letting more information go, or going full bore on things. </p>

<p>i.e. NSA wire taps... as time goes on, they let dribble bits of more information, but if they told us all at once, we&#39;d be likely to take action</p>

<p>Killing with drones... used to be just a few here and there. Now it&#39;s the goto option to avoid, &quot;boots on the ground&quot;</p>

<p>War in the middle east... highly televised in the early 90&#39;s, but made to seem like a fun movie, than a real war. It was like they were testing the waters to see if we would react similar to the vietnam war or the korean war. But it seems we&#39;re all too complacent, distracted, and comfortable to be bothered to care about these things. To be fair to most americans though, these things happen about as far away from their lives as could be possible.</p>

<p>I could go on, but it&#39;s a similar pattern they keep repeating. When you look at things, not as they&#39;re broken, but working exactly as intended, the world is a much scarier place to live. At least the motives are fairly obvious though. Been the same for centuries, wealth and power. I think probably boredom too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wasn&#39;t too long ago that arming a drone was completely unfathomable, then G W Bush was like we gotta get Osama. Suddenly we started blasting weddings and preschools from the other side of the globe like it is no biggie.  Now they want drones patrolling here in the US.  How long will it be until we are sitting here complaining about the government when suddenly we get blasted from above.</p>
