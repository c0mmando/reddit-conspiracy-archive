        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.&quot; - Aristotle</p>

<p>It takes a certain mindset to ever question the state religion of NASA, given all of the <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3a6agc/education/">government indoctrination we receive</a>. Despite being a military organization with secrets classified under national security, few ever question any of NASA&#39;s claims, instead taking everything at face value. Even to those who have seen NIST&#39;s fraudulent report of the obvious controlled demolition of the 3 buildings that were destroyed on 9/11/2001, NASA represents an ideal that could never lie to us.</p>

<p>It is fear that you have to get past in order to find the truth. Fear that you are being deceived, because you don&#39;t trust yourself to make the right conclusions. Fear that the truth is being poisoned, because you don&#39;t trust anyone else to make the right conclusions. Those that would control you want you trapped by your fear, instead of transcending it. The truth fears no investigation.</p>

<p>Remember, every Flat Earther that you encounter used to be a globehead; we know all of your arguments and justifications. Ask yourself, have you honestly looked into any of the reasons we have so passionately come to such a drastically different conclusion?</p>

<p>Surely you haven&#39;t seen a curved horizon with your own eyes, nor do you feel any spinning motion right now. What extraordinary evidence have you seen for a ball Earth that is spinning and flying through outer space? </p>

<p>None of the evidence NASA presents is independently reproducible. Their claims of Freemasons driving electric cars on the moon almost half a century ago have still never been replicated. Despite allegedly having thousands of satellites in orbit, we have very few pictures of any actual satellites, and very few pictures of the Earth from space. The 1969 Apollo missions not only resemble the limits of Hollywood&#39;s special effects but were timed to distract from the Vietnam War with novel new reasons to tune in on the mass programming device being installed in living rooms across America. As soon as computer imagery achieved a level of realism, we were presented with the ISS&#39;s fisheye lens, whose footage is nowadays indistinguishable from Hollywood&#39;s Interstellar or Gravity.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the non-curvature of the Earth can be <a href="https://i.imgur.com/IEcAo8G.jpg">independently reproduced by anyone</a>. Here are some other observations that do not fit within the heliocentrist globe model:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Ei7ZZsVDM">The horizon is flat and remains at eye level when you increase altitude</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPGW9bIx_e8">All amateur attempts</a> to reach as high an altitude as possible show a flat horizon at heights NASA material shows curvature.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVXa9jbSR7U">The constellations in the night sky can be photographed slowly rotating around Polaris, the Pole star</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/35bkup/surveyors_engineers_and_architects_are_never/">Railroads span hundreds and even thousands of miles without taking into account any curvature</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/35c86b/airplane_pilots_and_sea_navigators_fly_and_sail/">Sailors navigate by plane sailing</a>, mathematically assuming a Flat Earth to compute their heading.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/35q8m7/the_statue_of_liberty_in_new_york_stands_326_feet/">Lighthouses can be seen at distances that should be occluded by curvature</a>, with countless examples such as <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3bioem/flat_earth_proof_this_is_70_miles_from_jupiter/">Florida from the Bahamas, 70 miles away</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8eIuT-nSAs">Chicago across Lake Superior</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The Michelson Morley experiment compared the speed of light in different directions, <em>in an attempt to detect and thus prove the relative motion of the Earth</em>. The heliocentrists claim that the experiment &#39;failed&#39; because it did not detect an &#39;ether&#39;, discarding the evidence that the Earth was stationary.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These observations fit much better with a basic version of the <a href="https://imgur.com/a/bCVQG">Flat Earth model</a>. <a href="http://earth.nullschool.net/">Here</a> you can view many useful realtime datasets on different map projections, comparing them on a spherical (orthographical projection) and flat (azimuthal equidistant projection) model. <a href="https://youtu.be/_mfJXp4ePu0?t=12m43s">Here</a> is someone showing you some examples of how the data fits a flat model more cleanly.</p>

<p>For more information, if you&#39;re a reader, <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/earth/za/">literature from over a century ago</a> is still very relevant as <a href="https://i.imgur.com/IEcAo8G.jpg">independently reproducible proof of non-curvature</a>. If you prefer to watch something,  you can start with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFjG4jpUhQI">feature-length documentary</a> that will prime you on the subject, and there are many more that you can discover.  In short, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/PyaY8gn.jpg">Flat Earth is flat.</a></p>

<p>The ring of Antarctica is the limit of our current knowledge, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Treaty_System">the combined militaries of the world will stop you from any further exploration.</a> In a century of constant warfare, this is the only thing they can agree on. NASA was created to continue the spherical Lie and everything they put out is a hoax, starting with Operation Paperclip&#39;s Dr. Werner Von Braun&#39;s phallus rocket fetish. The higher in altitude you climb, the lower the density of the air and the less effective rocket propulsion becomes. NASA has not gone to low-earth orbit or any higher because <a href="https://imgur.com/a/3qri3">rocketry does not work in a vacuum</a>.</p>

<p>Here are some other hoaxes that are used to prop up the heliocentrist mythology:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Coriolis Effect: The rotation of small scale liquids in opposing hemispheres is identical. The patterns that heliocentrists claim as proof of a coriolis effect in large scale bodies of water look much more realistic when viewed in a <a href="https://youtu.be/_mfJXp4ePu0?t=12m43s">flat instead of spherical projection</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Foucalt pendulums: These do not uniformly swing in any one direction; they can be found spinning in every direction, often in the exact opposite direction of any supposed rotation of the Earth.</p></li>
<li><p>GPS: GPS, a US government program, is done via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_station">repeater towers</a>. Electro-magnetic signals weaken proportional with the square of distance from the source, and thus the sources of these signals cannot be hundreds of miles overhead with limited power sources but are instead the nearby towers, a few dozen miles away at most and powered off of the enormous power grid.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Obligatory &quot;why is this a conspiracy&quot;: If you believe in a spherical earth, you literally believe down is up and up is down. You have been indoctrinated into a state of helpless ignorance; you are already a slave to lies in your mind, completely lost, and easily controlled.</p>

<p>&quot;The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.&quot; - Alvin Toffler</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Litterally this. If you watch this video and pause at a point when the go-pro&#39;s lense isn&#39;t interfeiring and creating &#39;curves&#39; you can visibly see a flat horizon, while at other parts of the video the horizon is both concave and convex. If you use this as proof of a round earth you are ignoring at least four minutes of footage when this go-pro&#39;s lense creates an illusion of a concave earth.</p>

<p>Also, I have seen many horizons in my life from both dozens of meters high and from sea level and I can safely conclude that the horizon never curves. The horizon stays at eye level, and it is extremely flat, and it surrounds you like a pencil surrounding the &#39;point&#39; of a compass. When viewing the horizon, it never shows any signs of curvature. If you look at a horizon which ends twenty odd miles away, the buildings in the far distance are always completely straight, never leaning and curving away as they should on a ball earth. I have never in all my years seen any signs of curvature anywhere on a horizon; not even high up in a plane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You realize the reason why the horizon line looks flat is because of the curvature of the earth right?</p>

<p>If the earth was flat, you would literally be able to see night time on the horizon. </p>

<p>Not to mention that a flat planet is literally impossible because all matter in space wants to be round because it requires the least amount of energy to maintain. </p>

<p>Not to mention the seasons. You realize it&#39;s winter in the southern hemisphere while it&#39;s summer in the northern hemisphere right?</p>

<p>For example Australias winter is in June. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is possible to obtain a GPS signal pretty much anywhere in the world. According to your theory, repeater towers must be used.</p>

<p>Therefore you are contending that there are relatively dense (given the range of these towers) networks of towers in all of the most remote places in the world. This in includes the tundra of Greenland and Northern Canada, Northern Russia and in every ocean.</p>

<p>How are these towers maintained? Who maintains them? Why aren&#39;t arctic pilots reporting seeing hundreds of cell phone towers that are not mapped? Why aren&#39;t ships reporting these?

    <div class="md"><p>I would say you are 100% correct but Michelson-Morley was a flawed experiment. Consider for instance that it was obviously incapable of even ascertaining the existence of the Heliosphere. The solar system is immersed in an aether of charged particles, plasmas, magnetic fields, cosmic rays, and a vast infinite electron plasma field. The Michelson-Morley failed to detect the aether because it was a flawed design with flawed assumptions about the nature of the aether. Modern space age measurements have proven the aether probably does exist. Pre-Space Age experiments are crap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nonsense. The premise is completely flawed and designed for an electrically neutral environment which doesn&#39;t exist. If the Michelson Morley experiment had been based on accurate assumptions then it would have been able to detect the Heliospheric Current Sheet, the Heliomagnetic Field, and the Solar Electron Flux. It detected nothing because it was designed by individuals who didn&#39;t know what to look for. </p>

<p>The simple fact of the matter is that MM was flawed to begin with. It &#39;s designers did not understand the nature of the interstellar medium, they did not understand the motion of the solar system, nor did they understand the properties of the supposed aether that they were trying to detect. Advocates of the Interstellar Vaccum Theory have been proven conclusively wrong for over 70 years since the first probes were sent into space. MM can&#39;t even detect the relative motion of the Earth with Solar Mgnetosphere. It&#39;s the same type of 19th century garbage that still leads idiots to believe in hairbrain nonsense like Doppler Spectral Redshift and Big Bang Creationism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You didn&#39;t ask anything first. I asked you first and you ignored my question. MM is flawed for many reasons, but I imagine the easiest one for you to understand is that it assumes the Earth is separate from the Aether, when in fact, by its very nature the aether would be entangled to begin with. Regardless, there are countless peer reviewed articles on aether studies. Furthermore, you would have to be able to untangle the aether from the Earth in order for MM to work, a physical impossibility given the definition of the Aether. Now, I am not claiming the aether exists or doesn&#39;t exist. I am merely stating the short comings in MM at even being able to address the problem. The simple fact of the matter is that the aether&#39;s existence is implied by the failure to detect an interstellar vacuum at even nano scales. Regardless, since you&#39;re an obvious uneducated and uninformed troll with a sadly mistaken and misplaced superiority complex, I will be happy to put you in your place. Of course, a pointless exercise as you will deny any evidence to the contrary of your debunked paradigm which is as ridiculous and stupid as this flat earth nonsense.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s begin again:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What is the Electron density of the interstellar medium?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the density of quarks and gluons of the interstellar medium?</p></li>
<li><p>In what manner does the Earth dis-Entangle itself from the aether so that it can be measured in relation to it?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did MM fail to detect the Heliomagnetosphere or Helioplasmasphere in which we know the Earth is embedded?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Your anti-aether paradigm only goes to prove why Nikola Tesla is the superior scientist of the 20th century. There are plenty of fact filled books on scientific aether models at Apeiron here: <a href="http://redshift.vif.com/book_catalog.htm">http://redshift.vif.com/book_catalog.htm</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course I win, your knowledge of physics doesn&#39;t extend past a 9th grade public education and is steeped in creationist nonsense and filtered through religious propaganda. Sad part is, you don&#39;t even know it.</p>

<p>Imagine that we embedded the Earth in a three-dimensional Euclidean space. The question of the Aether is whether or not that space is filled or empty. Even the most basic space age observations prove that space is not a vacuum. The Earth is embedded in an ocean of subatomic particles and electron plasma which completely and totally envelopes the Earth. It is a proven fact. It is also embedded in a Neutrino field, which would be an aether if we wanted to call it such.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mmm, down votes.</p>

<p>A question that always gets me hammered, but not answered:</p>

<p>How can the sun accelerate and decelerate to follow the proposed flat earth path? According to flat earth theory, the winter sun has a greater &quot;central&quot; radius, but the summer sun has a smaller one. What energy slows or accelerates the sun to ensure a 24hr cycle throughout the year?</p>

<p>As for rocketry being less effective in space: opposing friction will also be less, and so will gravity. </p>

<p>I really don&#39;t know how to answer it and it may be that you are correct. This is not my field, but to be honest, I don&#39;t think flat earth theory is incompatible with the PTB narrative, it corresponds with the sentiment that we are random pieces of accident destined for oblivion. I don&#39;t believe that at all. </p>

<p>This is not true. No laws of physics need to be changed - the only thing that is required is the understanding that light bends upwards, but that is <a href="http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2014/aug/04/silicon-nanorods-bend-light-in-new-directions">easily tested and understood</a> within the existing framework of physics.</p>

<p><a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/02.18/light.html">The speed of light is demonstrably variable</a></p>

<p>Can you be any more specific?</p>

<p>and have little to no understanding of the science behind much of the phenomena.</p>

<p>Are you sure you aren&#39;t referring to yourself here? Just kidding! But maybe don&#39;t be such a dick.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When literally every single piece of scientific data forms a cohesive picture that really kind of illustrates one general set of model of the universe</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you sure about this? Heliocentric theory is relatively recent in it&#39;s acceptance and popularity, you seem to be just assuming that the consensus view is correct, probably because you&#39;ve been told that it is your entire life and never bothered to question it yourself.</p>

<p>Scientists are people, and they have a long, long history of being very, very wrong on incredibly important issues. You shouldn&#39;t take their unanimity and certainty as any kind of evidence.</p>

<p>Yes, education makes the largest difference which is why you won&#39;t find any serious scientist entertaining the thought - it&#39;s not that they can&#39;t believe it but that it&#39;s not worth the time.</p>

<p>If you say so - I&#39;d argue that the scientific community has a clear and long track record of stamping out any dissent or questioning of established scientific dogma.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean, have you ever considered that you were made out of pennies? It&#39;s the same line of thinking, it supplants all we know with outrageous claims that are intellectually dishonest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, that would be pretty easy to test, wouldn&#39;t it? Copper and nickel have fairly consistent and measurable qualities, so if your penny theory were true it would be fairly straightforward to prove or refute.</p>

<p>I guess I was hoping that you had an actual, specific objection to the actual theory, but as you are clearly not well acquainted with it and have no interest in becoming so, it doesn&#39;t look like our conversation will bear much fruit.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t just drop that without explaining what you mean, never mind the fact that the earth emits a small electromagnetic field. All of the math surrounding and governing our understanding of the magnetosphere requires that earth takes on that exact shape, a sphere. Either Maxwell&#39;s equations are wrong and you can explain the phenomena using some unknown mathematics or the churning of an molten iron dynamo takes on a sphere shape and creates the earth&#39;s electromagnetic field. </p>

<p>I&#39;m going to guess that the math is far beyond your understanding but just in case it isn&#39;t, our current understanding of it and the earth&#39;s production of it requires the earth to be a sphere (well, spheroid). Explain to me how flat earth deals with this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are good theories out there, but this just isn&#39;t one of them...</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting, and I have entertained it before.</p>

<p>5 of my biggest issues with it:</p>

<ol>
<li>Why is every celestial body round and the earth is just flat?</li>
<li>Why do physicists, rocket scientists, etc. agree that the earth is round and use this information to conduct real world tests?</li>
<li>Why do objects appear over the horizon at long distances? This is an observation hundreds of years old and can be made by anyone.</li>
<li>Why cover it up? What do we lose in believing the earth is round?</li>
<li>Our current understanding of gravity is completely wrong, which ties with #1 and #2, if the earth is flat.</li>
</ol>

<p>Aristotle&#39;s quote should finish with: <em>&quot;Likewise, it is the mark of an ignoramous to entertain a &#39;nonsensical&#39; thought and then believe it to be reality&quot;</em></p>

<p>Like entertaining the thought that snowflakes are not actually frozen water, but tears from a giant creature in the sky. We just....legitimately know that it isn&#39;t the case. To believe that with how much we <em>know</em> about thr nature of the world is ridiculous.</p>

<p>Trust me, I really gave flat earth a shot. It took a lot of effort to try and forget everything I&#39;ve been told and seen. It just doesn&#39;t make sense, simple observation and experience disproves it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can actually answer this...kinda.</p>

<p>From my understanding and reading of these posts; it is not necessarily that the earth is flat, but more that it is not round.</p>

<p>The big argument flat-earthers tote around is that you dont feel the earth moving and constellations revolve around the north star.  plus every experiment to measure the motion of the earth tends to come up inconclusive...so it&#39;s not necessarily the earth is flat; its more...its not round.</p>

<p>To go through these questions.</p>

<p>1) Im not gonna say in my opinion, cause i don&#39;t know what to think, but i am going to reference ancient civilizations that all say the earth is a floating disc (not flat).  Hindu Cosmology does a good job at explaining it.  the &quot;earth&quot; is still a globe...like imagine a snowglobe but round.  the land and waters are flat with a dome atmosphere above and below. the &quot;filament.&quot;  </p>

<p>The proposed system is more geo-helio centric where the planets orbit the sun; but the sun and the moon orbit the earth.  imagine a spinning ying yang as a representation of the sun and the moon orbiting around the center of the earth with the constellations and planets above.  that is then encased in essentially matter that we call the Oort Cloud and that is our system... and there are infinite number of these.  The big bang happens, the universe spreads out and eventually fades away and 8.64 billion years later there is another big bang, another brahma born from vishnu and its an endless cycle.... I am digressing</p>

<p>Why the conspiracy, why cover it up.... this has taken me a while to come to answer with.  And the answer comes from the ancient civilizations....with the current model: we are organisms on a rock orbiting a fireball tucked away in some part of the universe.  insignificant, far away, nothing in the vastness of space.  there is no center of the earth, just a round ball.</p>

<p>Now a lot of ancient civilizations will say that at the center of the earth.... there is something special... the tree of life, eden, mt. meru, mt. sinai, mt. olympus....always a special tree or a special mountain depending on which religion you are going with.  Here is the conspiracy (don the tin foil hat)... the north pole, is the center.  at the north pole, which apparently we can&#39;t fly over or access is eden/mt. meru/the center.  Earth is the center of the universe, everything revolves around us...well everything in our system.  we are the focal point.  </p>

<p>When you look at it this way, we become a lot more special and more significant then just monkeys on a rock.  </p>

<p>If the ball Earth is spinning at 1000mph and revolving around the Sun at 67,000mph, the solar system is spiraling around the Milky Way galaxy at 500,000mph, while the galaxy shoots away from a Big Bang creationary explosion at the beginning of time at 670,000,000mph, how do I not feel any acceleration at all?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the strongest, closest force to you is a constant 9.8m/s. Your point here seems to boil down to &quot;look how big these numbers are though!&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Instead, experiments like Michelson-Morley, which attempt to measure the speed of the rotation of the Earth given a constant speed of light, show that there is no motion, and the heliocentrists are forced to bluster away about &#39;aether&#39;, ignoring the results.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nobody is talking about aether in modern times. New conspiracy theory: you&#39;re from 2 centuries in the past! Of course that experiment didn&#39;t work by the way. Their entire premise is wrong. The speed of light isn&#39;t constant. </p>

<p>Michelson-Morley had nothing to do with the rotation of the Earth but was trying to find the rotation of a &quot;luminiferous aether.&quot;  Tell me, why didn&#39;t Michelson or Morley argue that their experiment proved a non-rotating Earth?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What sense would you use to feel the earth&#39;s rotation? There&#39;s no friction, so there wouldn&#39;t be vibration to touch. You&#39;ve got your sight, which you can actually use to feel the earth&#39;s rotation, albeit you&#39;d have to pay very close attention <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqOBPDWl5Gc">There are literally thousands of videos illustrating this</a>.</p>

<p>The reason those pictures don&#39;t make sense to you is because you&#39;re not considering the frame of reference. If you were standing at the equator directly up looking up, they&#39;d indeed be streaks across the sky. Most of those pictures are looking towards one of the poles, so they seem to be turning in a circle. In fact <em>because</em> the earth is round is the very reason you&#39;re able to see those circles. If the earth were a flat disk spinning on its edge like a coin, the horizon would always obscure the axis of the rotation. Because it&#39;s round, you pretty much always have a view of the axis of the earth&#39;s rotation.</p>

<p>There&#39;s your inner ear, but that&#39;s only sensitive to sudden acceleration or deceleration. The earth has been spinning at roughly the same rate for millions of years.</p>

<p>So how would you be able to feel it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well when that happens, it&#39;s simply that the moon and sun are both within your field of vision on the earth. I&#39;m going to assume you are asking about the sphere earth theory (as that&#39;s the only one which really makes sense). Imagine if you will a ball. Then on the surface of that ball you place a semi-sphere with its flat face tangent to the ball&#39;s surface. Now expand that semi-sphere out infinitely. That semi-sphere is your field of view. Anything within this region will be visible given that they are not obstructed. For you to see the moon at the same time as the sun, all that needs to happen is that both are within this space. </p>

<p>If the sun is setting or rising on one horizon and the moon is on the other horizon, then the moon will be nearly full as you have direct line of sight to the entire illuminated half of the moon. </p>

<p>If both are high in the sky then all you will see is a crescent. As the sun is farther than the moon, yet both are in the same general direction, that means that the other side of the moon is getting illuminated more than the side with line of sight to you. </p>

<p>And you can see it during the day because the moon doesn&#39;t just &quot;turn off&quot;. It&#39;s always there shinning, unless its within earth&#39;s shadow (called a new moon). Same with the Stars. The reason we see them less during the day is because the gas and water particles in the atmosphere interact with light that hits it, scattering the light in all directions. Blue light is more easily scattered so that&#39;s why the sky is blue. If any celestial object is brighter than this scattering then you can see it during the day. Venus and the moon are the most common examples of this, but Mercury and rarely Sirius can also be seen at certain times of day. </p>

<p>That&#39;s called a lunar eclipse. A new moon happens when the moon and sun are at the same point on the horizon. If they line up perfectly it&#39;s a solar eclipse.</p>

You raise some perfectly valid criticisms of heliocentric theory and globular theory, but without a model you are just poking holes in existing theories and aren&#39;t providing any evidence for a flat earth.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/sky/">http://www.google.com/sky/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.stellarium.org/">http://www.stellarium.org/</a></p>

<p>Can you point out any flaws or inaccuracies in the mapping of the stars, which sailors have been using to navigate successfully for hundreds of years? Can you model the stars on a flat earth geometry? If not, don&#39;t you have to acknowledge that the spherical geometry of the stars is irrefutable, and thus your flat earth theory is invalid?</p>

<p>You&#39;ve provided a very good primer on the problems with heliocentric and globular theory, but you have very little evidence supporting your proposed replacement model. You cannot even model the geometry of the heavens, which the globe-heads can at least do, and your azimuthal projection map is hilariously inaccurate, with continents in the southern hemisphere appearing ridiculously bloated versus the north. Without a working model, I think you should be a little more skeptical of and a little less devoted to your personal pet replacement theory - otherwise you are not much better than the globalists you malign.</p>

<p>Can you model the stars on a flat earth geometry?</p>

<p>Just look at them. There&#39;s your model: we have been able to accurately predict the eclipses for thousands of years, because we used to look at the stars a lot more than we do today.</p>

<p>Your link is to another Reddit post (by you) with no further links but rather a quote from a book that you seem to be infatuated with, that doesn&#39;t provide evidence for anything, model anything or predict anything, but merely makes a claim about trigonometry.</p>

<p>Your model of flat-earth stars is to &quot;just look at them&quot;? Are you serious? What about my question, is there any flaw with the spherical models of the stars that I posted, and if not, how could it possibly work on a flat plane?</p>

<p>You are ignoring the hard questions that point out the flaws in your theory, just as the globalists ignore the hard questions that point out the flaws in theirs. You are no better than them - possibly worse, since I suspect you are fully aware of the actual geometry of our universe, but for some reason seem to be on a mission to lead people down the wrong path. I continue to wonder why that is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree - I think looking at different perspectives can be incredibly painful, if only emotionally. Learning that something fundamental that you have believed your entire life is not true can be shattering, not just about the shape of the earth but about anything. I think that is why people can have such a strong negative emotional reaction to new information.</p>

<p>That being said - here is an incredibly brief background on Teed and his theory:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s only painful if you let it be.  How can information be painful?  It&#39;s just information.  What you do with it or don&#39;t do with it is where the pain comes in and all of that is entirely on you.</p>

<p>Learning you&#39;ve been lied to sucks but then the obvious follow up is, &quot;Why&#39;d you let yourself be lied to?  Why&#39;d you let others do your thinking for you?&quot;  It&#39;s empowering taking control of your mind and thoughts and realizing that hey, my entire conception of the world has been altered but I&#39;m still here and I&#39;m not going anywhere.</p>

<p>That link you posted is weird because it&#39;s clearly someone attempting to smear him and his theory - wouldn&#39;t a better background of it come from someone who&#39;s writing with a less obvious negative agenda?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you that exploring new information can be empowering for those who are willing to change their previously held beliefs. For those who are not, new information can be a threat.</p>

<p>There aren&#39;t many concave earth proponents - looking at the &quot;arguments&quot; of the detractors is a good way to start looking at the topic. Simanek is another &quot;skeptic&quot; who attempts to refute Teed&#39;s Rectilineator experiment but in my opinion fails miserably, and in his failure actually makes a compelling case for the veracity of the experiment.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.lhup.edu/%7Edsimanek/hollow/morrow.htm">https://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/hollow/morrow.htm</a></p>

<p>The best resource for &quot;pro&quot;-concave information is probably Wild Heretic:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wildheretic.com/concave-earth-theory/">http://www.wildheretic.com/concave-earth-theory/</a></p>

<p>And of course Steven Christopher makes an incredibly compelling case for concave Earth, if not his own divinity, on his YouTube channel:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheFoxStevie">https://www.youtube.com/user/TheFoxStevie</a></p>

<p>Again thanks for your interest, I&#39;d be interested in your thoughts if you do take a deep dive into the material. Unlike OP, I am open to arguments against the concave earth theory, I simply have not encountered anything that would cause me to believe that heliocentrism or flat earth &quot;theory&quot; are better models, with the many problems pointed out by OP (and many others) with regards to heliocentricity, and the problems that I have repeatedly pointed out with flat earth theory (southern pole star rotation, flight times in the southern hemisphere, lack of a cohesive model, etc.) which have never been addressed by OP or anyone else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, Mr. Eric Do-buy-my-book. I didn&#39;t see anything in that video (or any of his other videos) that even begins to model how the stars could work on a flat plane, just lots of vague speculation and appeal to ancient superstition. Flat Earthers cannot account for the axis of rotation around the southern pole stars (Sigma Octantis, Southern Cross, etc.) This is why flat Earthers cannot produce a working model of the stars, and cannot explain why models like Stellarium or Google Sky can produce an accurate map of the heavens at any time and location on (in) Earth.</p>

<p>Heliocentrism is bullshit but so is Flat Earth. Only one other option, I&#39;m afraid...</p>

<p>Not only has the government lied to you but you now have proof in your pocket to fight it. It changes your perspective completely when you really get it. You are no longer some tiny ant crawling on a remote dust speck in an infinite mess of stars and planets. The sun, moon, and stars rotate around you. Since day one, you have been told you are a piece of shit nobody, a nothing to adhere to rules like a good robot. No, you are the reason for this place. This is incredibly empowering when you really grasp it.</p>

<p>It will also let you know very quickly who you are dealing with when it comes to truth. If they talk satellites, galaxies, globe etc. you know they are either ignorant or putting forth the NWO agenda willingly or not.</p>

<p>When you have your entire worldview built of lies on top of lies, is it any wonder people are so confused, lost, and easily controlled? Is it really surprising everyone thinks everyone else is really stupid?</p>

<p>Everyone is hurt by this mental slavery, and everyone can see that things aren&#39;t right. Even the childrens&#39; movies that we create nowadays paint a picture of a dystopian world where everything is just <em>wrong</em>. It&#39;s the most common theme nowadays, a worldwide depression of the human spirit, and I believe your life and all of our lives would change if we opened our hearts and minds to truth. As long as we instead choose to cling to comforting illusions, illusions will be all that we have to comfort ourselves.</p>

There appear to be a number of genuine posters who believe that the topic only exists to discredit this sub (which I think is a very narrow view since the topic has obviously exploded beyond reddit), or conspiracy theories in general.  So it&#39;s hard to know if the downvotes come from people who believe that narrative or people paid to suppress the issue.</p>

When you do that you are saying &quot;I am not capable of understanding this issue so I need to find someone I can trust because they will tell me the truth.&quot;  Certainly we should listen to the views of people who have spent time on a subject, but we should not accept them unquestioningly.

But I do find it strange how these users who&#39;ve never visited the sub before magically find every flat earth post and downvote it minutes after it&#39;s created.  These users do the same things you&#39;re talking about, attack the OP himself or the idea of flat Earth generally and how absurd it is instead of discussing the specific claims.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll say that I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to find that what we all think we know about the planet and the nature of reality is totally wrong, it&#39;s been happening over and over again for thousands of years.  I think it&#39;s really arrogant that modern science assumes it has most of the answers even though the ideas and equations it bases these assumptions on are almost exclusively theoretical.</p>

<p>You seem interested in the history of this debate, so you may enjoy a book called &quot;Inventing the Flat Earth: Columbus and Modern Historians.&quot; It&#39;s not actually true that everyone used to believe in the flat earth thing, and it wasn&#39;t just &quot;a few people&quot; who understood that the earth was round. </p>

<p>The supposition that most people believed the earth was flat is thought to have come from Protestant organizations smearing/discrediting the Catholic Church and painting them as an enemy of science. In reality if we look closely, there&#39;s no evidence that the flat earth thing was widely believed by <em>anybody,</em> and plentiful evidence to the contrary. Basically, the Protestants started this rumor - &quot;HOO BOY THE CATHOLICS ARE SO DUMB THAT THEY HAVE PEOPLE BELIEVING THE EARTH IS FLAT, DURR HURR HURR.&quot; And it caught on! </p>

<p>Couple examples of how we can trace the round-earth knowledge throughout the centuries: </p>

<p>1) The orb used in plentiful Christian iconography, including during the coronation of England&#39;s monarchs, is a globe surmounted by a cross, intended to symbolize God&#39;s dominion over the world. It&#39;s called the <em>globus cruciger</em>. Notably it&#39;s an <em>orb,</em> not a pancake. It&#39;s been in use since the 5th century - if nobody believed the earth was round, why were they representing the world as a sphere?  </p>

<p>2) When Columbus proposed his journey to the New World, he had some opposition. Specifically, one of his critics used Ptolemy&#39;s measurements of the globe to argue that <em>circumference of the earth</em> was too big to allow Columbus to travel successfully. It&#39;s very specific in this criticism. Again, why would the presupposition be that the earth had a circumference unless it was popularly known to be round? </p>

<p>Lastly, I hypothesize that the only reason flat earth posts get downvoted and argued with is...well, because people in the conspiracy community like to be perceived as intelligent and reasonable insofar as that&#39;s possible, and being associated with stuff like flat earth suggests that we are all pants-on-head lunatics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point wasn&#39;t that everyone believed or disbelieved the earth was flat until the 17th century but that there was no consensus.  There wasn&#39;t one model near-universally accepted as true like there is today, children weren&#39;t taught only this one model in school growing up.</p>

<p>I was also speaking not just about flatness/roundness of the Earth but with our model of the solar system and universe, heliocentric vs. geocentric vs. the many other models of the past.  These were also fiercely debated for hundreds of years until Copernicus and (perhaps more importantly) Galileo came along in the 16th and 17th centuries.</p>

<p>I will check out that book though, thanks for the recommendation.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure many did but many also believed that the Earth, whether round or flat, was the center of the known universe at that time too.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>A 2-dimensional flat circle has circumference also.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t mean to argue these points too much, I don&#39;t actually think the earth is flat - I just think it&#39;s dangerous to assume we have all of the answers when it&#39;s been shown for thousands of years, over and over again, that we don&#39;t.  People are way to quick to just accept what they were told growing up by perceived authority figures.</p>
