    <div class="md"><p>Here is what ZetaTalk said about the NYSE glitch, the Chinese stock market crash &amp; United Airlines downtime: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&amp;nbsp; China is considered the world’s strongest economy at present, and its newly affluent citizens are doing more than buying cars and electronics. They are playing the stock market. In a country not familiar with capitalist gambling markets, China is still establishing controls. Its recent bursting bubble, wherein their stock market lost 30% within weeks, is a learning curve and not a fatal blow. Such market crashes are familiar to the West, from the 1929 crash to the more recent 2008 housing bubble crash on Wall Street. Was the shutdown of the NYSE a reaction, a protective maneuver known as Plunge Protection? Yes, despite claims that it was a computer crash. Panic trading is stopped in these instances.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp; What raised eyebrows was the apparent nexus in timing for other outages. United Airlines halted all flights earlier in the day for two hours, claiming a computer glitch. The Wall Street Journal crashed, simultaneous to the NYSE down time, reportedly due to the rush of the public to read the latest during the market closures. If a DDOS attack can disable a server, certainly a rush by the public can create delayed service, but is there more to this story? Amid all this was a tweet from Anonymous suggesting on July 7 that Wall Street will have a bad day on July 8, which then resulted.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp; Though seemingly separate issues, these well publicized outages not only have a common nexus, they were caused by the same hand. As we stated after the elite caused Obama to miss his October 20, 2014 date for the announcement, the <a href="http://www.zetatalk.com/ning/08no2014.htm">Council of Worlds has gone to war with the elite</a>.  We have stated that this war has been won and the announcement will now proceed, but given the nature of the Service-to-Self individuals prevalent among the elite, they are being given some last minute reminders on just WHO won this war. They should not expect to recoup or rally. The <a href="http://www.zetatalk.com/ning/04jy2015.htm">sudden demise of a Space X shuttle to the ISS</a>, after many successes, was such a reminder to Elon Musk and his cronies.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp; China is a partner during Obama’s announcement, but the China stock market was clearly headed for an adjustment, and thus the timing of the Council’s warming. Speculators in China will be reined in sharply by China, unlike the criminals on Wall Street who were never really disciplined after the Wall Street crash in 2008. Margin traders in China, hedge funds on Wall Street, deceptive derivative packages by mortgage bundlers, and the hallmark symbols of these crimes the NYSE and the Wall Street Journal. Anonymous of course is a human working closely with the Council on these matters.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp; What did the down time for United Airlines have to do with this sharp warning to Wall Street and wealthy speculators worldwide? The United downtime occurred the same day, but earlier in the day. The elite, who dearly want to prevent Obama from making his announcement, rely on modern day electronics to enhance their wealth. Beyond being able to make transactions around the world in a blink of an eye, the symbol of their elevation to the status of gods, in their eyes, is air travel. They can cross borders, evade prosecution, go to pleasant climates, and no one can stop them. Please note, this can be stopped with a wink of the Council’s eye. </p>

Hell they&#39;re still milking the charleston shooter thing by going off the main story and pushing shit about a damn flag. Also we haven&#39;t heard shit about the F16 and the private plane colliding with each other killing the two people in the private plane. Why was a sophisticated military fighter jet flying near a private plane? How was he not able to see the private plane on radar? A bunch of questions and no one is even talking about it. </p>
