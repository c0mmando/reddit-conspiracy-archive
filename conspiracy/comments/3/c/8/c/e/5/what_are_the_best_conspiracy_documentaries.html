       Absolutely worth the time investment.
      </p>
      <p>
       It opens so many cans of worms and pretty much paints the entire picture of why things are how they are, and what led to it, and even the players behind it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a certain fact of the Bushs being bonesmen, a part of a secret society.
      </p>
      <p>
       How fucking awful would it be if what this documentary says is true? That H. W. Bush had a role in the assassination of JFK?
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, every piece of the puzzle in this documentary can be argued against, but man....if its all actually true it is an absolute mindfuck how fucked everything is, and I lean towards it all being pretty much right on. Maybe not getting all of the players, but its fucked.

       A different perspective from the 1980s about America's role in Cambodia:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Swimming to Cambodia
       </p>
       <p>
        Gray goes on to perform a monologue where he discusses his experiences filming a small role in the movie The Killing Fields. Interspersed with his own experiences he expounds on the recent history of Cambodia up through the coming to power of the Khmer Rouge and the Cambodian Genocide. A small scene from The Killing Fields is the only other footage in the movie.

       Not immediately apparent as conspiracy material but if you understand and accept the premise then a conspiracy becomes evident. I always get attacked on this sub when I talk about electricity it is quite amusing.

       I wouldn't suggest Alex Jones any more than Richard Hoagland. There are better, less kooky choices out there as far as conspiracy theories go, though I personally listen more out of amusement and casual interest than because I believe it. (Same reason I visit here.)

       Hoagland though "kooky", has yet to be dis proven after 20 years on his analysis of the
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/GRQK9Kd.jpg">
        Cydonia
       </a>
       region of Mars.  The night time IR images, not the face.  That one piece of data he brought to the attention of the world still requires science and history books to be rewritten.

       Source on where he got this 'infrared image'? Because Hoagland is well known for zooming in very far on images and then reading things into pixels, so I'd like the original image if you please.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can compare it to the actual detailed images from MRO for example to see what he's up to lately.

       Your argument is that NASA hasn't bothered to publicly speak out against a conspiracy theory, therefore it's true?

       He has a private form of physics which he can't demonstrate - and he's not even a physicist to begin with. If any of his stories actually held water he could easily get a lot of recognition, it's not like amazing discoveries and landmark papers don't get released. C'mon, physicists are actively looking for alternatives to the standard model, it's not like they're secret about it...

       No, my argument is NASA wouldn't have released those images.  And NASA has also been known to edit images before releasing them to the public.  Not just for clarity issues.

       NASA has been putting red filters on Mars images to change the color of the sky from blue to red.  They made the mistake years ago on a CNN special on the Mars rovers.  The person they were interviewing at Nasa had a lap top on their desk with obviously unedited pictures from the rover on the surface of Mars.  You could tell by the shadows it was not dusk or dawn, and the sky was a bright blue.  Just like ours.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact NASA has held information back from the public is not a secret.
       <br/>
       As far as his theories on hyperdeminsonial physics, they can not be measured with our current technology, but does that mean they don't exist?  If you cant tell me how they built the pyramids, do they vanish?  There are things that we don't fully understand, yet they are still present.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the ancients have built things that we would have trouble duplicating today, does that mean they were more advanced than us?  Some people think so.  Even things we can duplicate that they did, think about the advantage in technology we claim to have.  And the effort it would take just to DUPLICATE their work.  Also think about what we have built today, what would stand the test of time like the pyramids.  The Hoover dam might be the only thing.

      <p>
       The issue of color is more complicated than it seems. Cameras and eyes don't work identically, and the former have to be calibrated to deliver an image that is representative of what our eyes would see. Most cameras have such options, people just don't generally use them. Early Mars images were calibrated to be more 'Earth-like' and sometimes NASA still does that; it's basically just changing the balance of light in the image to replicate what we see here on Earth, rather than what you would see on Mars. Current rovers have images of known color on board to calibrate the camera on the surface rather than based on our best approximation.

       Practically? YES. If he can't show that it's true, then how does he know about it? If it can't be measured, then why should anyone believe it? There are plenty of scientific hypotheses on the same level as his (although they tend to have their math figured out) which aren't commonly accepted either.

       We have advantages, but we also can't just hire an entire working class of people for several months per year to do our huge construction efforts, like the Egyptians could with their off-season farmers. You can do a lot of things if you just throw enough people at them.

      <p>
       We could easily build a structure that would stand as long as the Pyramids did if we wanted to, but there's no real rational desire for anything that lasts that kind of time. For the most part we don't really care for giant piles of rocks, we build useful things instead.

       You might not, but if we wanted who ever is here thousands of years from now to know we existed, and we understood complex mathematics the precession of the sky, knowing that they wouldn't speak the language, what would you build?  The fact you don't want to or that other dont explains right there why the ancient people were probably more advanced than us, technology wise, and spiritually.  They understood that building in stone would make their existence more than a myth and something that we have to deal with.  Despite that some people dont want to or have a hard time wrapping their minds around.  Even with a degree.

       You should be able to find it.  If I had more time and didn't all ready do the homework once, I would do it for you.   Even Joe Rogan tried to slam Hoagland on his podcast in an interview with Graham Hancock, to which Graham defended Hoagland, Rogan back peddled after Graham stated his case.  Rogan doesn't do that often.  Gained a little respect for it imo.
