       Does anyone remember the huge revolution in Iceland a while back where they didn't cave to the bankers and reconstructed their government? Yea, me neither.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now Greece is full of people who are aware and awake. They're about to vote "no" to the International Monitory Fund (group of thugs) and the EU Central Bank in a national referendum on more austerity. That's a fun word too. Austerity. Imagine if senators in America suddenly said "We're totally getting rid of all social security, stopping all disability payments and pull all Federal public housing funding." People would be going ape shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR My prediction: Greece will vote "no" and the rest of the world media; all EU, US, AU outlets including the BBC and NPR, will portray Greece as being self-entitled children living in a welfare state who aren't taking responsibility to hold up their share of the EU.

       This is what ZetaTalk said about Greece &amp; the future of the world's economy:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        &amp;nbsp; The story of a
        <a href="http://www.zetatalk.com/ning/31ja2015.htm">
         country going bankrupt
        </a>
        is not new, as history has many recent examples – Argentina in 2002 and Germany in 1924. The result is well known.
        <a href="http://www.zetatalk.com/ning/19no2011.htm">
         Creditors must write off the debt
        </a>
        , anyone holding the now worthless currency finds it falling in value, a sudden and unstoppable plunge, and those who had savings or pensions or cash set aside find all this has vaporized.
        <a href="http://www.zetatalk.com/index/zeta156.htm">
         Such is the lot of paper money
        </a>
        , even if it is in electronic form these days. This story, of a country or bank or any entity going bankrupt will increasingly be in the news. The outcome is certain, though will be resisted by creditors and those who have the illusion that they are wealthy.
       </p>
       <p>
        &amp;nbsp; In the short term, for Greece, the outcome is written. The Euro is itself in danger, having been
        <a href="http://www.zetatalk.com/newsletr/issue435.htm">
         unpegged from the Swiss Franc
        </a>
        recently and falling in value. With 28 member states, it cannot simply hand out money endlessly to a profligate when many of its member states have a lower standard of living. After decades of being coddled, the citizens and politicians of Greece are assuming that being stubborn is a winning stance. The shock has not even started. The suddenly called referendum is to save face for Tsipras, who can then claim he gave the people what they wanted. It will certainly not sway the creditors. Why should it?
       </p>
       <p>
        &amp;nbsp; We have predicted that the world will go on the barter system. Albeit in stages, gradually and at first only in certain locals or markets. Paper money – bonds or banking balances or printed currency or credit cards – will all be dropped. They will not be honored. For the wealthy, this will be a shock to realize that they HAVE no worth. They will expect that their lands and homes are an asset until hordes overtake them and ignore the supposed masters. They will expect that hired militias will support them until the militias take the liquor and supplies and leave the rich with nothing. The common man, quietly gardening and tending goats or chickens, will be spared this turmoil.

       Yea and that's totally wrong. So the world has, throughout history, gone to a barter system (not back to). The great myth is that we started out on barter, then moved to coins and credit. It's the other way around. The very earliest systems of money were all human economies. People would share. If they didn't trust each other, they'd keep credit records, tabletures, broken pieces of sticks, or other credit types of tickets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once systems fail, they go to barter. But you know what the crazy thing is? They barter in terms of the money from the previous system. Roman coins were used to price things long after the coins ceased to even be in circulation!
      </p>
      <p>
       The metalists (gold standard) people are pretty ignorant of the fact that metal has about as much value as paper. You can't eat it. You can't drink it. It's valuable because it's rare (at least in the case of gold), but it was pretty worthless up until the electronics age where now it holds value because it's in everything (laptops, cellphones...tiny amounts mind you, but critical).
      </p>
      <p>
       Metal standards don't solve anything. They just generate more waste and destroy our planet with mining. (Also, look up the origin of the word "mine." It comes from literally picking things off the ground and calling them yours; and than extended to the act of digging huge things out of the ground).
      </p>
      <p>
       You should really read
       <em>
        Debt: The First 5,000 Years
       </em>
       . Debt exists because States make it and it's used to enslaved or exert control. You can only have debt with an equal, but through debt you can turn that equal into a slave. Debt and slavery are very closely related. Seriously, read that book. It totally changed me perception of the world.

       The point of using valuable metals was that it was a way to limit forgery and guarantee a limit for the currency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unlike fiat currencies any pegged currency can't start to print money, they need
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       of what they peg it to in order to print more, devalue, or fractionalize (eg bitcoin) the currency.

       Gold was chosen because it was rare, easily identifiable and malleable.
