<p>I support the cause Lucy but you should try and refrain from using the autism buzzword when it comes to vaccines. Its kind of like saying chemtrails instead of cloud seeding. It is best to use something like brain damage which is much more widely researched then specifically autism</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both type and dose determine whether something is dangerous to one&#39;s health. Sodium and Chlorine both have their issues, but combine them and you have table salt. </p>

<p>In the case of Mercury, the problematic type is mercury that bioaccumulates, e.g. stays in the body long-term. This is Methylmercury, and consumption of fish is one way to get a dose of it, and there are regulations on it.</p>

<p>Ethylmercury is another compound sometimes used in preservatives for medicine (including vaccines) and does not bioaccumulate. It is far less dangerous for that reason, and is presently only in a few vaccines. The substance has not been shown to be dangerous, but the backlash from anti-vaccine groups led to alternative preservatives being used instead.</p>

<p>The hype is, as usual, wildly overstated.</p>

<p><strong>Thimerosal and Animal Brains: New Data for Assessing Human Ethylmercury Risk</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1280369/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1280369/</a></p>

<p><strong>Brain concentrations of total mercury were approximately 3–4 times lower in the thimerosal group than in the methylmercury group, and total mercury cleared more rapidly in the thimerosal group (with a half-life of 24.2 days versus 59.5 days). However, the proportion of inorganic mercury in the brain was much higher in the thimerosal group (21–86% of total mercury) compared to the methylmercury group (6–10%). Brain concentrations of inorganic mercury were approximately twice as high in the thimerosal group compared to the methylmercury group. Inorganic mercury remains in the brain much longer than organic mercury, with an estimated half-life of more than a year.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s interesting how you link to papers, but evidently don&#39;t want to take into account more recent studies which do not fit within that picture. </p>

<p>Consider from same paper, 10 years later:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4455575/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4455575/</a> </p>

<p>Seventy-nine macaques were assigned to six vaccination groups: 1) controls—animals received saline injections only; 2) MMR—animals received only the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, which has never contained thimerosal; 3) TCV—animals received all the thimerosal-containing vaccines administered routinely to children in the 1990s9 but no MMR vaccine; 4) 1990s Pediatric—animals received all pediatric vaccines administered in the 1990s, including TCVs and MMR, on the schedule recommended for children; 5) 1990s Primate—animals received all pediatric vaccines administered in the 1990s on an accelerated schedule to match macaque development; and 6) 2008—animals received the expanded immunization schedule in place as of 2008,10 which is similar to the current schedule.</p>

<p>Between birth and 12 months of age, animals were tested for neonatal reflexes, object permanence (a measure of early memory development), discrimination learning strategies (ability to respond differently to different stimuli), and social behaviors. Animals also were systematically observed and rated for their level and characteristics of exploration, social withdrawal, play behavior, and aggression.</p>

<p>The investigators found that animals within each dosing group showed similar development of neonatal reflexes and object permanence. There was a slight indication that the TCV and 1990s Primate groups performed better in some learning tests, and some of the experimental groups demonstrated fewer negative social behaviors than the control group. However negative behaviors were rarely observed in any group, and learning and social development overall appeared normal.4</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4455585/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4455585/</a></p>

<p>We observed no group differences in the acquisition of OCP. During discrimination learning, animals receiving TCVs had improved performance on reversal testing, although some of these same animals showed poorer performance in subsequent learning-set testing. Analysis of social and nonsocial behaviors identified few instances of negative behaviors across the entire infancy period. Although some group differences in specific behaviors were reported at 2 months of age, by 12 months all infants, irrespective of vaccination status, had developed the typical repertoire of macaque behaviors.</p>

<p>In any case, it doesn&#39;t mean that vaccines can&#39;t have adverse effects, but it&#39;s certainly not warranted to cry panic over it if the data is ambivalent. It suggests that if there is a relationship, it is fairly small.</p>

<p><strong>Delayed acquisition of neonatal reflexes in newborn primates receiving a thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccine: influence of gestational age and birth weight.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Infants were tested daily for acquisition of nine survival, motor, and sensorimotor reflexes.

No neonatal responses were significantly delayed in unexposed animals.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Thimerosal and Animal Brains: New Data for Assessing Human Ethylmercury Risk</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1280369/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1280369/</a></p>

<p><strong>Brain concentrations of total mercury were approximately 3–4 times lower in the thimerosal group than in the methylmercury group, and total mercury cleared more rapidly in the thimerosal group (with a half-life of 24.2 days versus 59.5 days). However, the proportion of inorganic mercury in the brain was much higher in the thimerosal group (21–86% of total mercury) compared to the methylmercury group (6–10%). Brain concentrations of inorganic mercury were approximately twice as high in the thimerosal group compared to the methylmercury group. Inorganic mercury remains in the brain much longer than organic mercury, with an estimated half-life of more than a year.</strong></p>
