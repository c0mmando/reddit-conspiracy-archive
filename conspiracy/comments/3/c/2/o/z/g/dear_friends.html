    <div class="md"><p>(a series of four consecutive lunar eclipses—coinciding on Jewish Holidays—with six full moons in between, and no intervening partial lunar eclipses) which began with the April 2014 lunar eclipse is a sign of the end times as described in the Bible in Acts 2:20 and Revelation 6:12.    </p>

<p>This was just a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_Moon_Prophecy">wikipida excerpt</a>    </p>

<p>If you can get past the religious stuff, the facts are true. I have seen two or so of the blood moons already, and they fall on particular Jewish holidays. The next one is in September.    </p>

<p>Previously, The two April lunar eclipses in 2014 and 2015 occurred at the same time as Passover. The next in September and october occur during the Feast of Tabernacle.     </p>

<p>The jewish calendar has been kept by the moon, where as we keep time by the Gregorian calendar. On the jewish calanar, you can keep the time by looking up at the moon, and depending on its size, you will know what time of the month it is. Full means its the middle of the month.    </p>

<p>Since the jewish calander has been the same, and follows the lunar cycle, its no coincidence that the 4 blood moons prophesied have fallen exactly on the Jewish dates (Holidays).       </p>

<p>Whats also important is to understand the meaning of these jewish holidays we celebrate and why, so you can understand why the blood moons are considered a sign because of the dates they fall under.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>also, Im gonna take a huge long shot here, and i may offend a bunch of people because im talking from my ass,     </p>

<p>but I think the jews not believing in Jesus stems from the whole idea of them being the ones that crucified him in the first place, call it denial or whatever makes killing that jesus guy justifiable.     </p>

<p>Even today people use this argument torwards jews: YOU KILLED JESUS!<br/>
so imagine what it was like after it happened back then, they could have branched off out of guilt or fear because they just killed the guy and made the prophecy true. fastforward to 2015, you have jews who dont believe that jesus was the messiah. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Didn&#39;t the Romans kill him?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the Bible, Pontius Pilate offered to release one prisoner from their death sentence, as per a Passover custom.  He offered to the Jewish community <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barabbas">Barabbas</a>, or Jesus.  Barabbas was released by popular demand.</p>

<p>So, while the Romans were the ones to nail Christ to the cross, the Jewish mob played a role.  However, one must remember that Jesus, and his followers, were Jewish.  After whipping the Money Changers, Jesus made some powerful enemies of his own people.  So, were the &#39;Jews&#39; responsible for Jesus&#39; death?  No.  Only some were.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There where rabbis and prists at the front lines demanding his death, and rabbis are Jewish, so I&#39;m certain there where many &quot;Jews&quot;  who wanted it to happen, and who knows how many regretted or realized it  afterward.    </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t say it was anyone who killed him, I say it was simply meant to be no matter what, and the idea is that he died for everyone, so we can live as sinners but not be condemned to hell, and at anytime can choose to change our ways and be given a 2nd chance to live as a good person,  a moral and loving person just like Jesus was.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many jews who believe it, they are called Messianic Jews. Basically messianic jews keep the same traditions but believe that Jesus was the messiah and believe in his 2nd coming, and they also believe in unifying denominations , &quot;Jew and Gentiles together as one&quot; (Gentiles = non jews ). There are also Messianic Rabbis too. there are a large amount of them across the country, and my dad is one of them.</p>

<p>most jews dont like us, If I ever wanted to become an Israeli citizen by birthright (As a foreigner with Jewish blood) they would kick me out if I mentioned anyhting about being messianic.        </p>

<p>As to why non messianic jews dont recognize jesus as messiah... there are too many reasons, it gets down to translations of translations and theology I know nothing about.    </p>

<p>Then there are Orthodox jews, they keep very strict kosher rules, and look and dress a certain way. Although there was one Orthodox family that accepted us and invited us over for diner cause my dad painted their house. they new we where messianic but they didnt care, and I dont care ither I just enjoy good company and friendship.</p>

<p>They broke challa bread and salted it, witch is a very respectful tradition for orthodox jews, basically saying we accept you into our home as family.</p>
