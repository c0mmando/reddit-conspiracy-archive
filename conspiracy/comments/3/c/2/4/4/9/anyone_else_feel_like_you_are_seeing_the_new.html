Literally hundreds of millions of people believe the holocaust is fact based mostly on anecdotal evidence. I&#39;m just a guy I&#39;m this present age whose families didn&#39;t even fight in WWII so asking me to verify is kind of impossible, but verily do not such people exist who can substantiate the claims that &quot;ze final solution&quot; occurred? </p>

<li>“. . . the discovery of the Jewish virus is one of the greatest revolutions that has taken place in the world. The battle in which we are engaged today is of the same sort as the battle waged, during the last century, by Pasteur and Koch. How many diseases have their origin in the Jewish virus! ... We shall regain our health only be eliminating the Jew.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Apparently &quot;eliminating&quot; = moving.</p>

<ul>
<li>On 12 December 1941, five days after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour, Adolf Hitler made a revealing speech in Berlin to Nazi leaders, both Gauleiter and Reichleiter; and Josef Goebbels recorded in his diary what had been said: &quot;With regard to the Jewish Question the Fuehrer is determined to make a clean sweep. He prophesized that if they brought about another world war, they would experience their annihilation. This was no empty talk. The world war is here. The annihilation of the Jews must be the necessary consequence. This question is to be viewed without sentimentality. We’re not to have sympathy with the Jews, but only sympathy with our German people. If the German people has again now sacrificed around 160,000 dead in the eastern campaign, the instigators of this bloody conflict will have to pay for it with their own lives.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>His top men saw it differently than you, apparently. </p>

<p>I understand wanting to get the numbers right, but the whole &quot;Aww, Hitler wasn&#39;t THAT bad.&quot; thing confuses me. </p>

<p>As the tanks were rolling in (after Hitler pleaded to the world to stop the massacre of innocent Germans by Jewish Polish partisans) the partisans killed 5800+ of these citizens: men, women, and kids... in A DAY. </p>

<p>Another part of history conveniently covered up...like the Communist Bolshevik Jew slaughters of Christians...to the tune of 60 MILLION PEOPLE under Uncle Joe Stalin. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You never presented me with any evidence to prove your claims as I requested.  So I was curious to see what kind of man would deny the holocaust and laud Hitler as a savior.  To see that he&#39;s a racist and a homophobe shouldn&#39;t have been surprising I suppose.</p>

<p>Holocaust denialism has been debunked many times over, much of which is collected here:</p>

<p><a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Holocaust_denial">http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Holocaust_denial</a></p>

<p>It seems strange that if Hitler was merely trying to create a safe Germany for Germans that it would require conquering most of Europe and pushing into Africa and Russia.  I doubt most of those conquered viewed the Germans as liberators.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus Christ&#39;s message of love, peace, forgiveness and for the eradication of dogma is still misconstrued because morons can&#39;t realize the new and old testament books are COMPLETELY irreconcillable.  The real conspiracy is zionist jews turning christians into zionists vis-a-vis their invention of this absolutely ridiculous concept of &quot;judeo-christianity&quot; to turn christians against muslims and fight their dirty little wars for them all while forgetting that Christ never advocated for war, retribution or violence.  This is why he was murdered (sentenced by his own people and executed by romans).  He was, in actuality,  a rebel and major threat to the religious and political establishment during his lifetime, as is his message to this day.  &quot;Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.&quot;  Have you ever read the new testament?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a former Christian who has been losing my faith due to seeing more and more contradictions in the Bible. Since you seem to see things so well, please help me by explaining the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How is envying your neighbor a sin but God is described as a jealous God? Why is it sin for us but not for God? And how can a jealous God also be a just God? The two characteristics are contradictions. </p></li>
<li><p>How can a God that IS Love (not just has love but is the source of all love according to the bible) also command genocide? He literally commanded his chosen people to kill every man, woman, child, and animal from other tribes, often so the Israelites could take their land. And how do we reconcile these actions with Jesus&#39; command to turn the other cheek?</p></li>
<li><p>How does prayer make any sense with billions of children everyday starving, dieing, and even being raped, tortured, and enslaved as many of them cry out to God? Yet somehow he answers the prayers of American housewives to find their missing car keys or for someone to get that promotion or to be healed of their cold? Why does geography seem to effect the power/priority of our prayers? And why do we not see more documented evidence of God&#39;s supernatural intervention in the form of miracles? Did he just stop performing them after biblical times? </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Bonus Question: How did Noah spread specific animals to distant parts of the globe after the flood without leaving archeological evidence of the journey? Koalas and kangaroos to Australia? Wolves to the arctic circle? Land Turtles to the Galapagos? Etc.

<li><p>Agreed.  This is why I say the ot and nt are irreconcilable.  Jesus essentially turned judaism on its head and started a new religion.</p></li>
<li><p>We don&#39;t reconcile these differences.  That is the whole point of my post above.  Judeo-christianity is a farce.  &quot;And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will burst the skins—and the wine is destroyed, so are the skins.” (Mark 2:22)</p></li>
<li><p>Prayer is a chance to give grace and thanks.  Not to selfishly ask for trivial or even important things, because free will means God will not intercede in any event.  It is the only way we will ever truly have free will.  Also, I don&#39;t believe in the old testament stories like noah&#39;s ark.  None of them are grounded in any true history.  They are metaphorical stories.</p></li>

<li>We are jealous of that which we are not entitled to, which is wrong. God is jealous of not receiving praise and worship that is rightfully his as our creator, when people bow down and start babbling nonsense to stones that they carved to look like things.</li>
</ol>

<p>That is how it is not contradicting and it IS just, because he has every right to be angry with us for being unfaithful.</p>

<p>We have no right to be mad at our neighbors success.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How can a God that IS Love (not just has love but is the source of all love according to the bible) also command genocide?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a fallen world wherein everybody dies, and everybody has the chance to follow God, so when people are not following God and are also threatening to destroy all of Gods people they are making the choice themselves to go against him.</p>

<p>Had they not set themselves against him, there would be no need for those people to be destroyed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He literally commanded his chosen people to kill every man, woman, child, and animal from other tribes, often so the Israelites could take their land.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you don&#39;t kill the women and children, then they keep around all that evil garbage that you were trying to eliminate by killing all the men, who pass their ideologies on to their women and children.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And how do we reconcile these actions with Jesus&#39; command to turn the other cheek?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jesus is not commanding individuals to allow themselves to be beat up, but to respond to hostility with Christian kindness, turning the other cheek rather than throwing a punch back.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How does prayer make any sense with billions of children everyday starving, dieing, and even being raped, tortured, and enslaved as many of them cry out to God?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pray is done with the understanding that everything is according to Gods will, and that just because you pray for something doesn&#39;t mean that you will receive it. It&#39;s much deeper than just asking God for personal favors, it&#39;s communication, it&#39;s supposed to further your spiritual relationship and discernment.</p>

<p>If the whole world prayed every day, then maybe nobody would be raping children because people would all be knowing about how it&#39;s wrong and not to do it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yet somehow he answers the prayers of American housewives to find their missing car keys or for someone to get that promotion or to be healed of their cold?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes what seem to be frivolous prayers are answered and sometimes they are not, sometimes people crying out for help are answered, sometimes they are not.</p>

<p>I do not know why , nobody can, but it doesn&#39;t show faith to not believe prayer is effectual just because literally every single pray isn&#39;t directly answered in the exact manner you feel it should be.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why does geography seem to effect the power/priority of our prayers?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does it? Do you have empirical data to prove this, or is it just how you feel from your perspective?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And why do we not see more documented evidence of God&#39;s supernatural intervention in the form of miracles?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You need to see miracles to believe?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did he just stop performing them after biblical times?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I would just say that they aren&#39;t directly &quot;miracles&quot; as they were in the bible, like a person having their cataracts clear up after having been diagnosed as having cataracts that would never clear.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t see every miracle because you don&#39;t know how they&#39;re occurring every day.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How did Noah spread specific animals to distant parts of the globe after the flood without leaving archeological evidence of the journey?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What archeological evidence would have been left of animals migrating like that? There is in some cases, like with Camels.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Koalas and kangaroos to Australia?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is it alleged by the scientific community that Kangaroos &quot;evolved&quot; from? Do they have a sound explanation as to how Kangaroos came to be where they are?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wolves to the arctic circle?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wolves are all over the planet, clearly showing that some animals are able to survive in many more climates and zones, and can spread out far more easily than other types of animals who are not as capable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Land Turtles to the Galapagos?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Land turtles are all over the planet, so I don&#39;t see how this is a point of contention.</p>

<p>I suspect that after the flood there was much more land you could traverse to go continent to continent, whereas those pieces of land have now become entirely submerged under the ocean.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Extra bonus if you can explain how he got some of every species on earth to one place</p>
</blockquote>

<p>God? This is the most basic part of the whole thing, God made the animals come to him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and managed to fit them all and their 40 day food supply into a single wooden boat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The inside dimensions of the boat are greater than what is allowed by the external dimensions, through the use of a temporal dimensional space.</p>

<p>If people that don&#39;t believe in God believe that aliens can open up dimensional portals and time rifts to come visit Earth, why do you find it so inconceivable for the creator of the universe to manipulate his universe?</p>

<p>Turning the other cheek</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, you&#39;re talking about what christ taught vs what modern christianity teaches. Two completely different things. I&#39;m talking about modern christianity, the institution. It is corrupt and broken. The teachings of Jesus are quite wonderful. The modern, grossly distorted version of it backed by the institutions of authority bears almost no resemblance to the original. It has become a tool of control, brought in to the folds of authority to neutralize the threat it poses. Sort of a &quot;controlled opposition&quot; in a way, but it took hundreds of years to accomplish. </p>

<p>Where are you getting this statistical figure from?</p>

<p>Are you just making up stats to fit your own world view because you&#39;ve actually never been in any church service ever?</p>

<p>Maybe you should attend a few different denominations and actually sit in on a bible lesson from a speaker, and then ask some of the congregants afterwards if they agree with everything.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>their congregations who never pick up the bible themselves?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, you know this how? Last I checked, everybody at church last I attended opened their bible and read for themselves what the speaker was reading.</p>

<p>Also, have you heard of the first service for remembrance where people who feel moved stand and share from the Bible and how what they are sharing is currently relevant to them and how it can help everybody else as well?</p>

<p>How about you actually go to a non-denominational Christian Brethren church before you start making broad sweeping generalizations about hundreds of millions of people.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen it too, and you are absolutely right, in that there are people who never read the Bible themselves, but listen to what they&#39;re told the Bible says from other people claiming to be authorities on the scriptures.</p>

<p>95% of preachers do not teach blind obedience to authorities, however, and you have no empirical data to support that &quot;statistic&quot;.</p>

<p>Make claims all day long, but don&#39;t try and back them with made up stats.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I saw how I was rejected when I questioned things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t church or Christian exclusive, this happens anywhere you question a person who doesn&#39;t want to be questioned or think about why they believe what they believe or why they behave the way they do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I saw how much I was hated when it came out I wasn&#39;t straight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a shame. You should be straight, but I&#39;m not going to hate you for not being straight, and nobody should. Love the sinner not the sin.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How it&#39;s just a gossip club that doesn&#39;t give a fuck about the teachings of christ.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, there are scores of churches who operate this way, and Christians who pay absolutely no regard to their supposed beliefs.</p>

<p>This is a problem I and many other Christians are dealing with, but nothing to lose faith over.</p>

<p>Good for them and their problems, I&#39;m not a pat of that so I&#39;m not going to let that bring me down.</p>

<p>Noam Chomsky? The attention to detail and quality of research are hallmarks of his deconstruction of certain conspiracy theories, or at least some of the elements of certain theories (e.i. propaganda and media manipulation by the powers that be). </p>

<p>While there are a lot of theories out there that are as you describe, with questionable leaps of faith in the analysis, a few do have logic grounded in reality and facts. Even a broken clock is right twice a day, and when through the noise and bullshit emerges patterns of suspicious behavior, deception, manipulation and violence, you have to at least ask questions. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe I am arrogant enough to know THE truth, but I do feel that when looking at the facts and the behavior over time of the entities at play, it is more and more apparent that for one reason or another individuals are not told what is really going on. </p>

<p>In just the last 20 years we have seen at least one declaration of war based on lies, with knowledge of said lies by the deciders. We have confirmed the long held suspicion that we were on constant watch by the power that be, our phones, computers, emails, financial activities, movements, even thoughts as of late, nothing seems to be out of reach for them.</p>

<p>I for one, do not think it is stupid to question the narrative. Not because of lizard people, but because they have repeatedly demonstrated to abuse their position, to lie to us, to kill and murder for profit. Does the saying &quot;fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me&quot; not apply to them as well, or the always popular on Reddit &quot;Once a cheater, always a cheater&quot;.</p>

<p>This is why I hold the positions I do, because I have questions, and so far I did not like the answers. All I&#39;m asking of others, is to at least entertain some of these questions, I&#39;m not a zealot asking for faith. </p>

<p>That&#39;s completely untrue and if it&#39;s really what you think then you&#39;ve been deceived and it&#39;s as simple as that. If you&#39;d done something bad and people found out about it, what&#39;s the first thing you&#39;d do? If it was only a handful you&#39;d say they were crazy, and if it was more you&#39;d find the craziest ones, parade them around, and use them to ridicule everyone else. The very fact that they have been doing this for over a decade now is part of the reason they stink of guilt. If I show you a peer-reviewed piece of scientific research which says there was nano-thermite in the WTC buildings, then only in the mind <em>of a madman</em> is it an acceptable response to ignore the science and ridicule the man/company/organisation/dog. What has happened to society is what Erich Fromm predicted would happen. It has gone completely fucking crazy. So crazy, that the sane people are the ones considered to be nuts.</p>

<p>This is another tactic that shills use a lot. They try to falsely associate independent beliefs such as those you just mentioned. Do you think believing Jews control the world is the same thing as believing the world is flat? Do you really think that?

<p>You can&#39;t be serious if you&#39;re claiming that even most of the ideas proposed by conspiracy theorists (as popularly defined) are backed by good science.

<p>Those words are commonly used in similar ways by most people, so I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;re getting so pissed about it. Do some people misuse words, sure.

<p>Conspiracy theorists, such as on this very subreddit, do such things quite voluntarily, and a lot believe multiple conspiracies at once from all over the spectrum.

<p>In Germany, 90 percent of people are conspiracy theorists (by your own definition of the term), so what you seem to be implying is that those 90 percent of people deride themselves by accusing themselves of being conspiracy theorists, yes?</p>

<p><strong>In its January 2011 issue, the German magazine Welt der Wunder published the results of a poll conducted by the Emnid Institute on 1,005 respondents. The poll indicated that almost 90 percent of the Germans are convinced that the government of the United States is not telling the whole truth about the September 11 attacks</strong></p>

<p>I sense sarcasm, which is strange, given that Mossad were caught literally red-handed, filming the attacks, while disco &quot;dancing&quot;, &quot;hugging&quot; and &quot;celebrating&quot;.

Oh, and one of them repeatedly failed a lie detector test.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here’s something for you to entertain.</p>

<p>You know about spiritual awakening? I had that, woke up, noticed that I exist only in this moment and that my consciousness is not limited to my body. Found happiness and peace beyond measure. It’s the real deal. My five cents is that your true nature is the one thing that the PTB don’t want you to know about.</p>

<p>Ok, so what? It gives credence to that we’re living in an inside out spiritual world. Absolutely everything is inside of consciousness and made from it. The materialistic worldview of “everything is made from dead stuff called matter” is a major part of the PTB’s bluff.</p>

<p>Ok, get to the point? If we’re ready to entertain that this is a spiritual world, we might be also willing to consider the ancient texts that point to year 2012 as the culmination point, a change of an era. Yes, nothing happened overnight, but that’s not how things work, we know that.</p>

<p>Now, according to the ancient texts and many contemporary sources, what we’re currently experiencing is the death struggle of the old regime. This new period does not energetically support the old selfish modus operandi and it cannot survive no matter how hard it tries. Day by day it gets harder for the old masters to carry out their shenanigans and hence the frantic acceleration of their plans.</p>

<p>And if nothing else, remember this, you are the Universe experiencing itself. Your thoughts are commands to yourself. Choose them wisely and demand for a future that you want to live in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Become interested in experience.</p>

<p>Notice that this moment never goes anywhere. Even though the sun sets and the clock’s dials move, we are always experiencing life in the now. Time is an illusion created by the mind.</p>

<p>Notice that that even though the sensations and thoughts in your body change, the one that feels and hears them does not. Ask yourself who is this one that feels the sensations and hears the thoughts.</p>

<p>Notice that the world around you is know by someone. Ask yourself who is this someone that knows what is seen, heard and felt outside of your body.</p>

<p>Dive into self-inquiry. Question all concepts about who you are. Once the search comes to an end, you know you’ve arrived.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Meditation is an excellent practice, but in my experience self-inquiry is the shortcut to self-realization. Dive headfirst into the question ”Who am I?” Demand to know who you are. Don’t take a thought for an answer, experience is all that matters.</p>

<p>Waking up is very similar to waking up in a lucid dream. You both feel and remember that you had had just forgotten that you are actually the dreamer of both the body and the world. And so is everyone else. We are truly One.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a smoke sesh with a young friend of mine the other morning and we started talking about the bible. Long story short and after some serious mind-explosions, we made some huge discoveries about the world and what it meant about us.
Given that God is real and an infinite creator, his final creation was Adam, within whom he put a bit of himself, a soul, granting sentience. To test his loyalty and gratitude to his creator, God made the tree of knowledge and Eve to tempt him to eat of it. Adam did eat of it, gaining the knowledge of the seven sins. He suddenly lusted after Eve and had sex with her, which is why they covered themselves with leaves when God came to them later. Sex lead to children, and here we are today.
But what&#39;s the alternative? If he hadn&#39;t eaten the fruit, he would have never learned what sex was, or ever had the urge to perform the act. Were we even supposed to exist if Adam had passes the test? Is humanity a plague on Earth as punishment for Adam eating the fruit? Would the Earth simply be better off without us?
I know this is way different than the introspection you talked about, but if we&#39;re all part of Adam, then we&#39;re all part of God, and you reminded me of this story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can think of each individual as a whirlpool in an infinite stream of consciousness. Just as a whirlpool in a stream of water is made just from the dynamics of the water, so is each human whirlpool made just from the dynamics of consciousness. Your particular whirlpool can only experience the information that is contained in it. Why I cannot feel your pain is for the same reason why you cannot experience my world. </p>

<p>Your body and your brain is how the whirlpool looks like from the outside. How you experience life is how it looks like from the inside. Science is looking for the source of consciousness from the brain, but they&#39;ll never find it from there. It&#39;s like seeing a lighting bolt and concluding that the bolt caused the atmospheric discharge, and not vice versa.</p>

<p>Evidence is stacking up to support this idealistic world view. Has been from the moment when we found the quantum world around a hundred years ago (I can wholeheartedly recommend Bernando Kastrup&#39;s work for an easily approachable introduction to the topic).  </p>

<p>However the only valid way to study consciousness is from the first perspective, that is from your point of view. It&#39;s also the only route to personal liberation from dissatisfaction. Become interested in who knows your body and the world around you. If you are just your brain, who knows your body and knows, hears and feels the world around you?</p>

<p>And what happends after death? Nobody knows, but it could be that your particular whirlpool breaks up, but nothing is lost, just the dynamics change. Perhaps the ripples of the old whirlpool start a new one down the stream.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion self-defence is warranted when someone infringes on the free will of another.</p>

<p>One who has fully realized his true nature could not harm another sentient being. On the other hand when consciousness <em>deeply</em> forgets who it is do we end up with individuals like the ones currently causing harm on this planet.</p>

<p>We can still see ourselves in them and them in ourselves. This is what unconditional love means and what Jesus meant when he said on the cross: &quot;forgive them for they do not know what they are doing&quot; (all religions contain parts of the truth).</p>

<p>In the largest scheme of things everything is exactly as should be (this includes the resistance to oppression). Ram Dass has beatifully put it as: &quot;we&#39;re all just walking each other home&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The TPP, police murderings... when is it going to become obvious to people? Look at how glued we are onto crap television with scripted, irrelevant information funded by major corporations being fed to us. Our news is crap, nobody knows fucking anything about what&#39;s actually going on. All we know is what they tell us, useless information. </p>

<p>We are required to work jobs for shit pay so we can barely scrape by, meanwhile there are people with billion dollar houses ruling us.</p>

<p>We are fed drugs that rip apart inspiration and personality and demonize the ones that are the most beneficial for us to evolve. And then we arrest those who take the wrong drugs. It&#39;s bullshit, we&#39;re at war with them, for fucks sake. And we&#39;ve spent trillions of dollars on it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a fucking wonder anyone is starving on this godforsaken planet.  </p>

<p>Our leaders continue to manipulate the system so they can lie, cheat and steal, and silence anybody who attempts to take a small step towards their power. God knows what else they&#39;re doing.</p>

<p>Our freedom is at stake, and it&#39;s coming real fast.  When the fuck are we going to do something? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part of the grim reality of the situation is that WE (the millions), while we are certainly being manipulated and subjugated, we only exist because of this system. It&#39;s unpleasant, but it&#39;s true. There is such a huge population because &quot;they&quot; made it possible with their slave labor here and there modern medicine there and as a result, there is a swollen population. Why? Because WE are livestock. From cradle to grave. We are born, monetized, indoctrinated and milked until such time as we are useless. Then, we&#39;re (some of us) disenfranchised. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so ugly, but also why it&#39;s so easy for us to be corralled and used this way. It will only ever get worse. Until there is some (unlikely) sea change, then sit back and open a beer and watch some football/kardashians/news (doesn&#39;t matter). </p>

If you thoroughlt scrutinize the different events that are routinely attributed to conspiracies, you&#39;ll find that there&#39;s a lot more reasons for the events than just evil people wanting to be evil. Also, to claim every shooting, terror attack, etc. is a false flag is farfetched, to say the lease.

    <div class="md"><p>The example here though was that somehow &#39;they&#39; managed to pull off 9/11 with precision, down to explosives and faking people on planes and shuttling people to and fro, the works.</p>

<p>And then &#39;they&#39; fake a school shooting, a far simpler affair, and they promptly fuck up on every possible level with crisis actors, fake conga lines and whatnot, as people around here argue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m opening up a van of worms here, but how is there no way it can be true? Is someone seeking to cause the attacks not capable of hijacking a plane? Is it the way that they fell? Because the way they fell is very well explained by the guy who designed the buildings, or the sisters, as he called them. Also, the motivation doesn&#39;t make sense to me. Some people who were already loaded needed an excuse to get into Iraq/Afghanistan to get more loaded? If they&#39;re that powerful they don&#39;t need much of an excuse. As well, why would they need to place bombs in the buildings? Those things could have <em>easily</em> fallen from two 747&#39;s. The guy who built then admittedly said that they were built with enough force to withstand a 707 at the time, but there was just no way to accommodate anything bigger. And how could you? How could you make a building that tall, with that much floor space hold off a 747 at full speed filled with jet fuel? As well, the risk of getting caught placing all those bombs is not worth the reward as I argue that the attacks themselves, even without the planes going down, would have been enough reason to go to war.</p>

<p>I used to believe full well that the attacks were caused by the government, but after setting aside my pride, and falling back on the tenants of what makes something true i.e. extraordinary claims requiring extra ordinary evidence, there&#39;s just no way that you can say that the conspiracy theories are true. There&#39;s not a single smoking gun. And if there were some serious evidence then somebody reputable would notice it. Its not that everyone who doesn&#39;t agree is just a sheeple, its that there&#39;s not enough there to prove anything. That was a lot of stuff, so my apologies for that, but that&#39;s my position. Its an extremely compelling way of thinking, but alas, largely false I allege. </p>

<p>In what universe? Throughout history, people have been brutal to each other in ways that governments rarely dare. Go back and look up statistics on murder and mayhem in past decades or centuries, and tell me that characterizing humanity as passive cattle is in any way accurate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can think of each individual as a whirlpool in an infinite stream of consciousness. Just as a whirlpool in a stream of water is made just from the dynamics of the water, so is each human whirlpool made just from the dynamics of consciousness. Your particular whirlpool can only experience the information that is contained in it. Why I cannot feel your pain is for the same reason why you cannot experience my world. </p>

<p>Your body and your brain is how the whirlpool looks like from the outside. How you experience life is how it looks like from the inside. Science is looking for the source of consciousness from the brain, but they&#39;ll never find it from there. It&#39;s like seeing a lighting bolt and concluding that the bolt caused the atmospheric discharge, and not vice versa.</p>

<p>Evidence is stacking up to support this idealistic world view. Has been from the moment when we found the quantum world around a hundred years ago (I can wholeheartedly recommend Bernando Kastrup&#39;s work for an easily approachable introduction to the topic).  </p>

<p>However the only valid way to study consciousness is from the first perspective, that is from your point of view. It&#39;s also the only route to personal liberation from dissatisfaction. Become interested in who knows your body and the world around you. If you are just your brain, who knows your body and knows, hears and feels the world around you?</p>

<p>And what happends after death? Nobody knows, but it could be that your particular whirlpool breaks up, but nothing is lost, just the dynamics change. Perhaps the ripples of the old whirlpool start a new one down the stream.</p>

<li>“. . . the discovery of the Jewish virus is one of the greatest revolutions that has taken place in the world. The battle in which we are engaged today is of the same sort as the battle waged, during the last century, by Pasteur and Koch. How many diseases have their origin in the Jewish virus! ... We shall regain our health only be eliminating the Jew.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Apparently &quot;eliminating&quot; = moving.</p>

<ul>
<li>On 12 December 1941, five days after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour, Adolf Hitler made a revealing speech in Berlin to Nazi leaders, both Gauleiter and Reichleiter; and Josef Goebbels recorded in his diary what had been said: &quot;With regard to the Jewish Question the Fuehrer is determined to make a clean sweep. He prophesized that if they brought about another world war, they would experience their annihilation. This was no empty talk. The world war is here. The annihilation of the Jews must be the necessary consequence. This question is to be viewed without sentimentality. We’re not to have sympathy with the Jews, but only sympathy with our German people. If the German people has again now sacrificed around 160,000 dead in the eastern campaign, the instigators of this bloody conflict will have to pay for it with their own lives.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>His top men saw it differently than you, apparently. </p>

<p>I understand wanting to get the numbers right, but the whole &quot;Aww, Hitler wasn&#39;t THAT bad.&quot; thing confuses me. </p>

<p>I get opposing Zionism but I&#39;ve yet to see any convincing holocaust denialism.  I doubt your sources are any better than what I&#39;ve seen but I&#39;d take some links.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guess you never heard of the Bromberg Massacre,  hmm? </p>

<p>As the tanks were rolling in (after Hitler pleaded to the world to stop the massacre of innocent Germans by Jewish Polish partisans) the partisans killed 5800+ of these citizens: men, women, and kids... in A DAY. </p>

<p>Another part of history conveniently covered up...like the Communist Bolshevik Jew slaughters of Christians...to the tune of 60 MILLION PEOPLE under Uncle Joe Stalin. </p>

<p>The 190,000 World Jewry lost (according to the IRC) is <em>terrible</em> but doesn&#39;t even compare numerically. Not close. Indeed, almanacs of the time show World Jewry numbers staying the same or growing. </p>

<p>Tl;Dr There&#39;s no business like Shoah business. </p>
