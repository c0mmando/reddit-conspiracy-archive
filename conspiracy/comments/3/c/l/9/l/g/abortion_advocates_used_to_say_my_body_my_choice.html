       They've managed to push the 'herd immunity' narrative to the point where the average person feels like you are physically assaulting them if you so much as question the contents of a needle you are about to be injected with.   They are masters of opinion manipulation.

       My son caught whooping cough from a recently vaccinated friend of his...we treated it with Vitamin C and it was the best solution to help him with his symptoms. And hey, guess what...we didn't "lynch" the family nor consider him a "threat"...but I, as a parent, now have direct evidence of the truth of this article. This is where the whooping cough outbreaks are coming from...some of them at least.

       Polio was eradicated because of vaccines right? Nevermind that whole SV40 thing, or that diseases with symptoms

       like polio still exist.

       That thing you said about bullshit from admittedly false reports, being misguided, and refusing to see anything but the same skewed bullshit applies to you as well, like it or not.

       It applies to me too. This is why I usually prefer to make up my own mind about an issue after I've satisfied my own intellectual curiosity regarding sides and arguments. Any viewpoint is worth entertaining, if at least for just a new perspective.

       Of course medical decisions should be a choice.  Sometimes those choices are difficult, especially when it comes to vaccines and abortion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most important thing about choices is that they be well-informed, guided by conscience and backed by objective facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The source of said facts must always be considered.  Complete transparency is a must. Health topics have astronomical financial interests tied to them, that weave throughout an economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are vaccines a good thing? In theory, of course.  And it seems obvious.  But do the facts behind the modern vaccine industry support this theory?
      </p>
      <p>
       Would vaccine preventable diseases have remained on the decline had vaccinations not become the norm?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are current vaccine formulations effective against the strains of the diseases they are meant to eradicate?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are vaccines produced ethically, without the sacrifice of human fetal cells, and not tainted with substances that can cause harm to the person's health?
      </p>
      <p>
       How do the health risks of actually contracting that disease compare to any possible adverse reaction to that vaccination?
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of all, why is it wrong to ask any of these questions?
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccines should be a choice, and always an informed choice.  If complete vaccine compliance is the goal, you need the best possible product for the job, not the most lucrative one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honest, objective sources show that the current state of vaccination industry is driven by financial gain rather than support of the public's health.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that is a tragedy, for everyone.

       Well put!

      <p>
       I'll say it again: My spouse had a Leading Edge Neurologist back in the '80's that said a Live Vaccine from our Child could harm His
       <em>
        patient
       </em>
       and we had to
       <em>
        decide or consider
       </em>
       delayed Medical
       <em>
        CONSENT
       </em>
       to not IMMUNIZE our off-spring to protect his client!
      </p>
      <p>
       We chose to
       <em>
        medically delay
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a long ass story and IMHO the delay had not one damned thing to do with our daughters near death experience some weeks later and her consequent Immune Supressed System 20 years after the fact.

       I'm not a scientist or have anything to offer than common sense, but please remember that President FDR was almost killed as a child because of Polio. I'm not endorsing his policies, just picking a well known figure to demonstrate everyone was affected by this.

       It wasn't defeated through the vaccinations, and those vaccinations gave many people Polio including my own mother. There were actually outbreaks caused by the vaccination. Deaths from the disease decreased more the year before the vaccine than the year after it was introduced.

       No, no, no. You have got it all wrong. The point is that the spots may kill someone, and killing a grown up is generally much worse than killing a baby.

       Chicken Pox and Measles are not going to kill healthy people in the First World.  However vaccines are known to be causing Crib Death and damaging infant mortality rates, the science shows that the more vaccines a nation gives the worse it's infant mortality will be.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is one way to die from Chicken Pox, it's if you take a Big Pharma medication such as Ibuprofen or Aspirin, but that's not a reason to vaccinate against it, just don't be silly and take Ibuprofen or Aspirin when you have Chicken Pox, your body knows exactly how to deal with Chicken Pox all by itself.

       People do die from the Measles, as I am sure you are aware. Vaccines do kill people also, so I think they should be left up to the parents, pretty much. But, there are big differences between pregnancy and disease. If you do not vaccinate your kids, they may endanger other children. This information needs to be public in my opinion.

       It's not an opt in society, friends.  If you can't take the risks of being in public, just as I do, you probably shouldn't ever leave your house.  I don't owe anyone the steep, steep cost of injecting myself with unproven, risky "vaccines." Prove (independently, through the scientific method) that vaccines are both perfectly safe and perfectly effective, then we can talk.  As long as no one will claim responsibility for the potential future damage I can incur through UNPROVEN vaccination, it's not gonna happen.

       Studied multiple times by the manufacturers themselves.  Of course they say their own products are safe and effective.  I'm asking you to prove it.  Through independent, double blind verifications that vaccines are safe and effective.  The lack of this for any vaccine is astounding, and speaks volumes as to why.
      </p>
      <p>
       Big asbestos also had many studies proudly proclaiming their products were perfectly safe and effective.  The same is true of big tobacco.  You're a fool if you believe a marketing and PR team has your best interests and safety ever at heart.

       The burden of proof is on you, you've made the claim they're not safe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please provide a credible peer reviewed study in a high impact factor medical journal saying they're not safe.

       It's absolutely by the manufacturers themselves.  That great revolving door with "regulators" helps only the manufacturers.  Double blind studies have NEVER occurred for one perfectly clear reason.  The claims aren't supportable with evidence.  Of they were, they would be.  First in animals, then in humans.  They don't stand on their own merits.  This game is entirely rigged by the manufacturers.  The vaccines courts are an absolute joke.  They use every trick in the book to maximize profits and remove liability for damages caused by their products.  No accountability to anyone but their shareholders.
      </p>
      <p>
       They can't prove they work.  They can't prove they are safe.  And if and when you're injured by their products, good luck.  They accept no responsibility for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's nice that you still believe big pharma is out to help you, and is working in your best interest.  For a healthier population.  Yet after being caught countless times conspiring to harm you, hiding studies that prove the drugs and vaccines they're hawking are ineffective at best, and at worst, highly damaging and/or fatal.  But this time they really aren't doing that to you.  Trust us.  We can't back it up with evidence, but this time we've got it right.  Seriously.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On February 22, 2011 the U.S. Supreme Court shielded drug companies from all liability for harm caused by vaccines mandated by government when companies could have made a safer vaccine.
       </p>
       <p>
        From now on, drug companies selling vaccines in America will not be held accountable by a jury of our peers in a court of law if those vaccines brain damage us but could have been made less toxic.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you get paralyzed by a flu shot or your child has a serious reaction to a vaccine required for school and becomes learning disabled, epileptic, autistic, asthmatic, diabetic or mentally retarded, you are on your own.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You have zero legal recourse in this perverted system, but really, just keep trusting the same people who have willingly and maliciously harmed you time and time again.
      </p>
      <p>
       The burden of proof lies with the manufacturers (and you) claiming they are perfectly safe.  The fuck outta here with this big pharma talking points bullshit...

       Correct, the AAP are the same ones who came up with the idea to push Ritalin onto children who show "symptoms" of ADHD (a fictitious disease invented by the drug companies), they are certainly not credible and no parent should trust them.

       Getting kids hooked on hardcore amphetamines is unbelievably reckless.  I'm glad my parents said no when the doctors tried to push these drugs on me.  Life is far better without chemical adulteration.  It is absolutely unnecessary.

       You've got to be kidding me, you've posted a link to the AAP, you think they have any credibility?  These are the nutters who push Ritalin onto children who show "symptoms" of ADHD (a fictitious disease invented by the drug companies).  Is this a children's health organization that parents should really trust?
      </p>
      <p>
       The cover of the AAP breastfeeding guide featured the name and logo of Ross Products, the company who make infant formula containing over 50% sugar, any doctor or medical organization that recommends a diet of corn syrup, soy protein, sugar and cheap oils to an infant should be arrested for malpractice.
      </p>
      <p>
       The organization is a disgrace to medicine and obviously just another tentacle of Big Pharma.

       There's more to
       <em>
        cell shedding
       </em>
       , that an Neurologist back in the mid '80's was
       <em>
        protecting his patient from
       </em>
       due to live Vaccines!
      </p>
      <p>
       This Neurologist, back in the early mid-eighties was PROTECTING his patient from a Live Vaccine, from an outside source and the Doctor applied the brakes to inform his patient.
      </p>
      <p>
       This Neurologist knew that injecting his immune compromised patient with heavy doses of steroids could harm his patient if said patient was
       <strong>
        EXPOSED
       </strong>
       to LIVE Vaccines!
      </p>
      <p>
       Who knew that shit in the '80's?

      <p>

       It is, indeed my Theory that the Virus incubated and jumped the Blood Brain Barrier and or the placenta.

       Our third child was born in Hospital and

       away and was shot, probed and poked, unlike our first two.

       I have no problem with you not paying taxes, at that point you should no longer be allowed to use our roads, our water or our power which is all subsidized by tax payer money.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then, you should have to pay the full price for gas because the subsidy no longer applies to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's all A ok with me, then when you realize property taxes you pay are no where near enough for private school and most private schools also require vaccines you can stop being a really stupid person and join the rest of society.

       There is no way for you to not gain from free quality education, it leads to lower crime rates higher property values which leads to more people moving to the area and more businesses which leads to more jobs and a more stable local economy and higher standard of living.

       Cause they can't.  They buy (or more likely, shill what they're told to) big pharma PR talking points as truth.  If the shit was supportable, they'd post the fuck out of those studies.  The reason why independent, double blind verifications are NEVER performed is quite clear.

       There are no such studies. If there are, they are probably behind a pay-wall. Your argument has a hard time holding up to scrutiny, friend.

       Short answer: First, it was not as rampant as the owned media and big pharma would have you believe.  Second, it was reclassified as "not-polio" as countless individuals were injected with SV40 laden "vaccines." Causing a massive spike in cancers.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Unbeknownst to most doctors, the polio-vaccine history involves a massive public health service makeover during an era when a live, deadly strain of poliovirus infected the Salk polio vaccines, and paralyzed hundreds of children and their contacts.  These were the vaccines that were supposedly responsible for the decline in polio from 1955 to 1961! But there is a more sinister reason for the “decline” in polio during those years; in 1955, a very creative re-definition of poliovirus infections was invented, to “cover” the fact that many cases of ”polio” paralysis had no poliovirus in their systems at all. While this protected the reputation of the Salk vaccine, it muddied the waters of history in a big way.
       </p>
       <p>
        Even during the peak epidemics, unifactorial poliovirus infection, resulting in long-term paralysis, was a low-incidence disease[2] that was falsely represented as a rampant and violent crippler by Basil O’Connor’s “March Of Dimes” advertising campaigns. At the same time as Basil O’Connor was pulling in 45 million dollars a year to fund the Salk vaccine development, scientists started to realize that other viruses like Coxsackie, echo and enteroviruses, could also cause polio.  They also discussed the fact that lead, arsenic, DDT, and other commonly-used neurotoxins, could identically mimic the lesions of polio. During the great epidemics in the United States, the pathology called polio was reversed by alternative medical doctors who attested to great success, using detoxification procedures available at the time – yet they were categorically ignored[3].
       </p>
       <p>
        Now it is admitted in the medical literature that other viruses can cause polio, yet few people on the street have any idea.
       </p>
       <p>
        Prior to 1954, the following undoubtedly hid behind the name “poliomyelitis”: Transverse Myelitis, viral or “aseptic” meningitis, Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS)- (what Franklin Delano Roosevelt had)[4], Chinese Paralytic syndrome, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, epidemic cholera, cholera morbus, spinal meningitis, spinal apoplexy, inhibitory palsy, intermittent fever, famine fever, worm fever, bilious remittent fever, ergotism, post-polio syndrome, acute flaccid paralysis(AFP).
       </p>
       <p>
        Included under the umbrella term “Acute Flaccid Paralysis” are Poliomyelitis, Transverse Myelitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, enteroviral encephalopathy, traumatic neuritis, Reye’s syndrome etc.

       I am not talking about herd immunity, am I ?
       <br/>
       I am talking about the case where people are around young babies (and it can happens quite often).
       <br/>
       Vaccines safe and effective ?
       <br/>
       Look at the smallpox. Thanks to a worldwide cooperation, it was completely eradicated from the surface of the earth. If you think vaccines aren't safe and effective, how can you explain the complete disappearance of smallpox ?

       Smallpox was the very first vaccine, implemented prior to the establishment of a vast profit-driven pharmaceutical industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the idea of vaccinations is a good one. I think the idea of a profit-driven pharmaceutical industry is a bad one. I think the latter hiding behind the former is a recipe for disaster.

       I suppose I could have included that information, but it didn't bear relevance to the point I was making about the relationship between the value of vaccines vs. the agendas of profit-driven big pharma.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it's actually the cowpox vaccine. The nominally functional premise was that getting vaccinated against cowpox (which the human immune system, in some subjects, could more easily establish immunity to) helped build/establish immunity to smallpox.

       This is interesting !
       <br/>
       Like everywhere, profit driven industry can achieve great things (for the consumer or the technological advancements) or can turn into a great trust leading to danger for the consumer (and a complete lack of advancements).
       <br/>
       Concerning big pharma, the idea is to be careful about lobbying and pressure on independent research. And we should focus on this, rather than rejecting all vaccines.

       Small Pox was not eradicated by vaccines, but by quarantine, in fact the vaccines were incredibly dangerous, this was admitted at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Polio was renamed as a large number of diseases, thereby reducing the amount of Polio diagnosis and making the vaccine appear a success.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's not forget that the the Merck vaccine chief admitted on video that the Polio vaccine was contaminated with a Cancer-Causing Virus, that is why the Cancer rates went epidemic after that vaccine.

       This is the logical end game. Overpopulation of the planet has been a major concern since the 1970s. We can't just keep growing into infinity. How do we maintain a reasonably sustainable global population? Reduce birth rates or increase death rates. Sterilization is generally viewed as the more "acceptable" route as opposed to gunning us all down in our sleep.

       I can see exactly why they are using the HPV jab to reduce female fertility all around the globe, we are under the illusion that we have a choice, we're not really meant to have, we are little more than farm animals to these people, the only way we can have a choice is to educate ourselves, like the anti-vaxxers have and allow ourselves to become more than just another sheep on a farm getting sheered and eventually put on a dinner plate.

       People refuse to open their eyes. President Clinton publically apologized to the nation for our RECENT sterilization programs. We haven't evolved to a higher consciousness since then. In fact, I think we've devolved into an even more evil world that revolves around deception. We don't even know who our enemies are anymore. We're all fighting each other. This thread is a case in point!

       You've got to be kidding, Rubella, Measles and Mumps are all mild short-term illnesses in the First World, it's unlikely that anyone would die from these unless they were already on their deathbed, and people on their deathbed need something to die from.  It's far better than leaving a whole generation mentally disabled from vaccines

       I totally agree with this statement. It is "my body, my choice."

       If you look at the situation from their (the nut jobs that want the government to force needles into you) perspective, they see "anti-vaxxers" as the nut jobs. They feel as though their body is being threatened by the mere thought that people like us are out there.

      <p>
       How so? Vaccinated people spread disease in the same way unvaccinated people do. If a vaccinated person comes into contact with a disease and has it on their hands, they will most likely spread it more than an unvaccinated person because the vaccinated person doesn't get sick or show symptoms, therefore spreading the disease further. Whereas an unvaccinated kid will come into contact with the disease, get sick, and be removed from public.

      <p>
       Yea. How was that eradicated? By giving a small amount of the disease to someone right? So then their own immune system would build up a tolerance to that disease and then be able to reject the other, would you agree?
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know that less than 50% of the vaccines of the 70 on the CA vaccines schedule work in that way? The others don't work like that. They use cell cultures like WI-38 (from aborted babies I shit you not), and just inject those cells into your body. The smallpox/polio "live virus" style of vaccination is not the norm and is not even being used to make new vaccines. But I'm sure you knew that being a vax freak right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Google WI-38 right now if you don't believe it.

       Dude. Vaccinated individuals create herd immunity which prevents these diseases from getting into our border. That's why we see no polio. I 100% understand how vaccines work and I thank God for them every day.

       It wasn't eradicated and the vaccine didn't work very well and was just as likely to give you smallpox as it was to protect you and it happened to coincide with the eradication of work houses, food inspection, eradication of cesspools, cleaning up of living conditions and hygiene in general. Big pharma loves this claim (which is a lie) along with the claim that the vaccine eliminated Polio (another huge fucking lie).

       Then they are not that "educated" and have their blinders on...polio was eliminated by the stroke of a pen by recalssifying the disease and other diseases that have similar symptoms to poliomyelitis...watch this if you think vaccination had anything to do with the so called "elimination" of Polio.

       I said it's possible. Why? Because a vaccinated person can have the disease on their person and carry it around and get other people sick in the exact same way an unvaccinated person can.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not true that a vaccinated person can have a virus on their body, say, if a sick person sneezed on them? Do vaccines somehow kill a virus that on the outside of your skin? Can you explain how it's done?

       It actually goes double for vaccines, since with them, you're mostly only responsible for one - yourself. With abortion, you're responsible for two. Plus, vaccination doesn't usually involve termination.

       Because an abortion doesn't threaten the lives of everyone else. When you catch the virus and it mutates, it renders the vaccine useless to vaccinated people. Your body and choice threatens them.

       How does it "threaten" them?...under this logic, if you walk into a hospital, you are voluntarily entering a "threatening" situation because of the possibility of getting a superbug that has been incubated and created in a hospital environment. Do you consider the emergency room a threat then? A visit to hospital to see a sick friend would be considered a life threating event.
      </p>
      <p>
       So under this logic nobody has the right to their own bodies or their children's bodies but the state, and the state will choose for you how you are to take care of yourself and your children...fuck that noise. The state can barely patrol a highway to keep it safe never mind get involved in the complex immmune systems of the human body.

       It's not a child until its been born. Most abortions take place at an early stage when it's just a clump of cells.

       If you didn't have the abortion, would a baby come into existence or not? The POINT of having an abortion is to stop a child from existing that would otherwise be born if you hadn't intervened.
       <a href="http://www.christiangallery.com/dismem.jpg">
        This is an abortion
       </a>
       . And even though I think abortions are disgusting, I believe that a woman should have the right to have one if she so chooses.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I beat off, my sperm doesn't grow into a baby if I don't make sure to get rid of it via a surgical procedure. To equate the two is a joke.

       I really don't care. Life is suffering, even if they arent' born yet. It's better to have a few moments of death in the womb as opposed to a lifetime of being raised by someone who didn't want you in the first place.

       No, it shouldn't. An abortion effects your own body. If you choose not to vaccinate your children, you are putting others at risk. It's as simple as that.

       No you are not. That is a big pharma lie/line. And an abortion does effect your body but it might have a little more effect on the body that is being vacuumed out of the woman's body...and that is my point...you can kill an unborn child through abortion (I am a pro-choice anti-abortionist!) but you can't choose how you take care of it after you choose NOT to terminate it's life cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are putting yourself at risk with all the side effects. Not to mention the flumist snorting vaccine makes you infectious for up to 6 weeks. Read the inserts.

       No Small Pox was eradicated and they no longer give the Small Pox vaccine as it's highly dangerous.  You're new to this topic I see, I'd recommend spending time studying it before jumping in with assumptions again.  By the way Small Pox was eradicated through quarantine, not vaccination.

       Studied multiple times by the manufacturers themselves.  Of course they say their own products are safe and effective.  I'm asking you to prove it.  Through independent, double blind verifications that vaccines are safe and effective.  The lack of this for any vaccine is astounding, and speaks volumes as to why.

       Big asbestos also had many studies proudly proclaiming their products were perfectly safe and effective.  The same is true of big tobacco.  You're a fool if you believe a marketing and PR team has your best interests and safety ever at heart.

       This is the logical end game. Overpopulation of the planet has been a major concern since the 1970s. We can't just keep growing into infinity. How do we maintain a reasonably sustainable global population? Reduce birth rates or increase death rates. Sterilization is generally viewed as the more "acceptable" route as opposed to gunning us all down in our sleep.

       Vaccine Safety is on the same level as Tobacco Science, they don't use real controls in the studies, avoiding mid/long term studies, they design the study to not even look for the known complications of the vaccine, the studies are by the manufacturer, the whole thing is a joke

       Vaccines do dramatically increase rates of miscarriage.  Also vaccines are the sole cause of Crib Death.

       You're wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       My spouse, with an Immune Compromised system, under heavy steroids for a severe MS
       <em>
        Flair Up
       </em>
       was Advised and Consulted because our Child was due for Immunization!
      </p>
      <p>
       The Doctor was, all the way back then
       <em>
        Protecting
       </em>
       his patient!
      </p>
      <p>
       We were granted a Medical
       <em>
        delay
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a huge process.
      </p>
      <p>
       She suffered horribly only hours after the shot. Now has, herself, an Compromised Immune System and her younger sibling has Full Blown Juvenile On-Set MS!
      </p>
      <p>
       She will be a Neurologist!
      </p>
      <p>
       THIS WAS IN mid 1980's!
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck with your HYPE!

       You have been gamed by the industry if you believe polio was "eliminated" by the vaccine. You cannot comprehend the extent of this ruse without the knowledge in this video.
