    <div class="md"><p>The Clintons are part of the global Satanic network. Duh. </p>

<p>If you check his history, Clinton grew up in the type of broken home that&#39;s a magnet for molestation and grooming for the Luciferians. Not as familiar with her back story, but they likely were paired for mutual benefit.</p>

<p>He was ambitious, brought into the CIA/Bush circles, helped them cover up the cocaine shipments in and out of Arkansas. That was what got him the WH gig.</p>

<p>All speculation of course. But the murders don&#39;t surprise me at all. That family is E V I L. Like most of our leaders nowadays, tragically. And maybe ever. </p>

<p>Shit speeding up fast. Expect some major chessboard moves against the masses in the next couple months, because they&#39;ve already started. </p>

<p>Yes, I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re right. I know several people on the verge of &quot;waking&quot; who are terrified by what they see on the fringes. Others who just don&#39;t want to get involved. But soon, all will have no choice. </p>
