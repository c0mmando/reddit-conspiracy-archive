<p>One clue supporting your hypothesis is that both Al Qaeda and ISIS sprang out of nowhere and became super-villains instantly and no one can stop them.  (i.e., complete bullshit)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are close to 100 various &quot;groups&quot; in the middle east that are classified as terrorist organizations by at least <em>some</em> nations. Each nation is free to choose for itself whether it thinks a certain group is or is not a terrorist group, and often times the UN and US will disagree.</p>

<p>Point being, there are plenty of groups that could be armed that are <em>not</em> currently classified as terrorist groups by the USA, or whichever country decided to arm them. For a while, they do the bidding of the supporting state. Only when they either go against the agenda, or are of no more use (or can be of even more use under a new label) do they become &quot;terrorist&quot; groups.</p>

<p>You also run into the issue of how the groups change - they may retain their name yet be under new leadership, and have completely different political motivations. For example no one debates that Hezbollah was useful in aiding Lebanon when it needed help with their war against Israel, but the Hezbollah that is in Syria is not necessarily the same group anymore.</p>

<p>What more, you have scenarios where <em>&quot;my enemies enemy is my (temporary) friend&quot;</em> unfold, and what gets even more convoluted is that all the major political powers are either directly or indirectly supporting all the terrorist groups (and non-terrorist ones too).</p>

<p>Ultimately though, it&#39;s correct to say that the funding for the majority of these groups is coming from the Western Nations, and no one can really claim ignorance to any of this.</p>

<p>Sadly, as far as the public is concerned, the excuse of &quot;oops all these weapons fell into terrorist hands... again! lol&quot; is a valid excuse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There could be some collusion here. We may never know. What we need to do is original research. We need to connect the dots. I don&#39;t believe one person can do it alone. Researching anything of this caliber takes people from various background with various skills and various networks.</p>

<p>Reddit is also not the place this. I don&#39;t think voat is either - even if this is the place where all of the departed have fled to. </p>

<p>All I know is if you want to suggest something like this, facts are needed to support it. I&#39;m sure a lot of research has been done on this but we need an organized collaboration if any progress will be made.</p>
