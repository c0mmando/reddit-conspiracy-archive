       I always envision it as a person standing on the shore and seeing a tsunami wave in the distance racing for shore. The other beach goers all have their heads in the sand and cannot hear those who do not, saying "Oh shit, what the fuck is that". I want to draw it as a cartoon, but never get around to it, heh.

       One of my coworkers came in today just totally somber. He's always full of energy, but today be was like...drained. Strange. The first thing he talks about is how he's ready for when shit hits the fan "I've got a bunch of guns, this is what I'm going to do" etc. If we're EMP'd, or the government tries stupid shit...
      </p>
      <p>
       We've had a conversation about it before, but today....he was completely focused on it. All he could talk about other than how the 4th was for me. This is your average hard-working guy with a wife and kid trying to sell a product so he can provide for his family.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm the one usually open to any of this type of talk, but for him to just be zoned in on it was unnerving.

       People are waking up to this type of stuff. The internet has really changed the game. Which is why they are trying their hardest to clamp down on it. I firmly believe, people are not stupid, they just need access to information and this is where the internet comes in. People are waking up and once you take the pill, you can see the bullshit, it's so obvious.

       Yes, sadly, what happens with America will influence the entire world. A part of me thinks the average American citizen will pull through.

       The guy I work with has probably never even heard of Reddit, or believes 9/11 was an inside job, but I'll be damned if this guy doesn't sense something coming as well. That's why it's disturbing.

       What I'm saying is, people need to discover it for themselves. You can lead a horse to the water but cannot make them drink it. Until they drink the water, then they can see it for themselves. That's my point. We are entering a major awakening, it's slow, but people are realizing. That is what it takes. You can't just bombard someone with how fucked the world is, they need to gradually see, and then we can start changing shit.

       We have the leaders we have because we have the society we have. We have ignorant leaders who are greedy because we have an ignorant/greedy society. If people want change, they must change themselves. Only then will they be able to elect said leaders. You're missing the point on almost everything I'm saying, but... w/e.

       I don't. Honestly, I'll probably die early fighting against whatever is trying to destroy my basic human rights. The more people that have it in their minds that: hey, maybe ISIS and my own government are
       <em>
        both
       </em>
       enemies if there were a conflict was trapped in. Everyone in this country needs to realize it is our friends and neighbors who we need to align with.

       The people
       <em>
        can

       win,
       <em>
        especially

       if those in the military decide as well.

       I'm trying to. I've given up on trying to "wake" the world up and I now focus on myself and family. I talk to like minded people, get ideas, prepare, etc etc. Tis all we can do. Some people just cannot wake up and I'm at peace with that. As the saying goes, to some people, ignorance is bliss. The truth is a heavy burden and some people just do not or cannot carry it.

       Haven't you ever heard the saying, "In order to love others you must love your self". It's the same thing. You must get right yourself, before you can be the change others can learn from. You get right yourself, and you will spread it without knowing, people will "follow" and learn from you. Seems like you do not know how this works.

       Of course I do not know you, but I have come in contact with people who say the same things. It's not the right direction. You must look inward to project outward. Do you truly know yourself, are you educated enough, spiritually sound enough, to truly inspire and wake people up for a positive change for humanity? Most people are not, hell I'm not, hence why I'm working on myself. You knowing yourself and your place in the universal consciousness is what they truly do not want you to do. Think about that for a second.

       your implications that i dont know myself summed up everything you were trying to get across. you were spinning philosophy into a personal question. if you cant see that from your own words then im sorry. words have deep meanings and if you dont understand yourself what your asking then dont ask. now you run when some one has a mind challenges you?

       I'm not running, you are putting words into my mouth and being defensive about simple questions. If you truly had confidence in what I asked, you'd reply in such a manner. You did not, so I'm choosing to end a conversation which is going no where, not because of me, but because you are taking such a defense and tilting the conversation. Good luck in your endeavors.

I really don't give a fuck anymore, as long as my family is OK (which it will be no matter what happens).

       Of course it's not fine. Then again, I doubt there's EVER been a "fine" period in history.
All I know is, I stay out of the banking system, teach myself and my family to be self (and family) reliant, and I'm in the best physical shape I've ever been in in my life.
I could care less if a bunch of lemmings jump off a cliff. I barely even resemble them as a species.

       Exactly how I feel. I would like to network a way to keep in contact with like minded people who know what their upmost responsibilities are at times like this.

       Even to go as far as people with the same outlook, a group of a thousand of us free minded people invade a small island and inhabit it ourselves. I'd love to just live somewhere were I knew what I was doing/giving to a community ACTUALLY benefited EVERYONE. Not just the small and meaningless with all this paper shit flying around called money.

       i think it's important to prepare mentally/emotionally, as best we can. remaining 'strong' positively in the midst of chaos, especially with those closest to you is a must. i hope people will be able (or want) to help others if necessary.

       Honestly, I decided to randomly look at this subreddit and I'm not sure why we are running out of time. What is going to happen?

       I'm trying to. I've given up on trying to "wake" the world up and I now focus on myself and family. I talk to like minded people, get ideas, prepare, etc etc. Tis all we can do. Some people just cannot wake up and I'm at peace with that. As the saying goes, to some people, ignorance is bliss. The truth is a heavy burden and some people just do not or cannot carry it.

       your implications that i dont know myself summed up everything you were trying to get across. you were spinning philosophy into a personal question. if you cant see that from your own words then im sorry. words have deep meanings and if you dont understand yourself what your asking then dont ask. now you run when some one has a mind challenges you?
