    <div class="md"><p>One of my coworkers came in today just totally somber. He&#39;s always full of energy, but today be was like...drained. Strange. The first thing he talks about is how he&#39;s ready for when shit hits the fan &quot;I&#39;ve got a bunch of guns, this is what I&#39;m going to do&quot; etc. If we&#39;re EMP&#39;d, or the government tries stupid shit...</p>

<p>We&#39;ve had a conversation about it before, but today....he was completely focused on it. All he could talk about other than how the 4th was for me. This is your average hard-working guy with a wife and kid trying to sell a product so he can provide for his family.</p>

<p>I&#39;m the one usually open to any of this type of talk, but for him to just be zoned in on it was unnerving. </p>

<p>I feel like we&#39;re going to see the darkest time in American history within our lifetimes.</p>

Until they drink the water, then they can see it for themselves. That&#39;s my point. We are entering a major awakening, it&#39;s slow, but people are realizing. That is what it takes. You can&#39;t just bombard someone with how fucked the world is, they need to gradually see, and then we can start changing shit.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t. Honestly, I&#39;ll probably die early fighting against whatever is trying to destroy my basic human rights. The more people that have it in their minds that: hey, maybe ISIS and my own government are <em>both</em> enemies if there were a conflict was trapped in.

    <div class="md"><p>Of course it&#39;s not fine. Then again, I doubt there&#39;s EVER been a &quot;fine&quot; period in history.
All I know is, I stay out of the banking system, teach myself and my family to be self (and family) reliant, and I&#39;m in the best physical shape I&#39;ve ever been in in my life.
I could care less if a bunch of lemmings jump off a cliff. I barely even resemble them as a species.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly how I feel. I would like to network a way to keep in contact with like minded people who know what their upmost responsibilities are at times like this. </p>

<p>Even to go as far as people with the same outlook, a group of a thousand of us free minded people invade a small island and inhabit it ourselves. I&#39;d love to just live somewhere were I knew what I was doing/giving to a community ACTUALLY benefited EVERYONE. Not just the small and meaningless with all this paper shit flying around called money. Fucking sick to death of being dictated how I should be. I am who I am. </p>

<p>i think it&#39;s important to prepare mentally/emotionally, as best we can. remaining &#39;strong&#39; positively in the midst of chaos, especially with those closest to you is a must. i hope people will be able (or want) to help others if necessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>your implications that i dont know myself summed up everything you were trying to get across. you were spinning philosophy into a personal question. if you cant see that from your own words then im sorry. words have deep meanings and if you dont understand yourself what your asking then dont ask. now you run when some one has a mind challenges you?</p>
