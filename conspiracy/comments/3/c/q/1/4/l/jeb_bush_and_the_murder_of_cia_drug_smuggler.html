<blockquote>
<p>Barry Seal -- gunrunner, drug trafficker, and covert C.I.A. operative extraordinaire -- is
hardly a familiar name in American politics. But nine years after he was murdered in a hail
of bullets by Medellin cartel hit men outside a Salvation Army shelter in Baton Rouge,
Louisiana, he has come back to haunt the reputations of three American presidents. </p>

<p>Why did he remove chapter 35? NOTE: Chapter 35 is intentionally missing from the printing of this publication. This was intentionally done by the publisher and is not a printing error. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Barry-Boys-Americas-Secret-History/dp/0970659105">LINK</a></p>

<p><strong>Daniel Hopsicker</strong> from his FB account : Sorry to say, for the most part I agree with him. 9/11 Truth...isn&#39;t. There was enough disinfo slung around 9/11--remote control, holograms, <strong>termites in the Towers etc</strong>-- to build a 100-story pile of dung, and <strong>completely obliterate the few real revelations that came out</strong>. Which was, of course, its purpose.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In this interview Hopsicker makes it plain that <strong>he thinks the controlled demolition theories surrounding the WTC 1, 2 &amp; 7 collapses are totally without merit</strong> and could very well be disinfo to lead the truth movement into chasing a false trail. <strong>He totally discounts the scientific findings regarding the nano-thermite found in the WTC dust</strong> and <strong>makes some disparaging comments about the abilities of the scientist involved in this discovery</strong>. He apparently <strong>attributes the collapse of WTC 7 to the diesel fuel held in the tanks for Rudy&#39;s emergency command center</strong>. I am baffled how he could see all the dissembling and coverup that has gone on over the Mohammed Atta story and yet swallow the straight down, free fall collapse of WTC 7 and the abnormal, explosive like collapse of WTC 1 &amp; 2 as something that does not warrant further investigation.&quot;</p>

<p>Would you like to provide us a current BIO or CV for Daniel Hopsicker of Venice, FL &amp; Austin, TX?</p>

<p>This is an interesting read : <a href="http://www.sott.net/signs/exposing_the_big_con.htm">http://www.sott.net/signs/exposing_the_big_con.htm</a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t spend time labeling people as Z&#39;s but this guy does: <a href="http://wolfblitzzer0.blogspot.com/2013/10/911-liar-daniel-hopsicker-vs-wayne.html">http://wolfblitzzer0.blogspot.com/2013/10/911-liar-daniel-hopsicker-vs-wayne.html</a></p>

<p>What &amp; who are you laughing at? Are you referring to me or the blogger?</p>

<p>I am certainly not the only person who questions the authenticity of DH. <strong>Daniel Hopsicker does provide a mixture of fact and falsehood.</strong> He also writes in a winding, somewhat confusing style.</p>

<p>He doubts <strong>9/11 author Peter Marshall</strong> <a href="http://www.madcowprod.com/2013/02/26/dad-kills-kids-and-self-the-philip-marshall-story/">was murdered</a> for instance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wow. Fasten your seatbelts.  The only big shocker is that Philip Marshall appears to be the last person to discern Saudi influence behind the 9/11 attack.  It’s not even front page news. And its certainly nothing to kill him over. </p>

<p>If it were, there would be at least 15,000 authors, Madsen and myself among them,  already dead.</p>

<p>But those selling the notion that Marshall was murdered ignore his book, so embarrassingly obscure that few knew of its existence before his death.</p>

<p>Instead they cite the brief relationship Marshall had over 30 years ago with Barry Seal, a life-long CIA pilot whose cocaine smuggling in military C123 military cargo planes funded the Contra’s war in Nicaragua and fueled the cocaine epidemic of the 1980’s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would highly recommend cross referencing anything Hopsicker writes.</p>

<p><a href="http://hightimes.com/read/inside-octopus">Who is really responsible for the JFK assassination, Air America, Watergate, Iran-Contra and just about every other major scandal in recent history? Could the Barry Seal story provide the answer? Does Seal&#39;s sad saga provide a window on the Octopus that really rules America?</a></p>
