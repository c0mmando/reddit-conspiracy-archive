       So you're saying I should prepare for when shit hits the fan? I was more looking for intelligent discussion about why it was going tits up, or what to expect specifically.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want to get all sensationalist. If this isn't the place for getting information, I'm not sure where to go.

       I used to be very active in this sub, and there were a lot of very smart, level-headed people willing to discuss similar things.

       pays to be prepared. I'm on the fence with J.H. personally. It sure looks like the Govt. would like to create a rebellion to crush though, I'd like to point them to Vietnam...

       Lol! What a BS shill response. A massive military wide preparation for civil dissent happening in your neighborhood is always something you should be concerned about.
      </p>
      <p>
       And those "anonymous blogs" are actually most of the independent, reliable news sources "stirring up" facts that aren't being provided by the MSM and government officials. You should probably do some of your own research on the internet and form your own conclusions instead of listening to completely baseless responses like the one from Justfaz and That_Guy381 (def sounds like a shill name to me).

       Probably because people have been around for several decades and have never heard, seen, or experienced anything like this before.
      </p>
      <p>
       This training is the first of its kind. Why now? Why in such grandiose? Why over such a huge area. And most importantly; why is my home being labeled as a hostile territory? When If, something like the deepest of conspiracy believers, actually happened, then you're damn right. These places WILL become hostile territories.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just find it strange the places they labeled as hostile, really would be if some sort of marshal law would attempt to be out in place.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say attempt, because they're right. They'd never shut down these places. They'd have a huge scary fight on their hands. People here and there are quite weary of our government.

       Wat. Dude, that doesn't change the fact that it is still a training exercise. What are they going to declare war on the United States? That's fucking crazy. No one would follow them.

       Even IF they did, a few rednecks with guns isn't going to stop the US military. You don't train against Unicorns, you train against hostiles. Where are you even reading that they labelled you as

       Alright man. I live in Texas too, haha.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't be afraid, is the first thing I wanna say. 
I have heard and seen anything from this being a tactic to scare us, to being the real deal Holyfield with martial law and the whole nine yards.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, now that we have considered some of the possibilities lets examine some things I have witnessed. 
-fake Malls being built, possibly as concentration camps 
-Wal-Marts shutting down, possibly to be concentration camps
-millions of FEMA coffins (somewhat dis-proven but who knows)
-police and military training together (have witnessed myself)
-increases in air traffic, specifically military 
-increases in troop presence
-special forces from every branch, the elite, being deployed
-multiple political moves (i.e. executive orders, "Obamatrade")
-a seeming disgust in the media for Patriots
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, no one really knows the scope of what all this means. We have 8 days before JH15 kicks off. It could be TPTB flexing their muscles trying to scare us, it could be rounding up gun owners before a catastrophe, or something much much weirder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about this though. About 50% of the world's private gun owners live in Texas. We have militias, national guardsmen, and police who will not go along with this. We have a concerned populace here in Texas (I have heard more rumors of succession). I personally am just an observer.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wanna end with this. I'm not religious but I feel this has its place in our lives:

       So you're saying I should prepare for when shit hits the fan? I was more looking for intelligent discussion about why it was going tits up, or what to expect specifically.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want to get all sensationalist. If this isn't the place for getting information, I'm not sure where to go.

       I used to be very active in this sub, and there were a lot of very smart, level-headed people willing to discuss similar things.
