       This might not be the right place to post this, if there is another/better sub to post this in let me know. But I think you guys might have some answers.
      </p>
      <p>
       My GF's Sister's boyfriend (well call him G) was talking to his brother in law (who we will call H) via text. They are both into hunting and both want to go into the military (the brother in law might have already served, i dont know) and they both just like guns and things that go BOOM in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over the weekend they were texting and G was telling H about how you can pretty easily make your own bombs. He was talking about how you only need a FOID card to obtain a type of gun powder, and then listed off a few other ingredients and what not ending the text with it gets super hot and super explosive. This is normal for him, he talks about this shit all the time. He's definitely not a terrorist, considering he talks about wanting to go kill the terrorists all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, H then replies with a text about something along the lines of "wait you want to jerk off all over the country?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Needless to say, G was a bit confused. After discussing their confusion they shared screen shots of what they sent each other. Basically, the text H received was nothing like the text G sent, except for one part. The text H receive was something like "Im just gonna go jerk off all across the country and in other parts of the world, finding super hot chicks are super explosive."
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        super explosive
       </strong>
       was the only common thing between the sent and received texts, which in my opinion, is a little too much of a coincidence. Its not a super common way to describe an attractive female, so it seemed to strike me as odd.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what it means, I thought you guys might have an idea. G swears its a certain Gov't agency tracking him now. Maybe intercepting texts after being triggered by certain key words.

       , but since you asked, no. Brown sugar is not good for use in hummingbird feeders. I've read that it contains iron, and it can make the little guys sick.

       Use plain white sugar.

       Are you saying that when G sent a message about the ingredients for explosives, H received a txt about jerking off instead? So then H replied "wait you want to jerk off all over the country?" - which was received correctly I assume. So manipulation was performed on one particular message only. Interesting, thanks for letting us know.

       Yeah the message G sent about the ingredients and what not was somehow changed and when H received it, it was about jerking off and "super explosive" chicks. He showed me his phone with the original message, and the screen shot that H sent him with the received message, the time stamps match up.

       OP... it's easy enough to test. Send the same message again... if it is algorithmic, it should trigger the same bot. It would be so easy to pull off this type of manipulation, but it is also pretty easy to get caught... so I doubt it.

       One is on T-Mobile on a Galaxy S4 or 5. Im not sure about the brother in law. I texted him asking for screen shots. He has not replied to me. He sleeps from like 10 AM to like 8 PM though and works 1am to 9 am so the window of communication is small.
