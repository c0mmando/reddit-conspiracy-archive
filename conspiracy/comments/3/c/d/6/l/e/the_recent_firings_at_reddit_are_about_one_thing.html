        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Greetings all. I have been trying to decide for a while if I wanted to post this, but I think now is the right time to.</p>

<p>I had the &quot;privilege&quot; of interviewing to work at reddit back in March of this year. This was smack dab during the middle of Ellen Pao&#39;s trial against KP, and you could tell the atmosphere was tense during my interviews. In the comments below I&#39;ll post a complete description of what the interview was like (I wrote it up for <a href="http://www.glassdoor.com">www.glassdoor.com</a>, but they rejected it for having &quot;too much personal information&quot;).</p>

<p>Before we get into what I believe is going on let&#39;s get into the history of Reddit, Inc as told to me by Alexis. Reddit&#39;s first acquisition was made by Advanced Publications. Many seem to believe they were directly owned by Conde Nast, but that&#39;s not the case. AP wholly owned Reddit, and put them under the same management team as Conde Nast, basically making them sister companies. In September of 2011 Reddit was spun out into its own company (dissolving the original Reddit, Inc and forming a whole new corporate entity) with Advanced Publications owning a vast majority of the shares. Then came their current $50 million funding round in September 2014. During this event Reddit Inc diluted its shares so that AP would own less than 50% of the company, and so they could distribute new shares to its current investors.</p>

<p>Now, this is where I think things get interesting. Reddit currently has 87 million shares outstanding (a number provided to me during my interview process), and during her trial Ellen Pao agreed to the fact that she has &quot;<a href="https://recode.net/2015/03/11/liveblog-day-three-of-ellen-pao-on-the-stand/">millions of Reddit stock options</a>.&quot; How every many millions these are, it represent a very large ownership in the company for a single person.</p>

<p>Now here is why I think the firings might be about peoples&#39; Stock Options. Reddit has a 5-year vesting period for their options with a one year cliff. This means you get 1/4 of your options at your one year anniversary, and 0.25% every month for the next 4 years. If you look at the people that have left (or been let go) recently many are close to that one year mark. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Blackout2015/comments/3cd4b9/the_recent_firings_at_reddit_are_about_one_thing/csuh4v9?context=1">Very few have made it past 2 or 3 years</a>. Your unused options are then returned to the company to be done with what they want. If you ask me, Ellen is looking for a nice big stock bonus but there aren&#39;t enough shares available. The obvious choice is to fire employees and return those shares to the company.</p>

<p>I know this all seems a bit far fetched, but it seems like a glaring truth to me once you get some inside perspective. As required for something like this I am willing to provide proof to the mods about my interview process and claims made about reddit shares outstanding. Also please feel free to ask my any questions.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: Was interviewed for a job at Reddit, and to my eyes it looks like they&#39;re making excuses to fire people before their stock options vest.</p>

<p>Edit 2: Added link to my own comment about employees that have lasted one year at reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since you are going public with this, I figure I should write an experience I had with a specific public sv company and may be what reddit is attempting to do.  I was working for a successful company that was constantly beating their earnings each quarter. After a couple of years of this they brought in a female CEO and she then proceeded to run the company into the ground. We were given all sorts of gifts and raises (without merit) . They did it so that they could lower the stock value and sell the company off to a major competitor. The female CEO was only brought in as a company assassin and there were rumors from various insiders telling to short it. All of it was probably highly illegal and I lost lots of $$ in stock. I&#39;m assuming reddit is not public (I stopped paying attention to stocks a long time ago), but it could still be relevant to this situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for bringing more insight to people how SV startups work. It&#39;s the crazy wild, wild west out here.</p>

<p>And no, reddit isn&#39;t public yet. It&#39;s currently owned by their investors and staff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>INTERVIEW PROCESS WITH REDDIT</strong></p>

<p>This was written right after my interviews with them, so I&#39;m sorry if this come across as a bit salty, I&#39;m just too lazy to rewrite it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My interview process with Reddit was a very long and strange experience.</p>

<p>I initial applied through lever.co on February 24th when I noticed they were looking for a Postgres Database Administrator. I heard back from their recruiter, Phil, on February 27th, and we scheduled a phone screening for the following Monday. The phone screen with Phil was pretty standard and we scheduled a technical screening for the next day, March 3rd.</p>

<p>I had my technical phone screen with Ricky Ramirez, the Lead DevOps Engineer at Reddit, and it went very well. We talked a lot about my background, and which platforms I&#39;ve had experience on. We also talked about the problems Reddit currently has with its RBDMSs and how I would solve those problems.</p>

<p>We scheduled my first in-person interviews for two days later, March 4th. I interviews with three groups of two people, each group for an hour. The first group was people from the DevOps team, the second group was developers, and the third group was the product team. As I was leaving I was told I should expect an offer the next day. </p>

<p>This is when things start to get weird. </p>

<p>Since Reddit is still quite small all of the offers flow through Ellen Pao, the CEO. During the time of my interview she was in the middle of her trial with Kleiner Perkins, and was understandably quite busy. Phil was trying to move things along so he worked the compensation committee to let me know what their offer would be. Their offers were as follows:</p>

<p>Option 1:  Base Salary - $130,000 with 37,500 options that vest over a 5 year period.</p>

<p>Option 2:  Base Salary - $140,000 with 25,000 options that vest over a 5 year period.</p>

<p>(For reference, Reddit had a little less than 87 million shares outstanding.)</p>

<p>During the same period Phil and I agreed I should meet Alexis Ohanian, the co-founder and Chairman of the Board. Alexis and I met on March 13th and talked about the future of Reddit, and his vision for the next 10 years of the company. After this Phil and I met, and we both agreed the offers were a little soft. He was going to go back to the compensation committee to come up with a new offer.</p>

<p>On March 17th I was asked if I could come back that night to meet with the Director of Engineering, George Pang. My interview with George focused a lot on my experience as a DBA and a lot of questions about cloud hosting, specifically AWS.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t hear back from Reddit until March 20th. And unfortunately they wouldn&#39;t be extending an offer. Despite everyone wanting me on board, George Pang specifically decided to not extend me an offer. He had problems with my lack of AWS experience, and now wanted to hire a Cloud Infrastructure Engineer, and not at DBA. </p>

<p>So there you have it, my very strange interview process with Reddit. I would like to add that everyone I met with was extremely professional, and very passionate about their jobs. Hats off to Phil for being a great recruiter, and working his butt off to get me on board.</p>

<p>All of my interviews went very well and I for sure thought I was going to get the job. Meeting Alexis was the most fun, and we had a great talk about where reddit is now, and new products reddit wants to introduce in the next 5 years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Feel free to ask me any questions about what the interview process was like, or anything I learned while interviewing with reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um, I&#39;m not trying to undermine anything, and I think what you are doing is great, but to protect yourself, did you sign a non-disclosure upon starting the interview? (I would imagine so since most SV tech companies do it standard), if so you may want to delete this asap before they go after you. I think it&#39;s pretty clear that Pao is willing to get dirty.</p>

<p>I am not a lawyer, so I could be totally off, just someone with a lot of SV industry insider knowledge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit actually didn&#39;t make me sign any kind of NDA during the interview process, not even one when visiting their office. I reviewed all emails exchanged with them any my notes about the interview just to be sure.</p>

<p>Thank you for bringing that up though and for your concern.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re referring to interview portion, I called it strange just because it was very different from any other Silicon Valley that I&#39;ve done. Reddit at that time was a 75 person company, and having the CEO interview all candidates struck me as odd, especially when she was in the middle of a high profile trial. </p>
