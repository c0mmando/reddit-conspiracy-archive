<p>Link: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3c796r/seriousrussians_what_is_your_opinion_on_putin/">https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3c796r/seriousrussians_what_is_your_opinion_on_putin/</a></p>

<p>We can learn two things from this; Always take the claims of random people on the internet with a grain of salt, and people will stoop to the lowest levels to push an agenda. If I hadn&#39;t checked their history, I would have assumed these people are probably Russian because who the hell would stoop this low? </p>

<p>Edit: <strong><em>This is getting really weird, guys!</em></strong> I just got a pm sent to me from <a href="/u/KoMoDo1977">/u/KoMoDo1977</a> stating this: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m confused. Do u think that I am 3 people or that I am impersonating 3 people? Did I just get called a paid shill or is that my imagination? Omg I am so happy thank you. :)</p>

<p>Anyway I will answer any questions you want. I&#39;m not actually a shill.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He then realized his mistake and sent this right after:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just realized I sent that via my alt. Send all replies to <a href="/u/micahjava">/u/micahjava</a></p>

<p>Another &quot;Russian&quot; entered the thread. I&#39;m going to keep watching this because it&#39;s really funny. 6 days worth of comments, but with a year old account. Another Russian in there has a 3 day old account. I&#39;ve also been checking a bunch of other threads from the last year with similar questions, and many of the people who answered abruptly stopped posting after the thread. It&#39;s like there&#39;s a massive pool of expendable alt accounts these guys have...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the kind words. I was hoping to at least show others how you could use creative methods to spot shills. </p>

<p>There are a few posts like this one buried deep in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> history which were more sophisticated. One guy compared subtle grammatical errors and the like across 3 accounts on worldnews which were all talking to each other. Certain things, like misspellings or alternative spellings can be used as well. For instance, if 3 people in the same stretch of comments all use quotes before a comma and misspell all the same words consistently in their history, it&#39;s more likely they are the same person. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will ask for a sticky in the future when I find some real dirt. At least I know some of what I should be looking for in the future. To be honest, this wasn&#39;t as strong of a post as I had anticipated, since all 3 &quot;Russians&quot; had an easy way to deny that they were impersonating Russians. One guy claimed he misread the title, the other pointed out how I can&#39;t prove he isn&#39;t a Russian immigrant, and the other claimed he was joking. What I should have done was wait until somebody asks more more details as their posts climbed to the top. </p>

<p>The only really strong bit of evidence here is the one Russian impersonator PMing me accidentally from his alt account, which has no history. Why would he have his alt account with no history open at the same time? Also, he must be using Tor or something similar, because you can&#39;t have two accounts open at the same time on the same IP address, so he must be using it to manipulate votes. </p>

<p>If you want more information on shills, I&#39;ve been spreading a link compilation for a while, and asked others successfully to do the same. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2hf77e/internet_trolls_may_be_trained_government_agents/cks8exy">Click here</a> if you haven&#39;t seen it. </p>

<p>I see it more as a form of harassment, something that is not uncommon. Shill researchers here have been given death threats via PM for exposing shills in the past. So, in your crazed world, you find pleasure attempting to harass people, but your own incompetence exposes you as a shill. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been noticing especially this year that a lot of the comments on YouTube seem to be made by complete bots. I do not want to go into detail as to why I feel this but if you dig a bit I think you will come to the same conclusion. The thing is when you dig you see that these people simply do not exist at all. Their Google+ circles are all entirely fake as well.</p>

<p>It is also an established fact that 4chan is being inundated with bots that deluge it with irrelevant posts. No doubt the same is happening here on Reddit. Seems if they can&#39;t control what we post, they will try to control what we see.</p>

<p>This would fit into the plan of dividing and conquering. Lots of racially inspired events as of late...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People in Russia wonder - &#39;&#39;What would Stalin do, if he was today alive?&#39;&#39; Others reply - &#39;&#39;He would be doing exact as Putin today does!&#39;&#39;</p>

<p>In times of great danger and great needs people seem to rally around their leaders - that is not a sign of weakness or slave mentality, it is just when people realize that in order to survive they need to remain together they instinctively support they gov.(not always &#39;&#39;not matter what&#39;&#39;)</p>

<p>People support Putin because he made not feel anymore embarrassment about our country like it used to be when Yeltsin was(?) in charge.</p>

<p>In one of his sayings, Putin said that 80 percent of all his assignments are not done. Some stuff though, a leader of a country cannot say straight forward to his people(even more when they are not ready for such insider info) - see how Kennedy end up. </p>

<p>Political analysts who dont have this fear of being shot, say directly that the percentage of his assignments not done, actually means that in the russian gov apparatus(which is nearly 2 million people), 80 percent of them do not do as Putin wants them to do. So basically we could say that 80% of them are not loyal neither to Putin and neither to Russia. </p>

<p>Whether i like Putin or not. It hasnt to do with liking or love - i just trust my country in his hands(instinctively). And right now the land has taken its true course in history - which obviously is not being this huge ass frightened country who obeys the so called international unwritten rules. </p>

<p>Objectively and even in practice, Putin continues the development of Russia - something was done under Stalin(like him or not, it is a different talk). </p>

<p>So yeah, he is a good(seemingly) guy who does the best he can in Russia&#39;s interests. But thats just me, there other opinions too</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are welcome :)</p>

<p>You just dont fuck with the FRS. And by the way, by eliminating the FRS, Kennedy would free every other bank under the rule of FRS. So basically despite not knowing where he was actually getting into, he tried to free humanity from the usure and the loan interest. </p>

<p>A great dude, wish you more like him. But the again, same goes for Putin. He could say &#39;&#39;he dudes! we are run by jews!&#39;&#39; and then the next morning he would be either resigning or dead like Stalin. The point is to make people realize stuff, so when a Kennedy or a Putin says &#39;&#39;this is how things are today&#39;&#39;, people will know(you could say that there is needed a level of awareness like(bad example) we here in the conspiracy sub have). Because you know, people would panic and shit. And that is what a leader cannot afford - too irresponsible. This is why many leaders of the world cannot come straight and speak their mind</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Kennedy story, in a nutshell, is his father was a crook, so that&#39;s how he got into high-level politics (they all are crooks).  They trusted Kennedy, being he was the son of one of their own, but THIS Kennedy truly was disgusted and wanted to change things.</p>

<p>He is a Hero.</p>

<p>JFK knew the only way to destroy a corrupt system is to have to power, so he played along to become president.  This shocked the crooks so much they had to send a message.  So, they killed him in broad daylight, killed his brother, and had his sister lobotomized.  This was a message to all others in their circle, &quot;if your kid betrays us, we&#39;ll take them all out&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s going to take a People&#39;s Revolution to clean this shit up.   They know this,  which is why they are cracking down on our rights, our ability to arm ourselves, and monitoring us.   America is turning into a fascist state.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t weep for us, because this is what they want to do to everyone.</p>

<p>Just pray the people wake up in time to stop it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It should be noted that critical commentary posted on blogs or social media from Russian citizens about their government is very controlled by their government.  They also have a pervasive surveillance network that  monitors social media, email, et al.</p>

<p>Bloggers like Navalny who do not self-censor are jailed.  Since valid criticism of government is stymied in that nation, I suspect very few Russian citizens would risk posting their true opinions of Putin on any internet forum if they do not kiss his ass.</p>

<p>So if you ask that valid question again, good luck with getting a genuine response.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>[russian]Captain here. Got downvoted to the point where i cannot comment anymore in <a href="/r/russia">/r/russia</a> for defending Russia and everything that has to do with it. Apparently <a href="/r/russia">/r/russia</a> is filled with anti russian commentators who just dont want to see any pro russian opinions. Those were supposedly people from the ex soviet republic - those who bitch about Russia these days</p>
