        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The following two-part series (more coming soon) provides conclusive evidence that:</p>

<p>A. multiple moderators of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are colluding with the moderators of extremely racist and sexist subreddits as well as the moderators of subreddits which openly mock and ridicule &quot;conspiracy theorists.&quot;</p>

<p>B. the administrators of Reddit are implicated in this collusion </p>

<p>Interwoven throughout this series is an extensive discussion of &quot;shilling&quot; as it pertains to reddit.</p>

<p><a href="http://r3cursiv3.blogspot.com/2015/07/reddit-revelations-part-2.html">Reddit Revelations: Part 2</a></p>

<p>As one of the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> moderators called out in the first part of this series (<a href="/u/assuredlyathrowaway">/u/assuredlyathrowaway</a>) is also a moderator of /v/conspiracy at voat.co, switching to /v/conspiracy will not solve this problem (leaving aside voat&#39;s relationship with Google for now).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve created a subreddit for discussing these matters further, and a community alternative to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, as the problems with the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mod-team are quite serious and we need to do something about it. </p>

<p>Feel free to join me at <a href="/r/publicdiscourse">/r/publicdiscourse</a> to talk about this further. I&#39;m not saying we need to abandon <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>; we do need another place to organize and talk about these things which is not under the influence of the moderators in question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion, the huge problem before us here is - now no matter how great Flytape is, he is tainted with so many scandals just having him as a mod creates massive disruption in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. (as we can all see with our own eyes over the past few days with numerous threads and thousands of comments dedicated to this debacle)</p>

<p><strong>Let&#39;s do a summary/ELI5</strong></p>

<p><em>1) An &quot;official podcast&quot; was released on Friday night by AssuredlyAThrowAway and the first guest was Flytape</em></p>

<p>He was wearing a weird mask</p>

<p>He was smoking a vape-pen</p>

<p>He had a trippy shifting background animation</p>

<p>The Podcast lasted a few hours</p>

<p><em>2) Flytape bans people who are in uproar about this performance</em></p>

<p>The users were mad because no one consulted with them properly and timely before the announcement of the podcast</p>

<p>They were mad that the podcast was being used as an &quot;official&quot; representation of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> by AssuredlyAThrowAway on 
YouTube</p>

<p>They thought Flytape was pushing hitler memes</p>

<p><em>3) Mr_dong comes in later due to UK timezone differential and removes the Podcast sticky due to the community uproar</em></p>

<p><em>4) The story feed has multiple threads blowing up discussing the incident</em></p>

<p>SRD crossposts the thread and it goes viral</p>

<p>memes are created by users on reddit &quot;justconspiracythings&quot; with flytape&#39;s mask/vape-pen</p>

<p><em>5) Mr_dong comes back with an announcement that countless users have complained about the situation and he looked into it more.</em></p>

<p>He finds that the podcast should not have been &quot;official&quot;</p>

<p>He finds that Flytape was banning people who did nothing wrong</p>

<p>He finds that the conflict is so divisive that the only way to resolve it is to remove Flytape for the overall community&#39;s benefit, even though some mods disagreed.</p>

<p><em>6) The next day Flytape posts an apology thread</em></p>

<p>He magically appears on mod list again</p>

<p>He deletes his thread after a poor response by subscribers</p>

<p>People start posting about the deleted thread and reinstatement</p>

<p><em>7) SovereignMan posts an announcement thread</em></p>

<p>The mods had a vote behind the scenes</p>

<p>It was an 80% - 20% victory for flytape</p>

<p>The votes will be kept in secret</p>

<p><em>8) <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> explodes in dissent</em></p>

<p>Multiple threads with hundreds of combined comments</p>

<p>People accusing others of being shills from SRD with no evidence</p>

<p>People asking for transparency in the vote</p>

<p>People complaining that Flytape abused his powers too many times</p>

<p>No matter how great Flytape is or can be, he is tainted with so many scandals just having him as a mod creates massive disruption in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t his first chance, right???</p>

<p>But that&#39;s just my observation.</p>

<p>Well here we are, this is your official warning.</p>

<p>Rule 10 states,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Posts that attack this sub, users or mods thereof, will be removed. Accusing another user of being a troll or shill can be viewed as an attack, depending on context. Repeat offenders are subject to a ban.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I can see from your posting history that you do this quite often.  My advice would be to focus on subjects that you support like AE911TRUTH and stop attacking people for subjects you don&#39;t support.  Any future incidents of you attacking users or mods, will absolutely result in a ban.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve been warned.  Have a great day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is telling you to support your claim or fuck off, attacking your character somehow?</p>

<p>No its not.  Rule 10 doesn&#39;t say no curse words.  It says.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Posts that attack this sub, users or mods thereof, will be removed. Accusing another user of being a troll or shill can be viewed as an attack, depending on context. Repeat offenders are subject to a ban.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re accusing me of being a Zionist shill, I told you to support that accusation or fuck off.  I gave you the benefit of the doubt that maybe you actually had something that erroneously lead you to believe this statement.  But basically you&#39;re just attacking people who don&#39;t believe your flavor of 9-11 truth.  Which is very typical of the AE911TRUTH movement.  All the people they fired and banned for daring to talk about other 911 theories.</p>

<p>There are actually some good interviews out there with former AE911TRUTH employees who witnessed all the corruption within the movement.  Like Mr. Gage touring Europe with his lady friend on the funds collected from donors to AE911TRUTH.  But don&#39;t worry he did a 1 hour speaking engagement somewhere along the way.</p>

<p>You have been warned and are expected to follow the rules going forward.  You&#39;re really just testing my resolve at this point.  I&#39;m being very patient with you thus far and I would appreciate if you would stop arguing about this warning and move forward without further production.</p>

<p>All these other imaginary things you&#39;re trying to stand on here don&#39;t matter.  You&#39;ve had like 12 different posts violating rule 10 be removed by at least 3 different mods.

    <div class="md"><p>This has been going on for hundreds of years:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Black and white worked together, fraternized together. The very fact that laws had to be passed after a while to forbid such relations indicates the strength of that tendency. In 1661 a law was passed in Virginia that &quot;in case any English servant shall run away in company of any Negroes&quot; he would have to give special service for extra years to the master of the runaway Negro. In 1691, Virginia provided for the banishment of any &quot;white man or woman being free who shall intermarry with a negro, mulatoo, or Indian man or woman bond or free.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>from another section:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bacon&#39;s Rebellion brought together groups from the lower classes. White frontiersmen started the uprising because they were angry about the way the colony was being run. Then white servants and black slaves joined the rebel¬ lion. They were angry, too-mostly about the huge gap between rich and poor in Virginia.</p>

<p>The greatest fear of wealthy southern planters was that black slaves and poor whites would combine in another uprising like Bacon&#39;s Rebellion. One tool to keep blacks and whites from uniting was racism. Edmund Morgan , a historian of slavery in Virginia , wrote in his American Slavery, American Freedom that racism was not a &quot;natural&quot; feeling about the differ¬ences between black and white. Instead, white leaders encouraged a negative view of blacks. If poor whites felt contempt for African Americans, they were less likely to join with them in rebellion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion, the huge problem before us here is - now no matter how great Flytape is, he is tainted with so many scandals just having him as a mod creates massive disruption in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. (as we can all see with our own eyes over the past few days with numerous threads and thousands of comments dedicated to this debacle)</p>

<p><strong>Let&#39;s do a summary/ELI5</strong></p>

<p><em>1) An &quot;official podcast&quot; was released on Friday night by AssuredlyAThrowAway and the first guest was Flytape</em></p>

<p>He was wearing a weird mask</p>

<p>He was smoking a vape-pen</p>

<p>He had a trippy shifting background animation</p>

<p>The Podcast lasted a few hours</p>

<p><em>2) Flytape bans people who are in uproar about this performance</em></p>

<p>The users were mad because no one consulted with them properly and timely before the announcement of the podcast</p>

<p>They were mad that the podcast was being used as an &quot;official&quot; representation of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> by AssuredlyAThrowAway on 
YouTube</p>

<p>They thought Flytape was pushing hitler memes</p>

<p><em>3) Mr_dong comes in later due to UK timezone differential and removes the Podcast sticky due to the community uproar</em></p>

<p><em>4) The story feed has multiple threads blowing up discussing the incident</em></p>

<p>SRD crossposts the thread and it goes viral</p>

<p>memes are created by users on reddit &quot;justconspiracythings&quot; with flytape&#39;s mask/vape-pen</p>

<p><em>5) Mr_dong comes back with an announcement that countless users have complained about the situation and he looked into it more.</em></p>

<p>He finds that the podcast should not have been &quot;official&quot;</p>

<p>He finds that Flytape was banning people who did nothing wrong</p>

<p>He finds that the conflict is so divisive that the only way to resolve it is to remove Flytape for the overall community&#39;s benefit, even though some mods disagreed.</p>

<p><em>6) The next day Flytape posts an apology thread</em></p>

<p>He magically appears on mod list again</p>

<p>He deletes his thread after a poor response by subscribers</p>

<p>People start posting about the deleted thread and reinstatement</p>

<p><em>7) SovereignMan posts an announcement thread</em></p>

<p>The mods had a vote behind the scenes</p>

<p>It was an 80% - 20% victory for flytape</p>

<p>The votes will be kept in secret</p>

<p><em>8) <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> explodes in dissent</em></p>

<p>Multiple threads with hundreds of combined comments</p>

<p>People accusing others of being shills from SRD with no evidence</p>

<p>People asking for transparency in the vote</p>

<p>People complaining that Flytape abused his powers too many times</p>

<p>No matter how great Flytape is or can be, he is tainted with so many scandals just having him as a mod creates massive disruption in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t his first chance, right???</p>

<p>But that&#39;s just my observation.</p>
