        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m new here, but not new to the use of misinformation to discredit so-called &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;. The story claimed that the leaked Galileo software was used to insert child pornography into target computers. It took a quick read of the &quot;code&quot; snippet and a few of the early comments to see that this was really a non-story. There was nothing in that code snippet to indicate what the title of the post suggested. Sure, we could ask why they would use the file names they used, but ultimately, there was nothing there. No substance at all. That it has the number of upvotes it has is an indication to me that it&#39;s being used to discredit both this sub in general, as well as the very notion that spyware exists that would covertly insert child pornography on a target&#39;s computer. The latter is likely the more important part, because once a computer has been rooted, it would be trivial to insert <em>any</em> files on that computer, not just child pornography. </p>

<p>So what we have here is a post that essentially mocks the very idea that child porn could be uploaded covertly on a target computer, because that particular example doesn&#39;t in any way prove or even persuade that the Galileo software inserts child porn on target computers. Now we have this bizarre situation where we&#39;re discussing a non-issue about whether or not this code snippet proves Galileo was inserting child porn on a computer (it doesn&#39;t even come close), but side-stepping the entire issue of what always happens when an infected computer gets rooted: any files can be uploaded to that computer. In fact, by definition, a rooted or compromised computer will always contain files not belonging to the original system or owner. </p>

<p>That post is a red flag. Whether the OP intended it or not, it is misinformation. Does spyware allow for any kind of file to be uploaded to a target? Certainly. Does that example prove or persuade that Galileo was doing this? Not in the least. My guess is that that post was heavily upvoted by users who are more interested in discrediting the sub than having a genuine discussion about what industrial strength spyware can actually do. </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Seems that it&#39;s  been removed now, <del>as well another one that it made it to the top that linked to the code hosted at Github</del>. Not sure that&#39;s a good thing, because it really was a perfect example.</p>

<p>That said, I found it odd that very few people seemed to jump in to talk about the code itself, that it just seemed to be some filler/sample/test values so that something would happen if the script wasn&#39;t run with supplied values on startup.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course, I&#39;m surmising that it was heavily upvoted by people who want to discredit, because I see so many really good posts being downvoted to oblivion regularly in this sub while nearly 2000 accounts voted up a story that has absolutely no substance to it. I could be wrong, but either way, it&#39;s most definitely working to discredit rather than opening up a discussion. I see this too often here.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you know anything about code you know that snippet was essentially impossible to do what was claimed. It would require that every user of Galileo have a copy of said child porn files, not to mention hardcoded directories in the code... Of course the snippet was small...and fake IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TBH OP I see this positively. Within human cognition any information which draws significant attention, even <em>if</em> later disregarded after analytical thinking (eg proving the contrary) can still remain in the conscious (and subconscious) and influence further decision making. This is the basis for endorsement ads and political smear campaigns.</p>

<p>In other words, even <em>if</em> the whole shebang was false, it did bring enough attention to the fact that child porn <em>is</em> used as a weapon, something most people would&#39;ve dismissed from the onset as &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;. And even <em>after</em> their realization that this information was false, the word was spread already.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that post and the one over on voat received a ridiculous amount of upvotes and ignorant comments with <strong>no one</strong> stopping to think critically or search for an expert analysis.

    <div class="md"><p>I would think anything that makes more people realize how possible it is to plant files on people&#39;s computers should be a benefit.

    <div class="md"><p>But my point is that it is already obvious to anyone who is even remotely familiar with how spyware and root kits work. The OP&#39;s title was highly misleading and served to discredit the entire notion that this could be done. It&#39;s clear that it <em>can</em> be done, but that example is the wrong example to choose. And I think it&#39;s definitely possible to actually prove when it&#39;s been done, though maybe difficult. But it serves no purpose other than to discredit the idea when the example being used doesn&#39;t prove anything at all. A quick glance of the recent comments on that thread suggested to me that it had the effect of just making us all look bad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>first when they accuse you of this &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;.</p>

<p>point them to the fact that they are accusing you of nothing. and move on....its an oxy moron.  how can you be planning  to implement a theory?</p>

<p>i have actually responded to people with this and they immediately shut up.....because the are so brain trained to respond to anything that causes thinking that it is usually always a &quot;conspiracy theory&#39;...its training.
thats where unfortunately i feel we need to start.</p>
