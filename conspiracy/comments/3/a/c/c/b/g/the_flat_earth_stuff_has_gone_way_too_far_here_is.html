        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Not that the goal wasn&#39;t unexpected, but there are efforts to link the flat earth sham with 9/11.  Pushing along these lines are the thoughts that no planes hit the buildings and that no one died that day.</p>

<p>OK, so ignore the ridiculousness and just consider what we have here.  The people pushing this, unwittingly or otherwise, are also making the claim that <em>they</em> are being shilled.</p>

<p>So what we have here is the classic divide and conquer tactic.  Shills have begun to push the paradigm that we live on a flat earth, somehow.....and people are buying into it because.....we just flat out (no pun intended) don&#39;t keep up on our knowledge base and we get lost in &quot;little mysteries&quot;.  As truth seekers, we love that shit and eat it up so......gobble gobble gobble.</p>

<p>Now, there are other people who don&#39;t believe this idea and would like to keep people from believing such an idea.  Those people are becoming the &quot;shills&quot; that are keeping this so called golden information from the rest of humanity.</p>

<p>As soon as you can discredit someone who believes 9/11 was an inside job because they are also pushing the idea that planes hit the towers because of this flat earth idea.......you can kiss any momentum by the movement goodbye.</p>

<p>This post is in an attempt to raise awareness to this potential issue and consider dealing with this issue somehow.  It may be slowly sucking whatever good standing we have out from under us.</p>

<p>Discuss?</p>

<p>EDIT - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYaeayjHSFM">Here is the video I had found connecting the two subjects together somehow.</a></p>

<p>EDIT - I also wanted to add another thought.  I liken this to the blue dress thing a while ago.  Someone said that was an attempt to get people never believe what they see ever again.  To soften them up against suggestion in the future.  People might always refer to the blue dress and say &quot;you can&#39;t always believe what you see, or your eyes, etc etc&quot; and then the precedent will be set.  This is the same kind of thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>sall good i just went back to the context to see how u didnt get it and i apologize for callin u a retard it put my comment off to the side I was saying maybe satellites dont exist I had no idea how many comments this has but outta respect heres a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/8o80eY3.png">screen shot of the context of my original response</a>
what are surgical spot assaults? and to be fair the 911 association video in regards to our airplane tracking is convincing as I have no actual knowledge what so ever except for that video,  therefor I have no opinion on it and dont really intend to dig into that theory because as you see i think the flat planet concept is ludicrous haha  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This post is telling you what and how to think. Flat Earth is real. One proof against any science experiment proving it wrong would negate a conclusion of any science experiment yet flat earthers have to give dozens and dozens. This is the one if you have an IQ over 100 you should be able to comprehend.</p>

<p>How the FUCK can you have Polaris the North star (which every navigator prior to 1900 used for travelling whether by boat or by land). ALWAYS every single fucking day of the year be THE star that all other stars rotate around in a circle with timelapse photography yet we are on a supposed 23.5 degree axis tilt that rotates 360 degrees every year. This would be nearly a 50 degree axis rotation yet it stays THE star that all others rotate around. Polaris would have to travel thousands of light years to maintain it&#39;s position as the north star. </p>

<p>If you cannot comprehend this you are absolutely the dumbest pile of shit on the planet and deserve what the military and local police are cooking up for you, I should know because I work at a different military base every week. They are up to Bravo and this will be escalated by yet another false flag. I just overheard a meeting today on how they will begin profiling civilians, what to look for in your style of dress, what you own, jewelry, the car you drive, how to visually break you down into a category and quickly etc. If you think I am pushing the flat earth to ignore the reality you are wrong I push truth and that is it. The lies are constant on this subreddit and I am about to leave.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not selling it it is not a story but agreed upon fact by any and all Astronomers that Polaris is the pole star the north pole star which all stars rotate around. Your globe theory states we are on a 23.5 degree axis tilt which supposedly accounts for the seasons 3rd grade science here bear with me if I go too fast. This tilt spins around 360 degrees in a years time by the globe theory. So how can Polaris still remain the north star that all the other stars rotate around 365 days out of the year without traveling back and forth where our pole would be pointing? It would literally have to travel thousands of light years and remain perfectly above our north pole as this tilt spins around each year. If you cannot see this as proof that we are not on a ball and that the stars spin around us perfectly the exact same every year I&#39;m not certain you have enough intelligence to attack the flat earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I keep waiting on this guy to reply to you, but I suspect that won&#39;t happen. He&#39;s going around calling everyone autistic for not knowing &quot;3rd grade globe science&quot; when his main assertion about polaris and the annual rotation of the earth&#39;s tilt is completely wrong. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just now hearing about this theory for the first time and I&#39;m a little wide eyed - this comment section seems like a joke. Are there any other points of &quot;evidence&quot; to support the flat earth theory, other than this crap about the north star and how the stars rotate perfectly around us?</p>

<p>I have tons of very quick and simple questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Why is everything that I can observe in the 3 dimensions of space round? Are the moon, planets, the sun, stars round because we are all coaster shaped disks that happen to be parallel to each other?</p></li>
<li><p>The south pole - why have we not observed the &quot;edge&quot; of the earth at any point. </p></li>
<li><p>Weather balloon photography</p></li>
<li><p>procession of the equinoxes - stars changing positions relative to each other</p></li>
<li><p>Coriolis effect</p></li>
<li><p>Tides</p></li>
<li><p>any image from space ever</p></li>
<li><p>Physics (is this a geocentric theory? How do we model this universe)</p></li>
<li><p>Seasons</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Those are just a few off the top of my head. I must say I find it rather amusing that we have a person calling this entire subreddit retarded 3 year olds for not believing that the earth is flight. Crazy world. </p>

<p>Good post OP - way to call it out. </p>

<p>I just REALLY don&#39;t like viewing others as primitive, or considering what I believe to be definitive truth. Of course, as you seem to be comfortable with, I am not perfect in that endeavor. In the grand scheme of things though, we are still horrendously un-intelligent and know so very little about the nature of reality. I think it is great to ponder such things about existence, but I don&#39;t think you should ever come to any definitive conclusions about things we are incapable of knowing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The tilt of the earth stays almost exactly the same throughout a year, the reason the northern and southern hemispheres have a summer and winter is because at one end of the earths yearly orbit around the sun, one hemisphere will be tilted towards the sun. Half a year later when the earth is at the opposite end of its orbit, the other hemisphere will be tilted towards the sun. This is because of earths orbit around the sun, not because the axis of tilt changes every year. Look up precession, it is the name for earths changing axial tilt, and it is a 25920 year cycle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I am one of the people you are referring to.  The premise that there are active agents attempting to discredit conspiracy theorists is absolutely correct.  The recent statements by David Cameron comparing those who question the official story for 7/7 to terrorists are extremely concerning.  The story about the contents of Bin Laden&#39;s library would be hilarious if I didn&#39;t think there were people who were buying it.</p>

<p>However jumping to the conclusion that the entire topic of flat earth is just a way to discredit conspiracy theorists is a problem.  I lurked this sub for a long time before making an account.  I finally decided to make an account and contribute specifically because of the flat earth, that is true.  I did this because I had spent some time looking into the issue and decided there was something there and I felt that it was not being represented well here.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to tell anyone what to think.  It is tiring to try and bring this particular conspiracy theory to people&#39;s attention.  Probably at some point I won&#39;t bother anymore.  It is so much easier to just say what everyone else is saying and get agreement and upvotes.  For me I want to know the truth for myself more than I want to inform other people.  </p>

<p>To be honest, I can&#39;t be certain that the standard flat earth model is correct.  But I am convinced that the earth cannot be a spinning globe as we are told.  I don&#39;t want to get into a back and forth about it in this thread, but i do encourage everyone to spend the time to research the topic themselves.  Look into NASA while you are at it.  Set aside your preconceived conclusions and give the arguments fair consideration.</p>

<p>If nothing else, think of it an exercise in logic and reasoning.  Do not accept dictated truths from anyone.  Consider what people say and make up your own mind.  Feel free to browse my post history if you like.  Also browse the post histories of the people who make it their campaign to rage against flat earth.  Make up your own mind.  If you have been around reddit for long you know how consensus in comments can be achieved.  Don&#39;t trust consensus, trust your own reasoning.</p>

<p>I have caught myself believing disinfo in the past like Niburu or aliens in flying saucers.  Once I realized who was pushing those topics and what evidence there was to back them up I was able to see the problems with how I had been approaching topics.  There are layers of deceit out there.  For a lot of topics I don&#39;t have absolute certainty.  If I really am a useful idiot promoting disinformation on the topic of flat earth, then I will have some major regrets later, but I do not think that is the case.  Please consider the evidence before you reach a conclusion.</p>

<p>Also, try this, it doesn&#39;t take long.  Google &quot;photo of earth&quot;.  Pick any one you like.  Now listen to this freemason science authority tell you about the shape of the earth, listen carefully to what he says:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoCKapivHGM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoCKapivHGM</a>  Does the &#39;photo&#39; you selected match his description?  Keep in mind he said that the earth is more than the height of everest wider at a point below the equator than it is at the equator.  Can you find a single &#39;photo&#39; that matches this description?  Now examine those &#39;photos&#39; again, are any of them actual photos?  If there are so many satellites up there, why can we not get real photos of earth?  If this contradiction doesn&#39;t pique your curiosity or shake your faith in corporate $cience then I wish you good luck. </p>

<p>Way to cherry pick to misinterpret what he said.</p>

<p>He even ends with <em>&quot;cosmicly speaking the Earth is practically a perfect sphere&quot;</em>, the opposite of how you are interpreting him.</p>

<p>His point is that technically the Earth is not a sphere. For example it bulges around the equator. However the Earth is so big that these features which makes it not a perfect sphere (like mountains and bulging around the equator) are insignificant.</p>

<p>There are actually experiments that you can perform yourself:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Proof that ships do not &quot;go down&quot; over the horizon.  Next time you are in a position to view a ship sailing away from you bring a telescope or binoculars.  Watch the ship with the naked eye until it has appeared to sink below the horizon completely.  Now use your magnifying device and see the ship come back into view.  The line between you and the ship was not blocked by curved water, you simply saw the ship reaching the vanishing point of your perspective.  (read on perspective if you don&#39;t know what I mean by this.)</p></li>
<li><p>Send a balloon or rocket up really high with a camera with a flat lens.  Note the flatness of the horizon, but equally important the fact that the horizon always rises to the level of the camera.  This is a feature of a flat plane.  On a globe the horizon must drop below eye level as you ascend.  You can observe some of these videos on youtube in addition to doing it yourself.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you blindly believe this page? Ok I&#39;m bored so lets dive in.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s just one that&#39;s wrong. Number 3, not correct. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verrazano%E2%80%93Narrows_Bridge#Description">One example: Verrazano Narrows Bridge</a></p>

<p>&quot;Because of the height of the towers (693 ft or 211 m) and their distance apart (4,260 ft or 1,298 m), the curvature of the Earth&#39;s surface had to be taken into account when designing the bridge—the towers are 1 5⁄8 inches (41.275 mm) farther apart at their tops than at their bases; they are not parallel to each other.[3][14]&quot;</p>

<p>Number 5 is really representative of this page it sadly seems. No math. No actual work to present. </p>

<p>&quot;according to the scale of the supposed &quot;curvature&quot; given by astronomers.&quot;
And that scale is?? </p>

<p>&quot;according. to theory, it ought to be nine-hundred feet higher above the level of the sea than it absolutely is, in order to be visible!&quot;
What theory? Where did this 900 feet come from? Where did the 40 miles come from? Nothing. </p>

<p>&quot;Whenever experiments have been tried on the surface of standing water, this surface has always been found to be level.&quot;
What experiments? Where? Anything??</p>

<p>Ah finally on number 6 we get a reference: &quot;as seen by Mr. J. Glaisher, of England, from Mr. Coxwell&#39;s balloon.&quot; The fuck?</p>

<p>Number 8 is apparently that sailors use maps and not massive three dimensional globes, so obviously the earth is flat. This one is particularly stupid considering sailor maps, not to mention the Mercator map itself, are designed 100% with the curvature of earth in mind. Or I guess every mapmaker in history is in on this as well. Clearly whoever wrote this knows absolutely nothing about ship navigation.</p>

<p>9: &quot;As mariners take to sea with them charts constructed as though the sea were a level surface&quot; Oh Christ. They don&#39;t. Next..</p>

<p>10: I have literally no idea why this person thinks a compass proves a flat Earth. Hell, dude probably doesn&#39;t even know the difference between magnetic and true north. If he did he could have, you now, told us how that factors in to his reasoning. Oh well.</p>

<p>11: &quot;As the mariners&#39; compass points north and south at one time, and as the North, to which it is attracted is that part of the Earth situated where the North Star is in the zenith&quot;
HAH! I knew it. The north star is at true north and is not specifically where the compass points. In fact, the North start is useful when it comes to calculating magnetic declination with a compass. Magnetic and true north- learn it, love it.</p>

<p>12: No idea what point is being made here.</p>

<p>13: Apparently does not understand how things work in 3 dimensions, which is really kind of sad. One could use something as simple as a coat hanger turned at an angle to show this point is totally incorrect.</p>

<p>14: &quot;The mariner&#39;s course in the direction of any one of these concentric circles is his longitude, the degrees of which INCREASE to such an extent beyond the equator (going southwards) that hundreds of vessels have been wrecked because of the false idea created by the untruthfulness of the charts and the globular theory together&quot;
Wait, so now sailors maps DO take into account the curvature of the Earth? I guess he changed his mind? And once again, no actual evidence of all these crashes or the reasons for them.</p>

<p>15: Says something is impossible even though it isn&#39;t. Does nothing to prove it&#39;s impossibility. Claims said impossibility proves him right. Sure buddy...</p>

<p>16: What? More he said she said nonsense.</p>

<p>17: This one is fantastic!</p>

<p>&quot;Human beings require a surface on which to live that, in its general character, shall be LEVEL; and since the Omniscient Creator must have been perfectly acquainted with the requirements of His creatures, it follows that, being an All-wise Creator, He has met them thoroughly. This is a theological proof that the Earth is not a globe.&quot;</p>

<p>BECAUSE GOD, duh!</p>

<p>18: This one is, seriously, &#39;I feel like I&#39;m level, therefore Earth is flat&#39;. I didn&#39;t think it was really possible, all things considering, but these &#39;proofs&#39; are going downhill fast.</p>

<p>19: I&#39;m not entirely sure, but I think this one is about how he doesn&#39;t understand projecting three dimensional surfaces on a a two dimensional plane. I mean, he can&#39;t possibly think something like the Mercator is literally cutting off the top and bottom half of the Earth, right? Right??</p>

<p>20: &quot;the theory of the astronomers is opposed to common sense,&quot; is not proof or evidence of anything. If it was I could just turn it right around on you and every other flat Earth believer. But, to be clear, evidence it is not.</p>

<p>21: See previous point at 20.</p>

<p>22: Now this is just getting stupid. &quot;Mr. Proctor, in his &quot; Lessons,&quot; says: Men &quot; have been able to go round and round the Earth in several directions.&quot; Now, in this case, the word several will imply more than two, unquestionably: whereas, it is utterly impossible to circumnavigate the Earth in any other than an easterly or a westerly direction&quot; I have no idea who &#39;Mr. Proctor&#39; is, but semantic arguments are the absolute bottom of the barrel. What is this supposed to prove exactly? By his logic he can only walk in two directions ever. Truth is you can go certain combinations of north/west/south/east. This isn&#39;t rocket science. I&#39;m sorry, but how dumb can you get. </p>

<p>23: Basically he says there&#39;s no proof the Earth is a globe so, umm, there is no proof. BOOM! Case closed.</p>

<p>All right I&#39;m going to stop here, but that was relatively entertaining. Maybe the actual honest to goodness proofs come later. Of course, in that case it should not be called &#39;100 proofs&#39; because it sure as hell isn&#39;t. I&#39;m honeslty a little amazed anyone would take this seriously, let alone actually use it to back up their claims in a debate. This is garbage.</p>

I am trying to show that you should not accept everything NASA presents without critically thinking about it.

<p>Is Neil Degrasse Tyson incorrect in his description or all the photos faked?  Why would he be lying do you think?  </p>

<p>I am not trying to rationalize the theory, I&#39;m not even discussing the theory.  I am asking you to confront your blind faith in authority by pointing out a contradiction between two authorities.  Would you agree that it cannot be both at least?

<p>If you believe there is not a contradiction there I encourage you to carefully listen to what Neil Degrasse Tyson is saying once more.  The photos cannot be rectified with a distortion as large as he is talking about.  Listen carefully to exactly what he is describing.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Of course, this is absolutely true.  I was not suggesting they did.  I was having a discussion with a person who unquestioningly believed everything dictated to them by official science.  I was trying to get them to a point of questioning before accepting by presenting two contradictory official sources.  </p>

<p>It is also true that disproving the globe model does not directly prove that any other particular model is correct.  It is far easier to disprove the globe than it is to prove the flat earth model.</p>

<p>Could you maybe explain it to me in your own words? Because we don&#39;t seem to understand the same things the same way. Because you&#39;ve linked some stuff that seem totally ridiculous to me, but you seem to think they are really convincing.</p>

<p>Or the 100 proofs (<a href="http://www.oocities.org/lclane2/hundrede.html">http://www.oocities.org/lclane2/hundrede.html</a>). Most of them are just nonsensical, but some are even willfully ignorant on top:</p>

<p>They can actually. Let&#39;s take a look at the actual numbers involved. The polar radius is measured to be 6,356.7523 km, while the equatorial radius is measured to be 6,378.1370. That works out to be a 0.3% difference, indiscernable to your eye. Let&#39;s take a look at a plot with an ellipse of these dimensions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have not even gotten to the topic of flat earth.  Discussing it is pointless with someone who blindly believe truths dictated to them from authorities.  Obviously there must be lying by authorities for it to be possible.  Do you believe the official story on 9/11?  If not, what is so special about NASA that puts their material beyond any critical scrutiny?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no contradiction. He is not saying the Earth is flat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those are 2 very different statements.  Again, I&#39;m not even talking about flat earth.  Are you saying there is no contradiction between Neil Degrasse Tyson&#39;s description of the shape of the earth and the &#39;photos&#39; that are available?  Listen to him again carefully.  The size of the distortion from a sphere that he is describing cannot be explained away by atmosphere.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They do not contradict, it is your comprehension/understanding that is the problem here. You also keep talking about NASA without addressing the fact that tens of thousands of people across continents and over decades have/have had the ability to verify the Earth is not flat and that the scientific consensus is correct. Thousands upon thousands of people all over the world, decade after decade, launching satellites, performing experiments, doing jobs that require taking the curvature of the earth into account. None of them working for NASA. NASA could lie all it wanted to and there would be hundreds of other sources to knock them down. This is why the previous poster said your theory requires a massive conspiracy involving hundreds of thousands of people from differnt decades, continents, countries, ideologies, religions and much more all acting in unison to further a massive conspiracy for some unknown reason. If the Earth is flat then that, as absolutely ridiculous as it would be, is a fact. I guess the North Koreans have been working us all along.</p>

<p>From the article itself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To defeat ISIL – and organisations like it - we must defeat this ideology in all its forms. </p>

<p>As evidence emerges about the backgrounds of those convicted of terrorist offences, it is clear that many of them were initially influenced by preachers who claim not to encourage violence, but whose world view can be used as a justification for it. We know this world view. </p>

<p>The peddling of lies: that 9/11 was a Jewish plot or that the 7/7 London attacks were staged. The idea that Muslims are persecuted all over the world as a deliberate act of Western policy. The concept of an inevitable clash of civilisations.</p>

<p>We must be clear: to defeat the ideology of extremism we need to deal with all forms of extremism – not just violent extremism. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Essentially it&#39;s saying &quot;If you agree with the narrative that the war on terror is a hoax or a cover then you should be considered a terrorist or potential future terrorist&quot; - and, as we well know, the definition of &quot;terrorism&quot; has now changed from &quot;use of fear to manipulate opinion or decision&quot; (i.e. what governments do) to &quot;any and all dissent against the established governing body&quot;</p>

<p>Honestly, it&#39;s more saddening people eat up this garbage rather than looking up the definition of a simple word. What&#39;s more startling is the fact that all the fighting is taking place over 2000 miles away with us as the invaders, yet people believe they pose an imminent threat.</p>

<p>I think my favourite part of that was &quot;The idea that Muslims are persecuted all over the world as a deliberate act of Western policy&quot;, which not only is a historic fact, but kind of implies that they&#39;re accidentally targeting Muslim populations and accidentally slaughtering a fuck-tonne of citizens while hunting down potential terrorists. &quot;It&#39;s not deliberate, we just got confused...&quot;</p>

<p>This is a conspiracy forum, flat earth is a conspiracy. I see nothing wrong with it being discussed here. I&#39;m actually intrigued by it. Do I believe it? No, but will I entertain the idea/look more into it? Sure, like all should do for any topic. </p>

<p>Maybe they just aren&#39;t interested, doesn&#39;t mean they are shills or anything. If you think about it, being spiritual or thinking differently would put you on another level of thinking, ie this life doesn&#39;t matter. Maybe they are seeking higher enlightenment, not the garbage here on earth. Just saying...</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Could be, but I&#39;m not a shill, read my post history. I saw some posts about the flat earth (I&#39;m curious and open minded) and decided to check it out. I&#39;m entertaining the thought. There are some things that make me question it, the moon landing being a huge one. What&#39;s the harm in that? I wouldn&#39;t of questioned it, if they wouldn&#39;t of posted it. That is how ideas spread and how people learn. It could be absolutely bunk, but atleast I checked it out myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem angry. The original point of this sub was to talk about all conspiracies, not just &quot;the Bush family are criminals&quot;. Yes, it&#39;s evolved over time, but a conspiracy theory is a conspiracy theory.

<p>If it was, that would re-write history and everything we know and SCIENCE CAN EXPLAIN, FTW. The Bushes&#39; being criminals is small beans compared to that. Why are you all so vehemently opposed to people talking about it? If you think it&#39;s non sense, DV and move on. Yet, you wanna bash everyone who talks about it and label them as primeval cave man. The Egyptians believed it and they also built structures you couldn&#39;t. They were smarter than you are, so why not explore the idea?</p>

<p>Sorry,don&#39;t mean to make it look like im railing against you as i agree with the sentiment of never outright dismissing things without examining evidence first.

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the problem.  Flat Earth Theory has ALWAYS been satire to specifically make fun of pseudoscience.  It was never an actual theory- it was created as a way of pointing out the ridiculousness of bad science.  Conspiracy Theory is considered pseudoscience in the scientific context, so pushing &quot;Flat Earth&quot; as a parody and trying to get people to believe it, is like trying to get someone to take an Onion article seriously so you can point out how stupid they are.</p>

<p>This is a campaign being used to discredit.  It&#39;s clever and silly and has a historical reference-</p>

<p>Wow, I just visited the Wiki article on flat earth and it has been completely rewritten in the past year to make this appear as a legitimate theory rather than a club that was specifically devoted to mocking pseudoscience. </p>

<p>This is the new &quot;reptilian aliens&quot;.  </p>

Instead of being so closedminded and childish how about you try negating their bulletpoints with fact as....oh that&#39;s right because that would take effort and work and to lazy hacks like most of you its much easier to just say it&#39;s crazy because you were taught some
Idiocy back in elementary school you deem gospel even though 90% of what you actually were taught has been openly proven as wrong and/or a flat out lie.  This idiotic tactic to try and tie 9/11 and flat earth theory together is just normal shill tactics like that traitor Obama tying the shooting in Carolina to gun control because it&#39;s a perfect way to hide or discredit the real issue(which is mental illness in the shooting). I&#39;m not gonna say the earth is flat or round but I&#39;ll never be so closedminded and tied to an idea NO ONE can or has proven, until we as a free public have the ability to man our own capsules to go into outer space ourselves the idea of anyone claiming the earth is one way or another is laughably arrogant and idiotic.</p>

<p>A legit shill on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> would be the zionists ruling the world crap which is literally, barely touching the surface of the deception going on. If only you guys knew, how deceived we are, the entire world, its reality paradigm changing. </p>

<p>The reason why this whole flat earth thing is gaining traction is that because, believe it or not, there are quite a few smaller subreddits dedicated to seeking truth, and people are starting to find out on these other smaller subreddits.</p>

The horizon, from the perspective of a human at sea level is FLAT, not curved. That is why refer to a perfectly flat line/plane as &quot;horizontal&quot;.</p>

<p>Secondly, if you are trying to prove the Earth is &quot;round&quot;, then that would make you a flat earther. The Earth is spherical (or an oblate spheroid to be precise).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may know it&#39;s &quot;round&quot; but that&#39;s not how it appears. Go to the beach. Put a ruler up to the horizon - you will see that it&#39;s a single flat line, ie it is &quot;horizontal&quot; - the clue is in the name. This because your eyes and the furthest things you can see are all at virtually the same level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a new field of science coming about called Plasma Cosmology, this seems a lot more realistic then the fantastical theories of General Relativity and or other variants. It kind of ties into Atlantis a bit because there are a host of theories with regards to earth&#39;s turbulent past, the big one being that Saturn being our previous host brown dwarf Star with Venus, Mars being our solar planets until about 13,000 years ago until we came into proximity with this known solar system with our present sun. Not 100% sure if its real but it seems to tie into the globalist blue print to move us towards more renewable sources of energy, ie Globalist corporation is now pushing Tesla hot wheel vehicles and propagating cleaner sources of energy on the masses. </p>

<p>I think the old dichotomy of limited energy is going to be slowly eroded away and a mass reveal is going to come about with regards to past discoveries of high energy efficient production methodologies, and the revelation space is highly electrically charged rather then present presumption that space is a null dead zone, which helps to explain comet phenomenom and why the rovers on Mars are still kicking around(ie, electrically charged dust storms on its surface, electrical machining into the planets surface). It also being shown presently that highly charged particles from our sun flow through electromagnetic filaments which interact with earth&#39;s electromagnetic fields and transfer massive amounts of energy to it afflicting us with auroras and electrically charged weather phenomenon. In fact NASA has already shown all the planets in our solar system experience auras at their magnetic poles and that regardless of the square law of light the weather on all planets in our solar system changes in tandem with the Sun. The other thing I learned was that electromagnetism is the strongest force in our universe, 10 to the power 48 stronger then gravity wherein gravity is the weakest known force in the Universe. In GE in the paper theory it states gravity to be the dominant force because it permeates everything, but the joke there is that so does electromagnetism, even from &quot;black holes&quot; in the paper theory have been found to be the strongest known electromagnetic fields we&#39;ve ever found in the observable universe and these so called black vacuums are actually black suns because of the massive amount of energy flowing through them and the massive amounts of energy they consistently spew. The energy discharge observation alone has forced the vanguard of General Relativity(GE, Einstein) with the likes of Hawking to continually rewrite GE paper theories from black holes which infinitely suck in energy to ones which jettison it often. </p>

<p>Truly an exciting time to be alive!

<p>Other than it being obviously and meticulously constructed to discredit any serious conspiracy research? The entire theory and it&#39;s adherents <em>just happen</em> to be the quintessential example of everything the &#39;tards and skeptics claim conspiracy researchers are?</p>

<p>Especially since it&#39;s clear that the flat earth narrative is less concerned with fact, and more concerned with acting as much like the prevailing stereotype of conspiracy theorists as possible. </p>

<p>I think a small cabal of &#39;tards got tired of being proven wrong about who conspiracy researchers are, and decided to &#39;false flag&#39; the community with an agenda they assume conspiracy researchers wouldn&#39;t be able to resist. Then once enough &#39;genuine&#39; conspiracy researchers buy into it and start promoting it, bam. Point and laugh (via the MSM most likely) and say &quot;see, I told you they&#39;re crazy&quot;. </p>

<p>Think that sounds far fetched? They already do that in this sub now with the rabid anti-Jew talk. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel the same. I&#39;ve entertained the Flat Earth Theory. Doesn&#39;t mean I believe it. But I will say this: Conspiracy Theorists don&#39;t, in most instances, have any trust in the government. In order for the Round Earth Theory to be legitimate, you&#39;d have to have 100% faith in NASA. I personally believe NASA is a hoax and I don&#39;t understand how NASA is the <em>only</em> government entity that some people have faith in. CGI can do wonders. How do you truly know that every bit of footage we&#39;ve seen from NASA wasn&#39;t, essentially, a movie?</p>

<p>I think the Cold War/Space Race was a hoax to get people on board with Capitalism. &quot;See, we&#39;re better than those Commies, hurr durr, &#39;Merica!&quot;</p>

<p>The world is a stage, everything is a show. <a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thetruthaboutthelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/William_Casey_CIA_Disinformation_Campaign.jpg">Everything we &quot;know&quot; (Mainstream) is probably at the other end of the truth spectrum.</a>. Question everything. Even the Flat vs Round Earth theories. Don&#39;t get so worked up like <a href="/u/HaltNWO">/u/HaltNWO</a>. That dude is a shill beyond belief. His life goal is to debunk Flat Earth and 9/11, with a little Sandy Hook and Boston Marathon sprinkled in there, yet he calls himself a &quot;CT&quot; and refers to this sub as &quot;us.&quot; It&#39;s laughable.</p>

<p>This country is waking up, that&#39;s why TPTB are accelerating the TPP, the civil unrest, the false flags shootings. They&#39;re accelerating this shit, because we&#39;re waking up. Who gives a fuck if a few retards on the internet associate Flat Earth &quot;retards&quot; with 9/11 truthers? Those people are so far gone, the government could hold a press conference and say they&#39;ve been fucking us this whole time and they&#39;ll still defend the proverbial Master&#39;s Whip. Fuck them. Let them live in their stupidity.</p>

Or the experiments you can do on your own.
Nope, its quick make fun of the thing that sounds dumb bc its an easy target..
For thousands of years everyone knew the earth was flat.
Not just one culture, all of them.
And i love when people discredit our ancestors..
Yea those people who built those things that we cant even build now if we tried...yea they were dumb as shit. 
Aliens must of helped them...
My favorite thing to do in my free time is to watch live Nasa feeds from the International Space Station and watch all the BUBBLES fly up from their suits..
Or watch them kick their feet in deep space to propel themselves...hmmm 
I wonder why is space is a vacume and earth is not and how that makes sense? A vacume by definition cannot be at all surrounded by a non vacume.. 
So when you travel up into space at one moment your in earth atmosphere and one second your POP in a VACUME! See thats a scientific flaw, but you know who cares USA USA USA!!
O yea why do flights in the southern hemmisphere magically lose all gps tracking info? You can check that but you wont, youll just make a corny unoriginal joke.
My favorite is the astroNOT from the luner misson explaining how he is distorting the view of the earth by turning the lignts off and shooting thru the window!! Facts...
Van Ellen who?
&quot;Well the van allen belt wasnt discovered yet so we werent affected&quot;
-nasa luner misson astroNOT
AND WE CAN SEE A PIMPLE OF PLUTOS ASSCRACK BUT WE CANT GET A REAL NON COMPOSITE PICTURE OF OUR OWN EARTH!
Every single picture of earth is factually a compossite as explained by Nasa themselves!
And why in the LIVE Earth footage from space is the earth supposively rotationg yet THE CLOUD FORMATIONS REMAIN THE SAME!!!!</p>

But I guess if we&#39;re going off ancient cultures who also believe that the sun is a God or pulled by a god&#39;s chariot for fucksake,then sure let&#39;s believe that blind faith holds more weight than MATH.</p>

<p>Ancient ignorance is only interesting because it shows where we as human beings were in relation to where we are intellectually.</p>

<p>ISS footage of earth</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s surprising, but please google &#39;images of earth.&#39; For all the thousands of satellite we have orbiting this planet, we can only find such a small pool of stills of Earth. The most popular image of Earth is an image taken over 40 years ago. Is it not absurd to come to the open plausibility that ISS footage can be faked? Do we have to believe everything that the television shows us? They don&#39;t call it programming for nothing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>regular people launching up balloons with gopros and showing again the earth is round.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>GoPros are notorious for using fish eye lenses that distort the image. It&#39;s kinda like looking at images of apartment rooms and they look huge, only to realize once you get to the place its extremely small, due to the fisheye lens. And btw, I have seen multitude of videos of DIY balloons reaching 185,000 ft+ and guess what, the horizon is FLAT. There are tons of videos of this. Please do not let the fish eye lens fool you into thinking its curved.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that I am no way shape or form saying that the Earth is a flat square. I have no idea the shape of this planet. </p>

<p>As for the other &#39;planets&#39; and the amateur telescope video, it&#39;s an interesting field and will need to look further into astrophotographers video evidence of the planets. </p>

<p>Ahh, which is exactly what TPTB want us to think, they&#39;re frigging nihilists after all. A lot easier to manipulate people that way, to say that we&#39;re all just stardust and we randomly came into existence :P</p>

<p>I bet to differ, a lot of ancient cultures were adept in mathematics, astronomy, and other fields. Really wish people looked into ancient cultures instead of relying on National Geographic TV telling us how ancient cultures were uncivilized, which is the furthest from the truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at all this discussion, and all these comments, telling <strong>you</strong> what to think about something <em>they don&#39;t want you to even look at</em>.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t learned to spot that behavior by now, that should be what you look out for every time.</p>

<p>Even in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, so many condemn and marginalize that which they will not even investigate. I foolishy dismissed the idea for years. When I tried to look at the topic seriously, I ended up becoming a Flat Earther.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a real person, I really believe the Flat Earth model explains all of my lifetime of observations more coherently than the spherical model, and you have to give it to the heliocentrists: their brainwashing matrix is so powerful that they have actually convinced you there&#39;s nothing to see here!</p>

<p>I compiled a <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/393icm/whats_all_this_flat_earth_stuff_about_anyway/">Flat Earth Primer</a> to help anyone get started on the topic if they&#39;re actually interested.</p>

<p>Note that this is deep down the rabbit hole. If 1960s special effects can still convince you that we can land men on the moon, you aren&#39;t looking for the truth with a critical eye yet, and should research the subject more.</p>

<p>&quot;One of the saddest lessons of history is this: if we&#39;ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We&#39;re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It&#39;s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we&#39;ve been taken. <strong>Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back.</strong>&quot; - Carl Sagan</p>

<p>A fun thing to think about is that on a quantum level, there is a flat, and also a hollow earth, and also a flat and hollow earth. Because we thought about it, I don&#39;t care if that isn&#39;t a stable system or could support life. That&#39;s why it&#39;s also hollow, the surface is too extreme.

    <div class="md"><p>regardless of what your opinions on the flat earth theory, it dosnt matter, its irelevant to the fact that 9/11 was in fact an inside Job. I was hoping you would provide links, proofs and a thesable argment to back your claims. but its nothing but conjecture, its a rant and nothing more. I was hoping you had some relevant info, but this make you worse then flat earthers, because at least they are more than happy to supply information which explains their belief, unlike you.</p>

<p>I do not think the earth is flat but just because you do not agree does not mean that we should censor ourselves? I mean its hilarious because in one frame of mind this sub thinks its a disinformation campaign, which it sure looks like. In the other its just an idea someone shared and got attacked like you said Bush is an angel or something to that affect. Anyways why would we censor ourselves? I just dun get et. </p>

I can answer it for myself. I am not 100% sure of ANYTHING. But I am willing to at least entertain the idea that I could be wrong because more than likely I might be.

<p>I&#39;m saying that the recent push the flat earth movement has been receiving is most likely inauthentic.</p>

<p>I heard someone talk about it in real life a couple weeks ago, it was the first time I had heard it mentioned outside of an online conspiratorial community. It could be a coincidence, but it seems like this topic is being helped along by outside influences, which could be anyone from deep state agents to members of conspiratard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>conspiratard are the ones always debunking flat earth theorists. </p>

<p>flat earth comments are almost always thumbed down to oblivion. If it is an outside force, they are doing a terrible job at it.</p>

<p>This is not inauthentic, but organic. People are questioning every little factoid they shove to us in public and parochial schools. </p>

<p>I tend to question everything. I don&#39;t like government agencies pushing an image onto me stating &#39;this is what earth looks like.&#39; Doesn&#39;t still well with me, know what we know that governmental agencies are not to be trusted.</p>

<p>oh and btw, the flat earth society is controlled opposition. It was either created or infiltrated by Masons. One of the founders proudly wears his masonic ring in one photo. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have posted this response in another topic but it also fits in here very well:</p>

<p>I think this all goes a bit deeper. To be honest right from the beginning, I am a round earth believer and I know that not all flat earth believers are stupid (not everyone is parrotting nonsense s/he heard from a friend which read something on the internet what a friend saw on youtube). I think this all is just part of a huge controlled disinformation campaign in order to make people resistant for the upcoming disclosure and the massive information dump which is to come linked to this. Because if one gets the masses to disbelief in science and get them to not being able to distinguish honest and true science from fakes, then the masses also won’t believe in disclosure and other true informations coming out. Lots of us are looking for informations, and at some point you will come across the illuminati &amp; cabal groups, and if you are up to date you’ll probably know about the sphere alliance and the SSP’s. It is obvious (at least to me and many others) that the cabal groups have infiltrated the conspiracy theorists and it seems this is all well prepared. People around the globe are slowly waking up and are realizing that somethings not right here. People know that NASA, our politicians, the media, schools and what have you weren’t always truthful and honest. So I believe that this huge disinformation effort is to discredit science with the weaopns of the conspiracy theorists. It is basically their last stand because they know if that doesn’t work they, the cabal group, will be history. But no matter what, this time they’ll lose anyway. I have read a lot about flat earth theory and in every forum, and on youtube etc. at some point the flat earthers are fighting fiercly with the round earthers about their beliefs. This tactic is old, very old and it seems to work on us almost every time unless someone notices it. Not only on this topic but also on many others. Get the people to fight each other so they don’t care about the one initiating all of this. I think what we should focus on is prevent this useless namecalling, fighting, insulting and so on because aggression does not get you anywhere in this discussion. No one knows everything and the one who claims to know everything is a liar. Only full disclosure is real disclosure and anything other than that will be orchestrated by the cabal groups. Its as easy as that. Technically we could be much further than we are at the moment and if the real full disclosure occurs we have to be able to distinguish the fake from the real thing.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to start to explain details of this because I wouldn&#39;t be able to do this as good as the ones who are doing this for years. But I can provide some links so you can research for yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I couldn&#39;t care less about how I &#39;came across&#39; if it was physically possible for me to do it. You are skewing the actual situation here, this is about stifling the &#39;flow of free disinformation&#39;. Nobody with more than a highschool level of education will ever back this flat earth crap. It&#39;s a bunch of non-scientist (no-brained as well) people, guppies really, who are easily fooled into believing anything. Did launching of satellites, spacecrafts and GPS technology not come into thought with your skepticism of flat-earth theory? If you can understand how those technological feats dispose of flat-earth theory than there is no chance for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dawg, you&#39;re missing the big picture here. Literally. If you&#39;re going to go with the whole flat earth thing you&#39;re going to need to include a few other theories:
-We&#39;re the... 5-7th generation of humans (as in wiped out, start over)
-Aliens
-Blue Beam</p>

<p>Here&#39;s why you need those: Having other advanced human civilizations is how we got our fake moon that our ancestors in this generation talk about. Even if the moon is also flat. Those previous generations made it, and never actually left earth/the &quot;moon&quot;. When the Nazis perfected their electro magnetic space craft down in Antarctica, they met these people beings, and are what our boys would have run into if they did go up there, regardless of Kubrick making the footage for television. They from those generations are just so far advanced it&#39;d be like if the NWO went with the Georgia Guidestones and hid themselves in a veil of technology (even if that&#39;s just underground bases) while those left restart with the basics, under the guidance and technology might of the new invisible elite. Maybe even fancy themselves as gods.</p>

<p>Anyway, part of how we got all that technology is the aliens that have been visiting this planet for all these cycles. I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re Annunaki, Pleiadians, Hyper Dimensional Beings, &quot;Angels&quot; (aliens.), or whatever passed as the old gods from antiquity, but they give us tech, whether willingly or through reverse engineering.</p>

<p>Which leads us to Project Blue Beam and the main thing you need to string together with Flat Earth theory. It&#39;s all a projected hologram. The night sky, the moon as we know it (which is why it keeps refreshing, look it up), ISS being &quot;up there&quot;, all of it. When Jesus comes and the Aliens invade to bring about the NWO and &quot;unite&quot; everyone, don&#39;t believe it. It&#39;s just Blue Beam. The aliens wouldn&#39;t invade like that. So behind the times.</p>

<p>NOW you can troll with style!</p>

Most of the people that claimed to see the ISS through their telescopes and providing proof, a lot of them are/were associated with NASA or employees of traditional print media with close ties to NASA.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m amused by this stuff. That there are some conspiracy ideas that are just a bit too far.</p>

<p>For me the idea of a flat earth, moon landing conspiracy, Boston bombing hoax and 9/11 inside job are all equally baseless.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand why it would be difficult for a person that believes one or some of these not-widely-accepted theories, most of which involve the idea of large-scale high-level cover ups, to accept that other people might genuinely believe other not-widely-accepted conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>Is it really that much less likely that scientists around the world are covering up the flat earth than, say, scientists around the world are wilfully overlooking the apparently blatant physical impossibilities inherent in the collapse of the Twin Towers?</p>

<p>What about climate change? Do you believe in man made climate change? (Hard to guess, opinion on that here seems pretty divided) - that being a hoax is certainly no more likely than a flat earth.</p>

But i&#39;ve never heard of a PhD holder ever coming out in favor of a flat earth. Or is inherently giving faith to licensed [proven &#39;experts in their fields&#39;] people just as silly?

<p>Since we live in reality where the earth IS round or egg like or whatever you prefer, then we have a problem with people running around spewing this as if it is true.  Wouldn&#39;t you say?  Or is it better to support baseless theories and almost encourage it?</p>

<p>We should be discouraging this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel the same. I&#39;ve entertained the Flat Earth Theory. Doesn&#39;t mean I believe it. But I will say this: Conspiracy Theorists don&#39;t, in most instances, have any trust in the government. In order for the Round Earth Theory to be legitimate, you&#39;d have to have 100% faith in NASA. I personally believe NASA is a hoax and I don&#39;t understand how NASA is the <em>only</em> government entity that some people have faith in. CGI can do wonders. How do you truly know that every bit of footage we&#39;ve seen from NASA wasn&#39;t, essentially, a movie?</p>

<p>I think the Cold War/Space Race was a hoax to get people on board with Capitalism. &quot;See, we&#39;re better than those Commies, hurr durr, &#39;Merica!&quot;</p>

<p>The world is a stage, everything is a show. <a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thetruthaboutthelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/William_Casey_CIA_Disinformation_Campaign.jpg">Everything we &quot;know&quot; (Mainstream) is probably at the other end of the truth spectrum.</a>. Question everything. Even the Flat vs Round Earth theories. Don&#39;t get so worked up like <a href="/u/HaltNWO">/u/HaltNWO</a>. That dude is a shill beyond belief. His life goal is to debunk Flat Earth and 9/11, with a little Sandy Hook and Boston Marathon sprinkled in there, yet he calls himself a &quot;CT&quot; and refers to this sub as &quot;us.&quot; It&#39;s laughable.</p>

<p>This country is waking up, that&#39;s why TPTB are accelerating the TPP, the civil unrest, the false flags shootings. They&#39;re accelerating this shit, because we&#39;re waking up. Who gives a fuck if a few retards on the internet associate Flat Earth &quot;retards&quot; with 9/11 truthers? Those people are so far gone, the government could hold a press conference and say they&#39;ve been fucking us this whole time and they&#39;ll still defend the proverbial Master&#39;s Whip. Fuck them. Let them live in their stupidity.</p>
