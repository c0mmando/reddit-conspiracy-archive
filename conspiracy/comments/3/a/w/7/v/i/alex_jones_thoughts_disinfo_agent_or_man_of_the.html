<p>Also, if Alex Jones is a disinfo agent...then the whole Bohemian Grove ceremony he exposed would be disinfo. I&#39;m fairly new to the reddit/online conspiracy forums community, but I heard about Jones a few years ago.</p>

<p>So what do you guys think about Alex Jones and infowars?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are there in the alt media to attract certain audiences. Say a person is sick of MSM, they are either more conservative and go to Glenn Beck or more libertarian and go to Alex Jones. These are the power houses in alt media. Once they get their audience in with good information, they poison the well with misinformation. This is the idea of a gatekeeper. Keep your audience in with 9 truths but the 10th is a lie and it&#39;s the most important. </p>

<p>Alex Jones and Glenn Beck will talk about certain things, but never go beyond that into the realms of truth. Alex rants and Glenn cries, both of their audiences enjoy it. Neither of them will talk about Zionism and the real cabals behind the curtain. They cover it a little, but never give you enough to propel yourself into higher knowledge, hence gatekeeper of information.</p>

<p>So, what you have is more radical/fundamentals in the Jones clique and more docile conservatives in the Beck clique and you have us in the middle who knows they are both gatekeepers. Divide and conquer my friend.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/">https://www.corbettreport.com/</a></p>

<p>You can also look at some of these  scores of other alternative sources.</p>

<p>Many of these are nearly as bad as Jones, some worse, but some are  great alternatives.
 At the least you get a huge choice.</p>

<p>And I know for a fact that he prints absolute unfactual garbage. I backtracked an article he published once and the ultimate original source turned out to be a foreign language vedic website that had no evidence for their original piece. I sent Infowars an email detailing my findings. They never acknowledged my email and they didn&#39;t retract their garbage article.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s what ZetaTalk said about Alex Jones in the context of responding to absolute video proof of chemtrails. (The video was taken down, but see link for screencaps):  <a href="http://www.zetatalk.com/ning/03ma2014.htm">http://www.zetatalk.com/ning/03ma2014.htm</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&amp;nbsp; This revealing video was taken at night, when the [chemtrail] operation assumed cover of darkness, and in a fog which was likewise assumed to be more cover. Thus the pilot abandoned normal precautions. It was also taken in LA, a large city targeted by the chemtrail operation. Such vidoes, which show absolutely that chemtrailing is being done, and where and how, are a huge threat to the operation. Thus any video revealing the operation is hunted down and killed, as one Nancy referred to in a 2009 newsletter. Since this 2014 video had gone viral on the Internet, they allowed a bit of the footage on Alex Jones website, InfoWars, included in a debunking video. What all this shows is that 1. Chemtrailing is very real, and 2. <strong>Alex Jones is a puppet of the establishment</strong>.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My sense is that Alex Jones is losing importance, as a media figure. He&#39;s a dynamic little fuck, but that only goes so far. He has an excellent memory, but you should watch him try to do simple arithmatic in his head! It&#39;s pathetic. He doesn&#39;t really want to be a leader, he wants to build a media empire. The fact that he won&#39;t criticize Jewish power in America says it all. He&#39;s dishonest.</p>
