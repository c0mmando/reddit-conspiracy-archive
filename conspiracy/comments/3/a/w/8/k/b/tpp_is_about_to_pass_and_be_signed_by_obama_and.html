       The problem is, MOST PEOPLE ARENT LIKE THOSE ON REDDIT. While we sit here, scratching our heads wondering how in the fuck can people possibly pay attention to this garbage. MILLIONS of people are paying attention to this garbage. I haven't turned on or watched a tv channel in years now, yet the elderly, the 'baby boomers' the largest proportion of our population and the largest proportion of voters HAVE WATCHED THIS GARBAGE THEIR ENTIRE LIFE. As a 20 year old with 60 year old parents(im adopted) they can't even comprehend the generational gap. My mom fucking
       <em>
        lives
       </em>
       for the Young and Restless, and my dad can sit and watch CNN all day everyday. Hell when I was younger and told them about Reddit they banned me from the Internet thinking I was gonna lure some child molester to our house or something. AND THESE ARE THE PEOPLE RUNNING OUR COUNTRIES.

       One of the main reasons I can see their shit very well, is that we lived overseas for years. Gives you a whole new perspective on the unfreedom that is the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       And we also wish to retire abroad. I cannot tell you how harrowing it is becoming to try to move anything more than pocket change out of the country. It's downright frightening, if you want to take some money with you to live on, it's very very risky.

       They are closing the exits. And I mean that in the deepest sincerest sense. What we really have is a form of soft exit control, what has been known in other cultures in other times as 'exit visas'. The only part we're missing here now is the actual permission slip itself.

       You need to stop paying for it. Start watching all your shows online for free and listening to podcasts. Meet some online friends who share different views and really learn about the world. I'd also suggest gaining a cool hobby/life skill as you can meet a lot of new and interesting people there as well. Expand your world views and mind my friend.

       It's not that his advice isn't bad, it's the fact the guy didn't ask for it and didn't even seemed like he needed it, but this guy decided to push his opinions and lifestyle on him as if he's got it all figured out and the other guy doesn't.

       Yeah reading it through again, it was impromptu, seemingly unwanted advice. I'm admittedly biased though, I like most of those podcasts and the ones I haven't tried, I will be trying out soon.

       I can tell you now, the people I've met in person are usually more enjoyable to talk to than most of the social retards I end up conversing with online. You've made an assumption that just because he pays for cable TV he needs to open his mind. It's honestly not that big of a deal and having a cable subscription doesn't make him a sheep. There are plenty of openminded people with active lives who watch TV.

       You've misunderstood everything I've said. First off he states how he watches "News" to see what others are "Watching." The best way in my opinion is to do this by bullshitting with a bunch of morons on skype. I suggested "Online" because he works from home. Second everyone should be actively opening their mind no matter how old they are they SHOULD be learning new life skills and gaining new experiences. This was general advice I'd give to pretty much anyone when I stated he needs some hobbies... Everyone needs hobbies and what better hobby is there than a new hobby?

       Why would you think it wouldn't when none of us did a god damn thing? There are numerous disadvantages to being a member of the conspiracy community but the worst by far is that we know so much and yet don't do anything about it. There are even fights because people think one issue is actually a distraction from another. They don't need to distract us because we aren't a threat. Stop trying to get other people to wake up when we're the ones that need to. Let's come together and make some real change otherwise all of this is meaningless.

       The problem with your argument is that the only way to make a difference in politics from outside the political system is to either:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Have lots of money
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Mobilize tremendous amounts of voters
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Since we don't have lots of money, our only option is to mobilize people on a large-scale. Some (~30%) of people have a hard time believing me when I tell them the new regulations imposed from the leaked text of the TPP. They cannot even fathom the idea that people in power consider their interests above the collective good. And others still are too ignorant or foolish to care.

       The only thing the darkness fears is the light. We don't need money or power to defeat corruption because that would just put us in a position to start the cycle all over again. What we need is an American mainstream news platform which is operated by average citizens that will speak truthfully about issues like TPP without being labeled as a conspiracy group. The word conspiracy has become synonymous with crazy while you can call anything news and it becomes fact and law. If we can get the word out there on a grander scale with these conditions then we can repair anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at Sepp Blatter's resignation. That was a huge step forward for the conspiracy community because that was achieved from spreading the word alone. No power or money was used to achieve this. All that happened was the news picked up the story and when enough people became aware of what was going on, there was no choice but to resign. The elite don't need to be forced into behaving, they just need a light to be shown on their deeds and then they can't go through with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another example of this is Edward Snowden. If the Guardian never picked up the story of his leaks, they never would have shown it as front page news on all the major news networks and the NSA would probably be a million times worse because they would be operating entirely in secret. We need to get the word out but on a mass scale and without the conspiracy connotation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russell Brand's Trews has made gigantic leaps and has forced politicians to come face to face with their corruption. However, the problems are that 1. very few Americans know about his program and 2. many people who have seen the program don't trust it because they consider Russell to be the elite due to his celebrity status and wealth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any one of us could start such a news source at any time but we don't because we would rather sit in our comfort zone complaining to ourselves within our own little conspiracy bubble. Sharing this information with each other isn't going to do anything. Sharing this information with your friends and family isn't going to do anything. The only thing that will is if the entire world knows our message like it was written in the history books.

      <p>
       I agree about the darkness fearing the light. But I'm not really sure how you foresee starting a national mainstream news platform without money. You'd need to higher reporters, anchors, producers, AV guys, plus equipment, building, etc. Then, if you want it truly mainstream, either radio towers or somehow get it on cable/satellite. Do you really think Comcast is going to let you have a channel which constantly calls them out? And if you don't call Comcast out, what's the point?
      </p>
      <p>
       That leaves you with the internet, which I believe is better for modern mass communication anyway. You already have shows such as Democracy Now! which have been talking about TPP for
       <em>
        years
       </em>
       now. DN! is about as far as you can go with a broadcast and still seem mainstream without getting the conspiracy label. Many here still consider it to be compromised though. It's definitely better than MSM, but I still feel they have lines they won't cross.

       This is exactly the solution, and all the pieces exist to make it happen.

       All it needs is qualified groups to step forward, have the crowd endorse by funding, and do it.

       NO!  This is a very distinct difference.  They passed TPA, giving the president fast-track authority to negotiate the deal.  TPP has not yet been passed.  It still needs to come before congress.  The difference it will now be voted on simply as a yes/no vote.  No amendments can be proposed or added.

       Scrutinizing each one and finding alternative candidates for the next election will take some time (and is probably not something I should be doing on the clock...).  If we can get people from most of the states (hell, we may only need to do the populous ones, I could probably process the Florida ones easily enough).

       The hard part is getting people riled up enough.

       Net neutrality was a "this could fuck with your couch time" issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       The average American won't mobilize on anything as abstract as relinquishing national sovereignty because they don't understand it and thus, don't care about it... Unless someone explains it to them which is the job of the mainstream media but they are the mouthpiece of the people pushing the agenda so that won't happen.

       Reddit got played like a fiddle on Net Neutrality.
      </p>
      <p>
       The strategy now is to not be distracted by bullshit media distractions and actually work to spread factual information to others so we cam have a semblance of cohesion, just for this (utterly doomed, IMO)  moment at least.

       Well not sure what you mean by reddit being played like a fiddle. Regardless there was a net neutrality-related article on the front page about once a day for at least a month. But I agree we need to be united. My point was mainly that it's hard to spread the message when TPP-related posts are being removed on the main subs.

       There was no way the TPP was not going to pass.  It is the keystone for the legal basis for legitimizing the corporatcracy.  With all the millions of money pumped into the political system, big business is demanding to get what they paid for -- free reign to plunder, destroy, exploit and own whatever their greed demands.    There is only one coming official morality, profit and more profit.  The solutions have to lie outside the political system, as Gandhi showed us decades ago.

       The general public is far more interested in the search for the prisoners, than in TPP.  This isn't the media's fault.

       And "TPP" isn't about to be signed by Obama; Fast Track for it is about to be signed.

       How do you know the general public most of whom aren't even close to the prison would rather hear? One thing affects us all and the other a small insignificant speck of property. How do you speak for the majority? What's your secret?

       People can relate to "bad guys on the run".  It's a simple story, unfolds quickly, excites fear and thrill of the chase, police say "call us if YOU see them", etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas TPP story is kind of arcane, unfolding over a couple of years, about corporate and national-level rules and money, hard to relate to.  Add even more arcane things such as TPA and Fast Track.

       We've got a chicken/egg problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       The general public becomes interested in what the media presents to them and the spectacle it creates. Almost no one in the general public would know about the prison incident if it was not plastered all over the media
       <em>
        first.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       The media then decides to present a story in a way that is more or less entertaining. If a story is presented as dry, with a quick headline, it will fade away. If it becomes a topic of debate and discussion in opinion segments, it suddenly becomes popular even if the topic itself is not very interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the media had presented the TPP in an attention-grabbing way, we'd be discussing that instead. Admittedly, "prison break" may have elements that are inherently more exciting. But the public does not dictate the direction the story goes first, the media does.

       Some of the media probably covered the TPP right from the start.  Serious major newspapers.  PBS.  Online newspapers and serious political/economic sites.
      </p>
      <p>
       But most people don't see anything exciting in TPP, and most media accurately judged that too.  Complicated, mostly-secret, unfolding slowly over a couple of years, arcane stuff about trade rules, sort of happening far away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas the prison story is simple, quick, easy to relate to, exciting, somewhat local (for people in the Northeast).
      </p>
      <p>
       No, I think most of the media is a reflection of the people.  A pretty accurately-judged reflection of them, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       For someone trying to whip up outrage about TPP, this is frustrating.  But blaming some media conspiracy is wrong.
