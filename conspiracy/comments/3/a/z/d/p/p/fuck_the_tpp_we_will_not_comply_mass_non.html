<p>Agreed.  We must make sure and not put the cart before the horse, however, my good man.  While noncompliance may indeed be the key to unlock freedom, it seems to me that the thing itself that leads to mass noncompliance starts with all of us as a <em>species</em> putting aside our heavily indoctrinated racism and all our brain washed prejudices, all come together as the ONE people that we indeed truly are, and all work together as <em>one</em>.</p>

<p>Without our coming together as one and seeing each and everyone of us - black, white, indigenous, Asian, male, female, trans, etc, etc - as ONE UNITED FAMILY <em>FIRST</em>, it seems we will not be able to accomplish the mass noncompliance needed in order to unlock the freedom we&#39;re talking about here in the first place.</p>

<p>Oh absolutely.  Agreed.  Having a sharp, critically-thinking mind, I feel, also helps.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Maybe it might not be so much luck as much as it might be that you might simply attract the kind of energy you tend to put out.  That’s a possibility too.  :)</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Well there you go.  As such, I don’t think you’re “lucky” at all.  You’d be lucky that most people were super chill with you yet you were an asshole.  You don’t seem to be that though, so yeah…You tend to attract what you put out to.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Gladwell or no Gladwell, that seems a decent enough postulation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Agreed.  Well-said.  I’d say spread your energy out <em>globally</em> though.  Just be a beacon of light as much as you possibly can.  Doesn’t mean you have to be a “smily, shiny, happy person!” 24/7.  Of course not.  Just try to be nice and honorable to people - even if you have a very serious look on your face.</p>

<p>or it could possibly be the key to opening your cell door before the officer of the state &quot;department of corrections&quot; (can you ever imagine a more orwellian term to label a group of turnkeys and jailers / slavers?)</p>

<p>because that is what will happen for some of the non-compliers.</p>

<p>I just hope it&#39;s not retroactively effective because that will basically destroy everyone&#39;s lives and that would cause serious backlash. Everyone watches TV on the internet, almost everyone in the younger generations.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be possible for them to enforce this because as soon as the new generation comes into power, we will just be like &quot;are you guys kidding me with your bullshit? that&#39;s ridiculous fuck off&quot;.</p>

<p>You take all the idiots that would potentially riot and, instead, band them all together and cause them to peacefully A) <em>not</em> take part in the shitty system as it stands, while B) absolutely help support, house, and feed each other <em>while</em> they&#39;re being noncompliant with that shitty system, and you will have a movement and make a statement that the system will have a MUCH bigger problem with than a bunch of idiot dogs running down the street looking like morons.</p>

<p>Rioting solves exactly zero.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Gandhi was the peaceful option but even he said that violence had its place</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And violence <em>does</em> have a place.  I don’t disagree with that and there is nothing that I said that even implies otherwise.  I am a <em>huge</em> second amendment advocate and strongly feel that EVERYONE should be armed.</p>

<p>This has exactly <em>nothing</em> to do with advocating “rioting”, however, which was the original point I was talking about.  Far different.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Martin Luther King was peaceful but he had his Malcolm X.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think both MLK and MX are significant and important, but I personally side with MX more than MLK.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The powers that be know that peaceful non compliance is preferable because they don&#39;t have to do anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Incorrect, sir.  If a million people peacefully decide to NOT go to work, NOT pay their taxes, NOT take part in any military exercises, NOT be TPTB “police man” guard dogs, and everyone decided to instead support, house, cloth, and feed each other, then TPTB will definitely have a HUGE problem with that and they will most definitely <em>not</em> see that as “preferable because they don’t have to do anything.”</p>

<p>Their entire system of control and manipulation would come absolutely crashing down if more and more people caught on to <em>that</em> type of peaceful noncompliance and acted accordingly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To truly advance your cause you must force the authorities to chose your side over the violent one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And regardless of whether that can be done with or without violence, it MOST DEFINITELY will <em>never</em> ever need or require any sort of stupid “rioting” in order to accomplish - like ophellaks above advocated.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There MUST be a violent factor waiting in the wings for if you fail and the authorities must be made to know that if they do not choose to deal with the peaceful option constructively then the choice will be made for them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Incorrect.  There should definitely be a means by which the masses can individually and collectively protect themselves, but don’t think for a second that the choices are only “Gandhi-like peace” or “all out, violent war!”.  Not even close.  There are many means of nonviolently protesting, and if one way doesn’t work, another way can be utilized before feeling like one <em>has</em> to resort to any sort of armed conflict.</p>

<p>One should never ever be afraid to engage in armed conflict, but one should also never rush headlong into such a thing if it can be avoided.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you only offer a peaceful front then you will accomplish nothing because they won&#39;t be afraid to not deal with you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, incorrect.  If a motherfucking SHIT TON of you/us confront TPTB and say “Yo, we are going to stop supporting this system like…<em>right now</em> this very moment.” and this group happens to be, say, a <em>billion</em> people that are all working together peacefully?</p>

<p>Sheeit, son.  You better believe TPTB will have a <em>real</em> difficult time handling that.</p>

<p>Whose going to police the police if the police are on the side of the citizens?  What military is going to shoot down peaceful protestors if the troops are on the side of the citizens themselves?</p>

<p>Realize that my ultimate point has nothing to do with trying to advocate “ONLY PEACE AND THAT’S IT!  NO OTHER WAY!!”  No.  I’m totally okay with armed conflict if it’s needed.</p>

<p>Understand that what I’m advising against is RIOTING.  That was my initial point, and it still very much stands.</p>

<p>Violence, if absolutely necessary, has to take place, and if a people are defending themselves, is what it is.  I’m not advising against that.  <em>Rioting</em>, on the other hand?  Yeah, that’s fucking stupid, yo.  That’s for fucking dumb asses and will <em>never</em> ever solve a thing.</p>

<p>1) Not really.</p>

<p>2) What does that have to do with the point I&#39;m making?  What does this have to do with the fact that I&#39;m not nor was I ever talking about the advocating of rioting?</p>

<p>...You really seem to be continuing to try to talk about something that is actually ENTIRELY different than what the real point here is.  If you want to continue to do that, then...okay, I guess.  I&#39;m not quite sure what you&#39;re meaning in this response, but it - again - does nothing to the fact that it&#39;s only <em>rioting</em> that I&#39;m talking about going against.</p>

<p>Rather then insulting me…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that you took what I said as personally referring to <em>you</em> is greatly indicative of where your mindset is at.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you should take a glimpse into reality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A reality showing that riots exist and take place does absolutely nothing to the fact that they are, again, the methodology of the stupid, unthinking masses, and they solve exactly nothing, help exactly nothing, propel exactly <em>no</em> movement forward, and actually <em>help</em> keep TPTB <em>in</em> power because the riots do nothing but allow the dumb, unthinking, “unwashed masses” to let off some steam before things go right back to the same old status quo that existed before the dumb rioting occurred in the first place.</p>

<p>History has shown this over and over again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The masses aren&#39;t going to wake up, you can ship off entire races of people to camps and those left behind will think &quot; at least its not me&quot; till its them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wouldn’t say that this doesn’t in fact seem to be how things are.  However, the point I’m making is that <em>rioting</em> isn’t going to help curb this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;ve literally been taking it up the ass since 1913.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Possibly long before even that, but yes.  At least since then.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s 100 years of bred in compliance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Understood and agreed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Corporations are openly and publicly making a move to override the rights of all constitutions and who cares?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do.  You do.  Others do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s a list of the companies involved and look around, there&#39;s no peaceful protest, there&#39;s no boycot, there is nothing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly.  Why?  A good reason for that is because we’re scared and we don’t trust that we will be supported by our fellow brothers and sisters if we try to stand up.  That’s the main reason why.</p>

<p>Rioting isn’t going to help this, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1989, protests in Beijing</p>

<p>that&#39;s what needs to happen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was <em>not</em> a riot, however.  Not by far.  That was a mass, official <em>demonstration</em> - an official protest.  Look it up.  Again, rioting is <em>not</em> the answer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A couple thousand innocent persons need to make a spectacle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would not disagree with that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One that cannot be ignored.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct and agreed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One that&#39;ll force the puppeteers back and off while those remaining revamp this ridiculousness system we&#39;ve prescribed too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Goddammit I’m <em>agreeing</em> with you!  The point and fact of the matter, however, is that RIOTING is <em>not</em> what’s going to help this to happen!  It’s not “rioting” that will do it!  It’s intelligent, concerted, mass noncompliance that is done TOGETHER by the protesting group.</p>

<p>We are not in disagreement in much of anything aside from your thinking that any sort of dumb “rioting” should take place.  Again, fuck that, sir.  Fuck that.  We need to do more and do better if we have any chance or hope of <em>really</em> making anything work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, what do we do?  First?  Second?  Third?</p>

<p>I propose, we organize, communicate, form consensus on ideas, form goals, and then take actions.  We need to elaborate on each of these points in order to be successful.  </p>

<p>People that shrink from controversy don&#39;t get to dictate the policy or process.  In other words, if our members choose not to acknowledge empirical reality in their discussion, after it is presented to them and they have had time to digest it, we should not feel obligated to take them seriously and slow down the process.  This shall not become a situation where the slackers prevent us from forming consensus.  We can include everyone that wants to participate, but we should not allow people to stop the process by continually objecting and at the same time being wishy washy about what they are trying to say.  We can&#39;t just say, &quot;make a better world,&quot; and then put that task onto others.  This is about <em>us</em> taking all of THAT responsibility.  <em>We</em> shall ask, <em>how</em>, repeatedly, discuss it, rectify disagreements with more discussion, and then form a consensus around policy.  We just give our power away to others by demanding things without caring about how they are done.  We&#39;d sound like impotent children crying to daddy to buy them sugary crap at the grocery store.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>We need a leader.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We ourselves need to each of us actually BE the leader we wish to follow.  No sooner do you appoint some stand alone &quot;leader&quot; for some cause than that cause is super easy to destroy and dismantle by simply assassinating that supposed &quot;leader&quot;.  If <em>everyone</em> follows a particular <em>principle</em>, however, then it simply matters not who tries to do <em>what</em> to undermine the movement or cause because EVERYONE has the ability to stand alone in the responsibility needed to move forward and succeed.</p>

<p>It is in part the &quot;leader/follower&quot; paradigm that has enslaved this society and caused so much trouble in the first place.  It is this leader/follower mentality that has made our entire society filled with sheep that complain, complain, complain in websites like we&#39;re presently on yet are unwilling to do what&#39;s necessary to stand up and take charge.</p>

<p>And why is that?  It&#39;s because we are foolishly trapped in this mindset that is &quot;waiting for a leader&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ideally, we need a set of leaders all working together to plan and run the insurrection.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed.  Ideally, in a group of, say, 10 million insurgents, we need a set of 10 million leaders - all of which are powerful enough to have a common goal and powerful enough to know when to work together as one toward a common objective.</p>

<p>True leaders can all come together and do this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A single leader is vulnerable, but a school of leaders in various fields would be hard to discredit or murder.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed.  That school of leaders, however, needs to be <em>each member of the entire group</em>.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a question for you, however, and I <em>really</em> would like you to answer this:</p>

<p>How willing would <em>you</em> be to follow a true, honorable, intelligent leader that also just so happened be <em>black?</em></p>

<p>You have a penchant for <em>not</em> responding to many posts, but I would like, if nothing else, for you to answer this one question posted here.</p>

<p>EDIT:  My response was posted over 8 hours ago, and, as of this here EDIT, you have posted about another twelve responses in other boards, and your very last message was posted but a mere 24 minutes ago.  This lets me know that you not only saw and read this here response to you, but have decided to not respond to the question I asked you.  Because of this, I will once again make mention of the fact that even though some of the things you say may <em>seem</em> to be valid when looked at superficially, the fact of the matter is that - as per your extensive post history and the fact that this is the second or third account you&#39;ve made after your other accounts were banned for repeated and continued racism - you are a 100% &quot;white supremacist&quot; degenerate.  The <em>real</em> meaning of your comments, therefore, truly make them hardly worth the time it takes to read.  You are singularly self-defeating in posts like the one you made here because, while you might sound like a person with a normal head on their shoulders if someone didn&#39;t know any better (talking about &quot;the need for strong leaders&quot;, etc) the fact of the matter is that the &quot;leaders&quot; that someone like you refers to are &quot;strong, <em>white</em>, Anglo European leaders that look at all other races as inferior to them and think of themselves as being superior to everyone and everything else.&quot;</p>

<p>The second an even mildly intelligent individual finds out that you think in this manner, they will also realize that yours is a mindset that is about the <em>last</em> type that is needed in any developed society, and the sooner such a type of caustic ignorance is entirely rooted out from a civilization, the sooner that civilization can prosper and move forward.</p>

<p>It is <em>because</em> of mindsets like yours that the problems you&#39;re even talking about here largely exist.  Such putrid froth is indicative of only the most morally corrupt mind, and such a mind has exactly zero business in a healthy society.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what <em>I&#39;m</em> saying.  I agree.  Unfortunately, people like 4to6 very much care and have said multiple times that whites are genetically superior to non whites.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If they&#39;re alive, aware, and willing to take back our world [away?] from <em>The Cabal</em> they can run their campaign out of my house.</p>

<p>There is an elite that human civilization is being unduly controlled by, and the species would do well to root this influence out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are beyond a &quot;color thing&quot; now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It should never have been a &quot;color thing&quot; in the first place as far as I&#39;m concerned.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is survival of every race, every religion, save one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m a little confused by this last sentence.  &quot;This is survival of every race, every religion, <em>save ONE</em>.&quot; tends to mean &quot;This is survival of every race, every religion, <em>except ONE race&quot;.&quot;  That itself seems to imply the you are okay with *not</em> saving one of those races.  Am I correct in this interpretation?  And if so, what race are you referring to?</p>

<p>Looking back at this response you posted here, your use of the words &quot;<em>The Cabal</em>&quot; seems at least to imply that the race you might be referring to might be the Jews.</p>

<p>Is that correct?</p>

<p>If it is, then I would not agree with this at all...and this is why:</p>

<p>Firstly, &quot;the Jews&quot; are actually <em>not</em> a race at all.  It is a religion.  Secondly, &quot;the Jews&quot; that you are in all likelihood referring to (if you indeed are...don&#39;t want to assume) are in fact, <em>not Jews at ALL</em>.  They are Khazars that infiltrated and hijacked the <em>real</em> (more middle eastern based) Jewish religion, called themselves &quot;Ashkenazi Jews&quot; instead of &quot;Sephardic Jews&quot; (a ridiculous thing, to be sure, as the Sephardics are the <em>real</em> Jews, and the Ashkenazis are little more than Anglo Europeans from eastern Europe) and have used this infiltration to create a global &quot;Guilt Trip Industry&quot; off of - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTnHcHsUNM0">not the least of which took place during WWII</a>.  False flag after false flag have been created by them so that they can then <em>use</em> the horrors they&#39;re covertly responsible for in order to guilt the world into letting them exact the horror they&#39;re exacting.</p>

<p>As such, it is most specifically the actions of those Khazars that call themselves Ashkenazi Zionist Jews that must be rooted out and stopped.</p>

<p>ALL racism must be stopped as well, to be sure.  White European ignorant bigots like 4to6 or whatever his name is are a HUGE part of the problem.  African racists that go around exacting violent crimes upon other are definitely part of the problem too.  Racism of ANY kind is what should be rooted out, and although some groups seem to exact more of it than others, ANYONE who engages in the activity is very much in the wrong and is a definite enemy of humanity and, by extension, the planet Earth itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I am not referring to Jews at all here.</p>

<p>I assume that you are familiar with the Club of Rome? The Class of 300 that rules the world? The <em>real</em> &quot;Illuminati?&quot;</p>

<p>To them Jews are nothing but &quot;court Jews&quot;--they give people a reason to get pissed off at people that are, in most cases, more successful and maybe even in a prominent government or banking group. So what? That shit is all for show anyhow...those people have wealth, but not even <em>close</em> to the &quot;real&quot; wealth we&#39;re dealing with in the Club.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure that there ARE Jews in the Club of 300 (the Cabal)...but I doubt that there are many, if so. Jews exist a level down the pyramid at least, maybe a few levels down. Definately a level above the <em>goyim</em> but the reasons for this are many and don&#39;t, for the most part, come from the Jews themselves.</p>

<p>If I had a magic button that I could push and EVERY JEW on the planet would die at it&#39;s push...guess what would happen if it were pushed? Absolutely nothing at all. There would just be <em>fewer</em> people against &quot;their&quot; evil in this world. No &quot;problems&quot; would go away...in fact the mess would be worse than ever before.</p>

<p>And yes, I agree with you and so do many regarding the true Sephardic Jew. When I was in Israel Sephardics were, literally, second-class citizens. The Askenazi (Khazars--and Jewish for political reasons only!) in Israel are (mostly) the Far-Right Zionist nutjobs who want continuous war so the money keeps flowing in for THEIR masters. </p>

<p>Please note that I met MANY awesome leftist Askhenazis in Israel...they knew what was going on, and usually weren&#39;t too pleased about it. But in Israel the Leftists have less power than ever before nowadays</p>

<p>Geez, even years ago Ehud Barak was considered a &quot;right-wing Zionist nutjob&quot; but at least they could say 
&quot;well, yeah, but hell, I&#39;m no Netanyahu, you know!&quot; ; &#39;)</p>

So what? That shit is all for show anyhow...those people have wealth, but not even close to the &quot;real&quot; wealth we&#39;re dealing with in the Club.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whether it’s the “Club” or some other group that is the one truly in power, I understand what you’re saying here and do not disagree with it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m sure that there ARE Jews in the Club of 300 (the Cabal)...but I doubt that there are many, if so. Jews exist a level down the pyramid at least, maybe a few levels down. Definately a level above the goyim but the reasons for this are many and don&#39;t, for the most part, come from the Jews themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds about right.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If I had a magic button that I could push and EVERY JEW on the planet would die at it&#39;s push...guess what would happen if it were pushed? Absolutely nothing at all. There would just be fewer people against &quot;their&quot; evil in this world. No &quot;problems&quot; would go away...in fact the mess would be worse than ever before.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t know that it would be worse than before, but I also don’t think that what you are saying is without reason, and I would sooner agree with you than not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the true Sephardic Jew. When I was in Israel Sephardics were, literally, second-class citizens. The Askenazi (Khazars--and Jewish for political reasons only!) in Israel are (mostly) the Far-Right Zionist nutjobs who want continuous war so the money keeps flowing in for THEIR masters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All very correct, sir.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Please note that I met MANY awesome leftist Askhenazis in Israel...they knew what was going on, and usually weren&#39;t too pleased about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s good to know.  They must be careful not to be complicit in the crimes of other Ashkenazis, however, by simply either standing by idly and doing nothing, or perpetuating the evil by virtue of their continuing to allow themselves to <em>benefit</em> from it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>even years ago Ehud Barak was considered a &quot;right-wing Zionist nutjob&quot; but at least they could say &quot;well, yeah, but hell, I&#39;m no Netanyahu, you know!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that indeed is pretty bad when you consider that the previous Zionist nut jobs are being favorably compared to Netanyahu.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh my god, I must recommend a book here!</p>

<p>Look it up, you should find it online. It&#39;s called &quot;The Conspirators&#39; Hierarchy: the Committee of 300&quot; by Doctor John Coleman. I downloaded mine from rarereactor.tk. This is ESSENTIAL READING!! What&#39;s so funny is that they change their name occasionally to sound totally benign...and NOTHING could be further from the truth. It&#39;s astounding.</p>

<p>Just be warned, you&#39;re about to go down the old rabbit hole like you never have. Since the book was written a few years back you can see how it has all played out PERFECTLY...only guns owned by private citizens are gumming up the works.</p>

<p>This book was essential reading for me. It&#39;s all true and suddenly everything will make a TON more sense to you.</p>

<p>Let me know if you have trouble finding it and I can either email it or stick it on Dropbox.</p>

<p>I am so excited to be introducing this material to someone else who could really use the information! I hope that you enjoy it; I guarantee that you will. Best thing is that you&#39;ll KNOW it&#39;s the truth based on what&#39;s happened in the last 15 years and it will make you realize exactly where Jews, Gentiles, Islam denunciation, the current political climate, etc all fit in and it will greatly comfort you that there IS a common enemy and there are far fewer of &#39;them&#39; than you think.</p>

<p>Enjoy the read friend! This book literally changed my life and my entire way of thinking. It is VERY powerful stuff and &#39;they&#39; don&#39;t like it getting around...all they can do is hope that people consider it all &quot;bullshit conspiracy theory&quot; but events since its last publication show that this is far less than accurate. It&#39;s real, and it&#39;s scary. But it, at least, shows us EXACTLY who the &#39;enemies&#39; are...and &quot;the Jews&quot; (yes, even the Ashkenazi) are FAR down the list.</p>

<p>I&#39;m really, really eager and excited for you to read this and let me know what you think. I&#39;m betting that it will have the same effect on your way of thinking as it had on mine.</p>

<p>Thanks agains for the recommendation.  I’m currently reading through <a href="http://www.whale.to/c/Gods_of_Eden_Bramley.pdf">William Bramley’s book</a> again (second time).  I’ll either begin on the 300 pdf when I’m done w/Bramley’s book, or will read them concurrently.</p>

In a million ways both sides profited from cities being burned, people being systematically killed, and so on.

<p>I’ve started reading the 300 book, and even before I started, it <em>definitely</em> seems to me that humanity is a “kept” race; a species that is used - as far as TPTB here on <em>Earth</em> are concerned - in a manner akin to the way a parasite uses a host.  We are the parasite.  And who is the host?  Well, the 300 are certainly much <em>closer</em> to the host than the average citizen - that much seems indubitably certain - but I’m not 100% certain that the Committee is the very bottom of the rabbit hole.  Not in the least.  I’m not certain at all that the Committee of 300 are themselves nothing more than peon Earthly emissaries and representative that have a <em>closer</em> connection to who’s <em>really</em> in charge than we the average citizens do, but who themselves may be nothing more than “king rats” to the top <em>top</em> level.  Bramley himself makes reference to this and dedicates the entirety of chapter 25 to the concept of the “king rat”.</p>

<p>The rabbit hole goes pretty deep when one gets to things going on here on this planet…but it goes <em>really</em> deep when one begins to consider that there really is actual, valid evidence pointing toward off planet influences and manipulation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Ha.  Yeah.  Shit’s crazy, man.  Totally.  That’s why I’m reading through his book again a second time.  Hey, by the way, there are a couple of pages missing in the book here and there.  I forgot which ones they are, however.  I have the actual hard copy of the book and I also have a scanner at my place as well, so if you get to those pages, just PM me or whatever, and I’ll scan the copy of the actual page and send it to you no problem so it doesn’t disrupt your reading.

<p>I agree with you, the 300 are definitely near the top as far as the PEOPLE go but are they the custodians?? It seems obvious to me at this point that there is a custodial race somewhere, using this whole thing for...what??? Energy? Are we being mined for something? This is what I&#39;m hoping Bramley&#39;s book explains...and I&#39;m being led to believe that it&#39;s headed that way pretty soon now.</p>

<p>It goes down further than I could have ever dreamed. With Bramley&#39;s info in the mix (and with the realization that is HAS TO BE TRUE in great part--it&#39;s obvious, especially after the discourse on the religions) it&#39;s like I&#39;m pretty sure that I&#39;m simply not gonna &quot;get&quot; this &quot;cosmic joke&quot; until it all plays out and I&#39;m not here to &quot;evolve&quot; any further...except perhaps in an energetic sense.

If you&#39;re in the dark try googling something like &quot;GLP illuminati interview.&quot; Was like an AMaA for a level above the Club of Rome. REALLY INTERESTING.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I would say <em>very</em> likely “no”.  I’d say the 300 are likely some of the top terrestrial emissaries <em>of</em> the custodial society.  I wouldn’t doubt that some of these Earthly representatives might even be more genetically related to them than the average human, but I do not think that they actually <em>are</em> the custodians themselves to any degree.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I’d say perhaps off planet based.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>using this whole thing for...what???</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems to me as far as I’ve been able to assess from the readings and research I’ve done that the reason might be two-fold:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use a genetically created slave to mine for gold needed to restore a possibly deteriorating atmosphere on their home planet, and</p></li>
<li><p>Use this slave race as a host to parasite off of and not only keep the host/slave subjugated, conquered, and dominated (like humans keep, say, cows and other domesticated livestock used for slaughter), but keep the creator-custodial species <em>and</em> it’s Earthly representatives (i.e. those humans in, perhaps, The 300 Club, among perhaps other secret societies) advantaged, elite, and quite well off/cared for/tended to.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These are two of the more nefarious possibilities.  There is a third option, however, and this one, while no less powerfully subjugating and indeed cruel in its own way, might have a much greater, more complicated implication down the line for the human species that can actually be said to be <em>good</em> and evolutionarily advantageous.</p>

<p>I outlined <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/14utv0/911_was_an_occult_megaritual_the_numbers_of_the_4/c7gwqaz"><strong>this third possibility</strong></a> over two years ago, and although some of the quantifiable dates and particulars have proven themselves to be miscalculated, the overall direction and meaning of the information itself still very much stands, and I would not be surprised if there is much more truth to it than not.</p>

<p>If you want to <em>really</em> understand what I was talking about in it, I would suggest that you read all of my responses in that particular thread along with the site I linked - and not just the OP alone.  The information <em>there</em> is a rabbit hole that goes <em>veeery</em> deep - deeper than even Bramley’s work alone, if you can believe that.</p>

<p>So these three options are my current guesstimates with regard to what might possibly be going on here on this planet.  I by no means pretend that these are exhaustive guesses, however.  I’m sure there are other factors involved.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Energy? Are we being mined for something?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It seems that this is a very astute overall assessment on your part.  I would also say that, as a bumper sticker I read a while back that still sticks with me to this day said:  <em>We are not humans beings having spiritual experiences.  We are spiritual beings having human experiences.</em></p>

<p>As such, I would venture that you might very well be right in that further understanding and elucidation will likely take place upon our evolving further into a more energetic state after discarding these physical vehicles we currently call “our bodies”.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey.  Continuing on in my second pass through <a href="http://www.whale.to/c/Gods_of_Eden_Bramley.pdf">Bramley&#39;s book</a>, I came across this interesting tidbit of information related to some of the things we were talking about.</p>

<p>On page 211 it says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>According to
Mesopotamian tablets, the Custodial society was ruled in
a unique fashion. At the top was a Council or system of
councils. Beneath the top council(s) were planetary subdivisions,
such as Earth. Each subdivision was ruled by
individual Custodians on a hereditary basis but subject to
the laws of the Council(s). According to ancient Sumerians,
local hereditary Custodial rulers were Earth&#39;s first kings.
Those rulers naturally implanted their monarchial system
on human society.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It further goes on to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The Sumerians state that the first human kings on Earth
were the offspring of Custodial rulers who mated with human
women. Those matings entitled the half-human offspring to
become early monarchs on Earth. Thus was born the idea
of &quot;royal blood&quot; and the perceived importance of maintaining
proper royal &quot;breeding&quot; to ensure continued purity
of the human royal blood line. Interestingly, some ancient
Custodial &quot;gods&quot; were depicted as either blue-skinned or
blue-blooded: this gave us the idea (and some say reality)
of royal &quot;blue bloods.&quot; Aristocratic breeding practices have
persisted through history and remain important to some royalty
even today. Human &quot;blue bloods&quot; appear to be the prize
Hereford cows of Earth&#39;s livestock race, Homo sapiens.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then on page 212 it says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The newly-weakened monarchies and parliamentary governments allowed for greater power to be assumed by a new institution being installed by the revolutionaries: a new banking and monetary system. This new monetary system was a major element of the revolutions of the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, yet this fact is only minimally discussed in the majority of history books.</em></p>

<p>I could imagine some of the members of the Committee of 300 being at least partially, distantly related to some of these beings perhaps.  Additionally, in the last quote, one can see where some of the beginnings of the fiat currency and banking systems began.</p>

<p>Very interesting stuff, to be sure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Common Sense Show – by Dave Hodges</p>

<p>Many believe that America is plunging head first into a civil war with the forces of the New World Order which have hijacked our government. Trust me, nobody reading these words wants live through the times that the globalists have planned for us and if you listen to people who advocate for a civil war, you need your head examined.  </p>

<p>Part one of this series detailed how the economy is collapsing due the failure of the Petrodollar. The resulting instability will provide the pretext to institute a series of false flag attacks which will provide the federal government with a preemptive opportunity to impose one of the most draconian forms of martial law that the world has ever seen. There is a chance that the American people will shed their shackles and finally rise up and that is exactly what the globalists desire.</p>

<p>If the globalists can draw us into a civil war and crush the opposition, they can end all pretenses and their full blown tyranny will be fully exposed for all to see and experience firsthand.  How close is America to falling into a civil war?</p>

<p>The Three Stages of a Revolution</p>

<p>dhsMany believe that the revolution has already begun and I would agree with them. There are three distinct stages of revolution and we are moving down the path to civil war at a frightening pace. You may not realize this fact, but your government certainly does! When DHS purchases 2.2 billion rounds of ammunition and 2700 armored vehicles, it is clear that they are preparing to kill millions of uncooperative Americans.</p>

<p>Stage One of the Revolution</p>

<p>revolucionThe first stage of a revolution, is a war of ideas and a campaign for the truth. This is what I am trying to accomplish on my website and on my talk show. Where I see the enemy at the gate, most of my friends and neighbors are sleeping through the unfolding attack. We are in a war of words and if we fail to use our words to awaken all of humanity, we are hopelessly lost and the globalists will carve us up for dinner. There is indeed strength in numbers and if we are unable to wake up our fellow countrymen, we will negate the only true tactical advantage we have, solidarity from a numerically superior force.</p>

<p>It should now make sense to you as to why 98% of the media is controlled by globalist controlled business interests, who in turn are controlled one way or another, by the members of the Federal Reserve. In order to win this fight, we need more people speaking out, making videos and calling MSM talk shows. We especially need to reach the police and the military in order to remind them of their constitutional duty to protect the people against a tyrannical government.</p>

<p>Our counter to the control of the MSM, is to exclusively support the alternative media. If Obama is successful in taking down the alternative media, then it will become necessary to enact a type of Committees of Correspondence  apparatus similar to what our Founding Fathers did in the pre-Revolutionary War period in our history. On the ground communication is timeless, effective and very difficult for a totalitarian government to negate.</p>

<p>Stage Two of the Revolution</p>

<p>Stage two of a revolution consists of civil disobedience or nonviolent resistance. Thanks to Obama, he has given Americans the perfect pretext to begin to resist our criminally controlled government and America is presently sitting on the edge of being immersed in stage two of a revolution. I am speaking specifically about gun control.</p>

<p>gun confiscation 21No matter what gun control laws that Obama brings to the American people, the people need to disobey.  Most readers already know what happens when a civilian population surrenders its guns. When, not if, but when Obama comes for our guns, all of us have a constitutional duty to disobey these unlawful policies. If this form of civil disobedience does not stem the tide of tyranny sweeping the country, then withhold your money from the globalist apparatus. Stop paying taxes as much as possible. Do not shop in the corporate chain stores controlled by Federal Reserve members such as Walmart or any other well known globalist entity. Shop local and begin to trade and barter with your neighbors and friends. Buy gold and silver and get of the corrupt Petrodollar as much as possible. In short, stop feeding the beast. Practiced en masse, these financial practices are often enough to bring a criminal government to its knees. However, you better store food and water because history shows the next step that a totalitarian regime would take would be to starve the people into submission. Further, we all need to realize that  if stage two does not bring the criminal banksters to their knees, stage three is unavoidable and that means all out war. If our resistance is forceful enough, we may force the globalist cowards to retreat and regroup. Their hesitation works to our advantage. We can use the time to solidify our positions and will be in a new position to make demands of the government. If our civil disobedience is forceful enough, we can make the globalists think twice about beginning a civil war.</p>

<p>With myself being a nonviolent person, I prefer this path of resistance. Although I may have been born at night, I was not born last night. The retreating globalists will eventually return with new methods and strategies to enslave humanity. We can only hope that we are united enough to resist being taken into stage three.</p>

<p>Stage Three: All Out War</p>

<p>Stage three is direct physical confrontation with the powers that be which involves a large number of citizens. In this case, our enemies will be comprised of whatever minions that the Federal Reserve can bring to the fight such as a well-armed DHS. If Americans have done their due diligence in stage one, the majority of the military and the police will defend the people. However, they must know that the people will stand with them. These objectives must be accomplished in Stage one.</p>

<p>A successful revolution cannot simply jump to stage three without having progressed through the first two stages. The first two stages are the necessary prerequisites that the globalists require to build the cohesiveness that they will need to begin the roundups, the murder, the mayhem and the total subjugation. False flag attacks are prominent part of the transition between stage two and stage three rebellion. False flag attacks also provide the justification and also galvanizes the pro-governmental forces to a point in which they begin to enslave the people.</p>

<p>When Stalin’s forces were dragging a third of the Russians out of their homes, it was too late for the Russians to fight back because the ideological base of resistance had not been built. The Russian people were defeated by Stalin because they did not win stage one of the revolution. We desperately need to heed this lesson from history and embark on a tireless crusade to wake up our country as to the dangers that lie ahead. Therefore, it is the duty of every awake American to educate their neighbors, family and friends, whether they want to hear the truth or not. Remember, any kind resistance to tyranny will not succeed unless there is an attitude of defiance towards the tyranny. Tyrants require minions to carry out their tyranny. Again, this is accomplished, again, in stage one.</p>

<p>If we are going to successfully fight back, it is now or never. Start an email distribution list. Talk to everyone  you know. Post short notices about the tyrannical government at your community mailboxes. Be creative, think of new ways to reach your neighbors. And by the way, buy guns and ammunition. Hide some of your guns. If possible, buy the guns off the books so there is not a government list with your name on it. When martial law is imposed, have a pre-designated meeting place for you and your family because cell phone communications may be down. Carry three days of needed resources in your cars because you cannot predict when you will experience trouble getting home. Form resource coalitions with your friends and coworkers. Store resources at differing safe houses, in your area, with friends and family that you trust. Turn off your television which only serves to condition people to accept defeat and to embrace the plans of the New World Order. Build backup plans for your contingency plans. Start preparing today like your life depends on it, because it does.</p>

<p>Analysis</p>

<p>false flagI believe that Obama’s people will very soon begin to commence false flag attacks in order to hasten the implementation of martial law and force the real leadership of the opposition out in the open where they can be crushed in a brief civil war. I think the first false flag event will transpire with the collapse of the Petrodollar and this will constitute the countdown to an all-out civil war.</p>

<p>If we can keep the globalists mired in stages one and two, through some of the suggested actions that I list, we might be able to force a lengthy stalemate. Time is not on the globalists side because propaganda does not shield the truth from the masses forever. This is why the globalists have to resort to collapsing the dollar and initiating false flag attacks as a means to force this issue into the third stage.

    <div class="md"><p>Hate to point it out. But you basically just said &quot;we can&#39;t&quot;. By doing <em>or</em> not doing something, covers all possible behaviors in general. Maybe that was the point.</p>

<p>The biggest hurdle to me, is when raising awareness of this bullshit, to circumvent the mainstream ideology with simple examples and measures of action. We don&#39;t really have that... and it&#39;d be awesome to say I did, but I do not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really don&#39;t think you are thinking this through. Utopian fantasies are just that, fantasy. </p>

<p>Your fantasy would crumble the foundations of modern civilization 
and take us back 200 years. </p>

<p>No electricity, no electronic communications, no waste and water management, no food safety, no maintained roads, no rail, no airplanes, no nothing. </p>

<p>In fact, it would probably lead to the deaths of billions of people as groups rush in to fill the power vacuum. Civil Wars, rioting in the streets, mass murder on an untold scale. </p>

<p>Government is not the enemy, it&#39;s the corruption that is the enemy. By eliminating government
and it&#39;s protections on all the aspects of modern society, you invite chaos to reign. </p>

<p>Your utopia would never come to fruition. </p>
