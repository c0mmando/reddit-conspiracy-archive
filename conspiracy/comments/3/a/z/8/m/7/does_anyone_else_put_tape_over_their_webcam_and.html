<p>How does the ability to directly access and change not only the BIOS of the computer but also the hard drive not deal with encryption, they can rewrite your hard drive, which means they can very well access encrypted data.</p>

<p><del>Gag orders against Google, Microsoft, and Apple. Not Reddit.</del></p>

<p>So you admit that it happens on some levels so that makes the point incorrect because Reddit, hasn&#39;t been shown to have a gag order on them.</p>

<p><del>That&#39;s <strong>0/3 claims so far</strong> you&#39;ve proven have been confirmed, if we&#39;re counting.</del></p>

    <div class="md"><p>But what are the chances of them(someone or even anyone) watching you? and what do they do with what they see? Will they compile a criminal case against you from an unauthorized breach of privacy? Will they blackmail you? &quot;We&#39;ve got footage of you jerking off, picking your nose, or doing other &#39;nefarious&#39; things, so give us money....do what we say.....&quot; What will they blackmail you out of, and who would blackmail you? Are they just randomly collecting footage of you browsing the internet, playing a game? Who decides who to watch, when to watch them, and what do they do with that information? &quot;This guy looks really pissed, is he playing a game? Is he arguing on the internet? Ok, does it matter? What&#39;re we doing with this information? Compiling a profile? A database? Ok, what for? What will we do with this profile?&quot; What could they possibly see through your webcam that is so &quot;OMG it&#39;s destroying my life&quot;, and what&#39;re the chances that your laptop is picked out of the millions, possibly billions, amount of laptops that exist in the USA, in the world. I understand no one wants to be watched without knowing it, but if you don&#39;t know it, how does it affect you? To me it seems more like a paranoid delusion to assume someone is going to use your camera to watch you without you knowing, and that something will come out of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure you even read my comment.</p>

<p>In no way am I making the argument supporting mass surveillance, or making the &quot;nothing to hide, nothing to fear&quot; claim, in fact, I&#39;m in no way even making an argument. </p>

<p>I&#39;m merely asking the questions who, when, where, and why are these &quot;people&quot; (that supposedly, randomly, access our laptop webcams) record or view us browsing the internet, playing games, jerking off, doing homework, etc. and what they are doing with this footage/information.
Just answer that. I&#39;m curious. I&#39;m sure everyone will have a different answer. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s rational to think that you are constantly being surveyed in the privacy of your own home, from an electronic appliance just because it contains a webcam and there are rumors, articles, and &quot;testimonies&quot; that unaware surveillance occurs regularly and that they store and collect video, data, information, whatever. Even if they are, and this occurs, they do nothing with this information. How can a video of you jerking off hurt you? And why you? What do they want from you? Why do they want videos of you jerking off? How will this help their agenda? What do they do with this information they supposedly collect? So far I&#39;ve seen nothing in the media, on the internet, of people who have A) reported that there is private footage of them taken from their webcam and that it&#39;s being used against them or B) webcam footage has been passed around the internet effectively embarrassing, or affecting someone in some way or another.</p>

<p>The only one that comes to my mind is when that school passed out laptops to it&#39;s students and it took pictures every 30 mins or so from the camera, but if I remember correctly that was decided as a violation of their privacy and they won a lawsuit against the school. The point being, the information they get from accessing your webcam unknowingly is not suitable to be used against you in very damaging world ending ways.</p>

<p>Since I&#39;m assuming you didn&#39;t read my comment, or just skimmed through it, I&#39;m going to assume you did the same thing with the link you posted, because it focuses on a very broad idea, when this thread and my comment focuses on a very small aspect of the much wider surveillance society that your article touches upon. Not to mention the fact that it&#39;s a 6 year old article, and in the 6 years since it was published/written there has not been drastic criminal cases against citizens using unauthorized webcam footage, nor any embarrassing video leaks from unauthorized webcam footage. The other thing wrong with your article is it cherry-picks four examples to support its claim, and they don&#39;t even support the claim. It supports the fact that, yeah, human error exists. It will exist in every system or organization that is run by humans, which is why it&#39;s called human error. 
It doesn&#39;t even go near the topic of what this thread is about: unauthorized access of a laptop webcam, and the possible collection of footage from that access. </p>

<p>Human error, misuse of collected data, having a database for criminals (seriously? This one is self-explanatory) these are things that are separate problems in themselves and can be fixed through laws and regulations. Unauthorized webcam access and storage of footage has not been used in anything, that I know of, and isn&#39;t necessarily a problem, since it&#39;s not being used for anything except collection (if they&#39;re even collecting footage, for whatever reason, which doesn&#39;t make sense.)</p>

<p>So to reiterate, who is watching you through the webcam? Are they watching or recording or both? What are you doing in front of the webcam you are so concerned about? How is accessing your webcam and/or recording footage negatively effecting you? Answers I will not accept: &quot;We don&#39;t know, they could use it for something in the future.&quot; &quot;You won&#39;t know until they use it against you.&quot; or as your article puts it, &quot;This sort of mistake might seem rare, but it is going to become increasingly common&quot;..... six years later, it&#39;s not increasingly common. Again, it&#39;s paranoia to think someone is trying to watch you through your webcam, that they choose you among the billions of people in the world, and that somehow this information will be used against you in a matter that you will not be able to defend yourself from. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, unless they hire one person for every person they can possibly spy on, you&#39;d have one person for every person in the USA. That&#39;s double the population, with half of the population surveying the other half, all day, everyday. Or maybe it&#39;s random people at random times, but then who decides the people to spy on, and who decides the times to spy on them? What is gained by spying on people through their laptop webcam? Automated data gathering I can wrap my head around because it&#39;s not controlled by a person but basically a machine that is making copies of everything for storage/collection, but I don&#39;t buy that video footage is randomly being collected/viewed from webcams with no clear motive as to why, or any outcome of this collection.</p>

<p>I believe the paranoia from people on this comes from the fact that everyone thinks they&#39;re so damn special and don&#39;t realize that to other people, they are literally just another person in the world. Someone saw you naked when you didn&#39;t want them to? &quot;Oh em gee, I can&#39;t believe my privacy has been breached.&quot; Bitch, we weren&#39;t born with clothes on. Get over yourself, your naked picture is as insignificant as your neighbor&#39;s naked picture, or some random guy in India&#39;s naked picture. &quot;But people around me will know, see, and care.&quot; If they care and hold it against you, although you had no control of it, then they&#39;re stupid and you probably shouldn&#39;t interact with them in the first place.
The quote goes, &quot;I never bother about that. Those who matter don&#39;t mind, and those who mind don&#39;t matter.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, this is not far from the truth. The main purpose behind the governments mass surveillance programs is correlation of data points using big data and data mining applications. It&#39;s the nature of this technology that the more inputs, the higher the quality of correlations. So they&#39;re not really that interested in the average citizen, as much as they&#39;re interested in the person who appears to be an average citizen, but who creates a &quot;data spike&quot; by the nature of the persons various activities correlating to something they&#39;re interested in. This data is not coming from your laptop&#39;s microphone or camera, but if you happen to be one of those citizens (or non) that create a data spike in correlation searches, then using your laptops mic and camera might be on their agenda. Its probably easier for them to put in a request for the FBI to fly one of their Cessna&#39;s around your house and gather what they need wirelessly from your laptops pre-compromised firmware and chip sets, thiough. </p>

Do you think there will just be a mass flood of criminal cases from the country vs the people and everyone will get a trial in court? The court justice system is already full on trials, cases, convictions, etc. There&#39;s no way they could pile on a large amount of cases and trials from &quot;crimes&quot; committed by citizens that were only known through an unauthorized access of a laptop webcam. I mean, how many crimes do you commit in front of your laptop? Do you leave your laptop in a position that is pointing at you committing crimes? How many people do you think commit crimes in front of their laptop and what crimes? Disregarding drug use, because the war on drug isn&#39;t about going after individual users, but manufacturers and distributors. </p>

<p>This is also not to mention statute of limitations. How long are they going to hold on to this information and footage? When will these cases start appearing? I feel like surveillance in this country has been going on for awhile, and how many instances have you heard about them accessing laptop webcams?  Or using information that has been collected to pursue anything?  </p>
