    <div class="md"><p>The derivation is extremely simple.</p>

<p>A planck length diameter sphere <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_particle">planck particle</a> divided into a proton charge radius sphere - multiplied by the planck mass.</p>

<p>You can simply divide one sphere with another because the way these planck spheres (PSU) are packed is space filling - via omnitriangulation.</p>

<p>Relevant quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Omnitriangulated geodesic spheres consisting exclusively of three­ way interacting great circles are realizations of gravitational field patterns... The gravitational field will ultimately be disclosed as ultra high­ frequency tensegrity geodesic spheres. Nothing else.” - Buckminster Fuller </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The planck particles are self contained em packets known as a &#39;geon&#39; - they also satisfy the Schwarzschild condition (planck mass in planck length sphere). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, so....</p>

<p>Proton charge is 1.6021766×10<sup>-19</sup> C and gives a sphere of volume 5.483× 10<sup>-57</sup></p>

<p>Plank Length is  1.616×10<sup>-35</sup> meters and gives a sphere of volume 7.033× 10<sup>-106</sup></p>

<p>The ratio of those volumes is 7.7961 × 10<sup>48</sup></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. Here is the step-by-step.</p>

<p>Proton charge radius: .8755 x 10<sup>-16</sup> m</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/widget/widgetPopup.jsp?p=v&amp;amp;id=1da8dd98eeb6ba861e0d978ff3abe109&amp;amp;title=Volume%20of%20A%20Sphere&amp;amp;theme=blue&amp;amp;i0=8.081%20*%2010%5E-36%20meters&amp;amp;podSelect=&amp;amp;showAssumptions=1&amp;amp;showWarnings=1">Proton volume with given radius</a>: 2.831 * 10<sup>-45</sup> m<sup>3</sup></p>

<p><a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/widget/widgetPopup.jsp?p=v&amp;amp;id=1da8dd98eeb6ba861e0d978ff3abe109&amp;amp;title=Volume%20of%20A%20Sphere&amp;amp;theme=blue&amp;amp;i0=8.081%20*%2010%5E-36%20meters&amp;amp;podSelect=&amp;amp;showAssumptions=1&amp;amp;showWarnings=1">Planck length diameter sphere volume</a>: 2.21 * 10<sup>-105</sup> m<sup>3</sup></p>

<p>Divide them and multiply by planck mass</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28%282.831+*+10%5E-45+m%5E3%29+%2F+%282.21+*+10%5E-105+m%5E3%29%29+*+planck+mass&amp;amp;a=*MC.planck+mass-_*Unit-">((2.831 * 10<sup>-45</sup> m<sup>3)</sup> / (2.21 * 10<sup>-105</sup> m<sup>3))</sup> * planck mass</a></p>

<p>Yields: 1.281 * 10<sup>60</sup> * planck mass = 2.788 * 10<sup>55</sup> grams.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/widget/widgetPopup.jsp?p=v&amp;amp;id=1da8dd98eeb6ba861e0d978ff3abe109&amp;amp;title=Volume%20of%20A%20Sphere&amp;amp;theme=blue&amp;amp;i0=8.776%20*%2010%5E-16%20meters&amp;amp;podSelect=&amp;amp;showAssumptions=1&amp;amp;showWarnings=1">wolfram volume calculator for given radius</a></p>

<p>And here is calculating the proton rest mass via these same principles but applying the holographic principle (planck masses that fit on surface / planck spheres in volume)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Surface Plancks on proton area with proton charge radius  : 4.71 * 10<sup>40</sup></p>

<p>Surface Plancks times planck mass: 1.02656 * 10<sup>36</sup> gram</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is the mass of the &#39;surface horizon&#39; of the proton.</p>

<p>Now all we have to do is divide by the plancks that would fit inside:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2 * (surface horizon mass / planck units in volume)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2+*+%284.7116551*10%5E40+*+planck+mass%29+%2F+1.2804*10%5E60">2 * (1.02656 * 10<sup>36</sup> gram / 1.2804 * 10<sup>60)</sup> = 1.603498 * 10 <sup>-24</sup> grams</a></p>

<p>The reason why we are only perceiving the rest mass of the proton outside of it&#39;s surface is because of the holographic network - instantaneous information transfer of the majority of the protons massenergy through planck sized wormholes connecting each protons surface (wheeler wormhole network). 10<sup>40</sup> surface plancks, each 10<sup>40</sup> connected to 10<sup>40</sup> - yielding ~10<sup>80</sup> - close to the approximate amount of particles in the Universe. </p>

<p>The amount of planck particles in the volume that don&#39;t have instant access to a surface port (~10<sup>20)</sup> just so happen to equal the rest mass of the proton.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to be a dick, but this guy seems to not be very credible in his &#39;field&#39;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(a) His overall argument is circular, which means it shows nothing. A hypothesis is presented that a proton might be considered as if it were a black hole, and his first conclusion, after a few pages of equations, is that the forces between them would be very strong, like the forces in a nucleus. But this goes without saying! If you pretend that something is as heavy as a thing can be, then it shouldn&#39;t come as a surprise to find that the forces would be as strong as a force can be. There&#39;s no significance in this whatsoever.</p>

<p>(b) His theory implies that the nucleus of a single atom of hydrogen has a mass of nearly a billion tons. This does seem a bit silly – but theoretical physicists do hypothesise apparently silly things sometimes, so that&#39;s not a deal-breaker. For obvious reasons, though, you need a very convincing reason to do something like that, including an explanation as to why we never measure this huge mass when we weigh hydrogen (or anything else), and none is given.</p>

<p>(c) The paper, while using some scientific terms, is presented at a very basic level. This could be considered a plus – all scientists would agree that there&#39;s nothing better than a simple theory, if it works. But Nassim is merely playing with equations from student textbooks (these are the only references cited in the paper), things that have been explored thoroughly for decades, and he&#39;s using them in a pretty simplistic way. It&#39;s unlikely that he&#39;ll find anything that hasn&#39;t been found before by doing this. What he has found is some values for things that look suspiciously like what he knew when he started. This is often what happens when you go around in a circle.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a bit of a joke to claim that anything profound can come from this kind of thing. But again, it looks cool, and it&#39;s clearly enough to impress a lot of his followers. And it won a prestigious award! (see above)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is Nassim Harameins unified field theory.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very hard to compress down to a post, which is why I posted these &#39;pointers&#39; or &#39;evidence&#39; so that people can jump into the rabbit hole.</p>

<p>Essentially, the claim is that the proton is a black hole. It contains the mass of the universe in vacuum fluctuations. When you apply the well known holographic principle for a black hole, meaning the surface encodes the volume, you go from the mass of all protons 10<sup>55</sup> grams, to the mass of a proton, 10<sup>-24</sup> grams.</p>

<p>So although the mass of the universe is really in each proton, from outside the event horizon we are only getting a few of the vacuum fluctuations, which happen to equal the proton rest mass.</p>

<p>Dividing a proton sphere by a planck length diameter sphere and multiplying by the planck mass, we yield the 10<sup>55</sup> grams. To deduce the rest mass:</p>

<p>We figure out how much mass would be on the outside plancks:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Surface Plancks on proton  : 4.71 * 10<sup>40</sup></p>

<p>Surface Plancks times planck mass: 1.02656 * 10<sup>36</sup> gram</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is the mass of the &#39;surface horizon&#39; of the proton.</p>

<p>Now all we have to do is divide by the plancks that would fit inside:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2 * (surface horizon mass / planck units in volume)</p>

<p>this is a generalized holographic principle equation</p>

<p>2 * (1.02656 * 10<sup>36</sup> gram / 1.2804 * 10<sup>60)</sup> = 1.603498 * 10 <sup>-24</sup> grams</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This solves proton confinement, which is the strong nuclear force, and it does it on the quantum scale as planck fluctuations - quantum gravity.</p>

<p>There is a geometry to the &#39;vacuum&#39; which is the fractal 64 tetrahedron matrix. There are plenty of resources on this at <a href="/r/holofractal">/r/holofractal</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s a myraid of reasons.</p>

<p>For one, I think this happens everytime there is a paradigm shifting understanding in science.</p>

<p>The reality tunnels which are built on a multitude of assumptions need to be broken down. When physicists evaluate this theory, they do so through their own lens of assumptions, some correct, some incorrect.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really hard to show we&#39;ve missed something huge 20+ years back, and we&#39;ve been doing non-sensible research since then (Quantum Chromodynamics for example) - and so this isn&#39;t even given more than a quick glance.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry if you&#39;ve answered this somewhere before, but I&#39;m confused.  If Quantum-Chromodynamics is &quot;unsensible&quot; then why do you the theory in <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/holofractal/comments/39b4mr/the_pattern_of_strong_charges_for_the_three/">this post</a> to validate what you are talking about?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I guess that&#39;s true, which is why I like to entertain all kinds of possible things, but I would imagine this is true for some other renowned physicists around the world who would then pick up on this idea? Or am I wrong in assuming people are as open-minded as I think they are? I can imagine that you would scoff at a theory that&#39;s been made by someone who doesn&#39;t have any degrees, but then  surely you would at least indulge yourself into cracking this theory and perhaps finding there is some merit to it?</p>

<p>The information presented is rather simple to refute: most of those numbers are not based on any physical observation at all, and are not valid or accurate whatsoever. None of them are independently reproducible. We can start with &quot;the mass of the known universe&quot; which is definitely not a quantity that we can measure at all.

<p>It&#39;s not coincidental that the theoretical numbers line up; they are all pseudo-science myths created by occultists who believed in the power of numerology.

<p>It&#39;s math. If we have 10<sup>55</sup> gram proton mass (divide a proton charge radius sphere with a planck length sphere and multiply by planck mass) and then this proton&#39;s diameter is blown up to the diameter of our Universe, the resulting mass energy is the cosmological constant.</p>

<p>That same source gives the mass of a proton as being 1.673 × 10<sup>-27</sup> kg which is quite a bit different than the 10<sup>14</sup> g which appears in <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/holofractal/comments/2p3h8t/the_holographic_universe_vs_the_standard_model/">this link</a> you listed above.  Apparently the additional &quot;mass&quot; is due to the &quot;proton would be spinning/orbiting at very near C, which results in a 10<sup>14</sup> gram relativistic mass&quot; .  Could you please explain then why the mass of protons is not observed to be anywhere near 10<sup>14</sup> g?  I find this really confusing.</p>

<p>Also, if protons spinning at &quot;very near C&quot; account for the &quot;strong force&quot;, then what exactly are the particles that we currently consider to be protons with a 1.673 × 10<sup>-27</sup> kg mass, and where does their strong force come from?</p>

<p>The proton rest mass is deduced within one standard deviation.</p>

<p>The proton charge radius is within .072% of a new muonic hydrogen proton accelerator experiment.</p>

<p>The mass of the proton at the surface is exactly the mass needed for proton confinement (strong nuclear force).</p>

<p>The gravitational to strong force coupling constant is deduced exactly, as the ratio of surface plancks to volume plancks (~10<sup>20).</sup></p>

<p>The dark energy or cosmological constant is also an exact deduction.</p>

<p>This is during a lunar eclipse. You can see the curvature of the Earth on the moons face. I believe it was Pythagoras that first postulated this. </p>

<p>Or another easy way of figuring out that the world is round is to simply sail a ship away from shore. If the Earth were flat you would see the ship simply get progressively smaller but we know that the ship will start to dip below the horizon, this would not be possible in a flat earth scenario. </p>

<p>Maintaining orbit over a flat earth would be impossible, you are essentially falling so fast around the planet you perpetually fall around it. Spaceships dont just sort of hang out up there they are moving incredibly fast. </p>

<p>Not quite. That would be the limit of your vision, if the Earth were actually a ball. That would be as far as you could see from that height, because at that point the curvature of the Earth itself would occlude your view of anything.</p>

<p>There are so many examples of being able to see farther than 3 miles, both on land and at sea, that I can&#39;t imagine you&#39;re taking this seriously if you&#39;re asking me to provide one for you.

<p>Not really. If my eyes are six feet above the surface, the <em>surface</em> becomes impossible to see beyond three miles because of the curvature. But I can still see something that is above the surface. If a friend and I are both six feet tall, he would have to be almost 11 miles away before he was entirely hidden by the curvature of the earth. The derivation is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon#Objects_above_the_horizon">here</a>.</p>

<p>So yes, you can see further than three miles, because things stick up out of the surface.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not taking this seriously if all you&#39;re saying is &quot;You should be providing your own proof.&quot; I&#39;m genuinely willing to be convinced, but so far you don&#39;t even seem to understand your own argument.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t change the fact that all across the world, from land and from sea, we can see much further than any calculation of the expected curvature of that given point would allow.</p>

<p>Your aggressive argumentation combined with deceptive techniques leave me unconvinced that you are genuinely interested in this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Statue of Liberty is 326 feet tall, or 100m. That means it wouldn&#39;t be hidden over the horizon to a 2m tall observer until he was 50 km away. If that observer is standing on the deck of a ship, let&#39;s assume he&#39;s 6m above the surface, the distance at which the statue of libery become hidden by curvature becomes 90km, about 54 miles. No problem there.</p>

<p>Can you show me a picture of the full statue of liberty from 60 miles away? I tried googling it but couldn&#39;t find one.</p>

<p>Again, the Isle of Wight lighthouse is 180 feet high, so 54 meters. An observer on the deck of a ship, 6m above the surface could see it from 64 km away (40 miles). Again, I don&#39;t see a problem between the numbers you&#39;ve quoted and a round Earth. And again, I tried to find a picture of this but couldn&#39;t. Where have I gone wrong?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So why does the amount of curvature observed increase with altitude? Are you only willing to consider evidence <em>for</em> Flat Earth and everything against it is just fabrication and lies? By that logic, any video that doesn&#39;t show curvature is using a lens that won&#39;t show it, so your video is worthless.</p>

<p>What about my other points? You&#39;ve yet to provide me with a single piece of reproducible evidence for non-curvature, whereas all the calculations I&#39;ve done and evidence I&#39;ve showed you is consistent with curvature. I&#39;m perfectly willing to concede I might have made a mistake somewhere, and I&#39;m open to being proved wrong. All you have to do is show me where I&#39;ve made a mistake. But apparently anything that doesn&#39;t agree with your view is a lie.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the point chosen for all the experiments the river is a slow-flowing drainage canal running in an uninterrupted straight line for a six-mile (9.7 km) stretch to the north-east of the village of Welney. The most famous of the observations, and the one that was taught in schools until photographs of the Earth from space became available,[1][2] involved a set of three poles fixed at equal height above water level along this length. As the surface of the water was assumed to be level, the discovery that the middle pole, when viewed carefully through a theodolite, was almost three feet (0.91 m) higher than the poles at each end was finally accepted as a new proof that the surface of the earth was indeed curved.[3]</p>
