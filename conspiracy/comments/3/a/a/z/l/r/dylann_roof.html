Those same pics seem to indicate something odd about his nose, though I can&#39;t quite make it out.

If he reloaded 5 times, did he bring 5 or 6 magazines? -those mags aren&#39;t cheap, or easy to buy unless you cherry pick them from gun sites; which would show a lot of premeditation. Or did he reload one mag 5 times?  Because that takes quite a while. Most of the .45 autos I&#39;m familiar with have a nasty recoil; strong men firing with an improper grip hurt their wrist, but this skinney kid had no problem shooting with deadly accuracy what, 40-45 times?Either the info I&#39;ve seen is wrong, or this whole scenario stinks.</p>

<p>&quot;We do know that once again, innocent people were killed in part because someone who wanted to inflict harm had no trouble getting their hands on a gun,&quot; <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2015/06/18/politics/obama-south-carolina-church-shooting/">Obama said</a> at the White House. &quot;At some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this kind of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries. It doesn&#39;t happen in other places with this kind of frequency. It is in our power to do something about it.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Surely, objectively, this is true?</p>

<p>He&#39;s not suggesting guns be banned or taken away... But at some point there has to be some acknowledgement that it&#39;s become far to easy for someone who has ill intent to get hold of one. Should no effort be made to address that? Or even acknowledge it?</p>

<p>These things <em>do not happen</em> elsewhere. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anyone knows the answer - clearly, even if some might like it - there&#39;s no disarming America, but there has to be some scope to look at these events and see if there&#39;s any changes that can be made which might at least reduce the likelihood of similar things?</p>

<p>But it&#39;s not just guns of course, it&#39;s far more complicated. And it&#39;s <em>hard</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>More comprehensive background checks and psychological screenings would be my answer. The problem isn&#39;t the guns. It&#39;s that people with supposed mental health issues, whom are often on a cocktail of SSRIs and other psychoactive drugs, are often able to get guns with no problem. I know my old roommate was bipolar schizophrenic and said he couldn&#39;t buy a gun. But people like the Tech and Colombine shooters got them no problem even though their psychological issues were well documented beforehand.</p>

<p>These things do happen elsewhere.  Even Obama didn&#39;t go that far.  They happen less frequently in the developed world.  They happen a lot in the undeveloped world.</p>

<p>The difference in the rest of the developed world is they have universal healthcare, better mental healthcare, better education, less wealth inequality, better education and less race issues.</p>

<p>Gun access is part of the issue, but probably a much smaller part of the issue than all of the above reasons.</p>

<p>It seems like the person in the first two side by side images has a nose that&#39;s either straight or slightly hooked.  Someone mentioned the nose looking like it might be fake, but it could be the white appearing at the tip of it in the right photo is actually part of the vertical L shaped pipe you can see behind him.  If you look at his nose in all the other photos it&#39;s obvious it turns upward rather than being straight or hooked.</p>

<p>In the first two side by side photos his hair is either cut short enough to reveal his ears, and/or tucked behind them.  The photo showing him with his hands cuffed behind his back indicates it may be the way his hair is cut that reveals his ears because it would be impossible for him to use his hand to push his hair behind his ear.  Could it be two different people?</p>

<p>These types of tools post right here, we should be quite familiar with them. This is what Nazis do, they kill people. Remember this the next time the Stormfront gang starts posting their recruitment propaganda here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only problem with your post is that much about this story is not &quot;generic&quot;. The guy&#39;s age. The fact that apparently he walked into a church he did not attend and sat there unnoticed for an hour before slamming into action.

<p>Maybe he really <em>was</em> a generic white supremacist. If it turns out he was, I&#39;d gladly sit right down here and say so, in front of God and everybody. In the meantime, we have nine lives tragically cut short, and something about the story stinks to high heaven.</p>

<p>Can you honestly ever imagine a story like this that you wouldn&#39;t immediately think was suspect?</p>

<p>I would be literally amazed if something like this took place and I came to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and didn&#39;t find a handful of highly upvoted threads calling it out as &quot;too convenient&quot; and saying &quot;something isn&#39;t right&quot;</p>

<p>While I generally don&#39;t believe that the government or anyone else is engineering events of this nature, I&#39;d at least have more respect for these theories if the initial suspicion wasn&#39;t raised simply because <em>they happened</em>. </p>

<p>In this case the guy seems like a troubled racist kid who had god knows what going on in his life. Mental illness? Maybe. Drug issues? Possibly. </p>

<p>Does it mean no-one should be allowed a gun? Not really. But the largely unfettered availability of firearms certainly does make it easier for people like this to act out violent fantasies and impulses. The same as it makes it easier for some people to take their own lives. That is a reality that should be considered - it&#39;s hard to know what the answer is, but pretending it only happens when the government makes it so is silly.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of millions of people in the US and it&#39;s pretty easy to get a gun. So it&#39;s not at all inherently unlike that something like this <em>just happens</em>. It&#39;s terrible that it does, but it&#39;s not improbable.</p>
