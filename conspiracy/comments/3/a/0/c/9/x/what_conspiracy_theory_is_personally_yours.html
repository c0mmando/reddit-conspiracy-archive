       The album 'Dark side of the moon' by Pink Floyd is actually telling us how our lives are trapped in an illusion which is probably orchestrated from the dark side of the moon. The songs 'Time' and 'Money' seem to be the obvious ones. The song 'Brain damage' if heard carefully depicts how the media influences us. The song 'Breathe' is how we are trapped is this world where all we do is run around like the quintessential sheep.  I have not been able to find any sensible meaning to the songs with instrumentals but i'm still working on that.

       What about the album cover?

       The triangle represents the Crystal Matrix of the Brain in which white light is passing through and it separates and gives the different colours of "life" as we know it as the illusionary hologram that it really is.

       Yes!  That too. I'm almost certain this album has something to it. All the really popular songs/albums seem to have a hidden message (like stairway to heaven).

       Obama is a double secret agent. He pretends to work for Jesuit bankers but really he's playing for Gnostic Masons.

       The purpose of destroying the middle class is to unite all workers under one banner. The purpose of globalization is to unite all oppressors together under one banner. The stage will soon be set for an uprising of the workers of the world against the ever dwindling numbers of their oppressors. Assuming everything goes wrong, we'll officially be a Class I civilization by 2115.

       Disclosure hasn't yet happened because the quickest way for aliens to visit us is through dimensional hopping. Most aliens are thus in the 5th, 6th, and higher dimensions. Oh, and they consume human experiences like we eat food. Our 3d lives are alien food. They farm us.

       There is a
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_the_Works_of_Religion">
        Vatican Bank
       </a>
       (the IOR) that is technically not a Rothschild bank. But thats really splitting hairs, because I'm confident there has been a Rothschild interest represented on their Board at least since the Industrial Revolution, if not before. So I would guess that their banking interests align and collude, but are technically separate.

       First 30% - The AI is already in power and manipulating people to make us addicted to itself. So that when people will understand that AI is in power, they can't get rid of that addiction of screens.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that this year the bilderberg was just a circlejerk for the people in the conference, while AI carefully manipulated those people through all the screens. Otherwise, i can't just understand how people in that conference could be so childish while having all that power..
      </p>
      <p>
       The other 30% is that people in power are really just power-hungry bastards who rationalize their existence and position every moment. It's just so frustrating to see normal people to get power(and get into some umm... organization) and in some months they totally believe that they deserve that power and other people are just wild animals who should be herder anyway. The old ''we are good, they are bad'' stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the other 30% is that... beings(uhuh, aliens) just created us to see how the experiment would go. And the cycle continues, with different programs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, leftover 10% goes to combination of any kind to these three theories.

       That the UFO situation,  especially in the early
       <em>
        "area 51"
       </em>
       era,  were really tests for nuclear powered aircraft.   The material used needed to be light,  protect the pilots from radiation, weight being a big problem,
       <a href="https://www.google.co.in/patents/US3075925?dq=lightweight+radiation+shielding&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0CB0Q6wEwAGoVChMIwMuTseuTxgIVwo8NCh0LWgCi">
        leading to the testing of different materials
       </a>
       , ironically,  shielding such as this also happen to be what these "balloons" in the official report,  were composed of.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.rense.com/general45/drop.htm">
        The airforce tested a few dirty bomb-like tests
       </a>
       that have been documented, for odd reasons, I believe to asses a possible crash of said aircraft.
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear-powered_aircraft">
        It's also well known that they did in fact create nuclear powered aircraft
       </a>
       ,  but the program was supposedly scrapped.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe it was scrapped. I think that given the nuclear public perception being very negative,  the airforce felt it was critical to not alert the public that the US was flying nuclear reactors over their heads....as well as being a secret project.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anyone could rationally explain to me why the airforce wouldn't want a bomber with unlimited range,  I'm all ears.   But I sincerely doubt they stopped the project.   Combine negative US public perception of nuclear technology with the cold war era secrecy (especially in the realm of nuclear technology), I think the projects and materials to protect the pilots were scattered all over the desert and not the remains of a balloon or alien space craft.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash-Landrum_incident">
        There have also been some UFO witness reports that entail radiation sickness from UFO's
       </a>
       near bases, resulting in lawsuits.  The aircraft might be obsolete now with drones and satellites,  but up until the mid 90's,  I would bet money we had them.

       The lynchpin for societal change lays with the sheeple.  Otherwise known as, “the bewildered herd” in

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       It is well known through
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sno1TpCLj6A">
        conformity experiments
       </a>
       and study of
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds3-ljxTRvo">
        Groupthink
       </a>
       the perceived collective can influence the judgment of at least 30% of individuals most of the time.  It also found that 75% of the individuals can be influenced some of the time.  In other words, you can fool some of the people all the time.  You can fool most of the people some of the time, but you can't fool all of the people all of the time.  But what does this mean?
      </p>
      <p>
       It means about 30% of the population are conformist individuals (sheeple) and easier to manage, manipulate, and maintain than the majority.  They can be brought to believe almost anything given the right incentive/stimuli.  The remaining vast majority is too divided, ideologically, to agree in any meaningful way.  Yet, even they can be influenced on some things.  TPTB are clearly aware of this and continue to work hard at keeping the majority fighting amongst themselves.  They have divided the majority, and conquered the minority.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why reason, facts, and logical debates remain inadequate tools against the bewildered herd.  It's not about reality, it's about what people think is reality.  These people are the key in moving society.

       I didn't invent this one but I like it and it's not that widely known. This theory is called the Cryptoterrestrial hypothesis by a guy named Mac Tonnies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The basics are that UFO's, aliens etc. are not from some other galaxy. They are native to Earth the same as we are. The difference is that they evolved first, gained superior tech and intelligence. They use these attributes to conceal themselves from humanity at large and to exert whatever influence on us for whatever purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interesting fact. Mac Tonnies died from a "heart attack" when he was 32 or 33 years old.

       Rather than robo-callers and other telephone nuisances being forced to not call, the do-not-call list puts all burdens on the people hated by the evil lawmaking scum who decided against the "call" list.  I know this theory is probably not mine, but I believe I made it.

       This one is probably thought up by many. All social media was invented or funded by the government. It is simple, fun way for the government to track you, look into your background and can also be used for black mailing. Google, Apple and other major technology builders are branches of the CIA fulfilling and assisting in making this happen.

       My theory is that most of our opinions and ideas are contrived from some silly experience or observations of the pack, most of our interactions are an attempt at getting some form of attention that feels relevant or necessary but ultimately is exaggerated beyond the basic need we might be basing it on.  And here we are in this thread, with those non-serious contrived theories that are mostly an attempt at amusing ourselves and others, I see very little reasonable attempts at making a point or making a complete theory which of course is impossible since we are talking about a theory based on very little information and as thus we are contriving them.. yet we don't even take the idea serious enough and we are mostly just making "joke theories" since most can either be laughed at or are so poorly explained that they can be argued against quite easily.. the thread itself is rather silly since only someone deluded or deliberately making a joke out of a theory could participate here since none of us has an original theory, in fact I think original thought in it's essence is extremely rare, the best we can hope for is to just add some tiny contrived addition to an already established idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh and just to join in on the fun.. you know how in adverts there are those people who seemingly have been using a product and they are giving us their testimony, I don't think they are giving a true appraisal, but a contrived one in order to sell the product.. they're actors you see, coupled with a scene seemingly showing the product in action usually in the form of some small test and/or computer generated animation.  The actors are usually terrible too, they exaggerate their words, like.. it's AMAAAAAAZING!!! oh it's just FAAAAAANTASTIC! and they have these extreme expressions of pleasure on their face.. almost like the effect The Joker's laughing gas has on people.  So yeah, they're totally fake, I'm not sure why they use such bad actors though.. is this just an attempt at making fun of us, like as in if we fall for these fake testimonies then they have a laugh at our stupidity each time someone buys it and "mentions the advert" which they always get you to do in order to get a special discount.. the special discount.. lol.. they overprice it and then act as though the lowered price is a good deal when it fact it's the actual intended price.  Anyway, fake testimonies in adverts are fake.

       Why? They have nothing to do.

      <p>
       Are they souls?  Probably, but reincarnation doesn't really mean anything.  So I don't use that term.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do they exist? No idea.  Their existence seems entirely pointless.  I wouldn't believe it , if I didn't have strong subjective experience related to the matter, (and no, I don't do any drugs.)  An example is that I asked for a sensation to prove their existence, and I got a strong sensation in my hand.  I couldn't reproduce this however.  (It's pretty obvious, however, that they're not allowed to let people think they are really around.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I think they manipulate people.  Possible examples are retarded stuff like religion, wasting potential, making really bad decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       My background? Strong skeptic.  For example, I think the alien theories are theory.  Also the idea of a God doesn't even make sense to me; but it's required for these beings to exist.  It's truly a shame.

But thats really splitting hairs, because I'm confident there has been a Rothschild interest represented on their Board at least since the Industrial Revolution, if not before. So I would guess that their banking interests align and collude, but are technically separate.
