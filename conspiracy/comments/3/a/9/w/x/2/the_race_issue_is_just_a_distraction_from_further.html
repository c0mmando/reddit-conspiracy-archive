<p>Billionaire jew George Soros already aimed for &quot;civil unrest&quot; in Ferguson by bankrolling various groups with 33 million USD to instigate national protests:</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.is/o6HF7">https://archive.is/o6HF7</a></p>

<p>What&#39;s really happening:</p>

<p>The hugely controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership is largely ignored by the media:</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.is/49EFj">https://archive.is/49EFj</a></p>

<p>Wages haven&#39;t increased in 50 years:</p>

<p>The 1 percenters got much richer during the 2008 subprime crisis recession:</p>

<p>The next financial crisis is coming soon:</p>

<p>The CEO of JP Morgan Chase Jamie Dimon stated in a shareholder letter in April 2015:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some things never change — there will be another crisis, and its impact will be felt by the financial market.</p>

<p>The trigger to the next crisis will not be the same as the trigger to the last one – but there will be another crisis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>JP Morgan is buying massive amounts of physical silver (the estimated physically available silver supply of traded futures is 1:11 or higher in comparison to silver only available on paper) right now in anticipation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>JP Morgan has accumulated another 8.3 million ounces of silver in just the past 2 weeks alone.</p>

<p>Is JP Morgan accumulating silver at these depressed levels in anticipation of geopolitical and financial turmoil?</p>

<p>It seems likely.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An independent researcher has uncovered that a jewish tradition is linked to past recessions as well and is a good indicator that there will be another recession in September 2015:</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to say if lone gunmen attacks are false flag operations, or just reactions to anti white media propaganda, but it wouldn&#39;t surprise me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Race, Religion, Sexual Preference... using aspects of other people to incite hate is an age old practice.   It works.</p>

<p>The only way racism will go away is when we no longer refer to each other by race.   When people begin to identify themselves as a human, rather than a white human, black human, etc.   At that point we will have beaten racism.</p>

<p>It is very easy to control people via division.  The saying &quot;divide and conquer&quot; is true.   What people are not looking at is the fact that what another person looks like, does, believes, has ZERO impact on you unless they actually infringe upon your rights.   If you believe my being black, or white infringes upon your rights in any way then you are a fool (not referring to OP, but just in general).</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be happy when people stop using race as a weapon.   The black people will not win anything by talking about black and white.  The white people will not win anything by talking about black and white.</p>

<p>News should say &quot;A man kills 8 people at church&quot;.    Stating a white man killed 8 black people just fuels the fire.   The bonfire of racism will continue to burn as long as people keep piling on the fuel.</p>

<p>Is murder a good thing?  NO.   Is violence a good thing?  NO.    This is the case regardless of race.   Anytime someone mentions race in conjunction with something they create groups and divisionary mental pictures and they fuel the bigotry.</p>

<p>We must see BEYOND race.   If someone&#39;s action infringe upon your rights say something.   If a person&#39;s action has no impact on you and has no victim other than themselves then back the F#$@! off.   Let people live their lives.   Quit letting people control you by using race, religion, gender, political affiliation, visiting team, etc tactics...</p>

<p>Wake up.</p>

<p>EDIT: This is not to say there are not racists.   There are.   All over the place.   They certainly are not just white either.   The only way they will stop teaming up in US vs THEM mentality is to stop viewing each other as US vs THEM.   Stop intentionally segregating yourself.   Don&#39;t ask for stories about white people.  Don&#39;t ask for stories about black people.   Ask for stories about people.   No matter how much you may think you are not racist, if you participate in separating people and talking about color you are fueling racism.   I don&#39;t believe it can be beaten until we view each other as humans.   To me race should be no different that blonde, brunette, red head... or brown eyed, blue eyed, etc.</p>

<p>EDIT 2:  Some people are orange.   Think of the tanning agents that don&#39;t come off too well.   Should we team up against them?   If we eliminate racism... will we then start attacking people for hair color?   Not likely as it is too easy to change.   In Africa we had people killing each other over nose shape... neither side was white.  (watch Hotel Rwanda the movie - very sad).   Why do people feel they need to group up like herd animals and charge at and attack other herds?</p>

<p>For example, Zionism was built upon the idea of &quot;a land without a people for a people without a land.&quot; This means that, foundationally, Zionism is also a denial of Palestinian existence.
