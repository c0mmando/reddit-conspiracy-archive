       MK Ultra/Monarch slave is totally possible, or even the blackest of black ops guys. I could see it. BUT....
      </p>
      <p>
       We're talking about a state that still flies the Confederate flag over its state house. And if you've ever spent any time in South Carolina, you know it's deeply racist.
      </p>
      <p>
       But coming full circle, it's the church location that makes me think False Flag, because then you've got the whole Satanist angle as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'm not making any decisions yet. Let's see if they get this guy, and how much of a scapegoat he appears to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for tossing this out there, though. It's worth considering.

       LOL. Completely untrue. And even if it were true, they'd have every right, considering they're treated like 2nd class citizens but for a few Uncle Toms, a racist flag flies over their State House, and S.C. was one of the most vociferously pro-slavery in the nation.

       All I know is this is a heinous crime. Having said that, labeling it a "Hate Crime" serves no purpose other than political pandering. 9 deaths is a death penalty case on its face. Hate crime labeling is only to enhance penalties. Unless someone knows how to enhance the penalty of a crime beyond death, I'm all ears? Fanning flames of more civil unrest is all I see as a result of doing it. That Chief and Mayor are idiots!

       Indicting for a hate crime insures the admissibility in evidence of all his racist bullshit, as evidence of specific motivation.  And getting at the truth lets the pus out of the civic wound he created.

       For 9 deaths, you don't need "racist bullshit" to get JUSTICE. That is a death penalty case period. The only reason to drag this into the media and federal courts as an example of "white racist evil America" will only serve one purpose and that is pushing the propaganda that white America is racist, evil and the cancer of the world and gun control. No Justice purposes can be served that would enhance the penalty of death. So, I stand buy my analysis.

       Your analysis ignores the rules of evidence, which would otherwise exclude his racist history (assuming an asswipe who flies the Rhodesian and South African apartheid era flags on his shirt has one) as more prejudicial than probative on the homicide alone, at least prior to the penalty phase of a capital case.  Getting that evidence before the jury in the guilt/innocence phase would be useful, so indicting on a hate crime serves a purpose.  And a country that spawns shits like this has a lot to answer for in the "racist evil" department, so public purging is a decent add-on.

       Probably with that climate, not acknowledging it as a hate crime given the facts might have caused a bunch of anger.

       Yeah. I see what youre saying, but the alternative, while irrational, could have made things worse is all I am saying. Usually things happen for a reason.

       I wanted to cite this. I do not wish to denegrate anyone's reputation over what are just allegations in this article and the ones it links, but I thought this might give a few pieces of the puzzle about why the shooting happened...?

       If I had to guess, and I don't, I would say that some group decided that things had been too quiet for too long on the racial front... I suspect this was somehow sanctioned, but I haven't found any evidence yet to actually point that way. Maybe someday they will enact whatever changes they want without seeing violence and murder as a necessary or efficable means of doing so. Oh them...
