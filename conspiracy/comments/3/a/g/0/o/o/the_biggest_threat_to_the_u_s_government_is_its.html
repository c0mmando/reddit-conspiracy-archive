<p>The U.S. Army illegally ordered a team of soldiers specializing in &quot;psychological operations&quot; to manipulate visiting American senators into providing more troops and funding for the war, Rolling Stone has learned – and when an officer tried to stop the operation, he was railroaded by military investigators.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always kinda wondered if the Saudis didn&#39;t set up 9/11 to sic us on Iraq and Afghanistan, so that <em>they</em> could gain access to and control of the oil reserves there, and use our military as a proxy to act as watchdogs for them.</p>

<p>I mean, 15/19 hijackers were from SA. 0 from Iraq, 0 from Afghanistan. Why go to war with countries that weren&#39;t even involved?</p>

<p>Because there&#39;s no way that Bush would bite the hand that&#39;s been feeding his family since grampa Prescott made a deal with the devil.</p>

<p>Nice going. Saddam, shitstain marauder that he was, was really the only thing keeping insane radicals like ISIS from filling the void. Saddam was a secular aristocrat who had so little use for the Islamists that he executed them for posing a threat to the regime. He wasn&#39;t an ayatollah and nothing about his government was &quot;Islamic&quot; in any way. It was a military junta. The Ba&#39;athists were actually more comparable with Soviet-style Marxism than Islamism. Their full official name was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ba%27ath_Party">Arab <strong>Socialist</strong> Ba&#39;ath Party.</a> One of their founders was a Syrian <em>atheist.</em> They were pan-Arab nationalists, not pro-caliphate Islamists.</p>

<p>Nice job, George the Lesser. In bungling Gulf War II you basically set the stage for World War III.</p>
