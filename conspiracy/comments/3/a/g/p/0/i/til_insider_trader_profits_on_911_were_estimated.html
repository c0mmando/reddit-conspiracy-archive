       </p>
       <p>
        According to Phil Erlanger, a former Senior Technical Analyst with Fidelity, and founder of a Florida ﬁrm that tracks short selling and options trading, insiders made oﬀ with billions (not mere millions) in proﬁts by betting on the fall of stocks they knew would tumble in the aftermath of the WTC and Pentagon attacks.
        <strong>
         Andreas von Bulow, a former member of the German Parliament, once responsible for the oversight of the German secret services, estimated that proﬁts by insider traders were $15 billion. . .
        </strong>
        Jonathan Winer, an ABC News Consultant, said ‘it’s absolutely unprecedented to see cases of insider trading covering the entire world from Japan to the US to North America to Europe.’ (quoted in Zarembka, 2008, p. 64)

       I'm sure that it was investigated - at least until they found that the results pointed to the "wrong people", and publishing it would be a "politically incorrect" disaster.
      </p>

       Then the "investigation" was halted.

       They are based on little more than faith.  Something the world is running dangerously short on.  Remember seeing yours drop by over 50% in 2008.  They've been printing money and pumping much of that into the stock market ever since.  You can't run at 0% forever, and by the time you're ready to pull yours out, do you really believe any is going to be left?

       Made up? Not really.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're looking at actual economic fundamentals it's clear where things are going. The collapse of 2008 should have been far worse, and we would have slowly recovered worldwide over the next decade. Instead, central banks doubled down to buy the economy another 10 years or so, thus ensuring that when the next bubble pops it will be more catastrophic than the worldwide great depression of 1929....far more.
      </p>
      <p>
       And before you state some uninformed crap like "well the stock market is at all time highs" realize that's completely meaningless in the context. Central banks are basically printing money with QE or european equivalents in order to keep markets afloat. This keeps stocks up but doesn't fix underlying fundamentals.

       Professional/retired trader here (not licensed anymore, trade from own acct.).  20 yrs. experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is something I have always looked at personally as a smoking gun (simply because of my own personal insights).  I read the investigation docs (SEC and stuff posted to the media) and everything I could find on this years ago after insider trading came to the forefront.
      </p>
      <p>
       The options/derivatives market to most is a complicated market where finding who made these trades is an extremely difficult task and an almost impossible job.  At least that's what the media has initiated and it appears the SEC after the fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       This couldn't be further from the truth.  Even the lowest broker (Registerd Rep in call center at Schwab) could have called time and sales and pulled a giant volume put and then found the account and name in question in a matter of seconds.  The first news that came out was that they couldn't find who did it because of the shadowy derivatives market, but once that was called out as bullshit by guys like me they changed the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       I worked on an options desk where some of the worlds elite traded options (clients).  I wish I could have been at the firm to check time and sales and then match that data to the accounts of those placing trades that morning and other days leading up to 9/11 (750 of 1000 of us were layed off in the dot com bubble in June 2001) via put contracts of size, especially via the airlines and other companies on the periphery.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would have been this easy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't buy the story that some newsletter or institutions trading quant type models made the perceived volume for these trades (Obviously some were, but few).  Based on the amount of Open Interest that was created in these contracts at that time, the market was lopsided that morning before the planes even hit.  The brokerages that took positions on the other side of these transactions (normal hedge) would have been screaming foul and found who it was immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, size is never traded from these newsletters.  Everyone on the street does their own research because they realize early on that these services are just money making ops for the newsletter writers and they can't be trusted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, a pro who didn't want to get caught would not have traded puts on airlines in the first place.  This would have been a dead giveaway.  Yes, I believe some dumb ass politicians and their friends probably did with insider knowledge and this was covered up, obviously.
      </p>
      <p>
       **The futures market would have been the place.  This is where the answer lies, but yet the powers that be have sent everyone on a wild goose hunt in a completely wrong direction.  Because of the dollar amounts you can use (billions), the dark pools and inter connectivity of the futures market in terms of its Global use is the market of choice by those with enough power to pull strings like these.  This my friends is where the answers lie.  Unfortunately, it's like a homicide investigation and the perps, well let's just say they've already left the crime scene.  The financial crisis that has come and gone has probably destroyed if not forever buried any information of historical record from futures transactions that day.  (Via buyouts, 7 year shred rules, etc.) But, maybe, just maybe the CTFC has docs that have simply been sitting, waiting for someone to look into these transactions via a FOIA request.  I'm not sure if that can be done but who knows.  Maybe someone like us has put those records right on top for all to see someday.  ;)

       If you read the entire investigation you will notice there was no involvement of the CTFC, which means the market where the largest and most easily placed, hidden and liquid transactions in the world weren't even investigated.

       That's what I'm saying.  If I were to trade in inside info I would trade futures, especially if I was working with millions (or billions), preferred more liquidity, wanted a darker (less visibility and more anonymous) market to operate and could make moves without anyone the wiser.  The real players on Wall Street work in the futures and commodities markets vs the options, equities and bond market.  In fact most mutual funds, ETFs and other packaged investment vehicles use the futures market because of the size of their funds and the ability to more closely mimic the moves of the equity and bond markets.  It's cheaper for larger trades, open longer and provides much more liquidity.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the other oversight members (exchanges, brokers, SEC, Nasd, etc.) were involved in the investigation, except the CTFC.  They were basically the only ones not involved.  Even foreign members to the exchanges and SEC were involved, but for some reason the CTFC wasn't even mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find this very odd considering the number of vehicles available to trade specifically tied to markets around the globe.

       If this is true, it means that people knew what was going to happen. That much is obvious.

       It also shows you that the ultra-wealthy can't resist taking advantage of any opportunity to make more wealth for themselves. Not even when doing so leaves a huge footprint in the data.
