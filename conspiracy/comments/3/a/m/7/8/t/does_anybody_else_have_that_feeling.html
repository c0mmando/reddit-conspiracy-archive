       Lately I've been getting this feeling that the whole world whether it knows it or not is gearing up for a major shift. I feel like that means war. But I could be wrong. I almost feel like I'm watching a movie were the protagonist can see the end. He can see the ways and paths to stop the end. Yet he can do nothing to change it as much as he struggles too. I get the feeling that we are all alive now to bear witness to something huge, something unprecedented in magnitude. does anybody else have these same gut feelings? Or is this just my head trying to wrap itself around my own existence?

       Its not just you. We're headed towards another economic crisis, wealth inequality is increasing, today's geopolitics (especially in regards to Russia and China) means WW3 could be just around the corner, and major institutions like Congress have lost the faith of the American people. Meanwhile, major cultural shifts are happening at an alarming rate, leaving plenty of people feeling like they don't fit in with their own society. Not many people anticipated things to go this south this quickly, and even if you consume news at just a surface level (turn on the TV in the morning before work), you're receiving a barrage of bad news that at even a subconscious level must be filling you with dread.

       One of the major things that I saw recently that brought a lot of this too the forefront of my thought was my previous job working high end construction just seeing the loss of any base in reality that so many people in America have. The way we are forced to massage the egos of the rich sickens me to the core. We have a new game show called the briefcase. If you haven't heard of it, it's about two in debt families given a briefcase filled with $101,000 each. The whole point of the show is each family has to decide how much money to keep and how much to give to the other family. we as Americans have now gone so far as too make sport of struggling families that desperately need the help. When any number of rich mother fuckers could just give that money away with no thought and yet they don't. We make a sport of it instead. Pitting 2 families against each other for our pleasure. What is wrong with America? It disgusts me too no end.

       Yeah, I've heard of 'The Breiefcase' as well. When real life problems are turned into entertainment, the seriousness of those issues gets muddled. Most Americans live paycheck to paycheck, but if they see someone struggling on the TV, as opposed to it being a member of their family or a neighbor, it somehow just doesn't register to them that this is real life.

       Yes. My take is that the internet and social media is quickly exposing a LOT of corruption to the brainwashed masses, and the system is preparing the propaganda machine and its stormtroopers (police/courts/military) to retaliate and/or maintain their authority with brute force.

       I kind of feel like jade helm is preparation for major war. Setting the equipment in place getting all the info we need to efficiently fight in our own homeland. Just under the guise of "war games" so as to not alarm the populace. You know what I'm saying?

       That's kind of in the back of my head haha. How dare we as a world populace want peace? I say whatever countries want war throw all "leaders" ie Putin, Obama, whoever leading China, Kim Jong un. Let them fight it out. After they're all dead if we still feel like killing more of the other guys well, we can suit up and follow our leaders. Instead of just going into the meat grinder.

       I believe that for America to go to war we should have to take a nationwide poll and in order to vote yes you have to fill out your info on a draft card. And when the announcement to go to war is made its also a draft notice of all people that voted yes. With no way to buy your way out and no exemptions. If you're not capable of fighting or being drafted you don't get a vote.

       The world has been on the edge of a crisis since "humanity" showed it's face. Isn't that just what they want? What they did with 9/11 to shift approval  towards the war? Keep you worried keep you scared. That is why the preppers  are such a threat the survivalists the ones that will be fine when everything else goes, the ones that can't wait till it does.

       Well they almost won already, they control the food, transportation, technology, energy, intelligence, education, gouvernment, healthcare, and so on... The army, police, court system and media propaganda machines. they basicly won. Now they just need to start something that will kill alot people without destroying hte planet in the process, unless they dont care and can fix the problem afterward...

       i was kind of thinking it might just be paranoid delusions of grandeur as well. A way for my brain to cope with reality and the very real probability that I will never change the world in the massive ways I'd hoped as a child. I stopped smoking pot because it was making me question reality too much. On top of that it stopped being "fun" once you examine in depth the idea that we can be living in hell and come too the conclusion that there's no way of knowing, or evaluate the idea that all of your friends could be figments of your imagination which you'd have no way of knowing if that were true or not. It kind of stops being fun. After about a year of heavy use I changed from being completely ok smoking any amount to easily getting paranoid and even was hearing full fledged arguments and full on conversations. the arguments and conversations generally were involving the things that were on the edge of my conscious insecurities, somewhat relevant problems. Etc.

       Suggestion:
  Go outside and clear your mind.  Enjoy the outside.
      </p>

       If you are correct and the world is about to change, it might be your last chance. It's also better than your current situation - stuck in your own head.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are incorrect and simply suffering from a broken brain, then going ouside and clearing you mind is good medicine for it.

       Weed just brings you to reality. You are "paranoid" because our current reality is indeed quite scary and something to be worried about, not the other way round.

       I meant paranoid as in like I was hearing mortars dropping around me and gunfire in the streets. People yelling etc. as a veteran all of that is a very real thought that happens everyday. I look for high ground find three ways out come up with an plan to deal with active shooter threats. Stuff of that nature run through the billion different scenarios in my head. Weed got to the point were it wasn't making me act because I knew it was just a drug. But to go from watching a comedy movie to curled in your bed reliving the worst nightmares of your life. That's the type of paranoia Im talking about. Hearing idf sirens even though I know they're not there. Hearing tank tracks and cannons boom bullets snap crack outside your window. That's the kind of paranoia I was experiencing.

       Idf in the army stands for indirect fire. Not Israeli defense force. They are what rings out when mortars are incoming. anything that vaguely sounds like it once you've heard it and been around it when rounds impact always puckers your butthole just a little couple that with being overly high and it's easy to hear brakes screech and let your brain do the rest. If you were asking whether I was actually hearing them or if I was in a war zone the answer is no. It was my overactive brain coupled with a split second stimulus and being overly high creating the sensation that I was hearing them just like I was back in Afghanistan.

       Pot was an instant no go for me as a kid. Some do well with it, it just left me feeling listless or not in control.

       Gardening or out door activities might be good for your spirits. I'm sure you feel like you gave plenty so how about hiking or swimming for personal stimulation that gets your heart moving and your brain excited. Rebuild a car? Take up RC planes?

       I'm not sure about that, I think that's kind of a dangerous assumption to make. I think you're right, weed heightens our perceptions of certain
       <em>
        aspects
       </em>
       of reality, but the same could be said if you take MDMA and experience the ecstatic, joyful side of reality that is within us, and our birthright. It's true that things are bad, and could get much worse, and it's good to sense that, and feel it, but you have to let it pass over you and not dwell in it and become helpless.

       You are right. Just to add to your point, with or without weed, we are all still largely helpless. Hence, when I smoke weed, I always think positive, joyful things. It gives me a state of bliss among the state of chaos we are in. I marvel in the dichotomy of that itself. Anyway, weed is a very personal/subjective substance and like everything else in life, it is up to the eye of the beholder to make what he wishes out of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't compare it with MDMA, because MDMA is a harder drug. Weed gives you a buzz for a couple of hours and then you can fall asleep like a baby, wake up next day feeling fully refreshed. I don't think you can say the same for MDMA, although it has its own therapeutic purposes as well.

       Who would this war be between? Not west vs Russia certainly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most likely for me would be something in Korea, current leader apparently is not very popular, how can he become more popular? War, Mussolini did it. Easy way to get popular

       I don't know. Honestly I see a lot of tension between Asia to include russia and America. Russia is certainly testing our defense with bombers and submarines stuff of that nature doing everything a boxer would do in the first round sizing the opponent up. Testing the defenses playing mind games stuff like that. If Russia attacks the east coast China attacks the west coast Korea could easily start a 3rd front in Asia the Middle East could certainly continue as a 4th front not to mention sleeper cells in America. Mexico although not outwardly siding with Russia is not completely against that idea. So there's a 5th possible front. I like to think that all these dominos aren't lining up in that particular order but there's a pretty good chance that they are. On top of all the biblical prohecies apparently culminating in the next few years. As well as multiple non religious prophecies and major goings on. It just seems to me to be a tumultuous and major time to be alive.

       I know about mad. But what would it take to just say fuck it? Being backed into a corner and sanctioned into oblivion? Controlling enough debt to know there's no way to feasibly have it repaid? Mad only works when you're talking about rational people who aren't backed into a corner. Like to people carrying guns going down a street in opposite directions. Both come drawn ready to fight. Meet in the center and say if you shoot at me. I Shoot at you. Now imagine instead of a street we are in a house with one way in one way out. One man comes in weapons drawn. The other was already sitting waiting weapon drawn. The man in the house is now essentially trapped. Of course mad is still in effect. But now there is only the one way out. What would it take for the man in the house to say fuck it. Maybe the guns just being pointed at him would be enough. Hit early hit fast. Hit hard. Maybe he might get out of there alive maybe he won't. Now imagine you are the man in the house. Would you bend to the will of the force standing on your doorstep? Or would you fight? That's just the way I look at it though. I know that many times prohecies have come and gone supposed seers have failed to see the tip of there nose. But although we do not fight major excursions like the crusades you cannot deny that we fight hundreds of proxy wars all across the globe. a big reason I feel a major war is coming is because everybody thinks there's no way it could possibly happen. Everything in the history of ever that people said there's no way of it possibly happening has happened. Titanic. Unsinkable. Germany in ww2. Unstoppable. Kimbo slice. Unbeatable. America falling under major attack. Unthinkable. Just my thought process

       Honestly, I don't think Russia will ever just say "fuck it". If you look at their country, it is absolutely massive and they have all the natural resources they need to be incredibly prosperous in the century to come. I think they know this, and are basically playing the waiting game for America to collapse. Better to let your enemy destroy itself than waste energy doing the job yourself. Maybe?

       The difference between nuclear mad and your examples is that in those examples both people may not get killed, only one might. With nukes both sides would be destroyed, no questions about that. Even if all the land based ones were stopped then the sub launched ones would fire.

       Titanic was called unsinkable because they didn't expect all of one side to be ripped open.

       For WW2 a much better example would be France. Don't forget they shouldn't have been defeated so easily, bigger armed forces in every way, the most defensive line in history.

       Also remember we remember the amazing in history. Not the things like 'a squad of cavalry charged a pike phalanx and they were beaten with little trouble'

       I agree that I am simplifying things. Nukes to guns countries to people etc. but the overarching idea is still the same even though the nuances are different. With current nuclear technology it may be possible to wipe our entire eastern seaboard out before we even knew what was happening. The idea that everybody would die is based on us knowing the ruskies launched the missiles with sufficient time left for us too react. The technology exists now to were the Russians could literally be a couple miles off the coast with rockets so powerful that we would have 5-10mins before Impact best case scenario. I can look up specific links detailing the technology if you want. Now if they surfaced 5-10 subs and launched 1 missile at every major target on the eastern seaboard who would be left? D.c. Gone. Nyc. Gone. Tampa home of jsoc. Gone. Joint base Langley eustis. Gone. Ft Benning home of the infantry and rangers. Gone. Ft Jackson. Gone. Ft drum. Gone. We don't anticipate an eastern seaboard attack which is why I believe it to be the greatest possibility. I'm sure that there are protocols in place for this type of thing. Unfortunately i don't believe our Cold War protocols will stand up too the million miles an hour warfare that would be required to overcome our borders. Also I'm not so sure that America as a whole has the heart to push the button anymore. We are a soft nation concerned only with materialistic frivolous things as a generality? The magineaux line was an impressive defensive line no doubt and you are correct it would have been a better example. The titanic sank specifically for that reason. Nobody thought of the whole side getting ripped open as a possibility. Therefore when it happened nobody knew what to do. Yes but sometimes the cav pushes through the pike phalanx simply by throwing enough meat into the grinder. Meat that we don't have. But China and Russia do. all of your points are taken, very well and that's a big part of why I believe war to be coming. Just because nobody thinks it will. We will not collectively disarm as a planet so war is inevitable.

       Ballistic missile submarines no longer even need to surface to launch their missiles. Each of their missiles also usually have multiple warheads, meaning just
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       of their missiles could wipe out 3 or 4 cities.

       Ok, so population centres may be wiped out. But bases in different parts of the country, subs etc would fire. Also consider that say for subs it would be military men pressing the button. Also if you were faced with total annihilation then your softness would be gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also consider that NATO'S first act of war would be to go nuclear
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't not think that war could be possible but I believe that if nukes were used by either side than it would be over for everyone. If they weren't (very unlikely with battlefield nukes).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also looking back on things we know why certain things happened that 'shouldn't' have. French morale was so terrible that they quickly broke (and blitzkrieg). Titanic, the captain took a more dangerous route. As for 9/11 (as you mentioned earlier) the security on internal flights was fairly weak, probably wouldn't have happened in Europe

       It's hard to read what you type out. You're all over the place and think Korea will start war. Jesus man. To top it off you think NATO would use nukes, thus ending civilization. I think NATO is smarter than that. There is an overall plan, and your entire idea is so far gone it's actually kind of entertaining.

       I'm not just listing off population centers for the sake of the civilian casualties the target areas I listed were demonstratably a large part of our overall leadership. Cut off the head the body dies that sort of thinking. Being a former military man I can tell you we do not train anywhere near as hard as the rest of the world. I don't believe nato or any country that is a major part of nato on the "good" side would push the button. We would try to fight this bear as gentleman. There would be a large outcry that nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons are beneath us. Don't worry our boys will get'em! That kind of thing. I could be mistaken, but don't flights get high jacked more often in the rest of the world? As far as the things that shouldn't have happened that's part of my argument. People making bad choices based on there belief that the bad things that can happen won't. You can do a dangerous and wrong thing 1,000,000,000 times successfully but it only takes one failure to figure out why it was dangerous and wrong in the first place.

       Nuclear subs (for Britain) had orders to open an envelope if they did not receive long wave radio (I think it was bbc 2) for two weeks.

       Also the firing of missiles would be picked up on instantly, retaliation would be swift and then the end. I don't think that military people (or anyone with half a brain cell) would realise that stupid nationalistic pride in the army would be pointless if nukes were flying to destroy your civilisation

       I don't think the security was good in internal us flights. In the 70s/80s (golden age of terror) there were lots of hi jackings. With PLO, IRA etc. even my grandad was on a hijacked plane once

       Yup thems the protocols I'm talking about! But due to current technology I believe those protocols to be outdated. Who knows we won't find out till it does or doesn't happen! Hopefully I can die an old pissed off paranoid nut bag! Maybe that's what I was thinking of the good ol' days when terrorism was an honest days work haha. But you are correct. Security was lax but rules were not. Had the populace been allowed to carry firearms onto planes such as a small sidearm 9/11 might never have happened.

       I don't think they would be outdated but as you said we won't know and probably wouldn't know about a nuclear war before we die from it instantly
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that the reason 9/11 was successful (well one reason) was that it was unique, before hijacks we're relatively safe, maybe one or two would die but if you kept quiet it would be fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also firearms would cause lots of planes to be destroyed, nutter has a gun and shoots a window or two out, the plane is pretty much fucked

       I didn't mean that the plane would implode or anything but having weapons on a plane is something that companies would rightly not agree to. If they have to replace Windows often or whatever it would not be worth the miniscule chance that a terrorist gets the plane.

       Yea but the reality of that happening is just not. there would be a few instances yes but the cost of a plane plus damages paid out to families is far greater than replacing even 100 windows a year.

       I'm not honestly sure. If you don't count the planes that went missing I believe so. Still if people were just riding around blasting shit away like everybody seems to think we do in 'Merica there'd be a lot more damage and destruction than there actually is.

       I heard about there flamethrower usage which is just an insane weapon to start with throw in some nut bags and we're talking real crazy. Did you see Isis' latest propaganda they released? They are definitely turning the holy shit scale up to 11 in my book they decapitated 7 men with det. Cord, drowned 5 in a pool in a cage with a bunch of go pros on it,  and blew up 3 more in a car with an rpg for target practice about a month ago they released another video showing them crucifying and dismembering a man for being Christian, throwing men off the roofs of buildings for being gay. They are definitely the most successful comic book villains ever.

       Haha I'm skeptical of everything. Generally I just pick the most outspoken dickhole and argue against whatever they're arguing for. I've argued some pretty crazy points just because. Like if you brought that up too me I would probably reply with something along the lines of well Star Trek looks good too. Or dr. Who has been portraying space since the 60's something just completely outlandish.

       Because it wasn't the Titanic that sank. Yes. You read that

       Leaders should be at the front. Inspiring men to great acts. Not cowering in bunkers deep underground.

       It's hard to read what you type out. You're all over the place and think Korea will start war. Jesus man. To top it off you think NATO would use nukes, thus ending civilization. I think NATO is smarter than that. There is an overall plan, and your entire idea is so far gone it's actually kind of entertaining.

       I'm not just listing off population centers for the sake of the civilian casualties the target areas I listed were demonstratably a large part of our overall leadership. Cut off the head the body dies that sort of thinking. Being a former military man I can tell you we do not train anywhere near as hard as the rest of the world. I don't believe nato or any country that is a major part of nato on the "good" side would push the button. We would try to fight this bear as gentleman. There would be a large outcry that nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons are beneath us. Don't worry our boys will get'em! That kind of thing. I could be mistaken, but don't flights get high jacked more often in the rest of the world? As far as the things that shouldn't have happened that's part of my argument. People making bad choices based on there belief that the bad things that can happen won't. You can do a dangerous and wrong thing 1,000,000,000 times successfully but it only takes one failure to figure out why it was dangerous and wrong in the first place.
