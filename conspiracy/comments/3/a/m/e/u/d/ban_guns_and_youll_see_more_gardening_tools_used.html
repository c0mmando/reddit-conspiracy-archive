       Every time there's a "shooting" the talk about gun control rises. Take away the guns and people will still harm each other, knives, scissors, landscaping tools, 2x4 with a nail through it, anything can be a weapon. Just like the first class on an airplane can have metal utensils, while us peasants, can't carry a nail clipper or leatherman. The law enforcement and military can have firepower but not the people? Firearms HAVE been created already and it's too late now, better for all sides to have em then just a privileged few, which would instantly give them power over the rest.

       This is literally happening already. Gun control in the UK worked
       <em>
        so well
       </em>
       that now there's a campaign for knife control.

       Let's not forget the only purpose of firearms isn't to harm people. Hunting, protecting livestock, protecting yourself from wild animals and target shooting all shouldn't have to suffer the loss of firepower in the name of babysitter style governing.

       They'll never be able to ban guns altogether.  It will be very hard for them to even limit them any further.  They will never get the votes from conservative Republicans from gun-states. Thankfully, the right to bear arms is expressly outlined in the Constitution.

       People who profit from social problems don't want them solved, and it is they who will send you off on a false crusade to prevent that. Banning privately held firearms will not solve the problems of inequality or institutionalized violence and racism that are at the root of killings like that in question; I'd venture to say it would actually make them worse.

       So why do other major countries have much lower homicide rates than USA ?  Plenty of racism and violence in England, for example.  But they have fewer guns, and much lower homicide rate.

       That's why I used the word
       <em>
        institutionalized
       </em>
       ; Americans are socially engineered toward racism and violence, whereas the British are socially engineered toward passivity. There are always exceptions, of course; not everyone is so easily influenced, but the people behind it deal in trends concerning millions of people, and centuries of time. Firearms are not the problem, and murder is usually just a symptom of what actually is.

       It's just that they don't have as many guns, so their homicide rate is about 1/5th of ours.

.I think your best chance of neither is mandating a living minimum wage, a negative income tax, and creating economic growth by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, and shifting from unsustainable factory farming to a regenerative agroecology.

       Good luck avoiding either if you're volunteering to line up outside the residences of holdout gun owners after the ban to collect their firearms from their cold dead fingers.

       For every person advocating a gun ban, I imagine a person dressed up in full riot gear lined up outside ready to die. If only you had such integrity. Instead I'm sure you'd send young, poor men and women to do the dirty work for you.

       Oh, I don't think we'd do that kind of forced confiscation.  If we banned guns, lots of law-abiding people would turn in their guns.  Manufacturing and sales would stop.  As criminals were arrested, guns seized from them would be destroyed.  Criminals would find it harder to get guns as the supply of guns to steal dried up.  Ex-wives and such would rat out gun owners.  As gun owners died, sometimes their inheritors would turn in the guns instead of keeping them.  It would take decades, maybe a century, but eventually we'd get 95-99% of the guns out of society.

       Yeah, I've heard that Japan thing before, and I think it's nonsense.  They missed taking out our aircraft carriers, and they would have been fighting at the end of a very long supply-chain.  And if they'd invaded, what would they have gotten, land ?  They needed oil and other resources.

       Guns are simple to use. In a fairly close space but you have the initiative then you would be pretty likely to hit them.

       Melee weapons also can be fought off with strength or technique and is a much more personal way to drive someone off

       I have shot a gun. They are basic weapons which require little skill to use unlike a melee weapon. Hence why they were adopted by armies quickly

       Have you ever cleaned a gun? Armies receive training. Even the bare bones militias. Orangutans can use spears. Chimpanzees can use cudgels. Only trained humans can use firearms with any degree of efficiency

       If people keep a gun in their drawer, don't use it often then cleaning won't be an issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is also far easier to stop someone who has a melee weapon

       True, true. But if you're going on a killing rampage, you'd have to train so regularly that cleaning guns would be necessary. Ask any regular shooter, accuracy is a learned skill. That's one of the most odd elements of many of these mass shootings the media perpetuates: many of the shooters shouldn't have had the skills necessary to achieve the results they did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe I'm wrong about that point though. Maybe 1st person shooters really do help.

       I know nothing, John Snow.
      </p>
      <p>
       I only vaguely recall some of these shooters having only gone out and bought guns shortly before the shooting (I think Virginia tech) or having been denied access to gun ranges(pretty sure that was the Aurora theatre.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I also vaguely recall experienced shooters suggesting the accuracy rates of these shooters would have been unattainable given the biographical knowledge of their histories with firearms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Others have attributed the anomalous accuracies and mortality rates to the "fish in a bucket" theory.

       Hmm well I suppose the first few kills are guaranteed, you choose the range etc, after that though I suppose some people would be cornered and hope for mercy.

       Is there figures for shots fired compared with kills?

       I think so. Supposedly the Aurora gunman was firing 50 rounds per minute into a packed theatre. I don't think he had a fully auto gun though and many reports alleged a second gunman.

       These things are always so obfuscated they probably don't even have a place in this discussion. :P

       50 rounds a minute is a lot, no way he could be accurate, does sound like an amateur tbh

       you're right.  there probably won't ever be a gun fight of organized civilians vs the state.  not because the state fears the gun owners but because civilians are complacent in the face of oppression.

       Our guns also did nothing to stop the Bush administration from weakening some of our key Constitutional protections after 9/11, did they ?  Did nothing to stop Bush from starting two decade-long losing wars, cutting taxes for the rich, adding trillions to the national debt.

       Yup.  Humans get angry, drunk, drugged, stupid, criminal from time to time. Some are crazy or borderline crazy. People's brains change over time, or under various influences, and the male brain in teenaged years is volatile. Very hard to predict or control what ANY person will do.
      </p>
      <p>
       These problems have always been with us, and all countries have them. What's different about USA, is that the USA is FLOODED with guns, so angry or crazy or stupid or criminal people can do as much damage as possible.

       It's misleading to point to one city or state inside USA.  We have no internal border controls.  Strict law in DC or Chicago is useless because guns can come in from Virginia.

       No, I think we could cut our homicide rate by 5x or 6x if we banned guns.  Percent of households owning guns has been declining in last few decades.  Eventually we'll outvote the gun owners and get guns banned.

       Reason to think we could cut our homicide rate by 5x or 6x if we banned guns: example of just about every other major country in the world.  They don't even have complete bans, just much lower ownership than we do, and they get big benefits from it.

       Social decay causes all violence. If you want to end the violence, start by mandating living wages, instituting negative income taxes, and funding the replacement of vastly outdated civil services like roads and sewers with maglev trains and composting programs.

       That statement.  You should try to find some facts to support it.  Many other countries, such as most in Europe, have the same kind of what you probably call "social decay" (less religion, more non-white people, more divorce, less marriage, more gays, higher unemployment, drugs, drinking, etc), yet they don't slaughter each other the way we do.  We need to ban guns.

The social decay I'm speaking of is poverty, hunger, and oppressive justice systems like the one in the USA that favors corporations over people, steals children from families, incarcerates individuals for victimless crime, persecutes people for self-medication, and otherwise sucks donkey Kong dick big time.

       Oh, I see, USA's homicide rate is higher because we have "poverty, hunger, and oppressive justice systems like the one in the USA that favors corporations over people" etc, and other countries don't ?  No poverty or hunger or corporate power in Britain ?  Our homicide rate is about 4.7x theirs.

       No, it would be great if violence in general was lower.  I was just showing that, even in a country where violence is higher, homicide rate can be 4.7x lower by restricting (not even banning) guns.  We should work to reduce violence, as well as ban guns.

       Look at Mexico vs. America- murders per million people:
      </p>
      <p>
       Mexico- 24 firearm mpmp and 218 mpmp total
      </p>
      <p>
       USA- 33 firearm mpmp and 42 mp total
      </p>
      <p>
       While 3/4 of murders in the USA are gun related and only 1/10 of murders in Mexico are gun related, Mexico still has 5x the murders of the USA despite the US having 6x the guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guns are tools. They can save lives or end them. Banning them does absolutely nothing to address the real causes of the violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Address the real causes. Quit blaming inanimate objects for injustices perpetrated by sentient citizens.

       Have you ever considered that the state keeps having this unproductive debate about taking guns away all the time, yet gun ownership has not declined?  This kind of talk just increases sales of guns and expands the budgets of enforcement agencies to have even more advanced weapons.  To me all this talk is about profits.  Not gun rights or safety.

       Actually the wild west wasn't all so wild because outlaws would be come notorious and then would be hung publicly. The system of peacekeeping they had was quite interesting. Most of the violence was actually racial. Those poor unlucky natives.

       Ban guns and you will see the formation of a terrifying black market for guns.  Drug gangs will look like boy scouts in comparison to the folks ready to import and distribute firepower.  And once that market is open, then you'll see an arms race.  LEO's will stop whining about extended pistol mags once the RPGs start coming in.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may be the case that guns are seldomly used for self defense.  Ban them and there's going to be a desperate need.  When a glock is worth $10k+ ambushes of LEO's will become commonplace.  Police stations, national guard armories, private security firms, these will all become targets.  We don't see IED usage in America.  Ban guns and that will change fast.

       Violent psychopaths cause this violence. Banning guns does nothing to deter them. Look at Britain's violent crime rate. A lack of guns doesn't make you safer. Across the world it's been shown healthy society makes you safer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Will less people own guns in a healthy society? Almost certainly. But I'll be damned if I'm gonna call the police every time I have to shoot a varmint in my chicken coop.

       It seems you anti-gun nuts prefer superficial solutions to real ones. Like banning meat before promoting agroecology. Or like banning cars before building maglev trains.

      <p>
       You want to stop the senseless violence? Create a society where the violence actually doesn't make sense. Build a world where loving thy neighbor comes before hating thy competition.

       It reduces the severity of the incidence. Knifes are extremely dangerous, but unlike bullets they don't fragment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, getting into a fist-fight is also potentially deadly, but it tends not to be.

       Those guns are being sold to existing gun-owners.  Doesn't matter much to the homicide rate when a guy who owns 6 guns buys 3 more.  Fewer and fewer gun owners are buying more and more guns.

       What is your proposed solution ?  I really want to hear other solutions from the pro-gun people.  I've heard:
      </p>
      <p>
       1- arm everyone
      </p>
      <p>
       2- arm teachers / fortify schools
      </p>
      <p>
       3- lock up all the crazy people
      </p>
      <p>
       4- tighten the gun-control laws
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think any of those will work, so I go with:
      </p>
      <p>
       5- ban private ownership of guns of all types, maybe except shotguns for home defense, if a total ban is not possible
      </p>
      <p>
       Why each solution above won't work:
      </p>
      <p>
       1- arm everyone: will greatly increase accidents, mistakes, suicides, stolen guns; will turn country into armed camps and fortifications everywhere; high cost.  No other country has found it necessary to do this to keep its citizens from killing each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       2- arm teachers / fortify schools: we've had shootings in schools, movie theaters, offices, post offices, stores, fast-food places, churches; going to arm workers in all of them ?
      </p>
      <p>
       3- lock up all the crazy people: we're not willing to pay for it; people's brains are very difficult to analyze and control; going to lock up all the near-crazy, drunks, druggies, anger cases, road-ragers, loser teenagers who MIGHT go over the edge ? Other countries have plenty of crazy people, but don't have the slaughter we have.
      </p>
      <p>
       4- tighten laws: okay, do it, but it won't stop the slaughter; I think the guns at Columbine and Newtown and Charleston, for example, were owned completely legally.  Some 600,000 guns are stolen each year in USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       5- ban guns: would work, but not politically possible at this time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any other solutions ?

       Fuck I must be a broken record:
      </p>
      <p>
       Fix society!
      </p>
      <p>
       Mandatory living wages or a negative income tax would seriously reduce poverty. Poverty is the mother of crime. Raise employment levels with projects that rebuild/replace our crumbling and archaic infrastructures with modern, sustainable systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for ducks sake fix our agricultural system. Factory monocultures of annuals are killing the planet's ecosystems while failing to feed our species.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want to know my solution? Feed the poor goddamnit. It's not just me claiming there is a positive correlation between hunger and violence. There's entire books written on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       All your options are completely nutters and ignore the root causes of the problems.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Guns don't feed people. Yes, hunting, I know. But seriously, all info indicates farming/foraging has provided in the bulk of calories in humanity's diet for millennia.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         These shooting do have a habit of occurring in gun free zones... Almost as if the shooters had signs directing them to defenseless targets... Still doesn't feed anyone though.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You're joking. Look how well this strategy has worked for drug users. The war on guns is less stupid than the war on drugs... I'll give you that. However neither of them hits at the poverty and hunger that causes the destructive behaviors we're trying to stop. For profit prisons are modern day slavery. Fuckign disgusting and won't solve the problem. Will only create thousands more.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Still not addressing the causes of the violence. I might agree with gun licensing that accompanies a training program would cut back on accidents. But without addressing the poverty/hunger issue, it won't do any good against the intentional violence.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Guns don't kill people. Hungry, poor, angry people kill people. Usually the people they blame for their poverty, hunger, and anger.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Or my solution
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Bring the poor out of poverty and feed everybody. I promise violent crime rates will plummet in a world with less to get angry about.
       </li>
      </ol>

       Sure, we should try to fix society.  We try to do that constantly.  But it sort of is impossible.  We're always going to have the crazy, and near-crazy, and fighting drunks, and druggies, and road-ragers, and wacky teenagers, and anger-management problems, and criminals, loose on our streets. Sure, we should try to identify and treat or limit them.  But why have society flooded with guns so these people can cause maximum damage ?
      </p>
      <p>
       And other comparable countries have all of those societal ills (mental illness, drugs, violence, crime, poverty, etc), yet don't have the slaughter USA does.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those first 4 solutions are things proposed by gun-guys, not by me.  I agree with you that they're nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       On #5: sure, guns BY THEMSELVES don't kill people.  But they make it really easy for people to kill people.  And countries with far fewer guns have far lower homicide rates than we do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why can't we fight poverty AND get rid of guns ?  Doesn't have to be one or the other.

       Fighting poverty is way more important than banning guns. Stop wasting your efforts on what you've already admitted is "politically impossible." Focus on the possibility of eliminating poverty.

       Why do many states with high gun ownership have murder rates that are about the same as that of Western European countries?
      </p>
      <p>
       You say, matter of factly, that the US high murder rate is because of high gun ownership when that clearly isn't the case when you look at it state by state.

       Yeah, there are variations.  And looking state by state or city by city is kind of useless because we don't have internal border controls in USA.  Strict law in Chicago means nothing if guns can come in from Virginia.

       How does that matter? States like New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine have hight rates of gun ownership and low murder and violent crime rates. The fact that guns can be transported around the country doesn't have anything to do with anything I said and I'm not sure why you brought that up.

       Healthcare access, a less overt racism perception (I know there are exceptions), and better educational access all help to prevent this kind of crime.
