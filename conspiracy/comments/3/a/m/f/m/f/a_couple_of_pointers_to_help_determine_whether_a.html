        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When there is a genuine mass shooting event, and when it&#39;s a case of an individual &quot;going postal&quot;:</p>

<ul>
<li>there will usually be an obvious motive (anger/revenge/jealousy) and, </li>
<li>the victims will generally be known to the assailant and targeted by him.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Boston Bombings, Sandy Hook, Aurora, and Charleston shootings all lack what I would call a plausible motive, as well as the victims being unconnected to the perpetrators (with the exception of the ethereal &quot;Nancy Lanza&quot;).</p>

<p>Again, if it&#39;s a real crime, and the motive is not obvious or it&#39;s presumed to be &quot;terrorism&quot;, </p>

<ul>
<li>the police will go to great lengths to establish whether that individual had accomplices - and they will arrest and charge anyone who aided/abetted the shooter in any way. </li>
</ul>

<p>However, in a false flag type event, which is conducted with the foreknowledge and/or active participation of the authorities the police/authorities/media will:</p>

<ul>
<li>immediately and repeatedly push the crazed, <strong>lone shooter narrative</strong> (eg Adam Lanza, Elliot Rodger, James Holmes and now Dylan Roof), and</li>
<li>make no serious attempts to investigate if the individual had accomplices</li>
</ul>

<p>In instances where the shooter is a mind-controlled (or entirely innocent) patsy: </p>

<ul>
<li>the patsy will usually be killed, often dressed up a suicide, (Adam Lanza, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, Lee Harvey Oswald) and</li>
<li>witnesses who could reveal the truth also have an unfortunate tendency to die suddenly (eg Ibragim Todashev)</li>
</ul>

<p>As a rider to this, I would add that a sudden, violent death of an investigative journalist or whistleblower, which is IMMEDIATELY declared by the authorities to be suicide or an &quot;accident&quot; (eg David Kelly, Aaron Swartz, Michael Hastings, Andrew Breitbart  etc) should not simply be accepted without question, particularly when there is no suicide note or where the immediate explanation (drunk driving in teetotaller Michael Hastings&#39; case) makes no sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fantastic points I myself have wondered about. When David Crowley reportedly sprayed his entire family with bullets and the rest of his family, neighbors and fans all clearly stated that it probably <em>wasn&#39;t</em> suicide - not a chance. And what do the cops do, close the case.</p>

<p>On the point about why they don&#39;t scrub for accomplices on these FFs, I was stunned (in the church case) to see all these potential material witnesses (his friends, actual crime witnesses) blabbing to non-MSM (also bizarre) type reporters all over the place about what he said his intentions were, what he was saying to people <em>at</em> the crime, <em>within</em> the crime scene. I thought, how in the fuck would real authorities allow these witnesses to blab to reporters about all the shit they saw. No way in hell that would happen with a random real crime where state senators are being shot, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, the fact that legal due process has been so royally trampled on here, is a great pointer to Charleston being a &quot;manufactured&quot; event. Also the fact that the victims families were somehow allowed to address the shooter in court was just bizarre.</p>

<p>I was also shocked by this. And, of course no video of the &quot;grieving&quot; families, just dramatic video of the shooter. The families are all getting huge sums of money as long as they behave as their handlers have instructed - and that&#39;s to play the noble Jesus-like characters using all the rightously-charged diction. Just for reference, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL8xIi3kyGE">here</a> is what a real victim acts like when confronted with the killer of a loved one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The victims have been going on about how they forgive, their hearts are full of love, bla, bla. Christ, it&#39;s absurd, unnatural. It&#39;s clearly an attempt to condition the public into thinking this is how they are supposed to act the day after a loved one is slaughtered.</p>

<p>The one thing I have yet to hear from Charleston, but which was a common theme from the Aurora victims, and from Sandy Hook (Gene Rosen in particular) was the need to &quot;go away from the darkness&quot; or &quot;go towards the light&quot;. Watch out for that. </p>

<p>Roof said he was &quot;getting involved&quot; with &quot;radical groups&quot; - yet no one wants to investigate these &quot;radical groups&quot; he was &quot;getting involved&quot; in?</p>

<p>I figure this would be a great chance to round up all the RACISTS in South Carolina, arrest some KKKs, &quot;name and shame&quot; some RACIST southerners.</p>

<p>But nope, even the fact he shot a Senator is being downplayed and no one else was involved at all.</p>

<p>Because 99% of those groups are honeypots for the FBI so they can pat themselves on the back for catching another &quot;terrorist&quot; with an IQ of 82.</p>
