<p>You&#39;re actually 100% right about this.  I was kind of surprised myself at how many states teach about creationism or intelligent design. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a map I found which shows the places in the country where creationism is taught along with the big bang theory.  This is encouraging,  and should be the model across the nation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk man.  I used to think like this.  But any questioning that we evolved from an ape seems to get ridiculed unfairly.  To bring up th he fact that apes do not have consciousness and we do might get you called a loon.  To me it seems much more likely ape to human evolution was aided.  By psychedelic mushrooms.  Or by a comet introducing new material/environment.  Genetic engineering by aliens maybe.  But it seems evolution has killed the quest for this source of the claimed evolution.  I can buy certain mutations, but the jump to consciousness needs some <strong>serious</strong>investigation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But we don&#39;t &#39;&#39;come from an ape&#39;&#39;, we share a common ancestor but humans occupy a whole new branch on the tree of life. At least, according to evolution theory. I get that you feel like consciousness is a special thing, and I like to think the same way (I&#39;m a special human being, unique, no-one like me will ever be born again). However, looking at the grand scheme of things, how many people have died before I was born? They all probably thought the same thing. I think consciousness is a purely coincidental side-effect of the neural networks that have formed over generations of organisms. Bacteria started by sending signal molecules to each other (quorum sensing for example), and this eventually grows out into neural networks capable of nearly instantaneous messaging between cells. This firing of neurons, to &#39;&#39;guide&#39;&#39; it in a useful way, has given us &#39;&#39;consciousness&#39;&#39; to navigate our mind&#39;s world with. This is what I believe, in a nutshell.  </p>

<p>To my understanding, a lot of research is being done into consciousness, so we are working on it. The &#39;&#39;stoned ape&#39;&#39; theory is a very fun one, but I think that theory is too random for my liking. It basically states consciousness is a random thing that happened by chance (the mushrooms have to be eaten by a semi-intellectual organism). I believe that evolution is convergent, and that eventually consciousness will arise in a complex evolutionary system.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because there is no scientific data to support the claims of creation or intelligent design. The big bang is a theoretic framework that is currently used in astrophysics, as we have no other explanation for the expansion of space that is being observed. By the way, it is not taught as a fact, the name already implies it is a theory: &#39;&#39;The big bang theory&#39;&#39;. The thing that scientists try to do (but sometimes in their humanity forget), is to always question the hypotheses they confirm with their experiments. Nothing is ever absolutely true, you can only ever reach an estimated probability of &#39;&#39;truth&#39;&#39;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there wasn&#39;t a vast conspiracy to teaching kids to not believe in God, or heaven,  then why don&#39;t they teach 
 intelligent design along with the big bang theory as possible ways the universe was created? </p>

<p>Why even close that door in the minds of kids, that there may well be a higher power or intelligent designer who made the universe?   </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying to only teach intelligent design, because I admit, this to is also just a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; if you will,  and can&#39;t be backed by science, but neither can the big bang THEORY. They both are just theories,  but one, even though uses the word theory in it,  is the only one taught in public schools,  so therefore accepted as scientific fact.  If your only taught about a single &quot;theory&quot;, and not teach that there is even another theory out there,  this might as well be that you are teaching it as fact. </p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t taught in public school (I went to both private Christian school,  and public school) about any possibility of intelligent design,  but in private school, I was taught both creationism and the theory of the big bang,  and allowed to make up my own mind which one was the one I think is most probable.  There certainly was a noticeable slant towards creation,  but they at least taught both to us in private school.</p>

<p>Why not open they door in the minds of kids, and present both theories as possible explanations, and let them decide for themselves which one they want to believe? </p>

<p>We also had physics classes, where we were taught how to convert real world observations into language (equations that we can share with eachother). In physics classes, we were taught about the current model that we have, the big bang theory, and how flawed it is.   </p>

<p>I can understand how you see it if you were at least taught both ways.  Please believe me though,  this is not how it is in America.  It&#39;s very easy for anyone to believe one theory,  if that&#39;s the only theory presented.  And in the majority of school systems,  that&#39;s how it is. </p>

<p>That door is completely closed here,  kids aren&#39;t even given that choice like they are where you live. </p>

<p>To my knowledge, there is still a very high percentage of religious people living in the US, despite there being no education about intelligent design in the schools. There is a very high probability that people will be taught about religion by their friends and families, and then we have this free flowing knowledge source called the internet, which allows people to find out anything about any kind of worldviews one may have. Do schools really need to have more influence on this by teaching religion?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there is a very big distinction between the intelligent design theory and the big bang theory, however. The big bang theory is based on giving us an answer on where we are in space, and how it was formed. We can measure (and this is important) that space is expanding around us (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_expansion_of_space#Measurement_of_expansion_and_change_of_rate_of_expansion">see wiki</a>), and we try to give an explanation as to how this can happen in relation to the experiences we have as humans. When it comes to intelligent design, we try to answer the question <em>why</em> space is expanding around us, but the reason that is given (a higher power that has designed everything) has no basis in our observations as humans (there is no factual observation, nothing to measure). In my opinion, both of these theories are talking about very different things. After all, I could still accept the fact that the big bang theory might have been intelligently designed, do you not agree? (The big bang theory tries to explain why the ball falls, the intelligent design theory tries to explain who the ball threw, metaphors with balls always work right?)</p>

<p>The Big Bang Theory absolutely does suggest that the universe and everything in it was created by a big bang.  It suggests that everything in the universe is basically the result of an accident.

<p>But it didn&#39;t.  The big bang theory is the source of all things in the universe to those who believe in it, even though it&#39;s a theory,  actually probably the biggest &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; the world has ever seen, but yet it&#39;s taught as fact in public schools. </p>

<p>If there wasn&#39;t a vast conspiracy to teaching kids to not believe in God, or heaven,  then why don&#39;t they teach 
 intelligent design along with the big bang theory as possible ways the universe was created? </p>

<p>Why even close that door in the minds of kids, that there may well be a higher power or intelligent designer who made the universe?   </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying to only teach intelligent design, because I admit, this to is also just a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; if you will,  and can&#39;t be backed by science, but neither can the big bang THEORY. They both are just theories,  but one, even though uses the word theory in it,  is taught to children as scientific fact. </p>

<p>Why not open they door in the minds of kids, and present both theories as possible explanations, and let them decide for themselves which one they want to believe? </p>

<p>Science shouldn&#39;t be taught as fact, it should be taught as &quot;the best way we understand the workings of the universe... *Right now. Subject to change as new data and information comes in.&quot; If your science classes failed to mention that to you, then that is a pretty massive failing of the system.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Because intelligent design doesn&#39;t count as a scientific theory, it is merely a hypothesis.</p>

<p>There is a big, big difference between what science calls &quot;theory&quot; and what your layperson would. Scientific theories have been rigorously tested and make predictions (gravity is only a theory, too). Intelligent design is not testable and does not make predictions - it&#39;s not science.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No one is trying to do that. It would be an amazing thing if someone came up with some way to test and predict Intelligent Design. But that&#39;s more or less impossible, so it&#39;s not science, and should not be taught in science classes any more than any of the other thousands of creation stories.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>let them decide for themselves</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because you don&#39;t science by just having people go with what their heart tells them. You science by rigorous testing and observation.</p>

<p>Come up with a way to test and observe ID - a way to make it science - and you&#39;ll win a Nobel.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Not exactly... they came up with &quot;dark matter&quot; and &quot;dark energy&quot; when their observations didn&#39;t match their predictions.</p>

<p>When astrophysicists looked at the universe and calculated how much mass different things should have in order to work the way they do (stars spin around galaxies and don&#39;t just fly all over the place) they realized that there wasn&#39;t enough matter in the galaxies to support their theories. The missing stuff was called &quot;dark matter.&quot; It&#39;s &quot;dark&quot; to highlight science&#39;s ignorance.</p>

<p>Something similar with &quot;dark energy.&quot; With observation, we learned that the universe was not only expanding but that the rate of expansion was increasing. The only way for that to work would be if there was energy being added to our universe. Because we don&#39;t know anything about it or where it comes from, it&#39;s called &quot;dark&quot; to highlight science&#39;s ignorance.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not magical fairy dust, it&#39;s science literally saying, &quot;This isn&#39;t what we expected. We don&#39;t understand this. Let&#39;s study it further and re-evaluate our models as necessary.&quot;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Again, you&#39;re looking at this the wrong way. We didn&#39;t come up wih these concepts to balance an equation or keep a theory from collapsing, these are the values that are HOW OFF our models/predictions are, which has prompted thousands of man-years of study and research into WHY our models are off.</p>

<p>Dark Matter has been observed through its gravitational effects. After our initial models were off, we learned about what Dark Matter&#39;s properties should be and used <em>that</em> to predict how it would behave. And sure enough, we&#39;re finding it in the universe behaving as we predicted.</p>

<p>Dark Energy is observed every single second by merely measuring the rate of universal expansion - it&#39;s getting faster, so <em>something</em> has to be adding energy to the system (we call that something &quot;Dark Energy&quot;).</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t, &quot;hey our model is off so let&#39;s throw this number in here to make it work and pretend like it&#39;s a real thing.&quot;</p>

<p>No, I&#39;m explaining to you what Dark Energy and Dark Matter really are and why they aren&#39;t just magical fairy dust made up to support faulty hypotheses. You are basing your entire argument on them (and science, as an extension) being just magical made up things.</p>

In science, a theory is an explanation based on observable facts and testing. So yes gravity is a theory, as is the germ theory of disease as well as the theory of evolution.

<p>Maybe you should just tell me what big show off words I used and I can be sure to explain things differently next time</p>

<p>I would like it if you told me the words I used that you don&#39;t understand so I can better explain scientific theories and why they differ from the layman&#39;s definition of the word.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I thought creation was taught in some southern states.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re actually 100% right about this.  I was kind of surprised myself at how many states teach about creationism or intelligent design. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a map I found which shows the places in the country where creationism is taught along with the big bang theory.  This is encouraging,  and should be the model across the nation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point the user is trying to make is that saying something is &quot;just a theory&quot; is ignorant of the scientific definition of the word.</p>

<p>In a colloquial sense, theory is used to describe a hypothesis or idea regarding an event, but in <a href="http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6024&amp;amp;page=2">science the definition holds more weight</a>. In science, a theory is an explanation based on observable facts and testing. So yes gravity is a theory, as is the germ theory of disease as well as the theory of evolution. All of these theories are supported by mountains of evidence, but they are still theories. Same goes for the big bang.</p>
