        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> According to a <a href="https://cantetenza.wordpress.com/2015/06/18/urgent-action-alert/">press release</a> published today, a subset of the hippie grouping &quot;Rainbow Family&quot; have chosen to gather on the Black Hills in Lakota territory. This subset have secured the backing of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and any confrontation with Lakota Warriors will be used to invade Lakota territory. </p>

<p>For those of you unfamiliar with some of the entities involved in this operation here is a brief rundown:</p>

<p><strong>The Rainbow Family</strong> are a non-hierarchical group devoted to forming &quot;alternative spaces&quot; where the spirit can run free. In the US, they&#39;ve been <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/the-dark-side-of-the-rainbow-gathering">controvertial</a> as their leaderless gatherings have progressively turned into unsafe free-for-alls involving hard drugs, rape and possibly murder.</p>

<p><strong>The Bureau of Indian Affairs</strong> is the federal body that governs the activities of all non-sovereign indigenous nations within the United States. They are infamous for violating treaties signed with the native people of the US and mistreating indigenous communities under their pervue. </p>

<p><strong>The Lakota Nation</strong> exists on several reservations and are indigenous to the Great Plains. Currently they are attempting to <a href="https://cantetenza.wordpress.com/sovereignty/">assert sovereignty</a> over their territories to ensure that they can practice their culture and religion without federal interferance and manage their own affairs. They currently govern themsleves and have formed a &quot;warrior society&quot; (a traditional indigenous military organisation) to defend this sovereignty. If the Federal Government does not prevent the Rainbow Family from using sovereign Lakota land it is the warrior society that will have jursidiction over removing them.</p>

<p>It seems clear that this is a <em>false flag</em> operation for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The BIA is aware that the Lakota consider the Black Hills to be part of their sovereign territory and have allowed the Rainbow Gathering at that location</p></li>
<li><p>When the Rainbow Family are removed, this will probably be done with force and result in violence</p></li>
<li><p>This violence will be used as a <em>casus belli</em>(sp?) to suppress the Lakota Nation using US forces in the form of state troopers, US marshals, or possibly from a Federal security entity such as the FBI or National Guard.</p></li>
<li><p>The Lakota Nation must be pacified because they set a dangerous precedent for native americans using their ancestral land rights to establish sovereignty within the borders of the US. This is seen as a threat to national security both in the US and Canada because from a legal standpoint there is little guaranteeing Government control over land previously or currently occupied by indigenous Nations. Sovereign indigenous Nations would be a heartland for any unrest, and could potentially act as a base for widespread rebellion. While this situation is still a long way away, any attempts to establish legal sovereign native entities have been met with dirty low-intensity war tactics by the US and Canadian governments.</p></li>
