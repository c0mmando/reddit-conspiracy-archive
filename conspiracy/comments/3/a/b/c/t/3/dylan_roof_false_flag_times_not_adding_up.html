       I promise you people this is a false flag. The president commenting on how easily this guy got a gun, and the story that he "was there to shoot black people", and the fact that his facebook page was created just this year, and that many of his 80 friends on fb are black. It just so happens that the only pictures this guy has available anywhere on the internet show him with racist images in the picture. Finally, this image aledgedly shows him walking into the church at 8:16pm. Now the story they are telling us is that he sat in the church during the meeting for at least an hour before shooting people. This would mean that the shootings happened after 9:16 pm which is not what we are being told. Anyhow, I will let you decide, but I am convinced this is bullshit. 9 people die in a shooting at a black church in SC in one night, and Obama is on tv peddling gun control. 9 people are killed in Chicago and it's called Tuesday night.

       I'll tell you exactly why over half his fake FB "friends" were black, it's to convince black people that when ever some white guy says "a bunch of my friends are black" they'll immediately make the connection to this false flag shooter and how his FB friends were black.

       They are really trying hard to start a race war, they are running headlines like "US in racial turmoil" and all sorts of BS to try and get us to fight with each other.  The only divide going on is the elite and Zionist thugs trying to divide us and trying to have us conquer ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't believe ANYTHING that the media blows up, especially if it uses repeated imagery and is specifically used to push any sort of anti-human or anti-liberty agendas.  Get ready for more false flag attacks, bigger and wider in scope then your wildest imaginations.  World tyranny is here and it's moving fast.

       A better question would be if  these were indeed  friends of his, why  were they friends of his when the only pictures on his facebook  him with racial messages/flags? Perhaps the images are photo shopped? Who knows?

       I guess it seems fishy.  I haven't really delved too much into the research.  However, the more I find it seems about as fishy as the Sandy Hook shooting.  Obama has no heart.  He doesn't even let the bodies turn cold before he is out on TV pushing his liberal ideologies to the the masses again.  Now he even has the Confederate Flag to pursue and be made into another scape goat as well.

       I wondered about that myself. My impression is that this was just an organically occurring crazy cracker who intelligence knew about - I wonder why her father chose this year and this month to out her - and that revelation bursting onto the scene could have been the trigger for Charleston.

       Why does this article not mention the older lady and her 5 year old grand daughter whose story was broadcasted on national news? Conversely, the article particularly says there were no children there. The family member of the old lady said she told her grandchild to play dead. 
Also, if this Dylann Roof is a false flag, where do they recruit the person to carry out an act such as this to further a race war idea or to push gun control??

       We have mercenary groups like (formerly) Black Water who have very low standards of morality. It's a heck of a lot more convenient to hire one of those guys to do the actual killing and just fabricate the character you want to propose as the assailant. I'm speaking as someone who's only pulled apart the character and not the shooting itself. The shooting's not important if it turns out Dylann "doesn't exist".

       This is what happens when white people are living in the wrong skin color and treated like abusers from day one to justify their victimization by the system, the media and the immigrants that have overrun a once great European society. A society that would not be here if not for their ancestors and won't be here because of their descendants who will be bullied into extinction by marxist culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Black people have been given every opportunity from the day their boats landed in the new world. They may have arrived as slaves but they were given the ability to start their own communities and to live in a land that was driven by European invention and culture. They may have had to work for their place here but they were free of the bondage of Africa which was a lot worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the 50's, jewish organizations have been spearheading integration, welfare, affirmative action and liberal racism.They removed segregation only to replace it with racism on all levels within society. They have destroyed strong white communities and strong black communities. Everyone has suffered because of this need to pretend genetics don't exist and the need to pretend that society isn't a construct of biology.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we have today is another utopia like those of the early 20th century in which marxist culture is manifested by the blood of innocent people who are only looking for cultural unity and to live in a place where they can be self-driven and can live without fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       These black people in America are only one example of what integration and an open border policy has created. They are never going to be satisfied because no amount of welfare and pandering and media coddling will every take the place of pride in one's self and community. It can never buy societal strength, cultural diversity and progress. It only keeps them as children, rioting and looting and throwing tantrums. They are murdering Europeans at an alarming rate. They are raping and stealing. They have nothing to call their own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Diversity is destroyed more and more the further we move towards integration. Culture is being replaced by tolerance. Uniqueness and creativity are being destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you are seeing is the end of the greatest groups of people to evolve from humanity. Europeans are being out-bred and out-maneuvered at every turn by their own construct. And the result is disenfranchised youth like Dylan Roof who have no where to turn but to themselves and what little they can do.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real victim here is Dylan Roof and all the other white children who will grow up to hate themselves and accept their genocide because the education system has taught them to. Because the media has taught them to. Because the government that should have been representing their former majority vote has turned on them for profits.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no doubt that the white people today who champion every cause but their own will see their folly soon.

       Yep...thats what happens when one of these messed up stories surfaces every other week. Again, more blacks are killed by each other in any given big city in the US every day. Never has Obama came out after any of those murders and say we need gun control. No, the big plan here is to hand over power to the UN to come in and TRY and disarm the citizens. Whats sad, is that you dont see this and just believe every damn thing the government tells you even though they have a more than stellar track record of flat out lying to us and killing its own citizens in order to start a never ending war....

       Do you have any clue about the UN arms treaty? Gun-control liberals led by President Obama are understandably frustrated these days. Recently, they have been losing the battle to disarm America in almost every state. However, they have not given up. Rather, they are trying to disarm America through the back door using the UN’s Arms Trade Treaty as their own concealed weapon. According to a letter sent to members of Gun Owners of America: “A few months ago, eighteen countries—including some of America’s closest allies—ratified the UN Arms Trade Treaty, giving a big boost to the anti-gun lobby that sees this treaty as the key to disarming America…The UN Treaty, if ratified by the US, would not only result in gun owner registration, it could lead to bans on handguns and semi-automatic firearms, microstamping requirements, and much more.”
