        EDIT 2
       </strong>
       : In this interest of this being sort of a broadcast that I suppose I created, I have to say 24hrs later I feel that what is most likely is that this program may just be picking up on the bright colors in this image. However if anyone has expertise or experience with this type of work, ELAs or things like that, your input would be highly appreciated.
      </p>

       Hey all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm making this post because I feel like this is important and other people may be able to shed light on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       So essentially there is a method of photo analysis called an ELA. Basically if a photo is unedited it will display similar level of compression all over. However, if its a jpg, and someone has edited it, it will display varying levels of compression and thus give itself away as an edited photo.
      </p>
      <p>
       So. Here is an example, on this forensics website you can see that someone has just photoshopped the Jesus face onto this weed (this is one photo they use as an example):
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?challenge=1&amp;id=9d40f53a05ca7cc7932ccc09b260312e9e3372c3.208035">
        http://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?challenge=1&amp;id=9d40f53a05ca7cc7932ccc09b260312e9e3372c3.208035
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously fake. As a control I have here this photo of a cat which has not been edited, you can see it displays a similar level of compression all over (I suspect someone applied a subtle instagram filter to this, that's why it's slightly "edgy", but still totally uniform):
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?id=631a71d9e7fa032c48a6468698e638a42287e74d.88871">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, we have this photo of the shooter from SC. In fact in one photo he's wearing two patches: one from apartheid South Africa and one from Rhodesia. My my! That is incriminating as hell!
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/dylann-roof-charleston-shooting-suspect-had-rhodesia-south-africa-apartheid-jacket-1506881">
        http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/dylann-roof-charleston-shooting-suspect-had-rhodesia-south-africa-apartheid-jacket-1506881
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But, could someone have altered this photo in some way? Let's check using the ELA:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?id=ffdd438724ace64b49b5eddb45a36b255c65d3cd.105386">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Interesting as FUCK. Sure seems suspicious to me. For the record I work in some capacity with photoshop, so I can say it looks slightly edited, but that means nothing compared to a real analysis like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm hoping in this thread, we can discuss this, and perhaps someone that knows more about ELAs, etc. can shed some light on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        EDIT
       </strong>
       : For everyone saying the photo of the shooter doesn't look the same as the modified example: I know. I used the most obviously modified one as an example here. Here is a more subtle example from the site that matches the ELA variation in the photo of the shooter. All over we have this white and black fuzzy pattern, but the edited area displays rainbow colors and compression variation
       <strong>
        not found
       </strong>
       in the rest of the image:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?challenge=1&amp;id=33aafc53251dbed136bf79fb0ef597c7838bded5.52461">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's another photoshopped version of the image which displays variation like the photo of the shooter (dense rainbow lines and pattern indicating variation
       <strong>
        not found anywhere else in the photo
       </strong>
       , just like the ELA analysis of the shooter photo:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?challenge=1&amp;id=f55625fca882ce0fc79012d514524108566d26b1.487266">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Shooter photo ELA for comparison. If you open these up in tabs with the Kim Jong Un photos side by side you will see the similarity:

      <p>
       Please note I'm down for any and all opinions on this, I'm not selling a definitive conclusion, just a truth seeker like yourself.

       I can provide some insight on this image. I do a lot of photo analysis and work with photo editing software.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Some type of editing such as white balance adjustment, highlight adjustment, etc. will produce those 'contrasty' snowy effects you see on the ELA (Error Level Analysis) conversions. If the entire image has been messed with in Lightroom, for example, it could show a lot of those showy areas all over the place. However, they would be somewhat uniform and very much alike on the entire image which indicates that the entire image has been saved an equal number of times and consistent throughout.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Images with little to no snowy effect indicate little to no editing with the white balance and/or copy paste and a low number of re-saves.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       What this means for the 'shooters' image: The background was heavily edited for the white balance, highlights and possibly individual color gamma levels to match the white level of the actual person. That is why it is so snowy on the ELA image. The patches with flags have been pasted and then the layers were flattened. This was done quick. I am almost positive that whoever made this composite image wanted it to be discovered.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I were to do it, I would spend an extra 30 minutes editing the 'shooter picture to carefully readjust individual gamma and white balance levels by increasing the 'Light' setting in Photoshop/Lightroom, saving the image and then reducing that Light level using the exposure/white balance settings and then re-save the image again and again 3 to 4 times. It would make them look a lot more uniform on the ELA picture in the photo forensics.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I am almost positive that the background picture started as a RAW image, then edited for lighting while the dude's picture was a JPEG. I could tell he is pasted with a naked eye without any s/w and bet my monthly paycheck on it.

       The people posting here are white supremacists, as indicated by their post histories. The person who killed 9 people is also a white supremacist. The white supremacists here are desperately trying to insist that the shooter isn't one of them. Getting it yet? They're trying to wash their hands of the guy, because he did what they all dream of doing, and that might complicate their recruitment efforts here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do white supremacists post here? To recruit. (They said so themselves.) Would anyone want to join them if they have an image of being a bunch of backwoods retard murderers? Probably not.

       I don't know from what angle you view reality, but I bet if a black family moved in next door into a house that they received through a government program and then proceeded to harass you first, then break into your home while you at work, beat, tie up and do other things to your wife and then threaten you to be 'knifed by his gangsta homies at 4am' after you file a police report only to have the testimony revoked because you fear for your life. That is one of the things that had me looking at things differently. You see, this type of behavior is a cultural trend for some demographics and thats a fact! I know that facts and statistics are the racist bunch of all, ain't it?

       What difference does it make if they are black? White people do fucked up shit like this all the time. I don't think to myself 'oh shit, here goes the neighborhood' every time a white guy moves in because one time one of them shoved his burning couch through his patio door at 3:30am.

       I never said they are subhuman. You are throwing things in my face, allright, but you have no clue about what you are doing. You are just desperately trying. You also want to paste some words into my mouth. If you want to be taken seriously, state valid and relevant things. Don't veer off the subject.

       So you are just going to be unreasonable about it then? If the thread really is fabricated by white supremacists I think it will become apparent that the photo is indeed not edited after more users who are knowledgeable on the subject pitch in their opinions.

       I think I'm being quite reasonable in suggesting that the motives of the people promoting this theory should be investigated, ideally by looking at their post history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Say,
       <em>
        why is it
       </em>
       that all their post histories contain references to "niggers," black people as subhuman animals incapable of thought, anti-semitic attitudes and Holocaust denial?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       think this is happening?
      </p>
      <p>
       Could it have something to do with the fact that the shooter is a white supremacist?
      </p>
      <p>
       Say, why do YOU think all these white supremacists are here to assure us that no, the shooter certainly WASN'T a white supremacist? When there's photographic evidence attesting to the fact that the shooter WAS INDEED a white supremacist, I mean? :&gt;

       If you're right and they and the shooter are indeed white supremacists then I would guess the reason for the thread would be to deflect attention away from white supremacist groups by discrediting the photo.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand the main stream media has been pushing the black vs white narrative pretty heavily lately in what seems to be an effort to deepen racial divides, photo shopping the shooter would accomplish this motive.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd also not consider it out of the realm of possibility that the posters in this thread may be white supremacists but also be correct about the photo shopping despite the aforementioned possible motive.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end all I care about is the truth, as of right now I am still on the fence but I'll keep an eye on the thread and form my own opinion after it has concluded.

       Haha if you are right and that happens then I'll have a good fucking laugh. I can see that you are just trying to sort the truth from the bull shit so good for you. If it turns out you are right then you didn't derserve all the downvotes you got in this thread.

       No, I did deserve all those downvotes. Hell, I even brought them on myself. See, the downvotes are evidence that there's a white supremacist, anti semitic element posting here, and employing a frightening degree of coordination to promote their propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I view those downvotes as a badge of honor. If a fucking neo-Nazi downvotes me,

       You sound like a shill to me.  Plenty of white people have bad experiences living in the ghetto, get pissed off and then say stuff on reddit that they shouldn't.  Are they all white-supremacists?  Probably not, they may even have middle-class black friends and whatnot.   But here you think that there is some conspiracy of neo-Nazis invading r/conspiracy (more likely a conspiracy of shills to discredit r/conspiracy I would say).  I don't know if you are payed to be here or not, but you are jumping to conclusions.  Let's return to the original post, was it photoshopped or not?  His explanation certainly sounds convincing, do you have any evidence to the contrary or are you just assuming he is wrong because he is a bit (maybe a lot) racist?  Remember, he could be both racist and correct at the same time.  Stranger things have happened.

       You sound like a little rich pussy SJW that doesn't life outside your bubble. One of those hypocritical liberal morons that think racism means "white people hating other races" and thinks racism against whites is justified/doesn't exist. Nobody is saying they're glad people died, and nobody is making excuses for anything. Youre confusing  that pesky thing called "reality" with whatever liberal retard fantasy world you project on to everyone and everything. Do yourself a favor and fuck off because nobody respects you here.

       That's not hatred, that's a fact. I am not afraid to speak in facts. I perform social economical analysis for a living. Racism is biased discrimination by definition. I am clear of bias and only use facts.

       In this thread we focus on the photo analysis. What is the point of demonizing people by bringing in racial hatred?

       Innocent bystander here, what is going in this comment thread? There are upvotes for racism and downvotes for anti-racism. It seems uncharacteristic of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       James Holmes' booking pics were photoshopped to make him look more menacing if you remember.

       Yes. It was his fbook profile pic. The interesting thing is that in the reddit "live feed" thread, there was mention of him creating his facebook just about a month ago and "none of his friends knowing him in real life." a statement that was retracted within an hour saying "oh...some people actually DID know him." but no further word on him just creating his facebook a month ago or not.

       All of these recent crazy kids all have a similar distant look on their face.  Either they were drugged up before the crimes, or drugged up after the crimes so they wouldn't talk.

       It reminds me of that

       Don't forget in the Holmes case he had someone waiting outside...a female.  Actually there was another guy involved in the Lanza case too that was forgotten about.  Amazing how these eyewitnesses always see other suspects and then it's written off with the old "eyewitness reports are unreliable" nonsense.

       Looks like 3 different images to me.  The fotoforensics page on the SC shooter pic looks like the background is one image, the Africa patches are another, and the person wearing the jacket with the logo is the third.

       Yeah, I can see it that way as well. Honestly the background looks super tilted and weird to me, but I'm trying to look at the hard facts.

       You're right though, the ELA does seem to indicate that may be a possibility although like I said I don't know enough about the big picture nuances yet.

       Those forensics sites have always left me perplexed, I've tried their examples and actual test pictures I shot/created and have had false positives AND negatives. I guess true, reliable and  powerful tools must exist but the free ones on the net, well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from that, from the biggest version I've found, it looks to my unprofessional eye as if the blurring/'unfocused' look on the flag patches is somewhat different from the one on the right. As if they used the Gaussian Blur filter instead of Lens Blur which gives out a more realistic 'unfocused' look IMHO.

       Word, interesting. I was going to take some time when I'm free and see about false positives / negatives but like I said I haven't done so yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way thanks for your input.

       I know, that example is their first step one and is designed to be as explicit as possible, it was probably photoshopped by someone who had very little idea what they are doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suffice to say, the bright colors on the ELA reading of the shooter photo show different compression levels just around the patches. It's at the very least, sketchy. I'll try and find another tampered with picture that looks more similar to my example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: So, for example, you may find this interesting, what we're really looking for is differing levels of compression. So in this example, the entire logo displays that neon rainbow flair. This isn't sketchy because it's uniform and all over, this picture may have been compressed at some point in his history. However in the text you can see the latter half displays a differing level of compression, showing it has been altered. It's this differing level of compression that makes the initial analysis of the shooters photo sketchy, not necessarily the compression levels themselves.

       The compression of those rectangle patches are not similar to other surfaces depicted in that photo because they are different than the other depicted surfaces.  While the mostly black patch seems similar, it is not because it has a dissimilar edge &amp; surface that are round.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, FotoForensics does not claim that bright colors like white, yellow, blue, etc.  are proof of modification.
      </p>
      <p>
       From FotoForensics:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Error Level Analysis (ELA) quantifies the JPEG compression rate across the image. The compression rate for similar surfaces should look similar, and the rates for similar edges should look similar...
       </p>
       <p>
        With ELA, "white" does not mean modified; white means a higher error level potential that must be compared against similar edges and similar surfaces in the picture.

       Right, the white, yellow, etc. are not markers of a modified image, it's the DIFFERENT compression levels that we have to look for. Like on this example:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?challenge=1&amp;amp;id=05f1f54137a3681e2cfa55e01bf581fb2642c655.81540">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       There is white, pink, etc. all over the image. Doesn't mean the whole thing was photoshopped. However the right hand side of the text exhibits levels of variation not found in the rest of the image, it therefore indicates that it was photoshopped.
      </p>
      <p>
       I should add that this is an example from their site that is definitely photoshopped. So I agree, it's not the levels or the colors but the variance that indicates editing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't say about your other point yet because I'm still looking into it. Like I said I put this up as more of a discussion than a definitive conclusion so thanks for your input.

       The rest of the image is relatively low saturation and contrast, but the patches are comprised of strongly saturated color and fine detail. They require a different level of compression to other parts of the image for that reason.

       Playing devil's advocate for a second, if what you say is true about compression levels between low saturation/contrast and high -- the face of the subject has a much higher saturation and acute color data (although not as high as the flag patches) compared to a darker surface like the jacket or hair?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a drastic difference between the grain color and compression of the patches and the rest of the photo, whereas the face has absolutely no difference in compression grain compared to much darker, low saturated and absent of color areas like the jacket.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your thoughts on that?

       Basically his face, while slightly more saturated, is a big soft color. It doesn't have a lot of edges or high contrast.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure if you run enough of your own photos through the ECT tools on that site you'll find all sorts of surprising image artifacts. They are inherent in lossy compression.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look into the way DCT compression works - essentially fine detail requires much more information to represent the visual information, which is why we see the differences in areas with more detail - it's why the background, with lots of detail in the trees, appears different to the foreground, with broader areas of color and less fine detail.

       Hey, I'm OP. Just wanted to show that I'm not just trying to push this theory and I'm actually interested in seeing if it's true. I think you might be right. I ran a few other photos of boyscouts with badges and other images that fit this description that they're similar but still a little different, and I'm not an expert so I can't really tell. Have you worked with ELAs before or anything?

       Couldn't those same features be natural reflections of the contrasts in the photo, though? The patch in the photo still looks more like the unedited sections of the logo than it does the edited script.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you provide an example of something that has been photoshopped where the contrast is as subtle as in the shooter photo?

       my take: he looks
       <em>
        too
       </em>
       weird -- i wanna know; is it
       <em>
        just
       </em>
       that he may be from an environment of  racists, does his family have any military background; CIA? does he have mental issues?

       i'm thinking, this could be another psyop to start some shit, i.e., JH,

       well, as a Black
       <em>
        woman
       </em>
       , i make every effort
       <em>
        every day
       </em>
       to let people know that i am not prejudiced against
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       whether based on race, religion, age, gender, in my conversation or by my actions,
      </p>
      <p>
       i sign (
       <em>
        A LOT
       </em>
       of) petitions (i know, that may not mean squat, but i do what i can) i have participated in protests against racism &amp; ALWAYS make it known where "i stand" when it comes to the rights of others,
      </p>
      <p>
       funny you should ask, as i'm considered "odd" because i can relate to people of different races/religions; it's only because my family knew people from other countries/cultures that came to our home. as a child i assumed everybody had the same experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
       now i realize that not everybody has been lucky enough to have known/learned what i have.
      </p>
      <p>
       while i have been bullied when i was younger &amp; yes, often people
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       think they can bully me now (just because some dumb asses make that assumption); they soon learn that i stand up for others AND myself, i'm perceived as a quiet person but i can speak up for myself &amp; others when necessary, i may be small in stature -- but i don't take no shit (from NO BODY).
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: i'm very friendly :)  but i refuse to tolerate people that are mean or unnecessarily ignorant (of that makes sense)

       This Dlyann Roff kid lived in South Carolina, that means he almost certainly went to school with Black kids and was not "ignorant" about Black people. This is not a matter of him never meeting Black people and only seeing racist stereotypes on TV.
      </p>
      <p>
       He grew up surrounded by Black people and grew to hate them. So why is that?

       Of come on, that's not true. It's only "hate" when a White person does it. When a Black person, or a Muslim does it, that's "understandable rage at racism and Islamophobia" isn't it?

       My question is. Who would take photos like this? It's so puzzling how some 20 year-old kid would go to the woods and take a picture of himself. Why wouldn't it be a selfie or webcam photo?
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone obviously had to take the picture for him and if my friend/mom/cousin was taking a picture of me I wouldn't look that menacing at the camera. I mean he was demented. but its just strange
      </p>
      <p>
       or he had a tripod set up. why someone would want to go to the woods just for a picture? obviously the answer seems easy. but its still strange that would be the only pic we have.
      </p>
      <p>
       not to mention how the background looks like a stock photo

       I used to live in Zimbabwe, in the post-liberation period. The first parts of it were a golden age for Zimbabwe. The racist Rhodesian government and its authority were abolished, but the nation's productivity remained at colonial levels when I resided there.
      </p>
      <p>
       My family left right before Zimbabwe became extremist and hateful toward white people. Before they began driving out the white farmers. It's a shame they went that way, but I completely understand the attitude. What we did to them when we were in charge was simply inhuman. The anger was natural.
      </p>

       I suspect the Charleston shooter may have had a similar upbringing to mine. His just went in a very different direction.

       Oh you mean the one that brought Rhodesia's quality of life for all citizens up to one of the highest in Africa. And you know what happen when the lesser Africans kicked the white farmers out. The started starving because they are too stupid to understand basic farming methods that European cultures have been doing forever.

       I completely understand why they kicked the whites out. And yes, they started starving as a result. They kicked out a tyrannical overlord, and they suffered for it. They'll keep suffering for it for decades; that is their fate. That is the price you pay for kicking out your tyrants - a few decades of things going very badly.

       So how were those white farmers oppressing them? They were tyrants too? The Zimbabwean white genocide was based on pure racial hatred and revenge upon those who had nothing to do with past oppression. They brutally massacred white families because they simply hated everyone with white skin, and that kind of hatred simply cannot be excused. The blacks deserve to suffer forever for it. I hope no European or Asian country provides them any kind of aid.

       So he proposed a bill to allow the whites to own the natives who did nothing with the african soil for as long as they lived on it? C. John showed the world what Africa would be under white rule. I hope China shows no mercy to the africans in their new land.

       My first thought when I saw that photo this morning was that those patches were photoshopped in. And they did a crappy job of it, too. It's like they weren't even trying, or perhaps as another one of those perverse jokes that always seem to accompany one of these events, they did a crap job of it on purpose.  I am a professional in the world of digital imaging.  I work on real high end stuff.

       Here are the results of my research:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        OP has posts in his history indicating anti-Jewish bias and Holocaust denial.
       </li>
       <li>
        Shooter is an active white supremacist, as indicated by the flags on his jacket.
       </li>
       <li>
        Forensic image analysis of shooter's photo doesn't indicate anything remotely similar to the manipulated photo example provided.
       </li>
       <li>
        OP seems to want to whitewash allegiance of shooter as belonging to his own community of white supremacists, and suggest the white-supremacist flags on his jacket were added via Photoshop after the fact.

       I'm not self hating. You're just another person who thinks questioning the official narrative makes you crazy.

       I am Jewish as is my family, so if you want to write me off as a self-hating Jew that's fine but don't act like it's not just some bullshit that you're projecting outwards. I probably wouldn't be studying Hebrew calligraphy and Qabalah if I was a self hating Jew, right?

       I have family that was affected by the holocaust, so I'm sure I don't fit the stereotype you're looking for, if that means anything to you.

       If you think I have agenda of coming online to promote white supremacy because I am a self hating Jew or something, then you're the crazy conspiracy theorist. Either way I'm sure this conversation has ceased to be interesting for anyone reading it.

       While we've been chatting, I've been going through your post history. So far, I've found dozens of posts, and even some threads posted by you, alleging that the Holocaust was a fabrication. I haven't found
       <em>
        a single one
       </em>
       where you mentioned being Jewish before our conversation took place. Maybe you could help me look? Maybe I missed them.

      <p>
       Personally, I don't think a Jewish person who has family that was affected by the Holocaust, would be working as intensely as you have, to deny the Holocaust ever happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are you denying the Holocaust happened with such tenacity? Pretty odd for a Jewish person affected by the Holocaust, wouldn't you agree?

       I don't deny the Holocaust every happened, just for the record. That is 100% ludicrous.

      <p>
       The fact that I have family that was involved with the Holocaust is the reason for my historical interest in it. There are also posts where I mention being Jewish.

       I'm not going to waste time proving to someone online that I'm Jewish but if you can think of a definitive test I can pass I'm glad to take it. Otherwise let's part ways man, good luck on your journey.

       Are you Jewish? If so I will type out some transliterated Hebrew prayers, honestly I think that's the best proof.

       This is gonna blow your mind... but, I think it's

        possible

       that someone who really hates Jews, might have done some research on Jews, and might have the capacity to post Kabbalah writings or bits of the Jewish alphabet. "Know your enemy" and all that.

       I mean there's no way for me to prove it dude, but just so you know I am actually totally completely Jewish. I was raised into a reform synagogue on on Long Island, my grandparents were huge into the burgeoning zionist movement before the state of Israel became a thing (they met Netanyahu back in the day when he was in NYC), I was Bar Mitzvahed and learned a Haf Torah portion, could have done birthright but chose not to, I can read Hebrew but don't speak Hebrew (the case with a lot of people that were Bar / Bat Mitzvahed)... not really sure what else to tell you. I even learned about the holocaust, which you are professing that I deny, pretty much every single year in Hebrew school, where I also learned the classic aleph-bet song that, if any American Jew is reading this, will certainly know what I'm talking about (Aleph bet vet, gimmel dallet hey, vav tzayin het tet...).
      </p>
      <p>
       I just want you to know it's completely hilarious to me that you think that this is like, my back up when people call me out online, is to pretend to be Jewish. The irony of you calling me a stormfront skinhead is hilarious, my grandfather and his brother almost died fighting the Nazis. In fact one of them (brother, not my grandfather) volunteered to be in some of the first boats deploying at D-Day and rocked the shrapnel in his face until the day he died to prove it.

       Maybe I could tell you about how the closest candidate for an ancestor to the Hebrew alphabet is Egyptian, and thus the Hebrew letters are strictly speaking hieroglyphic. This plays into the Qabalistic tree of life in really awesome ways, for example if you check it out, you'll see the path leading from the Sun (Tiphareth) in the center leading up to Kether (God, essentially) is Gimmel. Gimmel is a glyph of a camel (it even looks like a little camel). This is intentional as this path leading from the sun (which is the soul, beauty, life essentially) up to God (kether) crosses what we call the Abyss, it's like a journey, a journey you would make on a camel. There's 22 letters in the Hebrew alphabet, so there is one for each path on the tree of life, and each one has a cool graphic significance like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope you'll concede that while I could have googled that up (not really though...) it's strange that someone who is a white supremacist as you claim would have a working knowledge of Hebrew mysticism. It quite literally took me years to have a working understanding of the Qabalah and how it syncs up to other mystical systems, it's really not just something that I would take the time to learn if I was "studying the enemy" as you so claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just hope you realize that you are literally, 100% proving the stereotype of people that come on here and assume anyone who has anything to say that is not trusting the official narrative of a story must be a nazi skinhead or something, especially because I am literally
       <strong>
        a Jew myself
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway man I'm done with you. I respect what you're trying to do but unfortunately you have incorrectly assumed who I am and what my motivations are. Many years ago I would have been just like you myself in fact. Lo siento, I am not the skinhead you are looking for.

       I don't care, because I am a Jew.

        That's why I'm interested in the Holocaust. I want to know more about the most important thing that ever happened to my people, and defines our identity more than anything else up to the present day

       Right. You're a Jew. Who doesn't believe the Holocaust happened, as evidenced by your post history. But you're protesting what I found in your post history, just now. Even though you've been posting for ages about how the Holocaust didn't happen. Suddenly, just now, the Holocaust did happen. But it didn't as far as every post you've made in the past.

       Dude I'm just going to tell you this because I actually, really feel bad for you that you're so sure of yourself: someone investigating an aspect of history does not mean they don't think that event happened. If I were to check to see if the man on the street really had an accurate view of what happened at the Battle of Waterloo, that doesn't mean I don't think the War of 1812 never happened, or that Napoleon never existed. Likewise looking into my own misconceptions about the Holocaust does not mean that I think the Holocaust never happened or any other nonsense you've been told to think.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to be JUST like you, thinking that anyone that was looking into the Holocaust was a total fucking lunatic, until I learned things like the fact that the gas chamber at Auschwitz is a reconstruction, and that in the 1990's historians quietly revised the death toll at Auschwitz from 4 million to 1 million. I also was never told about the worldwide Jewish boycott of German goods, things like LEHI (zionist terrorist group) attempting to collaborate with the Nazis, etc. (this is far from an outlandish posit and actually appears on their wikipedia page). Since these things form an integral part of
       <strong>
        my ethnic identity
       </strong>
       and
       <strong>
        my race
       </strong>
       and
       <strong>
        who I am in the most basic sense
       </strong>
       I naturally started to research them. It's indisputable that the Holocaust is the real catalyst to the modern Jewish identity so without understanding it, it's impossible for me to understand
       <strong>
        who I am
       </strong>
       or how to live in this modern world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just hope you realize that you're so conditioned to view people in these stereotypes that you have alarm bells ringing when someone's post history shows they've been researching their own misconceptions about the Holocaust when in reality that would be
       <strong>
        the most natural thing in the world for an intelligent Jew to be doing.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway man like I said, I used to be just like you, so I thought I'd give you a little window into what I'm actually thinking and perhaps let you see things from my side of the aisle. I respect what you're trying to do, in a sense, so I just thought I'd leave off this convo on a positive note and let you see through the veil into the reality of the situation, that I'm actually just a Jewish kid sitting up in a messy apartment in NYC trying to figure out how the world ended up in the state it's in, and what my place in it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway it's been fun man but let's part ways. Good luck on your quest, it is a strange journey indeed.

       Nah, the category I fall into is Polish. You know, that other half of the Holocaust that was being wiped out by the Nazis alongside your people. We lost a fifth of our population to the Nazis, which admittedly isn't as major as the approximate 50% of all Jews wiped from existence by the Nazis as far as demographics go, but I think you understand now why I find anyone who even slightly stinks of Holocaust denial to be utterly repulsive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly, I believe the body count of the Holocaust is vastly understated. I think far more died than the official records account for. How do you feel about that?

       Well, that's hard to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that far more died than the SOVIET records account for (like...far, far more) but I'm clearly mixed up with a few things--like how World Jewry could go UP (unless the almanacs are wrong, which is a possibility) during the War Years. Personally I think that this is a Stormfront-style lie but I haven't looked into it anywhere near as well as I should have.

      <p>
       One thing that I DO hate is people blatantly profiting off of the suffering of my forefathers. Certain filmmakers come to mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Holocaust "denial" is a weird thing. People that "deny" that it happened are scumbags. People that question the numbers...well, I can see their point. I think that what they forget is that, during wartime, the
       <em>
        basic human necessities
       </em>
       are breaking down and faltering--accurate record-keeping simply falls by the wayside.

       Now there's a term I hear Jews using all the time. (Oh wait, no, I hear anti-semitic skinheads using it all the time.)

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The man overheard a conversation spoken in Hebrew, which drew his attention. He hid behind an 8-foot tall retaining wall and listened in to their conversation as they stood below. Shortly after a Lincoln town car approached the two people and the man in the backseat got out to greet them. After normal niceties were exchanged the third man said: “The Americans will learn what it is to live with terrorists after the planes hit the twins in September.

       From your post history - an insinuation that 9/11 was done by the Jews. Man, what is it with all these people posting here, alleging to be Jewish, then participating in anti-semitic conversations left and right?

       Furthermore--to suggest that I think that 9/11 was done "by the Jews" is hilarious. Utterly shameful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Were Jewish people a HUGE part of what took place that day? I believe so. Was Mossad instrumental in planning and carrying out the "attacks?" Without a doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to suggest that ANY ethnic group "ran" 9/11 besides who really did--PNAC assholes bent on total World domination (and yes, that group was/is disproportionately Jewish without a doubt) is just plain ludicrous.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think/believe what you'd like about me. I am Jewish...but I also strive to find the TRUTH in the chaos that swirls all around our heads. Sadly, more and more these days that "truth" (when it's bad news) has had Jews behind it in one form or another...most of them Zionist Likudnik terrorists. My biggest fear is that people will associate ME with "that type." And guess what? Now that more and more people are learning the
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       truth behind 9/11 (including the names) I have been faced with the first incident of "anti-semitism" (last year) in my entire life. And it all had to do with 9/11 and what "our people" did that day. Is this the impression that you want people to have about Jews? Because, I hate to tell you, that's what's happening. The Muslims and Christians are getting wise to the fact that
       <em>
        someone
       </em>
       wants them to slaughter each other--despite their very similar belief system (in a generalized sense of course).
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel IS a terror state. Israel IS an apartheid state. These are true statements--as true as "the electron is too small to be seen with the naked eye." The only "true Jews" that will get up and acknowledge this fact nowadays is the Neturei Karta. And that's just sad. They are very brave men--but, also, they've nothing to lose. They've adhered to Torah Judaism--NOT Talmudic Judaism.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all ok though--we are watching karma unfold right before our very eyes as Israel, basically, commits suicide.

      <p>
       My long-departed grandfather had an old Yiddish proverb he used much too often--but it certainly said it best. Roughly translated, it said "If one person calls you a horse, ignore them. If two people call you a horse, call them both donkeys. But if
       <em>
        three

       people call you a horse...well then grandson, you'd better get fitted for a saddle and a feedbag!"

       I'm genuinely curious, why do you participate in this subreddit if you insist on ignoring the elephant in the room?

       I participate in this subreddit because I often question official stories, and think that the truth lies buried behind multiple layers of lies.

       Then why do you ridicule people when they point out the jew hiding behind the final layer? If you're inherently prejudiced against taking on the jewish question, you'll very rarely see the truth.

       To you, there's a Jew hiding behind every final layer, isn't there.
      </p>

       <em>
        Think about why that is.

      <p>
       To a black supremacist, there's a
       <em>
        white
       </em>
       behind every terrible thing that happened to them. To a white supremacist, there's a member of another easily identifiable race, who is to blame for all their ills. Think about why this is so.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have all been turned against one another. Someone out there is benefiting from this relationship. Think about who that might be. (Hint: it isn't "the Jews.")

       Yeah, sorry OP but regards to your photoshop conspiracy there is nothing indicated here that it was changed. At least I cant see it, and I've starred at it for awhile. Great idea though, I like the idea!
