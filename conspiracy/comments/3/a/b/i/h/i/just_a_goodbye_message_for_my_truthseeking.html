       "Just a goodbye message for my truth-seeking friends in this sub:
      </p>
      <p>
       My account has been shadow banned.  This message will be posted with he help of a user whom I can contact outside of the reddit infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been trying an experiment. The driving question: what gets you banned, and where do you have to put it to get mod-attention. First few weeks I just made average comments on health/science/tech topics. Got a few hundred karma pretty fast, reddit is working as mormal.
      </p>
      <p>
       After that I might post normal comments in normal subs, but I kept the subversiveness in here (r/cons). I talked about sandy hook, 9/11, NWO, and other somewhat obvious topics around here. The karma progression stayed about the same. Seems that conspiracy talk is mostly still safe in this sub, and thats the good news.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, I posted my honest opinions to places with a lot of eyes, like r/news (where i passed some time trash-talking the 2-party system, but no ban). The change came when I saw a post on r/internetisbeautiful (
       <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/InternetIsBeautiful/comments/39y7zv/wealthometer_what_is_your_position_in_the_us/">
        http://np.reddit.com/r/InternetIsBeautiful/comments/39y7zv/wealthometer_what_is_your_position_in_the_us/
       </a>
       ). You can view the link and decide how this makes you feel, I'm not gonna tell you what to think. What I did say in the comments is this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It's clearly an independent research company (perhaps hired by a political entity, perhaps not).
I doubt there's any way to really see who is behind the curtain on this one.
The format of the info (especially the wealth distribution part) is presented in such a way that it asks "how much" instead of "should we."
That is a lot like someone walking up to you and asking "How long have you known you were gay?" instead of "Are you gay?" or "How would you describe your sexual orientation?"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This was the first comment I made that had no response whatsoever. I tried to contact a few of the other posters whom were saying similar things, but no luck. I guess it's possible I was not the only ban that happened in that thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes I was making "some noise" by my standards. But this was the goal. Either that post was a honey pot to draw out those who actually see what's going on, or the sub is just large enough that it has some of those mods that serve private interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       That leaves me here, thinking this experiment is over. I haven't received a visible up or down vote for 24 hours, and now I have confirmed: that account was banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's been a day since the ban, and I was ready to start mapping out the censorship, but I've come to a sad conclusion: reddit has been terminally ill since Aaron Swartz died. He may not be the sole reason reddit exists, but I firmly believe he was the only true human proponent that reddit has ever seen. Swartz sold his stake for a reason: reddit is a sick dog.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a huge amount of love for the concept of the site. I've had hundreds of hours of free entertainment and education, and I care for many of you users like I would my own irl neighbors. Most of all though, reddit woke me up to the nature of the world in which we live. Because of that, it pains me greatly to say the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is dead, and now I will be going elsewhere. Survivors have to learn to live and let die. May reddit and Aaron Swarts live on in our memories as yet two more beacons of hope that were stolen from our fight for freedom and truth."
      </p>
      <p>
       Feel free to reply, but this user is gone now. I got this message from him about 12 hours ago, and have only changed 2 or 3 spelling errors that jumped out at me.

       He wasn't down on life or the situation in the world, I just got the vibe he thought his time better spent somewhere he could build a reputation and spread his message in relative peace. Not sure what platform he went to,

       or even if he

       The poster wished to remain anonymous. I've never had contact with them through reddit, so I don't have any info to give you, sorry.

       I only posted this because I agree with the principle, they asked for nothing, and the user was friendly.

       I was one of the first few hundred users of reddit...came here from Fark actually, I can't remember when it was, probably 8 or 9 years ago.  Anyway, I've had 5 accounts banned so far.  I'm actually surprised this one hasn't been banned yet.  It certainly is on some kind of a list, however, because I can't post to certain subreddits, and have to wait 9 minutes to post or comment in others.

       So what you do is set up multiple accounts based on what your interests are.  Install a VPN like Tunnelbear and use different browsers, clear your cookies each time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or leave.
