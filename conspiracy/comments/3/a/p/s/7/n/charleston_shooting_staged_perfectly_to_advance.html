    <div class="md"><p>A lot of people are jumping on this sub for being too quick to &quot;Jump to everything being a hoax&quot;. They are probably a little right. Not everything we question will turn out to be false. But, I think we are all bound with the belief/understanding that the people in power will twist reality and/or create a new reality to fit their agenda. </p>

<p>For instance, I don&#39;t think this shooting was a hoax, but I am questioning all the stuff coming out in the aftermath. I have major doubts about the manifesto as well as a lot of the interviews and backstories that are coming out. </p>

<p>What I like about this place is that we do challenge what we are fed by the major media, where everyone else blindly accepts what they are told. We are going to be wrong... a lot. But what if we we are right, once? What if we find a smoking gun? What if we blow the whole thing open on a whopper with enough information that the public would have no choice but to agree? That would push the world back to sanity. That would be a defining point in history. I think it&#39;s okay to be wrong as long as we are not blindly subscribing to conspiracies as easy as the public blindly subscribes to the &quot;official&quot; story. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whats weird to me is that the SECOND the shooing happened, news was all over the place. But there was a shooting in detroit yesterday at a CHILDS birthday party, 11 were shot. And i bet no one heard about it (not anyone i knew did). Its so odvious theyre pushing the racial boundary with charleston its sickening. Shootings happen alot, but because theyre black we should care more or differently? Humans are human, we should be outraged at the loss of life not the loss of a color. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are fucking horrible. Holy shit, this guy does not make good points.</p>

<p>First video: Just because he says two of the same things in different interviews, it means he&#39;s reciting lines? That&#39;s an extreme stretch. And yeah, maybe he isn&#39;t an overly emotional kid, or maybe he had a complicated relationship with his mother, or maybe he just tried his hardest to not lose it on TV. This was just dumb in my opinion.</p>

<p>Second video: Even in the darkest times, most overly religious people focus on forgiveness because it&#39;s their only way to act against their anger. It also is almost a passive aggressive way of trying to make Dylann feel like he didn&#39;t get to them.</p>

<p>Third video: He&#39;s just assuming she&#39;s fake crying. I would get pretty emotional if I had to recount something like that in a press conference. Not everyone cries the way you want them to. Jesus Christ, this guy expects everyone to act a certain, specifically genuine way without stuttering or repeating the same things, or else it&#39;s fake and scripted. This is just getting old now.</p>

<p>Fourth video: Ok, maybe the girl is acting a little too casual for someone who just lost their mom, but then again, everyone deals with grief differently. They may be overwhelmed with love because they&#39;re being completely flooded by family, friends, the public, literally EVERYONE with comfort and prayer (which is huge to religious people). </p>

<p>Fifth video: Maybe only one of the possible points. Coincidences DO happen. I wonder if this guy has done his research to see how often these classes/drills are conducted, maybe if we saw some numbers, and saw that this training was never done until the week of the shooting. Even then it could still be a coincidence.</p>

<p>Thoughts: If anything this made me think that it was not a hoax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to admit, letting the victim&#39;s families address the accused is really way out there.  It is a legal challenge to get them the opportunity to address them AFTER they are convicted.</p>

<p>Also, the coincidence with active shooter training is no coincidence.  It has coincided with numerous events. like Sandy Hook, the UK subway bombing (The DHS was over there training the UK on bombings...yeah right)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My opinion in the matter remains undecided.</p>

<p>It does seem interesting to me though that you could take the <em>aggregate</em> of all that, the historical contexts, and the similarities of this event to others like it, and then just dismiss all of that as coincidence.</p>

<p>Ultimately the only things you have to determine if this event happened in the narrative op&#39;s sources suggest :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Any sources you have, trust, and have researched (but you have not cited)</p></li>
<li><p>The logical fallacy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority">&quot;the appeal to authority&quot;</a> </p></li>
<li><p>Your own personal &quot;intuition&quot; of the events referred to; which would be a combination of several factors like your education, upbringing, socio-economic status, jobs, etc.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So I guess my question to you is how many coincidences does it take for something to no longer be seen as a coincidence? Is &quot;coincidence&quot; the best argument you have to offer to refute the narrative postulated by op&#39;s source?</p>

<p>Your statement is just your opinion, or the narrative you are trying to drive. It doesn&#39;t fit to facts I&#39;m aware of.</p>

<p>It is a complete disservice to movements like the 9/11 Truth movement in which there actually IS evidence to point to a false flag, or at least a deviation from the official narrative in what actually happened. When EVERYTHING is an inside job (which is clearly not the case), people who are on the other side of the conspiracy spectrum are NEVER going to take issues like 9/11 seriously because they&#39;ll just lump it in with &quot;all of those crazy truther conspiracy nut jobs.&quot;</p>

You&#39;re right in the the only evidence being presented is circumstantial and pretty weak at that. My point is just I and others don&#39;t believe something just because the government or media tells us so. I&#39;m keeping an open mind on this, and choose not to believe either side until more information comes out.</p>

<p>Fifth video: Maybe only one of the possible points. Coincidences DO happen. I wonder if this guy has done his research to see how often these classes/drills are conducted, maybe if we saw some numbers, and saw that this training was never done until the week of the shooting. Even then it could still be a coincidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How can you look at a place that has such a long history of racially motivated terrorism and white supremacy like the US has and think a racist shooting is a hoax or a conspiracy. Nothing about this is surprising. Things like this DO happen in racist societies. And raging white supremacists like the shooter do exist.</p>

<p>I am beyond pissed off how something that clearly is a racist hate crime is now being twisted to talk about gun control. The problem is racism, you fools.</p>
