       They will only be able to effect certain areas. Most of america doesn't live in a desert. I have a well and live next to a creek. In the mid west we are getting flooded like crazy. But of course flooding provokes spending to repair damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you were in control of a huge ponzie scheme economy that was ready to collapse because it hit a plateau of the ever needed growth, then how do you provoke growth (spending more than normal).   Since 2008 it seems like every area of america has had some kind of weather related disaster that caused billions in damages. Drought, hurricanes, flooding, tornadoes......It would be easier to list places that haven't been hit by a disaster since 2008. So the question is what is the extent of their weather manipulation capabilities.

       What do you think Nestle'/Coke's plans are for the US, guys?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you "have a fiscal responsibility to the shareholders" to continue to grow, then at some point your goal must be to monopolize the water supply. And if you doubt that they can do it, I have seen it with my own eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       My wife and I took a trip to Pakistan and when Americans say that they are poor, most have no idea what poor really is. There was literally no clean running water anywhere in the country as far as I knew.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about the result of that? If you want to have a drink of water or even brush your teeth, you have to pay a tax to Nestle' Coke. Not only that, but they have all but monopolized (shared with Pepsi, but Coke is much more prevalent) about every consumable liquid you can find to purchase in the entire country. Your literal survival is tied to a corporation whose first priority is "the shareholders".
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you want to try to argue with me that "Well, somebody has to provide the water and they are SAVING those people."
      </p>
      <p>
       That argument would be completely false. Pakistan has a very sophisticated military and the US provides a significant amount of financial assistance every year. Many people will still remember a time when there literally was no Dubai as you know it. Today, you can drink anything you want in that city. It is physically and financially possible for the country of Pakistan to have clean and readily available water for their citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why do they not just do it? The answer is corruption. Nestle' Coke basically pays off the people in government to NOT do the infrastructure projects to provide it. Nestle' Coke has grown to be a literal virus on humanity and something should be done to stop them because they are killing people in a very real way.
