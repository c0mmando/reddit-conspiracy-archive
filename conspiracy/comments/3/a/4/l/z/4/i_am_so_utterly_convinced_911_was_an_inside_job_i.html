       All I think about is being in mid flight because it's preferred to than choking on smoke and knowing I have seconds to live. One day in NYC hundreds of innocent people were murdered and I feel a responsibility to bring justice to the perpatrators.

       There were some HUGE names left off of this list in regards to who perpetrated 9/11--just off the top of my head I see that Ehud Barak is missing. So is Shimon Peres. So is Issar Harel.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would
       <em>
        highly
       </em>
       suggest downloading the free ebook "9/11-The Deception That Changed the World" by Christopher Bollyn--probably the finest and least compromised journalist alive today--though his life has been nearly taken from him many times. If finally got so bad that he fled to (IIRC) Estonia. He is the guy that "outed" Michael Collins Piper. His articles in general are fascinating just because they are so insanely well-researched. I mean...wow...this guy does his homework. If all "journalists" were like Bollyn the world would be a much, much better place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Check out &lt;bollyn.com&gt;. This guy's life's work has been studying the Middle East and EVERY fact that he prints in that book is researched and footnoted scrupulously.

       <a href="http://www.bollyn.com/">
        Chris Bollyn
       </a>
       was beaten up in his own home and forced to move with his family to Europe to protect his family.  He is as courageous as he is professional and thorough as a researcher, analyst and journalist.
      </p>
      <p>
       In August 2006, Bollyn was attacked at his home in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, by a heavily-armed three-man team of undercover police that had been prowling around his house for several days in a row.  The result of the police assault on Bollyn was that he was falsely charged with assault and resisting arrest; both misdemeanor charges.  He pled innocent and went through a four-day trial in which the police openly lied and presented false evidence.  Bollyn’s evidence, on the other hand, was not allowed to be presented and his expert witness was not allowed to testify.  After the seriously flawed trial, Bollyn was found guilty of both charges and faced sentencing from the same judge who had overseen the trial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rather than submitting themselves to injustice the Bollyn family left their home near Chicago and moved to Europe in June 2007.  He then wrote a set of books based on his 9-11 research entitledSolving 9-11: The Deception that Changed the World.

       No problem. If you want to keep pulling on this thread, I recommend the books of Michael Collins Piper, a journalist who recently passed away.

       Confusingly, Michael Collins Piper seemed to think that Christopher Bollyn was an Israeli disinformation agent -- but I've read both and found them interesting. I think the key is always to harvest whatever good information we can from these sources, and form our own conclusions.

       You don't need to order a hard copy if you don't want to -- you can download the pdfs from Balder Ex-Libris through those links. Piper is dead now, he's not going to be missing out on royalties.

       If you're more informed on the subject than I am, perhaps you could help me condense the list down to 52 key players (maybe lump together the Bush family, etc) and come up with like a short blurb about each's involvement.

       I have a slightly related question. I'm looking for a video.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2002 or 2003, I remember seeing on the internet a video about custom computer graphics, where they literally had a room full of press, I think, watching a large monitor. And on the monitor, I am not joking, is Osama bin Laden, with a CNN news ticker across the bottom.
      </p>
      <p>
       The presentation was about 5-6 minutes long. They demoed a few different capabilities. First, they took a still image of Osama bin Laden, and put it on the monitor. Then, they showed their software take that still image and wrap it around a wireframe model, then they animated the model. And it looked great (in that year I probably watched it in no higher resolution than 480p, but couldn't tell it was graphics, because they were using a photo simply wrapped around a head.)
      </p>
      <p>
       They have the model talk with various voices, once like Bill Clinton, another time like a Bronxian, and then finally like Osama bin Laden (I guess, I didn't really know what he sounded like and didn't actually compare. But a middle east accent nonetheless.)
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end, they do a Q/A and someone asked a question I don't remember, but the answer "That's classified."
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't seen it again. Have you ever seen this video?

       I do think that's part of the point of the series: To get the public to think of politics as power struggles between oligarch families, rather than representative democracies. I'm constantly drawing parallels -- kind of like watching The Matrix after waking up.

       yea sorry i didn't mean its a point of the series, I guess i should have just said things from GOT and ASOIAF make me think of the modern world.

      <p>
       and yea i did the same thing, i fucking loved the matrix as a kid think I was like 11 when it came out.  After years of being fascinated by AI and teaching myself some programming and then also understanding the meaning of "wake up" or why "rage against the machine" was a good soundtrack addition and what "rage against the machine" actually means, I think I thought it was a name about being mad about computers and shitty electronics that you wanted to smash up like in office space when the boot fuck the printer.

       I also wondered if GRRM is trying to tell us something or just telling a story as best as he can, after all, Tolkien said something to the effect of "I dislike allusion wherever I smell it" but
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       that the narrative of such struggle is so universal that the reader is allowed to interpret it as he likes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference is Martin isn't ready yet, so what is the
       <em>
        theme
       </em>
       ? A
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       complicated song, it seems, with two polar opposites as leitmotivs: ice and fire, and all the troubles humans have in-between - the rich, the dethroned, the powerful, money, science, religion, common people, war, disease, slavery, revenge and famine - from everyone's view; a daring undertaking.

       And the magical collapse of a huge structure is also foreshadowed. Gurms heritage is LotR and Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn...

       Tor browser -- similar to Chrome or Firefox, but it has a built-in proxy server so it makes your IP address appear to be coming from India or Latvia or whatever. The point being.. maybe the website I posted is blocked for US because people in power want to hide the real culprits for 9/11 from the American people. I actually doubt it -- would be way too suspicious, but interesting to try. Always good to protect your privacy anyhow.

       Don't forget Maurine baginsky (spelling).  Also look up Abeldanger.com's Field McConnel  for an in depth explanation of Boeing/ Honeywell uninterruptible auto pilot. And serco, look up serco. Basically it was a serco( MI5) / American/ Canadian joint operation. The corrupt ones of course!!

       pretty good list but i think some on the list were probably
       <del>
        innocent
       </del>
       dupes and not really "in on it"
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: ok perhaps innocent is not the correct word. mislead is more precise. i think tony blair was duped, as was colin powell. and i don't think abramoff was involved with this at all, nor elliot spitzer. the more i look into names i don't recognize right away some of these connections are tangential at best

       PR shills are one the primary reasons the public doesn't know what's going on around the world. I want the truth to out. Murderers recognized as murderers, not as Nobel Peace Prize winners. Stop deceiving the public. Stop aiding and abetting mass murder.

       Hmmm. Did the FBI admit they had no evidence that bin laden was involved? Even with the supposed confession which we now know was mistranslated on purpose. Let's not forget we didn't even go after Bin laden. We went to Iraq. Then we went to Afghanistan. When most all of the highjackers where from Saudi. Why didn't we go there? Could it be that bush was buddy buddy with the Saudi royalty? Tell me, how does the bullshit they feed you taste? I bet anything if they served you a steaming pile of shit and told you it was steak you'd eat it with a smile and patriotism at heart. Sucker....

       We went to Afghanistan first, after demanding they turn over bin Laden, then dismissing their request for proof of his involvement in 9/11 as a delay tactic. Then we went to Iraq to find non-existent WMD. But yes, your main point is both valid and pertinent: we did not take any action on Saudi Arabia.

       do you honestly believe that? 
It has to do with what is right in the law. 
To say we even knew BL did it within 30 mins of the first plane hit is suspect to me in itself.

       No; I worded that somewhat vaguely. That was the justification given by the administration so they could continue to pursue the invasion. I believe that war was criminal and despicable. The US pursued a war based on an assertion they knew they could not prove to the international community.

       Yes, the standard for a criminal charge is fairly high.  Most Mafia chiefs, drug cartel leaders, dictators never get charged, for the same reason.  They're insulated by multiple layers.

       its not about finding the culprits. its about convincing the masses. Theres already truth being denied and now most don't cared. I'm constantly saddened by those who have seen the truth and just dont care. There are many. The real battle is convincing how its important, the real battle is showing how we were manipulated, the perpatrators are gone, now its time to prevent this from happening again, no longer letting the liers have power, no longer letting the people be decieved. Commit your life to the mass WAKING UP. The greatest power lies in the people, and most people are sheep. Become the shepard that leads the sheep towards greener pastures and less wolfs.

       I think of it more like no one has done a good job of explaining how 9/11 directly affected people in a negative way.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be completely honest, I'm still not entirely sure how 9/11 has affected me negatively. If someone could explain to me how hard I'm getting fucked by not knowing about how 9/11 was an inside job, that would make me care a lot more. I visit this sub a lot and when I see any posts pertaining to 9/11, I'll be like, "Okay, more evidence that 9/11 was an inside job, " but the thing is, I already believed that. I have yet to see a clear and concise post or article detailing the effects of 9/11. That's something I want to see.
      </p>

       I'd rather see that then get bombarded by

       That is a good point. Do you think that if someone put al the pieces of the puzzle together in one major article and showed how 9/11 directly effected us (iraq, afghanistan, patriot act, etc.) that more people would start to care? The main point being all of the information in one article, easily readable.

       That's not really the same though. If someone doesn't care 9/11 was an inside job, then they shouldn't care nor criticize anyone who claims 9/11 was anything otherwise. It's absurd to me to think the vast majority is indifferent to the happenstances of such a date, yet clamour, rabble and write off those who do decide to speculat and investigate about such a date.

       That's true.  You make a good observation here because a lot of people do come off as "indifferent" to certain things but then when one offers an alternative explanation (conspiracy style) it usually sets off alarms in these peoples heads and that's when they need to debate you or call you nuts.

       Yes. Yes they "where." The explosions resulted from "terrorists" rigging the towers with bombs.

       I'm sure I share the feeling of other people outside the U.S. of sheer wonder and astonishment of how your government got away with everything. There's a lot of people like you that are investigating and publishing stuff but still people are dying all over the middle east for that organized fascist coup.

       There's a huge moral and global responsibility on the U.S. citizens' shoulders but sadly most of your population are kept underfed and brainwashed.

       Watch some of the other vids, send emails to independent journalists, the loose change guys, get books on investigative journalism, start making calls and emails to; on the ground witnesses, cops, fire fighters, the insurance companies, demolition companies, find out who made the majority of thermite around 2000-2001 and see if you can get a hold of their customer records, contact relatives of supposed hijackers, lots and lots of calls and emails and something "new" will pop up

       Do you really believe these weak arguments? Anyone who can look at a steel framed building collapse symmetrically and see a natural collapse is in absolute denial.  Steel framed buildings do not collapse that way.  It's a matrix of steel.  It's impossible. Without serious help.  The truth of this is so glaringly obvious that anyone who can't see it is under mind control and brainwashed.

       Funny how people are so quick to dismiss the NIST investigation when it applies to the collapse of WTC 1 and 2, and nitpick at every discrepancy to call doubt against the NIST report, but then swear by its findings when it comes to WTC7.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is it? Is the NIST report flawed and the 9/11 investigation is incorrect, or is the NIST report about WTC7 the only place they got it right?

       With all due respect, elder, that's a dumb question. You're the one who's supposed to believe the official reports, so why do you think your theories are right and the government's are wrong? I have a theory. People who think conspiracy theorists are crazy have a thousand theories. Did it fall down because it was demolished, or because it got hit by debris, or because the fires weren't fought, or because it had an unusual design, or because the diesel fuel tanks caught on fire, or because of a never before seen thermal expansion failure that caused a chain reaction?

        A simple structure like a chimney can be prepared for demolition in less than a day. Larger or more complex structures can take up to six months of preparation to remove internal walls and wrap columns with fabric and fencing before firing the explosives.

       During the days prior lmao. And explosives aren't what turn buildings into dust during controlled demolitions. The weight of the building does. Explosions just blow supports causing collapse.

       Here's some. Notice how explosions happened prior and what do you know the building didn't spontaneously turn to dust. I just realized you're iamgod. The local scitzo. So I'm just gunna stop replying before I feel bad for picking on the special kid.

       Lurn physics, bro.  The top cannot physically, under any circumstances, crush the remaining 80% of the building. As well, the top tipped over then was magically recentered for a perfect collapse into its own footprint.  You go ahead and keep replying.  Or stop.  Frankly, we couldn't care less.

       Anarchy, are you serious? There is no way the western world goes all in on an idealistic, ridiculous form of political structure. And you call anarchy sustainable, how? Based on what? Theres no way this happens because the vast majority agrees we need a govrrnment in place. How will anything be enforced? Without political power, how does one nation get stopped from invading others, like ISIS is trying to do now?

       They don't agree at all. They're born out onto a production line which indoctrinates them into the false idea that a government is necessary and beneficial. That isn't the same thing.

       I can save you a lifetime, because it was PNAC. The MO of Zionists are false flag attacks, and this was no different. They caught Mossad dancing in "celebration" on 9/11, with explosives residue all over their clothes. Only serious propaganda can spin that into something innocent.
      </p>
      <p>
       It isn't just that though. Just about everything points back to the militant Zionists present in the Bush Admin at that time. Perhaps the most convincing clue of all is the way they've gone after everybody who spoke out against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever information does come out, it's guaranteed that there'll be a counter story, because Zionists thrive on deception. The motto of Mossad is : "Through deception, thou shall do war."

       What they did was totally understandable, from a political point of view.  Remember, 2000 election was a huge knife-fight, things were already extremely partisan.  So why give public testimony that will be picked over by your enemies for any nit they can use, if you don't have to ?  Of course you'd want to control the way the testimony was given, if you could.
      </p>
      <p>
       From a future point of view, it was a stupid thing to do.  There was govt confusion and incompetence on 9/11, but no conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, of course, the next 7 years of their administration was a massive fuckup.  Losing, futile wars, weakening the Constitution, ballooning the debt, torture, secret prisons, etc.  Then a huge economic crash.  Total fuckup.

       Spoken like someone who has done literally no research into what happened. It was the most obvious false flag attack in the entire recorded history of false flag attacks. The FBI caught Mossad disco dancing in "celebration" for Christ's sake. If that doesn't convince you then you have major problems with reality.

       Okay, thanks, I watched that section of video.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looks to me like the narrator is pointing at some vague black and white smudges and saying "this is the tail of a plane, this is the nose of a plane" and then going on to say "why is the body missing in camera 2 ?  must have been edited" (or something like that).  But the smudges seem very vague to me; not at all convincing that they are indeed parts of a plane.  I don't agree that this is clear, solid, irrefutable evidence.  I think it's vague, debatable, and unconvincing.

       Well it's my opinion that you don't understand what you are looking at. The tape has very clearly been edited to remove the object that was captured by the footage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Presumably because it didn't look anything like an airplane.

      <p>
       People can't quite understand that if there were so many people involved, at least someone would come out and leaked.

       When you join the army, you are given psychological evaluations. If you wish to join special forces, you are given more. People who become special ops have been vetted quite well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other day someone wrote, I would have kept a piece of hard evidence if I were involved. No, for two reasons:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        You wouldn't have any.
       </li>
       <li>
        They wouldn't have selected you for the mission if you would have.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       What would the demo team have that they could bring to light that would conclusively prove an inside job? A demo charge? A blueprint? I can get those, wouldn't prove anything. Their word or testimony? Today most people don't know that Oswald worked for intelligence, if someone testified from intelligence, they might have a hard time proving they worked in intelligence and a harder time proving they were in on the mission.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who talked on Operation Northwoods? Who was punished for it? Where was the congressional hearing? Treason cases? Most people haven't even heard of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       "So many people involved" and how many who have anything to "leak"? Anyone with anything to leak would be so involved that bringing forth the info would cause them to be self-incriminating with little to no chance of having their info used against anyone but themselves.

       The whole of basic training is a psychological test.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can't perform "well", follow orders without question and kill without hesitation, you won't be allowed in to special ops. Special ops requires more of the same as well as written psychological tests.

       No, I am unaware of anyone who "came out" and said "I helped do it, I helped plant the explosives, etc".

       Many have "come out" and said things such as "I was a CIA employee and I strongly feel 9/11 must have been an inside job".  That's worthless.

       The Gomel Chesed Cemetery Incident:
      </p>
      <p>
       In October 2000, approximately 11 months before 9/11, a retired Israeli Defense Forces(IDF) officer, and veteran of the Yom Kippur War(1973), was collecting English Ivy Cuttings at the Gomel Chesed Cemetery located at McClellan and 245 Mount Olive Avenue, which is near the city lines of Elizabeth and Newark, New Jersey. The Gomel Chesed Cemetery is a Jewish cemetery.
      </p>
      <p>
       The man overheard a conversation spoken in Hebrew, which drew his attention. He hid behind an 8-foot tall retaining wall and listened in to their conversation as they stood below. Shortly after a Lincoln town car approached the two people and the man in the backseat got out to greet them. After normal niceties were exchanged the third man said: “The Americans will learn what it is to live with terrorists after the planes hit the twins in September.”
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the men that had been leaning against the retaining wall expressed concerns that the upcoming presidential election (November 2000) might impact the plans. The man that arrived in the Town Car quelled the doubts by saying: “Don’t worry, we have people in high places and no matter who gets elected, they will take care of everything.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The man went to the FBI three times...and was blown off each time.

       OP, do you have one solid piece of evidence that convinces you ?  Or just a general feeling that the govt must be guilty of something ?
      </p>
      <p>
       I am willing to be convinced, but I have yet to see one piece of solid evidence that contradicts the official explanation, or genuinely supports an alternative explanation.  I've heard lots of innuendo and speculation and allegations.  Been given links to lots of YouTube videos, all of which turn out to be a complete waste of time, I won't watch any more of those.  If you have a valid piece of evidence, you should be able to describe it in one paragraph of text.

       Do you hold the NIST non peer reviewed report on a higher level because it was from a government agency?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or do you hold the peer reviewed papers on the use of controlled demolition higher because the fact they have been reviewed by the scientific community?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me know if you cant figure out how to google peer reviewed papers on the use of controlled demolitions at the WTC.  Or if you can't figure out that the NIST report hasn't been peer reviewed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing to look up is the fire codes changed since 9/11.  If fires brought down building 7, you would think there would be many of fire code rewritten to prevent that happening in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also you would think that there would be a lot of buildings that would have been retrofitted.  Let me know if you find anything that has to do with the structural engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing I found was a change in the codes to make fire proofing more robust.  So it doesn't dislodge as easy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck with that.  Let me know what you find sparky.  Im all ears.

       "Peer-reviewed" doesn't mean "true"; "non-peer-reviewed" doesn't mean "false".  Yes, I trust the hundreds or thousands of govt experts (engineers, accident investigators, detectives, etc) from many different agencies (FBI, NIST, NTSB, NYPD, NYFD, etc) who actually saw and tested the evidence, over some other guys who tested some stuff picked up somewhere near WTC by some random people.

       That was the exact article I hoped you would find.  What structural codes have been changed?  More robust fireproofing.  Nothing in relation to the actual engineering or to retrofit buildings.  They were changed in relation to getting help in and people out.  Nothing to prevent future collapses.  So take it to the next obviouls question.  Why not?

       I don't blindly believe what the govt says.  I looked at their evidence, and it seems convincing.  Of course it's not complete or airtight, far from it.

       We also have a difference of opinion on what a conspiracy theory is.  Imo the 9/11 commission report is a conspiracy theory.  With a less likely hood of probability that the other theories on the events of that day.  What you call sniping, can be better applied to the responses to the evidence the independant investigators have brought forth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The governments best theories on what happened have a much lower possibility to the point of impossibility on pretty much every thing they say happened with the exception of the date.  How many "hijackers" were filmed in the airports that day?  Even the footage of the couple they made public doesn't have date and time stamps on it, or appear to be legitimite.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are really that trustful in the government, and believe the unverifiable theories, computer models, and "evidence" they presented, thats your choice.  I have looked at all sides of the story since 2002 and can tell you that the governments story does not stand up to any scientific scrutiny at all.  If you choose to believe it, I truely envy you, and wish I could.  Intelligence wont allow me to.

       I think we need a new investigation to find out what happened.  That is all I have ever contended.  Let them figure it out.  I think the last one was a total farce and the only thing they got right was the date.   David Ray Griffin's book, the 9/11 commission report ommissions and distortions was well researched and sourced, to where the official report's sources despite them being listed, lead to bs or "classified" places or were just unverifiable.  Read that book if you haven't.  I have many times.   Here are a couple reasons why we need a new investigation.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Kissinger was originally appointed to head the last one.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Phillip Zelikow was the executive director.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Every committee member had conflicts of interest.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It was faught every step of the way.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Let a new investigation figure it out, with smarter minds than mine and yours.   We don't know how they built the pyrmids in Giza, but they are there.  All the more reason to investigate them and figure out how and why they built them.

       Well, a new investigation has to start somewhere, has to start with some new evidence or something.
      </p>

       The first three of your reasons for new investigation seem to be just personal innuendo, and the fourth is vague (and did you mean "fraught" or "fought" ?).

       Dude, there is so much evidence that has been brought forth before the 9/11 commission that was ignored, during the commission, and after.  If you haven't found any, you just haven't looked, or wanted to see what you found.   I recommend google.  Its a good source of info for the most part.
       <a href="https://www.google.com/search?num=30&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;q=new+9+11+conspiracy+evidence&amp;amp;oq=scientific+evidence++of+9%2F11++conspiracy&amp;amp;gs_l=serp.1.0.0i71l8.0.0.0.25185.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c..64.serp..0.0.0.RCAs0B0TYBg">
        Start by typing "new 9 11 conspiracy evidence".
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I also would recommend watching
       <a href="https://youtu.be/jiqkviFnuXk?t=3m58s">
        David Ray Griffin's Debunking 9/11 Debunking 9 part series.  Here is part 1.
       </a>
       He actually makes the debunkers look pretty silly.  Which is the exact light that should be shed on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, if you have never watched
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DOnAn_PX6M">
        The New Pearl Harbor,
       </a>
       watch it.  Even if you have to do it in segements.  Its a rather long documentary from 2013 that has a ton of good info that can be vetted and verified, unlike the governmnets claims, and also gives time to the ones who support the governments theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before I go any further in this already too long of a conversation, take the time to review that info.  It wasn't hard to find, and makes your claims of no new or contradictory evidence look very silly.  Any one with access to the web and google can find it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can't look at it, or choose not to, it will tell every one in this thread what type of efforts you actually put into researching the events of 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Peace out
      </p>
      <p>
       And the one documentary is 5 hours long, so any responses before that time will tell me you haven't watched it, and can no longer be taken seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not a very strong speller, but you get the jist of what I had to say.   The spelling police have dropped their cash bonus' as well, FYI.

       Yeah, I choose not to watch conspiracy theory videos because, so far, every single one I've watched has turned out to be a waste of my time.  Full of innuendo, illogic, outright falsehoods, trying to overwhelm with special effects or quantity instead of quality.  Bitten a dozen times by this crap, not doing it again.

       I can point all day, and have.  If you have ever heard the adage, you can lead a horse to water, hold his head under it.... the smart ones will drink.  The dumb ones will drown.  You thirsty?  Or need a life preserver?
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, don't care.  You have told me exactely what I and everyone else who reads this thread needs to know.  You are either too dumb to watch or listen to the answers of the questions you ask, or are paid to ask them.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want to continue any conversation, show me the evidence rebutting the claims in the documentary,
       <strong>
        ACTUAL EVIDENCE.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       That has been proven through scientific method, not claims or computer models that no one can look at the software at.
      </p>
      <p>
       If not, anyone with brain one will watch that,  see theh actual physical, first hand eye witness, and video evidence and realize you are totally a joke.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your efforts have more than likely had the opposite effect of your intentions, unless your intentions are to gain more support for a new investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you for makeing my job easy.  I love haveing discussions with people so obviously ignorant, by choice or naturally.
      </p>
      <p>
       They help take the people on the fence, expose them to credible people, and things often not covered by the mainstream about the events of 911, and cause them to investigate it on their own.
      </p>
      <p>
       That 99 times out of 100 has them join the cause for a new investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its people like you that have brought more people to the side of finding out what really happened, and exposed the governments claims for what they really are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Out right nut job conspiracy theorys.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks again.  Keep up what your doing, you make my job so much easier.   People see conversations like this, look at the evidence, and see that you have no clue to what you are saying, or know how to read, use google, or even watch videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not one thing I have presented has been disproved.   Not one thing you have stated has proven to be accurate.  At all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like I was just in a battle of wits with an unarmed man.  Almost feel guilty.  The taking candy from a baby thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do some homework.  Chime in again.  If its worth a response, I will.  If you don't hear back, you know why.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thank you for using the same playbook that has been used by the ones pushing the governments theory.  I have dealt with it since 02.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know you get paid by taking up peoples time, but the first one is free and this post has enough comments to make it worth my time, and it also provides training for those new to the movement on how to deal with people like you IRL.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other wise I would have stopped responding long ago.  The more you go, the more people learn about the subject.

       You do understand why I find none of you conspiracy guys convincing, right ?  When I ask you to provide one simple piece of evidence, you can't do it.  You either evade, or try to overwhelm with quantity, or try to waste my time, or insult me.  And you wonder why the general public doesn't take you seriously.

       I don't care why.  Any one with an open mind or that can critically think see's you for what you are.  Ignorant, or paid.  Refusing to acknowledge evidence does not mean it's not there.  That is all you have done, and made it quite obvious.  You are working against your cause.

       Agree 100%.  Any one looking at this comment thread can look and see I have provided links to review with information supporting my statements.  You have stated the same bs with nothing rebutting what I have presented, or backing up your claims....

       At least you are entertaining.  I give you that much.  LOL  Again, thanks for helping spread the word to those new to investigating the events of that day.   I couldn't have asked for a better dance partner.  Who buys breakfast?  I feel like I should, but suspect you think I was the one laying down and liking it.  If I can keep that charade up, I might work it into a free meal.

       A link to a 45-minute video that rants and lies is not convincing.  No wonder most people just ignore you guys.  The shame is that you are doing harm to society, spreading speculation and innuendo and falsehoods.  You're contributing to the polarization and anti-science attitudes.

       Sure, the 9/11 commission investigation had faults.  But that's not the only investigation that took place.  NYPD, NYFD, NTSB, NIST, FBI, CIA, etc all investigated their parts.  Heck, probably even lawyers for the 9/11 families and the insurance companies and the property owners investigated to some extent.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, I think you need some clear new evidence to spark a new investigation.

       Slight conflict of interest for the executive director of the commission.  The one controlling the staff and issues the commission would cover.

       Before you start, that's a fact.  No way around it.

       Looked at the Zelikow page, and I don't see the problem.  Some 9/11 family group complains that he shouldn't have been on the commission.  He promoted a "preemptive war" policy.  The Able Danger thing seems to have been refuted:
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Able_Danger">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Able_Danger
       </a>
       You probably could find a potential conflict of interest about any prominent person nominated for the commission; they all have track records in business and politics.  What's your point about Zelikow ?

       There is plenty of evidence, as any follower of this subreddit is well aware. (Not to mention common sense with a mere modicum of knowledge.) You have simply rejected all evidence and then declared that there is none.

Your claim of being open to being convinced is a bare faced lie. You do not require me or any single person to provide you with the evidence that is abundantly available for anyone to research.

       Yeah, I find those two links pretty unconvincing.  First is just some pictures and some architects and engineers saying "looks strange, we should have more investigation".
      </p>
      <p>
       Second makes some easily answered statements, such as "why WTC 7 imploded when WTC 6 and WTC 5 were closer to the Twin Towers and more heavily damaged by falling debris, yet, their structures remain".  Answer: because the other buildings didn't burn for 7 hours.  A bunch of opinions by some experts speculating from no firsthand knowledge of the site and buildings.  The rest is just the old "free-fall" and "fell straight down" woo, which 99% of the experts seem to find nothing strange about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dismiss this stuff because govt had plenty of experts analyze the actual site, the actual evidence, the actual building plans, etc.  Also there were investigators and experts for the insurance companies.  Investigators and experts in NYFD, NYPD, NTSB, NIST, FBI, etc.  And I assume 9/11 is studied in classrooms around the country, in engineering classes.  There would be a major outcry among major scientific organizations and mainstream authorities if there was something obviously wrong with the govt explanation.  Instead, only a small fringe contingent is saying these things.

        Here is what a former FDNY worker had to say about the investigation.
       </a>
       He seems  passionate, knowledgeable, and believes what he is saying.  He isn't trying to sell anything, so what would his motives be?  To help people sell books?  He doesn't seem crazy to me.

      <p>
       What do you make of government agencies like the EPA and the way they lied to the clean up and recovery workers at ground zero saying the air was safe to breathe?  Many died and are sick because of those lies.  They are part of this government that you put so much faith in.  Was that the exception or the rule?
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't deny it.  It happened.  The EPA lied.  People died.  Accept the truth, and lets figure out the now what together.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "small fringe" was 51% in a 2007 Zogby poll wanting a new investigation.  That number has gradually increased since 9/11, so that number is probably higher than the 51%.  The "small fringe" is the majority of people.  Your position is the small fringe.  Not my numbers, just the numbers.

       Asking people if they "want a new investigation" is useless; it costs them nothing to say "yes", so why not say "yes" ?  If you gave them a check-box on their tax return which says "Pay $5 to a fund for a new investigation of 9/11", few would check it.

       You are doomed to a lifetime of disappointment, so unless you got skin in the game, your efforts could be more profitably expended in other endeavors.  This has all had long enough to gel, and is one of those "everyone knows" things; the narrative is well-established, and even if you actually broke it entirely with irrefutable evidence, you would be ignored and the story wouldn't change.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason to do this is as a matter of principle.  Because you won't make a damned difference exposing the truth.  It's already been done.
      </p>
      <p>
       The power of narrative construction, is that it doesn't depend on the truth at all.  A handsome lie will be believed before an ugly truth every time.

       Well everyone knows the story: how a bunch of deranged Al Quaeda terrorists hijacked a bunch of planes using nothing but boxcutters and their desert ninja skills, and crashed them into our nations symbols of capitalism until one lone group of passengers understood the risks, and with the immortal words "Let's Roll" bravely sacrificed themselves to keep that last group of desperate terrorists from crashing their plane into the White House itself!  It brings a patriotic tear to my eye to think of it!
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, everyone also knows the "facts": that a bunch of Saudi Arabian Wahabbis hijacked some fuel-laden planes and crashed them into three of the country's largest office buildings.  And it would have bee four if that last one hadn't been shot down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or then again, anyone who's looked at the facts surrounding the incident would notice not only the large number of put options on the involved airlines just prior to the incident, but that fact that every rich Saudi including all the Bin Ladens was spirited out of the country when all air traffic was theoretically grounded, and might with a nudge and a wink encourage you to "draw your own conclusions."
      </p>
      <p>
       All of those things are what
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't tell you a story, unless I'm particularly bad at my craft.  I tell you
       <em>
        enough
       </em>
       of a story.  From there, you fill in the details to your personal satisfaction without any help from me.  Storytelling is the art of engaging your imagination within a particular framework.
      </p>
      <p>
       In that respect, facts are no substitute for innuendo, or for telling you what you want to hear.

       That was sort of my point.  The holes are there intentionally.
       <em>
        You
       </em>
       fill in the holes, and make the story complete to your own satisfaction.  That's the entire reason they're there.  Fiddly bits that aren't really important, so that you can feel that you have achieved enlightenment on this topic, all the while having subscribed to the ideas the storyteller wants you to take away.
      </p>

       This isn't something I should have to explain on this subreddit, but I'm finding that fewer people these days are savvy to this kind of subtle manipulation.  The whole point of "framing a story," is to get your buy-in on the framework.  What's hanging from the frame isn't in the least bit important.

       Immediately after 9/11, on that same morning, ALL air traffic in the USA came to a halt EXCEPT for airplanes which were carrying high level Saudis across the USA on their way back to their country.  GWBush authorized this.
      </p>
      <p>
       On Sept. 11th, 2001, Ben Sliney, chief of air-traffic-control operations at the FAA's command center in Herndon, Va., gave the unprecedented order to ground 4,000-plus planes across the nation and redirect any in the sky to the nearest airport. It was his first day on the job.
      </p>
      <p>
       the FBI never questioned members of the Saudi Royal Family before allowing them to flee the United States in the days immediately following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aboard the plane were two princes -- one of whom allegedly had been in contact with al-Qaeda before the the attacks and another whose father's longtime adviser owned a house in Florida that was allegedly visited several times by some of the hijackers.
      </p>
      <p>
       That the 'highjackers' actually were flying the planes is not verified.  There is plentiful evidence that the planes were under remote control.

       Well, some of those hijackers COULD fly: they got pilots licenses, more certificates, commercial pilots licenses, used jet simulators, and rented planes and flew them.

       Claim: Photographs and video footage shot just before United Airlines Flight 175 hit the South Tower of the World Trade Center (WTC) show an object underneath the fuselage at the base of the right wing. The film "911 In Plane Site" and the Web site LetsRoll911.org claim that no such object is found on a stock Boeing 767. They speculate that this "military pod" is a missile, a bomb or a piece of equipment on an air-refueling tanker. LetsRoll911.org points to this as evidence that the attacks were an "inside job" sanctioned by "President George Bush, who planned and engineered 9/11."
      </p>
      <p>
       FACT: One of the clearest, most widely seen pictures of the doomed jet's undercarriage was taken by photographer Rob Howard and published in New York magazine and elsewhere (opening page). PM sent a digital scan of the original photo to Ronald Greeley, director of the Space Photography Laboratory at Arizona State University. Greeley is an expert at analyzing images to determine the shape and features of geological formations based on shadow and light effects. After studying the high-resolution image and comparing it to photos of a Boeing 767-200ER's undercarriage, Greeley dismissed the notion that the Howard photo reveals a "pod." In fact, the photo reveals only the Boeing's right fairing, a pronounced bulge that contains the landing gear. He concludes that sunlight glinting off the fairing gave it an exaggerated look. "Such a glint causes a blossoming (enlargement) on film," he writes in an e-mail to PM, "which tends to be amplified in digital versions of images—the pixels are saturated and tend to 'spill over' to adjacent pixels." When asked about pods attached to civilian aircraft, Fred E. Culick, professor of aeronautics at the California Institute of Technology, gave a blunter response: "That's bull. They're really stretching."

       I think, you can find definitve proof, show it to the world and... nothing will happen. People will get mad on Internet forums for few weeks and forget. Families of victims will try to go to court, but good luck with wining vs "them". And mainstream media won't say a word about it.

       A Dutch demolitions expert, who flat out called the collapse of various WTC buildings a demolitions project on various interviews. Expert in the field. Some time after the interviews they are still scraping him off the street after a pretty nasty car crash.

      <p>
       Pretty sure he was assassinated. I spoke to him IRL on two occasions via Skype. He described and speculated in some detail how this project "would" have been undertaken.

       I am equally as driven to expose these awful truths to the public. I woke up on this last September, and I have never been the same person. I am obsessed with it and have read a couple of dozen books.  I am convinced 9/11 was an inside job, and I didn't think I would ever say that.

       Here's just one suggestion. Find out who is behind Popular Mechanic's debunking of 9/11 (financing, shareholders, connections, etc). I know many who reference and trust that report. I've read many pages of the book they released, and it takes many cheap shots at the character/nature of "conspiracy theorists", which immediately turned me off to their legitimacy.

       Don't forget Maurine baginsky (spelling).  Also look up Abeldanger.com's Field McConnel  for an in depth explanation of Boeing/ Honeywell uninterruptible auto pilot. And serco, look up serco. Basically it was a serco( MI5) / American/ Canadian joint operation. The corrupt ones of course.

       There's not a doubt in my mind that Israel had something HUGE to do with 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember the Gomel Chesed cemetery incident? A few months before 9/11 a Jewish man was at the cemetery gathering some ivy cuttings for his home. He was out of sight and saw two black luxury sedans pull up. Two men got out, hugged, and exchanged greetings--one asking about the other's flight from Israel the day before. Then, in plain Hebrew he heard one of the men tell the other "...the Americans will know what terror is finally when we hit the Twins in September." The man stayed hidden, knowing that if he was seen he was dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       The man went directly after this to the FBI, where a junior agent talked to him. He got nowhere. He spent MONTHS trying to get them to listen to him--he visited the NY field office two more times and got nowhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all know what happened from there...

       These conspiracy theories do real harm.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the lesson we learn from 9/11 is "govt is evil" or "the Jews did it", when the real lesson (I think) is "we should stop supporting dictators and invading countries", we risk more 9/11's.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the lesson we learn from big events (9/11, Boston Bombing, HIV/AIDS, Ebola) is "don't trust anything the govt or scientists say", that helps lead to "deny climate change, refuse vaccines, deny evolution".
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy theories generally are a form of religion: belief without evidence, even belief despite the evidence. This harms our country and our society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, there have been real conspiracies. Yes, there is plenty of malice and incompetence by govts or govt agencies. But these conspiracy theories are a different thing: start with desired conclusion, and invent/deny facts to justify it.

       Lol. I'm not even going to bother. Why do you think it's everything
       <em>
        except
       </em>
       the government's theory about a Muslim conspiracy that's a conspiracy theory? People like you are just too much to have to deal with. Backed up by evidence? If I didn't think you were actually serious I'd be laughing heartily. As such I'm just frightened that there are lots more people as thick as you around. No offence.

       Evidence that supports the govt explanation: video of the hijackers in the airports, video and eyewitnesses of planes hitting the buildings, records of hijackers entering the USA, records of hijackers taking flight lessons, phone calls from passengers saying "we're being hijacked", cockpit voice recorders showing struggles, accidental radio transmissions of the hijackers voices from the planes, Bin Laden claiming responsibility (after first denying it).
      </p>
      <p>
       The govt explanation of 9/11 seems to make common sense, and is the only explanation with ANY evidence supporting it. Give me some good, solid evidence otherwise, and I'll change my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, the govt case isn't flawless, the govt investigation wasn't perfect.  In any large event, there always will be unanswered questions, things that could/should have been investigated more, conflicting eyewitness accounts, etc.

       I think only the Flight 93 recorder survived, and the recording hasn't been released to the public.  It was played in a jury trial:
       <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/04/12/moussaoui.trial/">

       You can see security-camera footage of the Pentagon being struck; I don't think there's any motion video footage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing you're asking is positive evidence of a conspiracy, just "questions" or gaps in the official explanation.  Any big event or crash has gaps or unanswered questions.

       The point is that my questions should be easy to answer. The FBI went around gathering up videos from adjacent businesses after the plane hit the Pentagon. And I find it hard to believe the Pentagon was not better surveilled by the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the flight recorder, I've heard many online that have been released after crashes, but somehow this one is just too much for us?

       Either they are hiding evidence or the want us to think they are. If you want to blame someone for fueling conspiracy theories, blame the government.

       I don't think there were "adjacent businesses" close to the Pentagon.  It's mostly surrounded by its own parking lots, and highways.  One gas station is closest, I think.  See for example

       Sure, govt could have done better to head off the theories, by releasing more evidence quicker.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, I am not hearing any positive, solid evidence from you that supports some other theory.  Just sniping at gaps in the govt evidence.  Which I freely admit has gaps; all big events have gaps.

       That's the problem with many conspiracy theorists, they don't embrace any form of skepticism. They're already looking for a conclusion and they bend "evidence" to fit that conclusion, while ignoring all evidence to the contrary. Generally, they're xenophobic, paranoid and certainly lack objectivity and critical thinking skills. They don't understand standards of evidence and probably the most important thing: they're not scientifically minded.

       We're not going to keep going in circles are we? There is plenty of evidence that supports that it was an inside job. Some people just like to explain it away so the government or people with power can continue to do what they want without question.

       More people have been killed after 9/11 that were killed on 9/11. People that were not even involved in 9/11. Thats a hard fact and its not collateral damage either.

       Maybe you can tell us why the pentagon has a hole in the expected path of the fuselage, but not where the engines should have been. Maybe you can also tell us when the videos of the impact are.

       Not one of the things you mention is positive evidence of some conspiracy you're proposing.  It's all just "questions" about the official explanation.

       Pieces of engine were found inside the Pentagon hole.  "The collapsed area was about 95 feet (29 m) at its widest point ..." according to
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_77#Rescue_and_recovery">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_77#Rescue_and_recovery
       </a>
       I seem to recall the complete wingspan of the plane was 195 to 225 feet (depends on exact model), so the engines might have fit into that size of hole.  I don't know exactly how far apart the engines were on the plane.

       Maybe the answer is "we don't know".  Or maybe a question such as "why so many of the guys who did 9/11 were still alive after the fact?" is just unsupported nonsense that isn't worthy of an answer.  I notice you couldn't answer my 'Which "guys who did 9/11 were still alive after the fact" ?'

       It would great to have more evidence, such as video.  Doesn't happen in the real world.  Video is not everywhere, eyewitnesses give conflicting stories, high-speed crashes destroy evidence.

Those buildings did not come down the way the 9-11 report says.  It is strictly impossible, in fact, it's a total, the account in the 911 report is a total contradiction to the laws of physics."

       I wouldn't call it debunked (unless I worked for

       Here's Why the Iraq War &amp; 9/11 actually happened according to
       <strong>
        ZetaTalk
       </strong>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Starting with the revelations learned after the Roswell era, when the secret government, MJ12, and their many members in the corporate community, ultra wealthy, heads of some other countries like Britain and Russia, learned of the approaching passage of Planet X and its consequences, they started laying plans.Is it any surprise that Dubya is in the White House at this time, seeing his father's grip on many aspects of how the government works over the decades? It was all planned! Check back to the Reagan era, when the same crowd was behind getting Reagan into the White House - Cheney, Rumsfled, Schultz, Pearl, and the like. To put restrictions into place too soon raises suspicion, so it was laid out to occur after a terrorism incident, so as not to look like what it was - a determination to control the populace. The OK City explosion, the downing of TWA800, all pre-runners to 911, as they were determined to have a cause for martial law and civil rights restrictions.
       </p>
       <p>
        They aimed for 2003, as we have consistently stated this would be the year of the pole shift, leading them to stretch out too early with these moves. Now there is resistance to the restrictions they wanted to impose, and many are being lifted or at least resisted. All part of our plan, when we issued the White Lie about 'shortly after May 15, 2003'.

       And here's what ZetaTalk says about 9/11 justice:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        &amp;nbsp;
        <em>
         "911 was False Flag as Dick Cheney was orchestrating the event, at the helm, though he will never be brought to justice for this. This and the US electoral fraud in 2000 and 2004 via Diebold paperless voting machines is considered too shocking for the American public to handle, and thus will be suppressed forever. The UK False Flag on 77 was done by the UK for the benefit of Bush/Blair during the Iraq war, to motivate doubters in the UK. MH 017 was downed by Kiev in an attempt to engage Europe to fight Ukraine’s battles."

       </p>
       <p>
        &amp;nbsp;
        <strong>
         Global Research is correct in guessing that no more than Saudi involvement in 911 will be revealed should any currently classified documents get declassified. The truth about the Bush family’s involvement, and in particular Dick Cheney’s central orchestration of events, was never investigated, so cannot be declassified.
        </strong>
        <em>
         Putin was threatening to release 911 satellite images during the Ukraine standoff, and all this was in process well before the October 20 announcement date was missed. We have mentioned that the rats are starting to turn on each other, and even though 911 is not central to the cover-up [on Nibiru], proof lies in many hands, it is likely that by this process 911 justice will result.

       No, I am unaware of anyone who "came out" and said "I helped do it, I helped plant the explosives, etc".

       Many have "come out" and said things such as "I was a CIA employee and I strongly feel 9/11 must have been an inside job".  That's worthless.

       Yes. Yes they "where." The explosions resulted from "terrorists" rigging the towers with bombs.

       The point is that my questions should be easy to answer. The FBI went around gathering up videos from adjacent businesses after the plane hit the Pentagon. And I find it hard to believe the Pentagon was not better surveilled by the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the flight recorder, I've heard many online that have been released after crashes, but somehow this one is just too much for us?

       Either they are hiding evidence or the want us to think they are. If you want to blame someone for fueling conspiracy theories, blame the government.

       There is plenty of evidence, as any follower of this subreddit is well aware. (Not to mention common sense with a mere modicum of knowledge.) You have simply rejected all evidence and then declared that there is none.

       You will simply deny it all out of hand and continue your shilling of non evidence. No one can convince you of what you are diametrically opposed. Your claim of being open to being convinced is a bare faced lie. You do not require me or any single person to provide you with the evidence that is abundantly available for anyone to research.

       No problem. If you want to keep pulling on this thread, I recommend the books of Michael Collins Piper, a journalist who recently passed away.

       Confusingly, Michael Collins Piper seemed to think that Christopher Bollyn was an Israeli disinformation agent -- but I've read both and found them interesting. I think the key is always to harvest whatever good information we can from these sources, and form our own conclusions.

       That was the exact article I hoped you would find.  What structural codes have been changed?  More robust fireproofing.  Nothing in relation to the actual engineering or to retrofit buildings.  They were changed in relation to getting help in and people out.  Nothing to prevent future collapses.  So take it to the next obviouls question.  Why not?

       Dude, there is so much evidence that has been brought forth before the 9/11 commission that was ignored, during the commission, and after.  If you haven't found any, you just haven't looked, or wanted to see what you found.   I recommend google.  Its a good source of info for the most part.
       <a href="https://www.google.com/search?num=30&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;q=new+9+11+conspiracy+evidence&amp;amp;oq=scientific+evidence++of+9%2F11++conspiracy&amp;amp;gs_l=serp.1.0.0i71l8.0.0.0.25185.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c..64.serp..0.0.0.RCAs0B0TYBg">
        Start by typing "new 9 11 conspiracy evidence".
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I also would recommend watching
       <a href="https://youtu.be/jiqkviFnuXk?t=3m58s">
        David Ray Griffin's Debunking 9/11 Debunking 9 part series.  Here is part 1.
       </a>
       He actually makes the debunkers look pretty silly.  Which is the exact light that should be shed on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, if you have never watched
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DOnAn_PX6M">
        The New Pearl Harbor,
       </a>
       watch it.  Even if you have to do it in segements.  Its a rather long documentary from 2013 that has a ton of good info that can be vetted and verified, unlike the governmnets claims, and also gives time to the ones who support the governments theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before I go any further in this already too long of a conversation, take the time to review that info.  It wasn't hard to find, and makes your claims of no new or contradictory evidence look very silly.  Any one with access to the web and google can find it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can't look at it, or choose not to, it will tell every one in this thread what type of efforts you actually put into researching the events of 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Peace out
      </p>
      <p>
       And the one documentary is 5 hours long, so any responses before that time will tell me you haven't watched it, and can no longer be taken seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not a very strong speller, but you get the jist of what I had to say.   The spelling police have dropped their cash bonus' as well, FYI.
