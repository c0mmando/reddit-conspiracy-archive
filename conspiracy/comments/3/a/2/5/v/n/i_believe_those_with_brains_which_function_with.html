        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I should warn you in advance: this is almost a novel and when I say &quot;stupid human&quot; I am only referring to those humans who are.</p>

<p>Also: Stupid =&gt; One who is not willing to learn. ex: Doctors are, without question, intelligent as they must be -yet many, once they have attained a certain degree of experience, refuse to learn new procedures, concepts, treatments or even stay abreast of the latest medical news.</p>

<p>Now then.</p>

<p>I share neurological and behavioral similarities with those identified as being &quot;on the Autistic Spectrum&quot;.  But believe the tag Autism is being misused and severely misjudged.  Further, I have encountered articles, people and even websites dedicated to eliminating this supposed disorder.</p>

<p>I am not a doctor of medicine.  </p>

<p>I do not pretend to be an expert.  On anything. I believe there are no experts.  Experts are wrong all the time.  However, I do always invite those who do believe they are experts to argue, while keeping in mind that either or both of us may be wrong.  I stay prepared at all times for the possibility that I may need to update what I have stored as more or less accurate data.</p>

<p>I have studied the documentation and been to the lectures.  I have gone to University and studied with the other students on human anatomy and physiology, especially neuroscience.  Of course I&#39;ve also studied genetics and DNA structure.  I&#39;ve spent over 10 years studying mathematical and particle physics.  However I never paid for entry or any of the materials.  I simply followed older classmates who had graduated and the teachers and professors let me.  I recorded lectures and played them to music while sleeping.  I more than actively participated in the various tests, projects and experiments, most often being invited by several groups at a time due to my ridiculously active creative and reasoning abilities.  Many times I scored highest on the pre-test mock exams I&#39;d ask them to copy for me.  However, I never had the money to pay for the real exams.</p>

<p>And so I never graduated from anything.  Not even highschool.</p>

<p>I was evaluated by several psychiatrist and my parents were told I had severely restricted socio-developmental capacity and poor learning adaptability.  I remember how the doctors attempted to make me talk while looking at them and how I was unable to even understand what they were saying while I did.  They were very insistent when they recommended they switch me to an &quot;alternative learning&quot; facility.</p>

<p>After I had a severe accident at the school, my parents decided it might have been a mistake.  I, however, believe the mistake was for them to believe I ever had a learning disability.  For what reason is a person judged to be impaired if they are capable of performing the task at an acceptable level? Why do teachers get to say you are not paying attention because you simply can not look them in the face without being overwhelmed? Its not the system -the system was fine.  I learned very well.  I understood very well.  I only didn&#39;t &quot;pay attention enough in class&quot; and received poor grades on that premise only.</p>

<p>This is ridiculous.  Basically, I&#39;m not allowed to learn because I don&#39;t obey a command I can not obey.  What a load of fucking shit.</p>

<p>I have the uncanny knack to run into, befriend and live around others who I was later told were &quot;Autistic.&quot;  Stupid humans pitied, ignored, even insulted and bullied these people while claiming to be their friend.  As for their parents (especially the mother), they would either shelter them like babies into their teens or treat them like retards who couldn&#39;t do anything right.  Mine were somehow both and neither.</p>

<p>These people usually grew up to eventually leave their parents to live elsewhere knowing almost nothing of the real world.  I&#39;m not kidding when I say that all these people were very angry with their parents for a very long time.</p>

<p>As I grew up with many of these people I was able to observe their progress and, as I have a habit of doing, I made a study about it and logged my observations.  Without question, all of them suffer.  But not from a disability, only from their treatment by stupid humans.</p>

<p>It is the product of my observations that I submit: all those I have encountered who were diagnosed as being affected by ASD also learn very quickly.  Amazingly fast, in some cases.  The only obstacle they seemed to have is a great anxiety when faced with a teacher or tutor who was unwilling or unable to tolerate their &quot;attitude&quot; or their apparent &quot;lack of interest&quot;.  I also found that each one of them had the ability to &quot;copy&quot;, just as I do.  This ability would appear in their behavior, mannerisms, speech, drawing and writing, so long as I was able to maintain their interest.</p>

<p>In fact, the only thing I have found that ASD categorized people have difficulty with is accepting orders.  Without fail they do not simply do what they are told.  It must be explained.  Every time.  They will not move unless beaten, physically or not, after which they will attempt to perform something: the wrong thing.  This does not collude with most stupid human social conduct.  Even less so with slaver-type stupid humans, who view them as nothing but defective or simply stupid or lazy when its the exact opposite.</p>

<p>Is it a conspiracy if all the powerful stupid humans are too stupid to properly use their new biological robots and decide to terminate the line? The normal humans seem fine with them...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oop, sorry I didn&#39;t notice you right away for some reason.  I suppose I was using the term used in Digimon?</p>

<p>Edit: I should explain - any distinct change in genetics of an animal can be described as perceivable evolution. Evolution marks the change. So we can take Down syndrome for example and pretend that we can say that the negative points outweigh the good ones.  That may be true but makes them no less an evolved human. We do not say dogs are not descendants of wolves because they don&#39;t live as long and such.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand now!</p>

<p>This is something very important I wanted to discuss.  There has been a link that has been discovered between people diagnosed with either Asperger&#39;s or ASD: heavy metal poisoning. I <em>beg</em> all who have been diagnosed with Asperger&#39;s or ASD to try Chelation Therapy.</p>

<p>I did not receive flu shots.  Neither did by mother, before or after my birth. So if flu shots do contribute to aggravating the symptoms, they do not cause them directly -in my opinion.</p>

<p>Of course I may have absorbed Mercury from another source, say if my water was contaminated or if I ate a large amount of sardines or tuna. I did try chelation and it was without question a huge improvement so again please try to convince your aunt or uncle to try it with your cousin.</p>

<p>According to the results of the research I was participating in, it was found that people with our brain function and nervous systems find it difficult to eliminate heavy metals and some other elements of lesser health detriments. Any poison that is not eliminated properly will accumulate in various regions of the brain and can affect judgement.  </p>

<p>However, neurotypical humans have not been found to exhibit ASD symptoms when exposed to them especially Mercury. Instead it gives a person who has ASD the same symptoms and effects that it does an NT human: Neurasthenia - we feel as anxiety,  stress, stomach cramping and even paranoia-like symptoms that may develop into schizophrenia if left unchecked.</p>

<p>EDIT: This links to an overview of the situation described by someone whos better at describing than I am:</p>

<p><a href="http://drhyman.com/blog/2010/05/19/how-to-rid-your-body-of-mercury-and-other-heavy-metals-a-3-step-plan-to-recover-your-health/">http://drhyman.com/blog/2010/05/19/how-to-rid-your-body-of-mercury-and-other-heavy-metals-a-3-step-plan-to-recover-your-health/</a></p>

<p>Only some of his conclusions differ from mine, but it can give you a good idea of what&#39;s happened to your cousin and what you and his parents can do to help him become himself again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to apologize for my assumptions.  Your comment confused me at first.</p>

<p>I must admit that it is quite probable you and your cousin&#39;s parents were not given access to all the information.</p>

<p>Please let me try to help your cousin.  I was in similar condition to your cousin before I was rescued myself:  </p>

<p>Autistic people are incapacitated by Mercury poisoning as most of us do not have what it takes to eliminate it. Amalgam tooth fillings are the major cause for poisoning, but Mercury in Tuna can play a role if we eat a lot of it.</p>

<p>Some of the Flu shots are harmful to our intestines and brain. Sometimes they&#39;re even fatal.  I did not receive a flu shot so I was lucky.</p>

<p>I have discovered ways to recover from these things and would like to share them if you will let me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are identifying with people who have an actual disability because you share some traits with them.  I have those traits too but I also recognize that profoundly autistic people have big challenges that I as an unusual but otherwise normal person do not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s difficult to appreciate your post while you&#39;re calling people &quot;stupid humans&quot;.  It seems like you are still holding quite a bit of resentment toward certain people in your life and applying this pattern onto pieces to which it doesn&#39;t apply.

<p>Edit: I <em>am</em> autistic.  My post is meant to explain to people who will listen that people like you refuse to understand that &quot;social faux-pas&quot; means nothing to people like me and by that fact you misjudge us to be liars and idiots.</p>

<p>What I don&#39;t understand, now, is this: it seems like my comment has offended you, though i never attacked you at all.  Why is that?

<p>You never had any interest in commenting anything appropriate to the  post and now that you have my attention you&#39;re feeling sated as you have fed.</p>

<p>Now for the soupe-du-jour: You don&#39;t have the faintest idea what you&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>And for the main course: No amount of bullying/trolling/crying will ever force me to do anything.  Not because I don&#39;t want to.  Not out of spite.  My brain functions in a way that does not allow me to operate by, or accept, your flawed rationale.</p>

<p>Now finally dessert: I am well aware that nothing I say to you makes any difference.  That&#39;s what my post is about.  This comment is actually not for you but for those who end up reading it so they can laugh at you for your ignorance.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t know that people with ASD (Autism) have feelings, if you don&#39;t know that our brain function makes us unable (not unwilling) to comply with irrational rules or commands, then you really understood nothing of my post.</p>

<p>Please allow me to re-iterate: We do not accept orders.  Our brains do not simply understand &quot;this is bad, don&#39;t do it&quot; we will always ask why.  If the answer is always &quot;because some people don&#39;t like it&quot; you&#39;re only stating how there are more who give us this order.</p>

<p>Now you say that you want me to explain to you these things.  Which I did explain to a certain degree in my post. Yet it isn&#39;t my job to help people like you.  You can go read up properly on ASD/Asperger&#39;s and then come back and then comment something else off topic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fine.  On topic: do you believe that vaccines are causing ASD or purely an evolutionary strategy?  I ask because many here, if not most, believe it is a disadvantage and wish to cure it.</p>

<p>I do believe that people should be more open to different ways of perceiving the world and that, ideally, education and social interactions should be individually tailored to each individual.</p>

<p>Honestly, I&#39;m not convinced that ASD is an evolutionary advantage at this point in time.  Since it&#39;s a spectrum, it&#39;s near impossible to determine its benefits vs. costs on the whole.  Is that more on topic, or just muddy?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I forgot to mention this in my post, although at least one other person commented on this already.</p>

<p>The following can be verified <a href="http://drhyman.com/blog/2010/05/19/how-to-rid-your-body-of-mercury-and-other-heavy-metals-a-3-step-plan-to-recover-your-health/">here</a></p>

<p>There is no question that the Measles vaccines are not causing ASD -only causing neurological damage and severely disabling the person. Those with Autism don&#39;t fight off the virus and, instead, it continues to live in their brain causing massive damage.  </p>

<p>The reason they can&#39;t fight it off is a chicken vs egg situation between ASD and Heavy Metal retention.  We don&#39;t yet have concrete proof if Heavy Metal retention is caused by the Autistic genetic trait or the reverse.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe there has been enough research to determine that yet.  But, as I mentioned in my post, there do exist incidences where the person diagnosed with ASD does not have high levels of Mercury or other Toxic Heavy Metals in their body and who have never received any type of vaccine or flu shot.</p>

<p>So <em>in my opinion</em> that indicates a pretty sure sign, however there is still the possibility that the mother had Mercury in her system when she was pregnant.</p>

<p>The problem is how, those of whom share the ASD trait and do not yet have a buildup of Mercury in their systems or the measles, are usually simply considered strange and are often never diagnosed as they can most often lead relatively normal lives.</p>

Other than your lifetime of frustration imposed by others, what makes you believe there&#39;s a conspiracy as opposed to large masd communications?

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, sorry, I somehow thought it was obvious.  I should know better by now, but that seems to be part of the problem.</p>

<p>The vaccine of course.  It seems far too convenient that Mercury poisoning is self-sustaining and that the Measles vaccine was suddenly mandatory in many parts of North America.  </p>

<p>There are a few other things I noticed while I was doing my research. How neurologists, dentists, and psychiatrist I spoke with reacted when I asked about the heavy metal poisoning, for example. Some flat out told me to get out of their office.  I was only asking to be tested and I had to see over 20 doctors before finding one that was willing to send me to the hospital to be tested.  The dentists absolutely refused to talk about it period and ignored my requests to have my amalgam fillings replaced, even though it would have been more money for them.  That really bothered me.</p>

<p>I would like to make something else clear.  While I can&#39;t say I don&#39;t resent the way people react to how I communicate, I also don&#39;t blame them.  I don&#39;t hold grudges unless with a person who does. 
All I really care about is my obsession: solving problems. I suppose I am quite angry with the dentists though.  They were somehow very stubborn about using amalgam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>High lead, copper and mercury. Once she had the results the doctor sent me to the hospital.  They had do a 2 week prep of no stimulants or other drugs and then had me taking something orally that was supposed to take every day until it was gone.  I don&#39;t remember how long I took it. They did say it was to purge the metals from my body. I had to keep returning to the hospital for blood tests and urine samples. </p>

<p>For a long time now I thought that it was a treatment called Chelation.  But I&#39;m looking it up right now and its not quite the same as what they had me do at the hospital and it looks like its some sort of &quot;alternative medicine&quot;. So I don&#39;t know about that.</p>

<p>What I do know is that all the people I meet who have ASD and go see their doctors to be tested usually have high levels of one or another heavy metal in their system.  Ive even encountered one such who had very high levels of Bismuth.</p>

<p>Afterward, I didn&#39;t feel very good for a while.  The detox process took a long time and was rather hard on me.  But I did regain some of my ability to focus.  The biggest improvement was my appetite.  Before the treatment, whatever it was/is, I hated eating.  Ever since, my appetite has been crazy.</p>

<p>Bad news though, can&#39;t say I&#39;m cured.  I might have gotten rid of the metals I had, but just now (like the past few month) Ive been having more and more nausea and the tingling and muscle cramps in my arms and legs has come back and gotten worse.  So obviously I still am accumulating something.  Just today I realized I still take Pepto (Bismuth) and I&#39;m a real stupid person who went back to smoking tobacco.</p>

<p>EDIT: I forgot to mention that they also gave me something through IV at the hospital.  This is what made me think it was Chelation. I also forgot to say that I went through a period of what I can only call withdrawal as I craved cigarettes something fierce, like I&#39;ve never experienced before and haven&#39;t since.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know where the lead came from.  I know that the drinking water where I was living as a child wasn&#39;t the best.</p>

<p>I never liked Tums or Rolaids and they don&#39;t work as well as Pepto, but I just found some Zantac in the med cabinet. A million times better: its a proton-pump inhibitor.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sad to say that I deliberately asked and I couldn&#39;t remember what he told me by the time I got home.
I wonder if I contact the hospital if they would still have those from around 25 years ago. I like having the numbers and it irks me. I might do that.</p>

<p>EDIT: Chelation wasn&#39;t the biggest help for me. I was already more aware of my surroundings and socializing by this time.  My first and pretty much only real friend was responsible.  He was a sociopath.  We were the same age and he made it his little puzzle game to try to take me apart and put me back together. Once I was more capable of communicating, I made it mine to do the same to him. With a fair amount of success, I might add.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess you could call it &quot;fixing&quot; me?  I was severely handicapped until I was around 7 when I met him.  According to our parents he would use me to cover for &quot;bad&quot; things he wanted to do.  For example, he liked to sneak out of his window. So he would come over and pretend to sleep in my room overnight then go out and play with his friends.</p>

<p>Eventually he wasn&#39;t satisfied with just leaving me at home.  He started to tell me things like &quot;if you keep it a secret ill show you something cool&quot; and I&#39;d follow him -even when my parents couldn&#39;t even get me to eat, lay down or be quiet.</p>

<p>Later he taught me one of the <em>most</em> important things I figure I learned in my life.  All about Trolls. This was before anyone was very interested in the Internet, so you&#39;ll have to excuse the borrowed sense to the word.  Either way it took him a lot of effort to teach me that.  I just wouldn&#39;t or couldn&#39;t accept that the person getting Trolled wasn&#39;t necessarily a victim.  I just didn&#39;t see it.  Until he &quot;forced&quot; me to try it once.  What a revelation.  See, up until then, people that I did try to talk to always seemed to get upset with me.  I didn&#39;t know what was wrong and it made me not want to talk.  So when I found out that, if I&#39;m feeling like I&#39;m being picked on or unfairly treated, I can just say what I think that person&#39;s problem is and OMG do they get mad.  Only its different.  I&#39;m expecting it.  It doesn&#39;t matter if the person gets angry, they deserve to be because they were being unfair (even if its only in my mind)</p>

<p>So I found out I was actually really good at that.  I started to be a Troll everywhere.  I turned into that asshole that just shits on everybody.  And people started to like me?? I started to make bad friends.  I didn&#39;t care they were bad. I had friends.  It was a miracle.  Anyway I did come back down afterward.  That was humiliating. Still it was definitely worth it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting post--I&#39;m only half done, but I have a suggestion for you:</p>

<p>First off, if you aren&#39;t familiar with the Olmecs you should read a quick primer on them, or on ancient Mesoamerican cultures in general. Once you feel like you have a grasp on who they were, you should read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Were-jaguar">this wikipedia page</a> about one of their most famous motifs, the were-jaguar baby.</p>

<p>The legend was that women, often older women (the &quot;crone&quot; or the &quot;elder&quot;), would be impregnated by jaguars and give birth to these mystical babies with very distinct facial features and otherworldly skills/abilities.</p>

<p>We know now that after a certain age (&quot;elderly&quot;), a woman is more and more likely to give birth to a child that is somewhere on the spectrum. These kids have facial features that are in line with the depictions of the were-jaguars. Several art historians have put forth the idea that the Olmecs were in fact treating children on the autism spectrum with respect and reverence. This is definitely in line with what I&#39;ve read of your post.</p>

<p>I&#39;m typing this while hungover on my couch, so it isn&#39;t quite as well-worded as I would have liked. Here are some links to relevant papers, in order from most accessible-&gt;most academic.</p>

<p><a href="http://adasperdown.blogspot.com/2010/10/jaguar-children-worship-of-those-with.html">This is just from some random blog, but the ideas are similar to the academic Art History papers I&#39;ve read</a></p>

<p><a href="http://downsyndromeuprising.blogspot.com/2013/07/a-brief-history-of-down-syndrome-part-2.html">Still just a blog, but this one is...better presented</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.penn.museum/documents/publications/expedition/PDFs/16-4/Gonzalo.pdf">Milton and Gonzalo are geniuses! It could be that I&#39;m just a huge nerd, but I think this is a really fun paper</a></p>

<p>You should check out a process called &quot;Chelation&quot; which removes heavy metals from the body. An MIT scientist has come to the conclusion that Autism is actually heavy metal/chemical poisoning of the brain. Cite here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3P6wVUH0pc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3P6wVUH0pc</a> . Chelation could possibly help relieve the symptoms of your autism. Not saying that autism isn&#39;t evolution, but all the autistic people I know (although sometimes being very talented in one subject) are usually not too social and have trouble functioning in society. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I have read that report and I agree that the heavy metal poisoning does affect the person as well.  I forgot to mention that Thank you.  It is a very important problem as it also affects the neurotypical humans as well in very bad ways.  Also, many neurotypical humans are not always adept/able/willing to function in this society either.  Very astute thought.  I appreciate you actually reading the post as well :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for speaking up. My personal experience confirms your view. In a way it is like this: if everyone would do things like i do them, we would have peace on earth, but as most others do things differently (in a more stupid/selfish/animalistic way) so i am viewed as the unsocial being. But to socialize is only a reaction/defence mechanism in a harmful environment. The goal of social and neurological evolution must be that we start seeing ourselves as individuals and not as part of a group. The worst crimes in history were caused by those who believed in shit just because everybody they k ew did the same. So...
yeah. Society has to change, not us..
take care friend and keep smiling. Dont make the mistake to think too highly of yourself. Even a monkey or a tree share the same shard of mother-earths soul as you. We are all one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to preface this with the fact that I was diagnosed with Aspergers around twenty years ago.</p>

<p>Evolution is a farce. We are not in a continual upward journey of growth. Our physical bodies are copies of copies of copies... and we are bound to gradual degradation. Each generation is worse off than the last. There is no such thing as a positive mutation. Mutations do not accumulate to create new kinds of creatures.</p>

<p>Speciation, or variation, exists and is real. Genetic material <em>that already exists</em> is recombined and shuffled to create a creature of the same kind that is the same, but different. No new genetic material is created, nor could it be. A feline will always be a feline, it cannot become anything else. A dog will always be a dog. A horse will always be a horse.</p>

<p>There are limits on how you can rearrange the genes of a cat to get another kind of cat. You can&#39;t rearrange the genes of a cat to get a worm, and you can&#39;t rearrange the genes of a bacteria to get a frog. The mutations that occur within this shuffling process of reproduction are harmful and cause defects like sickle-cell anemia and down&#39;s syndrome.</p>

<p>Genetic information is a language extremely complex beyond anything man has made that requires biological machines to process and transcribe it. Our existence is no accident, but one of intelligent creation. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKQ-OmeNfFw">Evolution is a stupid theory</a> that has no basis in reality other than people telling you it does. The facts do not add up. </p>

<p>You are not an upgrade, nor could you possibly be. We are the byproduct of copying copies, being injected with poisons, and then being indoctrinated into a state sponsored religion to keep us ignorant of the fact that we were created by a higher being, God, the creator of all things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah...I&#39;m about ready to take this down. You&#39;re right.  You obviously checked the definition of the word evolution before posting.</p>

<p>You missed the meaning of the post.
I am trying to say that I believe people with brains which operate in this way are significantly different that of other humans and are almost always misunderstood.  For this reason they are mistreated and labeled as defects.</p>

<p>Perhaps, if its that word you have a problem with, I can change that. Evolution, as you see it, is a denial of your faith.  </p>

<p>Then take this for example: </p>

<p>You say your God is a &quot;higher being&quot;. To some people that could only mean your God is supposedly up in the sky or space somewhere.
To others it might mean he is under the influence of better narcotics.</p>

<p>Do you not see? I don&#39;t care if we came from apes or dolphins. I don&#39;t.  It&#39;s not important for the message I was trying to communicate.</p>

<p>My point is forget about what they want to tell you about yourself. You&#39;re your person responsible to God for your own actions. You can learn whatever you want and nobody can keep you from that. Secular education is a system of indoctrination that will help you for some things, but it doesn&#39;t keep you from being alive or living and is mostly harmful. You don&#39;t need their schooling or approval to live a fulfilling life.</p>

<p>What&#39;s wrong with you physically doesn&#39;t define who you are, your character does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand now!</p>

<p>This is something very important I wanted to discuss.  There has been a link that has been discovered between people diagnosed with either Asperger&#39;s or ASD: heavy metal poisoning. I <em>beg</em> all who have been diagnosed with Asperger&#39;s or ASD to try Chelation Therapy.</p>

<p>I did not receive flu shots.  Neither did by mother, before or after my birth. So if flu shots do contribute to aggravating the symptoms, they do not cause them directly -in my opinion.</p>

<p>Of course I may have absorbed Mercury from another source, say if my water was contaminated or if I ate a large amount of sardines or tuna. I did try chelation and it was without question a huge improvement so again please try to convince your aunt or uncle to try it with your cousin.</p>

<p>According to the results of the research I was participating in, it was found that people with our brain function and nervous systems find it difficult to eliminate heavy metals and some other elements of lesser health detriments. Any poison that is not eliminated properly will accumulate in various regions of the brain and can affect judgement.  </p>

<p>However, neurotypical humans have not been found to exhibit ASD symptoms when exposed to them especially Mercury. Instead it gives a person who has ASD the same symptoms and effects that it does an NT human: Neurasthenia - we feel as anxiety,  stress, stomach cramping and even paranoia-like symptoms that may develop into schizophrenia if left unchecked.</p>

<p>EDIT: This links to an overview of the situation described by someone whos better at describing than I am:</p>

<p><a href="http://drhyman.com/blog/2010/05/19/how-to-rid-your-body-of-mercury-and-other-heavy-metals-a-3-step-plan-to-recover-your-health/">http://drhyman.com/blog/2010/05/19/how-to-rid-your-body-of-mercury-and-other-heavy-metals-a-3-step-plan-to-recover-your-health/</a></p>

<p>Only some of his conclusions differ from mine, but it can give you a good idea of what&#39;s happened to your cousin and what you and his parents can do to help him become himself again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, sorry, I somehow thought it was obvious.  I should know better by now, but that seems to be part of the problem.</p>

<p>The vaccine of course.  It seems far too convenient that Mercury poisoning is self-sustaining and that the Measles vaccine was suddenly mandatory in many parts of North America.  </p>

<p>There are a few other things I noticed while I was doing my research. How neurologists, dentists, and psychiatrist I spoke with reacted when I asked about the heavy metal poisoning, for example. Some flat out told me to get out of their office.  I was only asking to be tested and I had to see over 20 doctors before finding one that was willing to send me to the hospital to be tested.  The dentists absolutely refused to talk about it period and ignored my requests to have my amalgam fillings replaced, even though it would have been more money for them.  That really bothered me.</p>

<p>I would like to make something else clear.  While I can&#39;t say I don&#39;t resent the way people react to how I communicate, I also don&#39;t blame them.  I don&#39;t hold grudges unless with a person who does. 
All I really care about is my obsession: solving problems. I suppose I am quite angry with the dentists though.  They were somehow very stubborn about using amalgam.</p>
