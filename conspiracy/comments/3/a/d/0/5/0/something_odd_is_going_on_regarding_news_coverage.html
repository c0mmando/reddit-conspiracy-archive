       so that bill mentions House approved of the TPP bill with a vote total of 218-208. But the only vote turnout that was equal to that was this one below which does not mention the TPP at all and deals with retirement for public officials.
       <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/114-2015/h374">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now i see this bill dealing with the TPP and it passed but the vote turnout is much different
       <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/114-2015/h373">
        https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/114-2015/h373
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Did the Hill mess up the numbers? They never mention what the actual bill name is just talking vaguely about the tpp with an update on vote results.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am asking in regards to is tpp stuff buried in this bill on retirement or did the hill just mess up the numbers which is a problem because then we have a ton of people bitching on the net posting this article but its completely wrong with the numbers showing that people will post stuff but not actually research anything.

       First, to clearify- what you have here
       <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/114-2015/h373">
        https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/114-2015/h373
       </a>
       (you're first link) is an admendment to this bill
       <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/114-2015/h374">
        https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/114-2015/h374
       </a>
       (you're second link)
      </p>
      <p>
       The amendment passed, then the bill passed.  That said, you are correct, I see nothing in
       <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2146/text">
        HR 2146
       </a>
       (that passed 218-208) that relates to the TPP.  However, I see nothing in
       <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-resolution/321?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22%5C%22hres321%5C%22%22%5D%7D">
        HR 321
       </a>
       that contains language to a trade deal either, so I'm just very confused all around.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: so I found this:
       <a href="https://rules.house.gov/bill/114/hr-2146-sa">
        https://rules.house.gov/bill/114/hr-2146-sa
       </a>
       , which links to this:
       <a href="https://rules.house.gov/bill/114/hr-2146-sa">
        https://rules.house.gov/bill/114/hr-2146-sa
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So from what I understand, the old HR321 was amended on the floor to include the TPP language
       <a href="https://rules.house.gov/bill/114/hr-2146-sa">
        in this link
       </a>
       (passed 244-181).  That amendment was then added to HR 2146, which then passed 218-208.

       Basically, they added an amendment to a previous amendment to a bill that they knew would pass.

       Corporate news companies don't want the people to know what their corporate masters are trying to do, which is why I'm not surprised that it's gotten zero attention today.

      </p>
      <p>
       H Res 321 is
       <a href="http://rules.house.gov/bill/114/hr-2146-sa">
        the rule governing consideration of HR 2146.

      <p>
       <a href="http://amendments-rules.house.gov/amendments/RYANWI_03761715141607167.pdf">
        The amendment to HR 2146 is here.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The rule governs consideration of the bill - a completely different bill from the bill considered last week.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rules are pretty common for "controversial" bills (any bill that can't get 2/3 of the vote).
      </p>
      <p>
       They govern what amendments are in order generally.  However, as was done here, they can deem an amendment passed for purposes of consideration on the House floor.
      </p>
      <p>
       So while a vote for the rule effectively resulted in the inclusion of the amendment, it was not a vote for the amendment per se.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to press reporting on it, to be somewhat fair to them, the main thing is that frankly, I doubt most of them understand what happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know a lot of staffers that don't really understand what happened.  For the most part the Hill rags did understand what happened, but mainstream press? No way in hell.

       When you say order; is that defined as sequence, or as in "rules of order" i.e. allowed?   I'm assuming rules of order, but I'd hate to be wrong.

       By that you mean, a vote for the rules was not indicative of agreeing to that amendment because they didn't know it was in there?  Why cast a yea vote for the rule if you're not ok with the amendment added to it?

      <p>
       Generally speaking what's allowed. That said, a structured rule (a rule making only certain amendments in order) still generally list the amendments made in order and say they have to be made in that order. That's usually not important, but can be.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would be considered a closed rule, since really no amendments were made in order.

      <p>
       Everyone (with competent staff at least) knew it was there. It's not that uncommon a practice.

      <blockquote>
       <p>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's a party loyalty thing. A rule going down is seen as a major rebuke of leadership. It's as close as the house would get to a vote of no confidence as can occur in parliamentary systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the 30 Rs voted against the rule the first time this came up, I'm sure there was a lot of yelling. Wouldn't be surprised if people lost committee assignments when the smoke clears.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also note that the mindset with a rule doing this (deeming an amendment passed) is probably different than you're thinking. Most members and staff (in both parties) ultimately viewed this as a rule to consider TPA. Not as a rule that slips an amendment in. In other words, a rule to consider the end product described in the rule, however it's created.
