        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve seen the post about that Guccifer romanian hacker imprisoned saying something bad is coming to US this year for sure. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ5jtP4_u3c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ5jtP4_u3c</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un_XI4MM6QI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=10m42s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un_XI4MM6QI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=10m42s</a> .</p>

<p>Not to say that he is now incarcerated for hacking not only Bush and Clinton family e-mails but also Rockefellers, Walmart family and others (including FBI database, CIA and the entire US government including national security, FEMA). He was asked how is he knowing what he knows and he told I&#39;m not allowed to say. Probably he signed a deal of not divulging other secrets regarding US government so he won&#39;t be expulsed to US and getting jail there.</p>

<p>Buuut, he said that <strong>Pennsylvania for sure will be nuked until the end of this year.</strong> He also spoked about Americans dying on American soil in large numbers. There will be riots, police shooting in innocent people and that military and even police is training right as we speak for this kind of situations only. </p>

<p>If you start looking out for this you&#39;ll find numerous videos that support the same ideea. Millions will die this year in America. </p>

<p>I pray to God this won&#39;t happen even though I&#39;m not an US citizen and not living there. But.. too many things happen.. </p>

<p><strong>US Homeland Security bought 1.6 billions rounds of ammo only in the past 2 years.</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbfjxjpKoR8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbfjxjpKoR8</a> . DHS even refuses to answer to why they bought this huge amount of ammo!!?</p>

<p><strong>Fema camps have millions of plastic coffins deposited all around US. For fucking sake, they even have children&#39;s coffins.</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3zSDdm-SHI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3zSDdm-SHI</a> <strong>Obama</strong> then had a <strong>press conference</strong> speaking about <strong>&quot;Prolonged Detention&quot;</strong>?? And saying <strong>&quot;We&#39;re not persecuting them for past crimes but for their expectation of the future crimes&quot;</strong>??????? Basically saying <strong>we will incarcerate people &quot;preventive&quot;</strong>.. And during last year they even started marking houses for concentration camps?.. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo2URXtOYk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo2URXtOYk</a> </p>

<p>And what was with that <strong>Jade Helm 15</strong>? That literally describes what I&#39;m stating right here? People rioting, police shooting in civilians?? Texas being marked as enemy..? Not gonna go further into the subject as there&#39;s no real proof this is real.</p>

<p>Also, what&#39;s with all that <strong>Gun-Control raids</strong> happening right now in US? All those <strong>protests</strong> and people sustaining this ideea is just wrong... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv7ZXLU51Hs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv7ZXLU51Hs</a></p>

<p><strong>Walmarts are being closed</strong> around US and not to say that Wal-Mart family built walmarts even in <strong>areas with low population</strong>. <strong>Wal-Marts which were never open</strong>. They are abandoned. Why on earth would you do that? It&#39;s of course something they plan on using later on. And the only thing that comes to mind is some kind of camps to either gather people up and help them or imprison them. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ERJG1exeSU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ERJG1exeSU</a></p>

<p>Not to say that walmarts are closed for plumbing issues for 6 months. They will be open again on September 15th. </p>

<p><strong>The Pope</strong> is coming to US to adress the congress and the people for the first time in history of the world on the <strong>22th September</strong>. He will speak on the <strong>24th</strong>. Also, Pope said that he knows he&#39;ll go back to &quot;his father&quot; in 2-3 years so he isn&#39;t worring about other stuff atm, he is just focused on helping others as much as he can. Already 2 years passed.. &quot;I have 2-3 more years to live&quot; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfXuuGhfE5I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfXuuGhfE5I</a></p>

<p><strong>Then the weird part is this right here.. The third secret of Fatima (Fatima being the name of the Virgin Mary).</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20000626_message-fatima_en.html">http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20000626_message-fatima_en.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>a <strong>Bishop dressed in White</strong> â€˜we had the impression that it was the Holy Father&#39;. Other Bishops, Priests, men and women Religious going up a steep mountain, at the top of which there was a big Cross of rough-hewn trunks as of a cork-tree with the bark; before reaching there <strong>the Holy Father passed through a big city half in ruins and half trembling with halting step, afflicted with pain and sorrow, he prayed for the souls of the corpses he met on his way</strong>; having reached the top of the mountain, <strong>on his knees at the foot of the big Cross he was killed by a group of soldiers who fired bullets and arrows at him</strong>, and in the same way there died one after another the other Bishops, Priests, men and women Religious, and various lay people of different ranks and positions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Now the Nostradamus, Quatrain 2.97 ~</strong> <a href="http://www.crystalinks.com/quatrainscentury2.html">http://www.crystalinks.com/quatrainscentury2.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Roman Pontiff</strong> beware of approaching</p>

<p><strong>The city that two rivers flow through,</strong></p>

<p><strong>Near there your blood will come to spurt</strong>, </p>

<p>You and yours when the rose will flourish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it just me or <strong>Philadelphia is really a city where 2 rivers meet</strong> that can fulfill the prophecy?</p>

<p>Also, French foreign minister said we have <strong>500 days until climatic chaos</strong>. We need to avoid that. 500 days from that day is exactly <strong>24 September 2015</strong>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QDJb6fF8pg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QDJb6fF8pg</a> </p>

<p>Shall I also talk about the <strong>Doomsday clock is now 3 minutes to midnight?</strong> This was stated on <strong>23th january 2015</strong>.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtAy2_FfpxY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtAy2_FfpxY</a></p>

<p>Another fact is <strong>over 200 000 homeless people simply vanished</strong> from the face of the earth in US.. What happened to them no one knows.. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-OiHYVtd8Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-OiHYVtd8Q</a></p>

<p><strong>Active Base</strong> or camp that the <strong>government is saying it&#39;s not active</strong>, here we have <strong>proof of it being active</strong> and not only that, but even the grass around the area is all cut down and everything so clean. It&#39;s a theory that maybe it&#39;s a <strong>concentration camp</strong>. <a href="https://youtu.be/7eLvjUL1Urs?t=577">https://youtu.be/7eLvjUL1Urs?t=577</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna stop here with all this post. I&#39;m not saying something is coming and I pray to God it won&#39;t and everything is a lie or just inventions. But just to be carefull out there. I&#39;m not an US citizen and I&#39;m not living in America but I sure hope all are lies and nothing bad will happen to anyone. </p>

<p>Just wanted to lie down some of the info I&#39;m aware of and to find out other opinions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy fuck. This is a good call. </p>

<p>I&#39;d also say, Pennsylvania is a state much controlled by the Freemasons -- they were able to cover up Penn State Satanic pedo-crimes, for example, and Jay Parker was brought up there in an Illuminati family -- so it may be a natural place for something like this to be pulled off. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really just a shot in the blue, so don&#39;t really take my word for anything.</p>

<p>But watching tv shows and stuff made before 2001, I see a lot of the views in New York with a direct shot of the twin towers.</p>

<p>Now this could be whatever but Friends would always have a shot like that, and if not all the time, most of the time it would have the sun in between the towers.</p>

<p>Bear with me, this is just an observation. Makes a good shot I&#39;m sure.</p>

<p>Now seeing stuff made within the last few years, it just seems like the Golden Gate Bridge is getting a lot of on screen attention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, you should do a little research.</p>

<p>2015 is steam rolling towards religious prophecy. If it&#39;s not the real prophecy, it is one they manufactured. It will mean just the same for them either way.</p>

<p>Take a look at the Jews history of action following a blood moon tetrad. Know that both the fourth moon and solar eclipse is coming later this year, so if anythings going to happen, it&#39;ll be in and around that time.</p>

<p>Now look, you don&#39;t have to take anyone&#39;s word for it. To be perfectly honest I do not go to church, or otherwise worship god.. But these guys running the show definitely do. The root of all the Jews evil is their religion that states to kill anyone who is not them, and they live by it alright.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just saying, if this was my world, and my world was starting to look like the culmination of my Lords prophecy, I would probably take advantage of that.</p>

<p>But seriously, look into it for yourself. I don&#39;t think religion and it&#39;s followers should be taken lightly considering the enormous history The Church has, including the powers it used to hold, and the powers it still does hold, which are, in fact, still vast. The Church used to be like the Illuminati ( or however you&#39;d like to refer) and they had their hand in just about everything.</p>

<p>The point of all of this is to keep an open mind. If you aren&#39;t going to educate yourself in what THEY BELIEVE IN, then so be it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A sheep, Huh?</p>

<p>Haha well I guess we&#39;re all sheep, aren&#39;t we?</p>

<p>Well I think us conspiracy guys are more like the trolls under the bridge, watching hopelessly as the Shepards guide their mindless sheep across OUR bridge, into a pit of fire, because we&#39;re too fucking pussy to go out and try anything for ourselves, because we still give a shit about what THE SHEEP think about us. </p>

<p>But we shouldn&#39;t, and we know that.</p>

<p>If you want a &quot;reputable&quot; source about biblical prophecy, try reading the fucking bible, or the quaran, or whatever the fuck the Jews read, then take a look at the current state of the world and do the comparison.</p>

<p>What the fuck do I know if the worlds going to end due to the second coming of Jesus? I already told you I&#39;m not religious.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just observant, and I keep an open mind. Which means that I like to explore all the ideas out there, knowing that I won&#39;t fall victim to one certain theory, but explore it as if I did.</p>

<p>Maybe the world isn&#39;t owned by Jews, but at least it sort of is. Rothschild is Jewish at its roots and they basically own all but the 3 or so countries we are currently hampering with, due to their central banks.</p>

<p>Once you really understand how much power they&#39;ve had since 1913.. You really start to think about some stuff.</p>

<p>Dude you don&#39;t have to believe the Jew theory! It&#39;s not my fault they are who they are and done what they&#39;ve done okay!? What makes people fit into <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is opening your mind and having YOUR OWN fucking idea.</p>

<p>If you are trying to fit in, you are doing something wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Elul 29 is the last day of the Shemitah year on the Jewish calendar. 
You know how God worked for 6 days then rested on the 7th? Jews have 6 working years then a 7th year of &quot;rest&quot; called Shemitah. Elul 29 is the last day of that year before the cycle resets.</p>

<p>Google will answer your questions about this year far better than I can. Unfortunately you need to wade through a lot of religious stuff but there is factual information hidden behind all the &quot;God&#39;s judgement&quot; baloney.</p>

<p>Fema camps have millions of plastic coffins deposited all around US. For fucking sake, they even have children&#39;s coffins.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What are you insinuating here, that the government is going to kill children in such great numbers, that they have to have coffins ready for them? That makes the assumption that, although they are evil enough to kill mass numbers of citizens, they are respectful enough to have grave liners pre-purchased for them. Well on second thought, maybe it&#39;s for the PR job that comes afterwards.</p>

<p>&quot;This is Anderson Cooper reporting live from the scene of mass protests where the US military has opened fire on anarchist thugs protesting some racially motivated murder. President Obama has announced that in a offering of good will, the USA will pay for the burials of all unfortunate enough to be killed dying for what they believe in. God bless America!&quot;</p>

<p>This is the closest thing I can find to your quote. BTW, not saying it doesn&#39;t mean the same thing, but quotation marks are indicating a literal quote in your post.</p>
