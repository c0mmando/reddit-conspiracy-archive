<p>I&#39;ve only checked out myself and one other user who seemed who I expected to be a shill.  The one suspected shill I looked up was profiled as a zionist who almost exclusively posted unpopular comments in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and did so every day like it was his job.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a regular here but I&#39;m almost certain I just witnessed a massive brigade against people on a thread in <a href="/r/funny">/r/funny</a>. It was a South Park meme, basically calling truthers &quot;retards.&quot; Needless to say it gets ugly toward the bottom, people were actually having some civil discussions on the topics, nothing too abrasive, normal disagreements at first. This all while the post was at 4K karma. </p>

<p>Anyway a couple people show up being very vicious to anyone supporting the truther material, insults, <strong>BOLD</strong> type, you know, irritating childish crap intended to solicit a similar response to then discredit those people, crap that usually gets downvoted to hell. The brigaders would single any truther sounding posts out and downvote them into oblivion while the very immature posts were gaining traction, all the while they would repeat &quot;<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is brigading!, you&#39;re stupid! you&#39;re an idiot!&quot; they&#39;d repeat this like a damn mantra.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve not seen so much fecal tossing before over some disagreements about 9-11, even against people who feel that there is just not enough evidence to prove government involvement or not, they were also roughed up by this sudden opinion shift.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t link or name names, I&#39;m sure you guys can find it though if you haven&#39;t seen it already. I don&#39;t know anything about this thread but you guys were mentioned a few times and I thought you&#39;d like to know, and now I see this post, which is also concerning. Anyway, hope this helps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just checked out that <a href="/r/funny">/r/funny</a> thread, and the people posting seemed genuine.  9/11 is the quintessential controversial topic, and normal people seem invested enough in the subject to actually have heated reddit arguments about it.</p>

<p>If you check my comment history, you&#39;ll see I&#39;ve argued the case for skepticism about the Apollo moon missions in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> in the past, to be met with animosity, accusations I&#39;m retarded, and double digit negative karma on each comment.  I don&#39;t blame that on shills, but rather see it as a reflection of how people really feel.  Most people think moon landing conspiracy theorists are retarded.  A ton think the same about 9/11 truthers.  It was propaganda that programmed these public opinions, and now it is actual normal users who perpetuate the propaganda and continue calling truthers retarded.  No active shills required.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the more current subject about which history is not yet written in the public&#39;s mind where I&#39;m much more wary of shills.  I couldn&#39;t believe some of the organized propaganda pushing I saw in the days immediately following the Boston Bombing.</p>

<p>Current events related to Isreal are probably the best examples of topics about which history is still to be written, and thus are where you&#39;ll find the straight up shills commenting.  <a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2012/10/12/diary-of-an-israeli-shill/">This old article</a> might be a work of pure fiction, but I think it paints a plausible picture of the kind of outfit that might be paying shills to push certain ideas and shape public opinion about current events.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It looks more genuine now yes, but it felt like a swift transition, roughly 2-3 hours. First it was mass insults, nonsensical madness and now it&#39;s like people shifted to be more level headed. Maybe it&#39;s a new tactic? Send in the demoralizers first, shake people up, make them lose confidence, it&#39;ll catch them off guard because this is Reddit and no one acts this way, then send in the actual debaters. </p>

<p>I only say it this way because I was tracking the comments of a couple of the more vicious ones, when they got their Karma base to no longer be hidden, the tone suddenly shifted, even among those first couple users. Of course it is likely all unplanned and it just turned out that way for various reasons, perhaps with recent Reddit drama there is just a bit of chaos as sub populations shift around or people invent their own new agenda to be offended over.</p>

<p>I like the shill angle though as concept, I know Russia does it so it isn&#39;t exactly far fetched.</p>

<p>If you see a shill, or someone who&#39;s trolling us the best thing to do is downvote the fuck out of their comment. Some people don&#39;t care, but a lot of them will.</p>

<p>If someone really wants to be an ass and they take things too far, report their post to the mods. The worst offenders can get banned from this sub. It&#39;s not a complete solution but isn&#39;t it worth the effort?</p>

now they ban you..your. personal info is not safe here. and can be looked at....any site requiring an email can be found out.

    <div class="md"><p>/pol/ came in and decided that they wanted to confirm the admins&#39;/normie suspicions that this board was filled with anti-semitic (re: anti-jewish not anti-Israel) stormfag garbage.</p>

<p>Basically, for all the talk of jewish/mossad false flags (which certainly have happened, that&#39;s not what I&#39;m arguing) now the new stormfags are doing an amazing job at wrecking everything. Problem is, if you moderate them then you&#39;re going against the stated MO of the subreddit (ie to allow free and open discussion about conspiracy theories). </p>

<p>Our overlords know that the best way to destroy a board is to let it destroy itself with meaningless gossip and circlejerking. Instead of talking about the TAA/TTIP/TPP or the &quot;crowd on demand&quot; stuff stormfags would rather have another discussion about the jewish marxist plot to destroy the world and how much they hate Israel for killing muslims. I&#39;m all for shittalking Israel and banks but every fucking day it&#39;s the same shit and nothing new is ever discussed beyond &quot;fuck the jews&quot;and so forth. This is a problem, because when a normal user comes on and sees this shit they obviously back off. And it becomes impossible for regulars to have a serious discussion about proven Israeli/IDF/Mossad activities as every conversation is now tainted with bigotry (that, I should add, is more concerned with shitting on jews rather than discussing Israel&#39;s often disgusting and unethical activities).</p>

<p>How to solve it? I haven&#39;t a clue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly think we should start taking a hard stance against all this anti-Jew bullshit. Just get a mod who is able to discern thoughtful anti-Zionism and anti-Israel material from the completely unreasoned anti-Jew material and ban every single post and every single user that fails to make the distinction and goes off on some Jew talk. </p>

<p>I&#39;m definitely a fan of the ideal of unmoderated discussion, but with 300k subscribers and counting, and with shills from all over the place clearly targeting this sub as a matter of course, something needs to be done. Poisoning the well is a very real thing and letting this Jew crap continue has the very real effect of damaging the quality of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> as a whole. Not to mention that our failure to moderate such clear instances of &quot;hate speech,&quot; particularly those instances we already know to be a hot button issue for a very vocal and sensitive group of activist crybabies, is just asking for broader Reddit moderation to come down on this sub and use that material as its excuse.</p>

<p>We should organize and present our reasoning to the mods, or something. Or at least suss it out in conversation.</p>

<p>The Jews are not a unified group. They most likely agree on absolutely nothing, including what constitutes a Jew. They identify themselves as Jews for a diverse variety of reasons, including religious, cultural, familial, ethnic, and nationalistic reasons, and none of these reasons predispose any of them to have anything of significance in common. There is no other explanation: only a complete fucking idiot could possibly have a problem with &quot;the Jews&quot; as a whole. Only an idiot could possibly entertain the beliefs and assumptions that would lead them to have that problem, and I don&#39;t want that idiot anywhere near any reasonable person.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. As far as I can tell, Voat doesn&#39;t automatically subscribe you to any defaults, unlike Reddit. However, the defaults are listed at the top, and all of the subverses have a &quot;Subscribe&quot; button. Most of the major subs from Reddit have a Voat equivalent. There&#39;s /v/technology, /v/science, /v/books, /v/conspiracy, etc. </p>

<p>Voat is still small, so it doesn&#39;t yet have the diversity of small, niche subs that Reddit has. However, the existing subverses are much smaller than any major subreddits, so it&#39;s actually possible to have meaningful discussions without getting buried by thousands of jokes and puns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that most of the smart people left Reddit or lurking in the shadows away from all the sociopaths. There are a few stragglers but most of the users are new and still sleeping. It takes a long time to grasp all the information in this sub!</p>

<p>What I see happening now. A curious user will come in and post something good which gets lots of up votes and they then delete that post. Here is one of those. </p>

<p><a href="https://us.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/39kqr5/sandy_hook_im_a_teacher_and_i_wanted_to_have_a/">Sandy Hook: I&#39;m a teacher and I wanted to have a discussion because things aren&#39;t adding up</a>.</p>

<p>Its almost like they gather intel and then remove it. This was the user <a href="/u/missylizzy">/u/missylizzy</a> of that post before they removed everything. </p>

Atko and the guys have been working round the clock to get things normalized, and they&#39;ve done a fantastic job imho.

    <div class="md"><p>I worded that incorrectly as I am definitely stoned. I&#39;ve never visited voat nor had I ever heard of it until last week in this sub. I planned on it...got stoned and forgot. Came back to reddit the next day and saw a post quoting voat saying &quot;voat is under the second DDoS attack in 24 hours&quot;. This is proof to me the new leaders of reddit put the tip of the elites cock on their esophagus and plan to censor the web as instructed by any means necessary. Such as collecting data on its users and reporting things such as someone calling voat a safe haven for truth seekers. Is it not quite the coincidence that a day later voat is being censored from the web after being discussed in this sub? Knowledge is power so think. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Things just don&#39;t appear normal from all perspectives of the sub. Go to the new posts section. All I see is posts with 0 upvotes. It seems like mass dpwnvoting is going on to hide new information in my opinion. Go to comments on these posts as well. All downvoted to 0. Either their is a small town somewhere that has grouped together to downvote all new posts here or there&#39;s mass censorship going on. You decide which sounds more reasonable because those are the only excuses I have for this. I have been a silent user of this sub daily yes daily for over 3 years. Not bragging, just sharing that so you&#39;ll think hmm...maybe this adamant user would know how the norm is. </p>

<p>BTW, Reddit doesn&#39;t display votes on new submissions for a certain amount of time for some reason, but you can still see where posts are at in the comments page or certain browser extensions. If you&#39;re just looking at the new page in your browser, it&#39;s gonna look like everything is at 0, but it&#39;s probably wrong. </p>

<p>Not sure when they changed that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m hesitant to think that anyone&#39;s &quot;out to get&quot; <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, at least in the manner that one might expect. The fact is, when people think &quot;conspiracy,&quot; they think of tin foil hats and truly fringe ideas. This sub really seems to be more about political and media corruption than about the Reptilian Jew Illuminati, but that&#39;s what people associate &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; with.</p>

<p>I do think people downvote brigade this site, but it&#39;s not necessarily to suppress any dangerous content or ideas. Rather, I think it&#39;s just spiteful people who frequent subs like <a href="/r/TopMindsOfReddit">/r/TopMindsOfReddit</a>. People like to feel superior to others, and some people get off on basking in their perceived self-superiority to what they think of as crazy, paranoid conspiracy theorists. It&#39;s petty and dumb, but a lot of people are like that.</p>

<p>I do think it&#39;s kind of unfortunate that the entire concept of &quot;conspiracies,&quot; which can and do occur, is so strongly associated with highly implausible fringe ideas. I think a lot of us can agree that there&#39;s probably a lot of government corruption we&#39;re not aware of, and that&#39;s systematically concealed from us. I <em>don&#39;t</em> think the majority of people here believe in a secret cabal of aliens allied with a secret Zionist shadow government.</p>

<p>At the same time, though, I don&#39;t think that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> should censor or prohibit any statements or ideas, even those which are frankly absurd. It&#39;s important to have a place like this that&#39;s open to any and all discussions. Even saying &quot;no, you can&#39;t post your theory about the Reptilian Jew Illuminati and their evil plan to kill us with GMOs,&quot; would really be an affront to what this sub is about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe lay off all the insane dipshit posts about chemtrails, false flags, Jews, etc. Get back to the fun stuff like UFOs n&#39; shit and psycho 9/11 theories that, though possibly plausible, are wildly insane and endlessly entertaining. This sub takes itself WAY too seriously. No one agrees on anything. Everyone with a dissenting opinion is a shill. Open minds, my ass. Nearly everyone that posts here is incapable of seeing the bigger picture and most of you do nothing but embarrass yourselves.</p>

<p>Relax. Have fun. No one is going to change the world by posting on a message board, especially one as universally chided as this one. </p>

<p>Edit: No need to bring it up. Yes, I&#39;m a shill. Big time. Hardcore, in fact. Definitely not just some guy that works a 9-5 job he hates and doesn&#39;t want to spend his time reading pointless and endless bullshit that no one is EVER going to do anything about. Definitely a shill. Look me up on Facebook and send me a friend request. My name is Jewey McGeorgebush. </p>
