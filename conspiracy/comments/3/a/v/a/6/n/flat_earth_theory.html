       What do they have to gain from saying the earth is round? I don’t get it. It’s an interesting theory and there could be some truth but what are the primary gains from this?

       I think they boil it down to: globe earth = no god. When there's no god, nothing matters. Also imo, keeping us looking at the stars makes us blind to whatever is going on in our world.
Not my views, but I don't pretend to know the answer.

       Here's the thing: science can't disprove God. I don't understand why people attack those who choose to believe what they do based upon their faith, when it's quite obvious they're relying on faith of their own.

       The only real question I have is why would the earth be flat, but everything else planetary in nature be spherical?

       There's Flat Earth with circular lights in the sky...there's no evidence any of it is spherical up there...and nothing has ever been launched to "space".  All spherical planets have been projected into your mind through mass brainwashing since our childhood.

       Flat Earth demonstrates through evidence that the ground you are standing on is not part of a spherical ball spinning through space.  It's hardly focused on anything in the sky as there's no way of going up there to find out.

       The globe is the foundation of all religious science material. Without the globe you don't have space. Without space you don't have deep time. Without deep time you don't have evolution. Without evolution you don't have aliens....

       It makes you face reality. You suddenly need to know "Who made me? Why am I here?" Your options become either believing in the One true God or many gods, just like it was in the ancient times.

       The fossils we find are there because they were buried rapidly in a worldwide catastrophic flood. The bones they say are millions of years old cannot be because they have C-14 in them.

       The sedimentary layers actually reveal trees upright through hundreds of the layers at once all over the world. All of the sediment from all over the world was washed around and slowly laid out into layers over the course of the flood and however long it took for the water to settle off of the continents and into the valleys.

       It can be staged with the current technology we have, pretty much anything can be staged. You might not be watching too many movies. I recommend you spend a good month catching up on all the amazing movies you've missed. Start with Gravity.

       Look at your own post, and how often this question comes up, despite how easy it is to show that they have total control of your entire reality. They've made people so stupid and lazy in their own heads that they aren't even interested in the truth anymore, just an entertaining story packaged for them while they wait passively. Behold the fruits of mass indoctrination in government training centers.

       "One of the saddest lessons of history is this: if we've been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We're no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It's simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we've been taken.

       Because it is very likely that UFOs from outerspace is a massive psyop backed by Rockefeller money to prep us for a fake alien invasion.  Also the fact that people are so normalized to UFOs through their promotion in popular culture which is completely controlled.

       Yes, absolutely.  I think UFO sightings likely fall into three categories:
       <br/>
       1) human tech not available to the public
       <br/>
       2) holographic projection technology
       <br/>
       3) stories fabricated for some reason
      </p>

       To stage an alien invasion, unless they were going to do it war of the world's style and make it a pure media show, they would need some hardware.

       Greed in society today certainly is a big issue, but I'm sure you can see that it's a bit of a stretch to go from "people/corporations are pretty greedy", which I agree with, to "corporations are intentionally poisoning people".

       You have two different 'why' questions intricately bundled.
      </p>
      <p>
       One is a philosophical 'why', why would anyone do this, requiring a subjective answer, and which definitely depends upon knowledge none of us (in this conversation) have. I have many different speculations on this topic but am not interested in sharing any with this particular battleground.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other is the practical 'why', why a sphere instead of flat, requiring an objective answer. The Flat Earth model explains many physical phenomena in a much more coherent manner, as explained in my
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/393icm/whats_all_this_flat_earth_stuff_about_anyway/">
        Flat Earth primer
       </a>
       . Specific examples include sailors navigating at sea by assuming a plane, lighthouses providing utility beyond the limit of the expected curvature of the Earth, and railroads being designed over vast distances without having to account for any curvature deviation. So when you ask for practical examples of using the Flat Earth model, they are all around you. None of the actual physical models of our everyday interactions account for curvature and all the 'relative' movement we should be experiencing as we rotate, wobble, tilt, orbit, and hurtle through 'outer space'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Observations of the night sky, the horizon, the sun and the moon: these all make much more sense under a Flat Earth model. Under a ball Earth model, you are left completely confused when faced with physical observations in the real world: you require a heliocentrist expert priest to bring you back into the herd with the approved dogma, which nowadays can be found on wikipedia. You trust NASA over your own lying eyes, and will be forever dependent on experts to define your reality. Society becomes one large

       that isn't interested in and can't focus on anything other than the latest entertaining distraction.

       Humanity is trapped in the age of "the crowned and conquering child", ignorant of its past and present, and unconcerned with its future.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Everywhere his (Horus) government is taking root. Observe for yourselves the decay of the sense of sin, the growth of innocence and irresponsibility, the strange modifications of the reproductive instinct with a tendency to become bi-sexual or epicene, the childlike confidence in progress combined with nightmare fear of catastrophe, against which we are yet half unwilling to take precautions. Consider the popularity of the cinema, the wireless, the football pools and guessing competitions, all devices for soothing fractious infants, no seed of purpose in them. Consider sport, the babyish enthusiasms and rages which it excites, whole nations disturbed by disputes between boys. Consider war, the atrocities which occur daily and leave us unmoved and hardly worried.

       Do you not know what he did for a living? He had the Cosmos show, he was the Neil deGrasse Tyson of the 70's, you think he would be blatant and come out to lose his job. This clip I shared was twofold one to get you lost in the maze of dimensional thinking and two to introduce the idea of aliens, while admitting that we live on a flat plane. The man was a genius, unfortunately wasted on deception.

       I am not religious at all.  I have never been part of any religious organization.  But if someone asks me if God exists my answer is not "no", it is "I don't know", because I don't have conclusive evidence one way or the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't particularly want to be labelled 'flat earther' as it implies a range of shared beliefs with a group of other people (just as people interested in exposing 9-11 have a wide variety of beliefs and many are disinformation agents).  But I am interested in considering available evidence on this topic and there is a lot to consider.
      </p>

       The worldwide power structure is controlled by people who worship lucifer.  This is a separate topic that you should research separately.  For this area it is not about what you or I believe, it is about what they believe.  They actively work towards bringing prophecies to become reality.

       As I said, this is a topic on it's own, and a large one.  If you are interested I suggest researching the history of freemasonry and other secret societies.  Also the symbolism used in mass marketed culture.  They are very big on symbolism.

       The theory is founded off the human five senses, what each of us use from direct experience.  Not what a proven freemasonic cult has claimed they were able to see with rockets that can never leave the atmosphere - because rockets do not thrust in a vacuum nor at high altitude.

       Flat Earth for me is only 3 months old as are most of us flat earthers, we have not been hiding like roaches, we are recent converts. I just had a realization during business travel and then the recent flat earth stuff here had me investigate and hundreds of hours later I am 100% convinced it is a flat earth.

       I am probably the most religious person in this forum, and certainly do not believe the earth is flat.

       Do you believe that the bible is LITERALLY the word of god and should be taken literally?

       You have your established worldview; those you call "flat earthers" simply lack that. So you can have a panoptic belief system or you can be open to the idea that lies are everywhere.

       I am open to lots of ideas, however I have seen many things disproving the flat earth and barely anything credible supporting it

       They need hardware, they need phd engineers, they need vast swathes of people willing to lie and keep secrets. I wonder how the government spends so much money? Hmmm.

       I think it goes far deeper than any of us could even imagine. We know that corporations and the state work together to distribute expensive food and drugs that cause diseases. We know there's an agenda to increase the number and cost of cancer patients. Someone wants people to be sickly and fat. There has to be a plan.
