       Am I the only one who feels that there is a racial and dividing narrative being perpetrated across the United States? Every month there is some racial narrative in the media. There is an attack on the confederate flag which is interesting. Below I provided a link to a Washington Post article about how the Confederacy is alive and well in southern flags. I find it odd to put this article out. If you venture to the article it's the comments that caught my attention. I'm noticing a division which is not racial but a regional division.

       Governments literally create false realities to keep people in conflict. That is so that populations remain fearful of each other and divided and do not unite to overthrow the elites. It is a part of a strategy of tension that has been employed for at least hundreds of years through governments and probably thousands of years through relgions.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not natural for people to hate each other like this. We are manipulated into it. The following is a passage from Howard Zinn's "A People's History..."
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Black and white worked together, fraternized together. The very fact that laws had to be passed after a while to forbid such relations indicates the strength of that tendency. In 1661 a law was passed in Virginia that "in case any English servant shall run away in company of any Negroes" he would have to give special service for extra years to the master of the runaway Negro. In 1691, Virginia provided for the banishment of any "white man or woman being free who shall intermarry with a negro, mulatoo, or Indian man or woman bond or free."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       from another section:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Bacon's Rebellion brought together groups from the lower classes. White frontiersmen started the uprising because they were angry about the way the colony was being run. Then white servants and black slaves joined the rebel­ lion. They were angry, too-mostly about the huge gap between rich and poor in Virginia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The greatest fear of wealthy southern planters was that black slaves and poor whites would combine in another uprising like Bacon's Rebellion. One tool to keep blacks and whites from uniting was racism. Edmund Morgan , a historian of slavery in Virginia , wrote in his American Slavery, American Freedom that racism was not a "natural" feeling about the differ­ences between black and white. Instead, white leaders encouraged a negative view of blacks. If poor whites felt contempt for African Americans, they were less likely to join with them in rebellion.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's the same strategy gone global. And now that we have instant global communication, they can't just lie about it in the newspaper and trick everyone. They have to actually act it out or find patsies to act it out for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it... do you actually have reason to hate anyone? ....or have you only been taught who you should hate? Do you actually know for certain that the individuals in every "terrorist act" are actually who we are told they are? Would the people have actually had the motivation or resources to commit an act of terror or were they only able to do it because a government agency enabled it?
      </p>
      <p>
       These are all legitimate questions.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Daniele Ganser, professor of contemporary history at Basel University (Switzerland) and chairman or the ASPO - Switzerland, published a landmark book about "NATO's Secret Armies." According to him, during the last 50 years the United States have organized bombings in Western Europe that they have falsely attributed to the left and the extreme left with the purpose of discrediting them in the eyes of their voters. This strategy is still present today, inspiring fear for the Islam and justifying wars on oil.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Tufts Professor, Michael Glennon, even explains this in his book "National Security and Double Government". The TL;DR is basically that you don't have any choice or right to self-determination anymore because anything can be justified in the name of "national security".

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        National security policy in the United States has remained largely constant from the Bush Administration to the Obama Administration. This continuity can be explained by the “double government” theory of 19th-century scholar of the English Constitution Walter Bagehot. As applied to the United States, Bagehot’s theory suggests that U.S. national security policy is defined by the network of executive officials who manage the departments and agencies responsible for protecting U.S. national security and who, responding to structural incentives embedded in the U.S. political system, operate largely removed from public view and from constitutional constraints. The public believes that the constitutionally-established institutions control national security policy, but that view is mistaken. Judicial review is negligible; congressional oversight is dysfunctional; and presidential control is nominal.
       </p>

       So you saw that video off the Charlie Hebdo thing, right? Here is what I saw. I'm no expert, but I have been putting in a lot of time into reading and learning how these operations work:
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw a couple of professionals work smoothly and cleanly. They had a very well-planned out attack and made a nice escape. It certainly did not look like a couple of guys who have never seen action and suddenly self-radicalized. Even if you have trained, unless you have seen a lot of action and can control yourself, then you are going to be panicked and scattered. Those guys were smooth and in control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only that, but the big tip-off to me was the leaving behind of the ID cards. This always conveniently happens. Oswald's wallet, James Earl Ray's "bundle of evidence", and even the passports that miraculously showed up at 9/11. It's a common tactic because it works so well on the general population and spin control through their agents in the media can discredit those who point out the absurdity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now what happened the next day?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, a couple of guys took some hostages in a bakery or something. This is where those agents who try to find people willing to become radicals come in. If you had to make something like this happen, what do you do? You probably show them that you can get them money and weapons. You probably use your knowledge of other fake acts by other agents to show them that you are connected to the terrorists. Then you tell them, "The signal is coming. There will be an attack today, then muslims like us everywhere across Europe will stage a coordinated attack. Your mission will be to hold hostages in this bakery!" Then they see the attack happen and believe that it is real. These aren't ever really bright people to begin with so they never figure out they are being set up. The reality is those poor patsies would have probably never had a vector to do anything at all if these agencies had never enabled them. Do you think they got those guns by themselves?
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously... this is how those types of things operate. You have to create an illusion like a magician. If you go and look at those JTRIG slides, that's exactly what they talk about. These guys love to compare themselves to magicians that create false realities. Examples here:

        https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/02/24/art-deception-training-new-generation-online-covert-operations/

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it sounds like madness, but we have some really famous quotes to back it up:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        William Casey, CIA Director 1981-1987: “We’ll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The aide said that guys like me were "in what we call the reality-based community," which he defined as people who "believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality." ... "That's not the way the world really works anymore," he continued. "We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you're studying that reality—judiciously, as you will—we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors ... and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do." —Unnamed White House aide[1] The quote is now widely attributed to Karl Rove
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is what Karl Rove meant by "we are history's actor's". They are literally creating a reality of their own choosing (that of course serves themselves) for the masses to move them to the actions that they want them to.

       Yep.  People need to learn to be able to prioritize evidence that is presented to them.  They must learn to separate what evidence can be fabricated and what evidence can not.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, when a reporter says "an anonymous state department official confirms", then you can almost 100% count it as bullshit.

       It's apparent as soon as you notice how fast the Charleston Event was labeled a hate crime. There's a narrative, and it's the media's job to spin spin spin and do what they're told.

       The pastor/State Senator Clementa Pinckney was kind of a

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Pinckney introduced a now controversial Senate reapportionment bill (S.1284) similar to Hodges’ that quietly passed both the House and Senate last month and was signed into law by Governor Haley on May 16.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pinckney’s reapportionment led to two current school board members, P.A. Pournelle (District 3) and William Bowman (District 7) being rezoned into neighboring districts, forcing them out of their seats and creating the need for several special elections, meanwhile potentially preventing board member Paul Haase (District 4) from seeking reelection.

       ...from last June. But no, it was a hate crime. Because if some photoshopped pictures, and a 100mB manifesto from a website registered from a Russian domain server and never went down (should have had multiple reddit-level-hug-of-deaths) as well as a website that has no archive.org data at all.

       I didn't say it did - per se - but you can imagine the demand for access to this kind of site after this kind of Event - and considering it was just a personal website registered

       <a href="http://privacyprotect.org/acceptable-usage-policy/">

       . Why go through all the trouble to jump through a few sites (and probably use a VPN to go through Russia) for a website like that? It's a shitty website anyway. I made better ones in '97.

Surely a manifesto and pictures of a dude who just killed 9 people would generate the kind of traffic resembling a reddit hug-of-death, eh? But no, this little shitty website registered via a Privacy Protection service in Austrailia, through a Russian domain registrant, never goes down. Impressive.

       First of all, yes, race war is being promoted in America. In fact, leftist progressive hero George Soros - a main lefty Democrat fundraiser - is actually paying fake protestors to "protest police brutality."

      <p>
       But second, and perhaps more importantly, all this nonsense about "coming together" and not "being divided" - it sounds like something your high school coach would say after losing a home game.

      <p>
       Here, in the real, adult world, the races have NEVER been "united" nor are they ever going to be "united" - that sort of "unity" is completely artificial. The elites do not do things to "divide us" - quite the opposite, they use all sorts of techniques to try to "unite us" around whatever product they are selling or legislation they want to pass.

       Actually both extremes are used for their ends. They divide us against each other so that we don't stand up for our mutual, working class self-interests. As we fight each other over the color of our skin, we appear out of control. They constrict our time and feed us deceptions that make us fear each other. They sell us that terrorist are out to get us. Then they sell us a fascist unity to ameliorate the problems, real and illusory, that they created.

       Binary thinking is how we are controlled by the apparent extremes. Do you or do you not think that there are common working class economic interests? Do you or do you not think that the owning class also has common economic interests?
      </p>
      <p>
       Businesses make profits for their owners. Profits are what is left of revenues after all expenses are paid. Wages and benefits are expenses. The working class wants higher wages and benefits. The owning class wants higher profits. Do you understand that profits are competing with wages and benefits over revenues in excess of other expenses?
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not selling dictatorship. The fear of communism and socialism, somewhat engineered by the owning class, to protect their economic self-interests, keeps people from considering universal health care and makes people take for granted social security, disability, unemployment insurance and other socialist programs that help keep people from going homeless.

       The only way your Marxism works is if you define "class" according to financial capital at some point in time. Your Marxism falls apart when you start adding anything but financial capital (social, cultural, etc.) into the mix.

      <p>
       Now, thank you for that Econ 101 lesson, but please, spare me the "fear of communism and socialism" crap - I left college a long, long time ago. The reason people aren't interested in your Communist utopia world is because history shows us that:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) It's all hot air from people trying to push some new politicians (Bernie Sanders, one assumes.)
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Any time actual Communists get into power, the first thing they do is start building gulags and a police state.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know what my economic interests are, thank you very much, and the reason you fail so miserably at selling your communism to the "working class" is because they are not as stupid as you think they are.

You don't argue with integrity, you attack someone with words like communism and gulags and deliberately ignore the details they attempt to discuss with you.  It's not typical of people on

       I'm called communist and said to want some kind of dictatorship for pointing out that workers want more pay and better insurance, that owners want to earn more profits, and that those two interests inherently, mathematically compete with each other, and I am the one being accused of ad hominem?  Wow.  Then you do even more ad hominem, saying I am calling everyone who disagrees with me conservative or afraid?  Wow.  I pointed out
       <a href="/r/conservative">

       are doing, perhaps in the hope that I wouldn't use it to describe you.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        An ad hominem (Latin for "to the man" or "to the person"[1]), short for argumentum ad hominem, means responding to arguments by attacking a person's character, rather than to the content of their arguments. When used inappropriately, it is a fallacy in which a claim or argument is dismissed on the basis of some irrelevant fact or supposition about the author or the person being criticized.

       I feel you are a little biased on the subject, considering you believe that multiculturalism is a Jewish plot to weaken the white race, and that black people are subhuman.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, it couldn't be farther from the truth, and in multiple societies many races populated it with little to no regard of what we consider races nowadays.

       I think TPTB went with the "race war" in a shadowy meeting about 30 years ago...  Since then we've become significantly more "race-less" out here in the middle class and TPTB either haven't noticed or were unable to change their threat "vector" in the middle of an operation.  Either way... race war isn't going to fly.  I blame Apple-Bottom jeans.

He told the devil, "I can assume what almost all of these items are for but I can't seem to see how that wedge is of any use." The devil grinned and replied, "Ah, that.
