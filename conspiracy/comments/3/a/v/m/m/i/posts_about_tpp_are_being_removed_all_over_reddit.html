    <div class="md"><p>I remember reading about some questionable aspects of minds.com in a thread somewhere, such that their motives may be more insidious than they appear. Unfortunately I can&#39;t find the thread right now. I could be wrong, but from what I did read, I was convinced to switch to diaspora instead, as it&#39;s not hosted in a single location, but rather some of its users in various locations around the world. Just my two cents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the first thing they did was snap up all our usernames. I&#39;m not sure if you noticed, but I reported it and got mine back. Many others did as well. Then bipolartard tried to grab up mod positions all over there and once it came up I&#39;m pretty sure I remember the admins got rid of that cancer too. </p>

<p>Not being a big complicated business yet, the admins have a lot more agility. And being that voat was born out of mod conspiracy, they are particularly sensitive to the problem.  Maybe not perfect, but progress. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Politics is not news?!?!? Holy fuck. That is something that actually applies to people&#39;s real lives and voting patterns. I can understand now allowing reporting from someone&#39;s blog. But to reject hopefully neutral reporting from mainstream news organizations is insane.</p>

<p>I avoided subs like <a href="/r/poltics">/r/poltics</a> because you just can&#39;t have a decent discussion in there and it is so slanted. You need news reporting to get facts with as minimal slant as possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We all know that there is massive censorship on Reddit&#39;s main boards.</p>

<p>This got immediately censored as &quot;US internal news&quot; because it is strongly critical of the trade deals, Congress and Obama, with good evidence http:/np.reddit.com<a href="/r/worldnews/comments/3auijt/corporations_win_again_senate_passes_obamatrade/">/r/worldnews/comments/3auijt/corporations_win_again_senate_passes_obamatrade/</a></p>

<p>While this on exactly the same subject from CNN, gushing that the Senate vote was a &quot;victory&quot; sailed through until the mods realized the top comment demolished these &quot;trade&quot; deals as a total disaster (this was shortly after the comment had been awarded some gold) <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3auskk/senate_passes_tpa_tpp_is_now_fast_tracked/csg795k?sort=top&amp;amp;context=3">http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3auskk/senate_passes_tpa_tpp_is_now_fast_tracked/csg795k?sort=top&amp;amp;context=3</a></p>

<p>The mods on the main boards really couldn&#39;t be any more obvious that they act as propaganda agents for Establishment / Corporate interests and act directly against the interests of their audience on Reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2015/5/27/julian_assange_on_the_trans_pacific">This interview with the founder of WikiLeaks is very important and does a great job of explaining it</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.greenleft.org.au/node/59292">This article explains the recent leaks that specify how TPP will  strengthen pharmaceutical monopolies</a></p>

<p>Essentially, TPP gives a ton of control to corporations. It worsens behavior that violates antitrust policy, expands spying, limits peer to peer sharing online, and way more that we don&#39;t know about.</p>

<p>Because it&#39;s written as a &quot;treaty&quot;, it will be extremely difficult, if not impossible to get rid of because it takes the cooperation of all nations involved. Basically it&#39;s just a huge display of how money is poisoning politics.</p>

<p>Taken from eff.org:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What Is the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP)?</p>

<p>The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a secretive, multinational trade agreement that threatens to extend restrictive intellectual property (IP) laws across the globe and rewrite international rules on its enforcement. The main problems are two-fold:</p>

<p>(1) Intellectual Property Chapter: Leaked draft texts of the agreement show that the IP chapter would have extensive negative ramifications for users’ freedom of speech, right to privacy and due process, and hinder peoples&#39; abilities to innovate.</p>

<p>(2) Lack of Transparency: The entire process has shut out multi-stakeholder participation and is shrouded in secrecy.</p>

<p>The twelve nations currently negotiating the TPP are the US, Japan, Australia, Peru, Malaysia, Vietnam, New Zealand, Chile, Singapore, Canada, Mexico, and Brunei Darussalam. The TPP contains a chapter on intellectual property covering copyright, trademarks, and patents. Since the draft text of the agreement has never been officially released to the public, we know from leaked documents, such as the May 2014 draft of the TPP Intellectual Property Chapter [PDF], that US negotiators are pushing for the adoption of copyright measures far more restrictive than currently required by international treaties, including the controversial Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I realize TPP is big news, but as has been discussed frequently on this sub many people just don&#39;t care about politics. I don&#39;t think it is that far a leap to assume that maybe the TPP posts have just not been upvoted enough to be on the front page of <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>. So excuse my horrendous act of wanting some decently solid evidence before believing something that someone posts. I realize i did minimal research on my own, but that was on purpose because i know for a fact, like many have pointed out, that <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> exists and i could have gone there, but many other people are too lazy or uninformed to do things like that, so if the OP took the time to provide sources this post could have a much more positive impact. And for future reference, ad hominin attacks are the lowest form of discussion so you might want to rethink that argument that i am a shill and moron, because those are opinionated fact less attacks that have a tint of irony because you assumed that my comment was a &quot;shill&quot; or in other words a politically biased and <strong>opinionated</strong> thought, much like you just expressed :)</p>

<p>Yeah. It sounds totally made up to me. I&#39;ve noticed a pattern: A sure way to get a lot of upvotes is to claim something is being systematically deleted or that you have had an account banned. That plays into the mindset of so many people that even without any evidence at all it&#39;s a guaranteed way to get upvotes.</p>

<p>People really should read up on confirmation bias. Just because a story fits perfectly into your world view doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s true. And people will take advantage of those who are too willing to believe anything that confirms their biases.</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>I agree that conformation bias plays a huge part in this sub&#39;s mentality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really I think it plays a big part in all politically-oriented subs. Conservative, libertarian, liberal, socialist. Noam Chomsky - who many here hate, and many here love - first made me aware of this problem: When we make accusations about our enemies, no one asks for evidence. And if anyone <em>does</em> dare to ask for evidence, they are attacked as subversives. And on the other hand, any accusation directed at our own side is met with demands for extensive, elaborate evidence. </p>

<p>Chomsky was talking specifically about the Cold War: Back then you could say <em>anything</em> about the Soviet Union and get away with it. Entire careers were built writing books filled with lies about the Soviets, and you could get away with it because no one wanted to appear to be sticking up for the Soviets. </p>

<p>On the other side, if anyone ever dared to criticize the US government they were first called a traitor and then would be asked to provide detailed proof of every claim. And you could never produce enough evidence to satisfy them.</p>

<p>The same happened in 2002 and 2003 when Bush was marching the country to war. The claims about WMD were obviously bullshit. But those who asked for evidence were said to be defending Saddam Hussein. We ended up making a disaster out of Iraq in part because dissent was not allowed. </p>

<p>This is how confirmation bias works, in a nutshell. In <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> it plays out like this: Reddit is considered the enemy, and it is considered to be beyond dispute that Reddit is actively engaged in an effort to repress freedom and help &quot;TPTB&quot; to impose totalitarianism.</p>

<p>People who believe this are desperate for <em>anything</em> that reinforces this theory. So they welcome threads like this one without question.</p>

<p>Right now you could click that &quot;Submit a New Link&quot; button and start a thread about how you&#39;re being repressed by Reddit, and if you make up a half-way believable story, you&#39;ll have 450 upvotes in 2 hours. (OP didn&#39;t even try to make up a believable story; it&#39;s shitpost that took no effort and he already made it to the front page.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Knowing about it is half the work to stopping it after all so if they did read up on it we might have more critical thought</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Amen!  And that&#39;s what we need. This is an important sub and one of the very few places people have the courage to speak out about a lot of hugely important subjects. But a lot of it is lost in a cloud of poorly sourced claims and authoritarian bullying of anyone who wants the evidence necessary to construct a sound argument. If we are going to change the world, we can&#39;t do it without solid arguments based in fact.</p>

It would not be unrealistic to think this story is also being censored.  In reality I would rather this post turn into a discussion about the TPP and censorship than read a bunch of posts insulting the sub and its users.  By far most of the posts here at least attempt to prove what they are presenting, and sometimes it&#39;s speculation that turns out to be wrong, but that&#39;s ok and is what r/conspiracy is for.  Many conspiracies are hard to prove but can be seen only by linking a number of anomalies together.  If this isn&#39;t good enough for you and you need hard evidence before you can entertain a thought than maybe this isn&#39;t the sub for you.</p>

It&#39;s naive to think that certain entities would not want to attempt to control the discussion on a site with millions of users.  You asked for the documentation, there it is. Some posts may be because of duplicates, (although there have been cases where that is used as the excuse but in fact there was no duplicate, or using the duplicate posts to ban each other until they are all banned), but to deny that censorship is present at all is just disingenuous and an outright lie.</p>

<p>Who said that? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s naive to think that certain entities would not want to attempt to control the discussion on a site with millions of users. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree. But saying that &quot;certain entities&quot; would like to control the discussion is not the same as saying that those entities <em>are</em> controlling the discussion. You need more than mere motive. Certain entities would like to empty all the money out of the bank, too. But that doesn&#39;t prove they are bank robbers. If you&#39;re going to allege a specific act, you need evidence of a specific act. Not merely motive. </p>

<p>If you want to speculate, go for it. But remember: You said it is &quot;well documented.&quot; <a href="/r/Undelete">/r/Undelete</a> is not that documentation. It merely shows threads that have been deleted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>to deny that censorship is present at all</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not denying that at all. What you call &quot;censorship&quot; is clearly present. But you have yet to produce evidence that the censorship is being done systematically by or on behalf of &quot;the establishment&quot; across all of reddit, as you seem to be suggesting. There are mods who delete stuff for perfectly legitimate reasons. Threads that violate the sub&#39;s rules, for example. There are also politically motivated mods who repress opinions they don&#39;t like; this is a human failing and happens across ideologies and many subs. But normal people can sign up for reddit, and normal people can become mods. Some of those people will abuse that power to delete opinions they don&#39;t like. But that doesn&#39;t even come close to proving &quot;the establishment&quot; is deleting TPP stories across Reddit.</p>

<p>In reality I would rather this post turn into a discussion about the TPP and censorship than read a bunch of posts insulting the sub and its users.</p>

<p>Me too. Let&#39;s start by not giving them any ammunition to attack us or the sub. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>sometimes it&#39;s speculation that turns out to be wrong, but that&#39;s ok</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree entirely. A lot of ideas would never get discussed or explored at all if we required a super high degree of evidence before even starting a discussion.</p>

<p>But far too often people mask their speculation as cold statements of fact. You can&#39;t do that and retain credibility. If you are speculating, say so. Don&#39;t declare your theory to be a fact unless you know it is a fact.</p>

I think we have to expect this going forward, especially with government imposed net neutrality and that ruling that website are held liable for user comments. They&#39;re going to slowly impose censorship and we&#39;ll never see any headline about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The senate will give Obama fast track authority.  The powers that be are likely intentionally inciting a race war to blind people to it, and they are already all talking about taking away gun access.  oh yeah....and gays get to marry this week (paint targets onto themselves for the people mad about the religious zealots that will set themselves on fire?)  It really looks like an intentionally brewed perfect storm.   </p>

<p>Is it time for an American strike?  Seems a peaceful, yet forceful message.  The only voice that matters these days seems to be that of the 1%.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are not certain that those voting don&#39;t know the dynamics. We are in political season and politics are being played .</p>

<p>We live in a representative democracy and the rules have been public for almost 250 years. If you don&#39;t trust the representatives then why did you do nothing but wait until now to complain on reddit ?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t trust your representative ? Then you can legally organize to have him removed or you can organize a campaign for a new representative in the next election . If our reps are so bad then you should have used your legal rights to prevent them from being elected in the previous election .</p>

<p>And I believe the dynamics will be revealed for 60 days and our reps have the right to vote ya or na. If you don&#39;t like the rules then exercise your rights accordingly .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You presented no argument and instead you gave me a series of links . I am reading through them now but your argument is still weak and you are not advancing your position .Most of these articles are bloated with complaining words  and present no real argument either.</p>

<p>Now how does this deal hurt democracy ? Are you allowed to vote in the next election ? Can you still register to be a lobbyist and open your own PAC for free across the country ? Does the judicial branch and court systems still exist ? Does Congress still have ultimate leverage ? The answer to all these questions are yes and so democracy still exists .</p>

<p>It seems most of the links you sent me complain about a new arbitration system for corporations who cross borders . How does this affect democracy ? If you don&#39;t like a corporation then don&#39;t use its services . Don&#39;t want Big Pharma? Then don&#39;t go to the doctor ? Don&#39;t like big banks ? Then use a local credit union or Bitcoin . Don&#39;t like surveillance ? Then stop using the private services of phone makers and telecoms . Don&#39;t like food in the supermarket ? Then grow your own with the tools for sale in Wal Mart. Don&#39;t like copyright infringement rules ? Then look for free content or better yet create your own content !! I&#39;ve never seen a corporation force anyone to use their service and as long as this is the case then our political system is still in tact . Have you ever tried bringing a corporation to court in the current system ? Good luck and you will get NOWHERE!</p>

<p>And finally ...we don&#39;t have a absolute democracy . We have a representative democracy . These are 2 different systems and the politicians and lobbyists are playing by the very transparent rules set in place .</p>

<p>Where is your counter argument ?</p>
