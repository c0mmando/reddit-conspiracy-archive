    <div class="md"><p>I know a lot of OTO and Masons. The lower ranks are just dudes. As in all things the higher you go the more corrupt and the less like the spirit of the organization. For me it&#39;s not about the Masons or whatever; it&#39;s about psychopaths abusing whatever system they can to gain power - in this case it&#39;s government and corporations. If we lived under a different system the same psychopaths would simply try to abuse that other system. The systems are irrelevant. It&#39;s the people controlling the systems. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a psychological issue - not an ideological one.</p>

<p>Frankly I don&#39;t care anymore.</p>

<p>I&#39;m more interested in breaking free from these people than analyzing and speculating about esoteric and hidden motives. At the end of the day it&#39;s more important to be free from these freaks than to understand them. I&#39;m still interested in &quot;understanding my enemy&quot;, mind you - it&#39;s just that my priorities and focus have shifted. I&#39;m interested in solutions now.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care.</p>

<p>Telling them to fuck off is more effective than &quot;studying their ways.&quot;</p>

<p>In the end you have no choice but to say &#39;no&#39; and then do something about it.</p>

<p>Or we can all read their books and keep obeying them.</p>
