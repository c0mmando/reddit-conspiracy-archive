       Jordan Maxwell is a seething douche. Once you realize that his bullshit word play has no connection to etymology or philology he becomes a combination of laughable and pathetic.

       I know a lot of OTO and Masons. The lower ranks are just dudes. As in all things the higher you go the more corrupt and the less like the spirit of the organization. For me it's not about the Masons or whatever; it's about psychopaths abusing whatever system they can to gain power - in this case it's government and corporations. If we lived under a different system the same psychopaths would simply try to abuse that other system. The systems are irrelevant. It's the people controlling the systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a psychological issue - not an ideological one.

       I agree with you that they could use nearly any different system to achieve their goals.. but from what I have seen it's about more than them just being psychopaths or opportunists. At the very top there is some agenda or ideology that has driven this group for a very very long time.

       There's more to it though.. the surface stuff is not their ideology. But dig deep and you will see indications of it.

       I'm aware of the speculations regarding high weirdness.

      <p>
       Frankly I don't care anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm more interested in breaking free from these people than analyzing and speculating about esoteric and hidden motives. At the end of the day it's more important to be free from these freaks than to understand them. I'm still interested in "understanding my enemy", mind you - it's just that my priorities and focus have shifted. I'm interested in solutions now.

       It's not really secret information. Look hard enough and it's available to anyone. Just start reading ancient mythology. Start with Joseph Campbell.

       Again, if you're still obeying these people it doesn't matter if you know their stupid handshakes. You have to start saying 'no' to them and you have to do something about it.

       If you want insider info into freemasonry check out the writings of Albert Pike.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was the most highly decorated free mason involved in the craft.
      </p>
      <p>
       He didn't leave freemasonry and then started writing  about their secrets, no, he wrote about freemasonry while he was still a mason.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was a confederate general and he has his own statue in D.C.
      </p>
      <p>
       His writings left nothing out. You wanna read about what goes on,  read from him.

       Great call! I have watched some of his videos and he has some of the most accurate info I have seen. Info no one else I have encountered has had. But he was still missing or withholding some from what I have found.

       How did he describe Lucifer? Did he put Lucifer before god? Because even freemasons today will say they worship lucifer - but that it's symbolic of learning or something to that effect not that it's anti-god.

       I have seen indications that the highest level is satanic.. but I am unsure if this is disinformation or not. I suspect they might be anti-religion and consider themselves "realists."

       A few of my elderly relatives are Freemasons.  Their wives are members of Eastern Star.  (Their adult children did not want to join).  They raise a lot of money for hospitals to help poor children.  Their numbers are dwindling because younger people are less likely to join.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I have met a couple of younger Freemasons who are quite amused by the theory they are trying to dominate the world.

       Yeah.. I find this funny. It's not the lower people who are involved though. It boggles the mind how they cannot understand this simple concept. It's why they are easily controlled.

       Most of them are only navel gazers, luckily there are still some lodges involved in charities and social works.

       Masonry has lost much of the power it once had. Today as am group there is a lot of cronyism, there power is far from what it was a century ago.

       That's a good point. But the important thing to me is how if you back track through the history of Freemasonry you will see the signs of the real power structure that exists.
