<p>edit: later note: sorry, not the vid i was looking for. it&#39;s good, no doubt, but i watched something that though rude as i&#39;ve ever been presented evidence, was also the best facts prensentation i ever saw on the matter. About a day or now 2 ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a bit funny that most of the respondents to this post so far missed the point that the OP was looking for a debunk video, not a video promoting flat earth.</p>

<p>For those who think it is disinfo, are you sure?  Have you actually looked?  Do you reject it because you have considered the arguments and found them to be lacking, or because if it were true it would alter your world view by too much?  </p>

<p>It feels safe to throw stones from the majority position, but that doesn&#39;t mean it is correct.  In some other forums you would have the same dynamic with other topics.  ie the majority comfortably bashing anyone who questioned the official narrative on 9/11.  Don&#39;t allow your beliefs on anything to be dictated by the weighted average of the opinions you are exposed to.  That just makes you a sheep in a different pasture.  You must trust your own logic and reasoning if you want to know the truth about a subject.</p>

<p>Most of his evidence is based on the use of fish eye lenses, such as  the kind that are on go-pro camera&#39;s for instance. He thinks the earth is flat but has no edge. Nuff said.</p>

Ideas should be judged on their merits.  How can you have reached a conclusion on the topic after only having considered a single person&#39;s viewpoint on it?  Do you know that the &quot;Flat Earth Society&quot; is a freemason run organization that exists solely to discredit the theory?  </p>

<p>From your statement it is clear that you haven&#39;t looked into this topic.  It requires at least 10 hours to even get the basic points.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>fish eye lenses</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you saying fish eye lenses are not available?  How is analyzing video footage to determine the type of lens used not valid?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>thinks the earth is flat but has no edge</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is that a problem?  The standard flat earth model has Antarctica as a ring around us with no knowledge of what is too far past the edge of that ring.  You assume that there must be an &quot;edge&quot;, but what if it is an infinite flat plane? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nuff said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If that&#39;s all it takes for you, then you will only ever know what someone else wants you to think.  Give yourself more credit than that.  One of the most important things while investigating conspiracy theories is to cultivate your ability to reason.  In order to do that you have to actually consider the evidence.  It appears that you have rejected this idea after only the most cursory examination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have looked at the sky at night, I have been in a plane many times.  I suggest you actually research this yourself.  It&#39;s not a joke.  Of course it seems outlandish at the outset, but set aside your disbelief and consider the arguments.  </p>

<p>If you believe that man has been to the moon, then you should start with researching NASA first.  It is very difficult to consider flat earth until you realize that NASA is a complete fraud. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is the Earth flat?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not 100% sure.  I am sure that the standard spinning globe model that we have been given does not work.  Proving another model completely correct is much harder.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does it have an edge that no one has ever seen?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Public knowledge is not the same as all knowledge.  Likely there are some people who absolutely know the true nature of our world.  For example those who control militaries.  I don&#39;t have any way to verify this myself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are all of the space based pictures of the earth fake?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Almost all, yes.  I think there are a couple that are taken in such a way to deceive, ie through a round window.  NASA themselves admit they make composite photos.</p>

<p>Because our model doesn&#39;t fit into someone else&#39;s model of the solar system doesn&#39;t mean that their outlook is right. It&#39;s the same with science.. Like alot of the elites everything is on a &quot; need to know basis&quot; </p>

I know there are those here that kick it in news and politics. infact, after hearing a day of ban bitching, I straight up asked, &quot;why go then?&quot; and they straight said, &quot;Because someone has to speak the truth.&quot; and that makes sense.

<p>Got any evidence?</p>

<p>What&#39;s telling is that you don&#39;t think you&#39;ve made your point without name calling . You make accusations that more fit yourself than those you accuse and when challenged to support you own position you find it better and easier to call names and change the subject..</p>

<p>You claim to get angry/mad and do this and that  about it. That&#39;s not good. That&#39;s the kind of folks that end up in prison.Maybe you should reconsider.</p>

<p>edit, I can tell you haven&#39;t read this yet  because you haven&#39;t downvoted it.</p>

<p>Look inward.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Putin vanishes for a week. Everything from the powers that be killed him to a clone replaces. I calmly inform everyone it&#39;s okay, Putin is fine, and in the Ukraine talkin with the troops. At the end of the week, the news reports Putin returns to the world stage after visiting the troops in the Ukraine. Got any evidence you&#39;re not here to derail, and defame and accuse. tl;dr the rest. You&#39;re a used maxie pad, just a bloody mess that has no use left.</p>

<p>edit: You&#39;re also the worst, and I called the russians using the moon landing as something to stir up shit 30 days in advance as well. That&#39;s 2 up, 0 down, and still wondering to myself, why am i talking to a clown? So everyone else can see, you&#39;re fake. A paid shill of monsanto cause I dared to speak ill. You guys have been non-stop since that post. Die in hell fire. </p>

<p>Dude, why would OP bother answering your questions if you completely ignored his. Honestly you&#39;re a fucking moron, just read OP&#39;s post. He&#39;s looking for a vid DISCREDITING flat earth. OP doesn&#39;t think the earth is flat idk how you even got that. You&#39;re the only one posting flat earth bullshit... the answer to all your question is obviously no.</p>

<p>If you believe that man has been to the moon, then you should start with researching NASA first.  It is very difficult to consider flat earth until you realize that NASA is a complete fraud. </p>
