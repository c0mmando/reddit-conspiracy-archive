I wanna show it to her. Oh, and dv, cause i asked something, that's aways the typical..

       nope, but i'mma check em out right now to see if they got the same solid comfirm that it's not flat.

       edit: later note: sorry, not the vid i was looking for. it's good, no doubt, but i watched something that though rude as i've ever been presented evidence, was also the best facts prensentation i ever saw on the matter. About a day or now 2 ago.

       It's a bit funny that most of the respondents to this post so far missed the point that the OP was looking for a debunk video, not a video promoting flat earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those who think it is disinfo, are you sure?  Have you actually looked?  Do you reject it because you have considered the arguments and found them to be lacking, or because if it were true it would alter your world view by too much?
      </p>
      <p>
       It feels safe to throw stones from the majority position, but that doesn't mean it is correct.  In some other forums you would have the same dynamic with other topics.  ie the majority comfortably bashing anyone who questioned the official narrative on 9/11.  Don't allow your beliefs on anything to be dictated by the weighted average of the opinions you are exposed to.  That just makes you a sheep in a different pasture.  You must trust your own logic and reasoning if you want to know the truth about a subject.

       Most of his evidence is based on the use of fish eye lenses, such as  the kind that are on go-pro camera's for instance. He thinks the earth is flat but has no edge. Nuff said.

       "his", "he"  who are you referring to?  No person represents the idea.  No person is the absolute authority on anything.  Ideas should be judged on their merits.  How can you have reached a conclusion on the topic after only having considered a single person's viewpoint on it?  Do you know that the "Flat Earth Society" is a freemason run organization that exists solely to discredit the theory?
      </p>
      <p>
       From your statement it is clear that you haven't looked into this topic.  It requires at least 10 hours to even get the basic points.

       Are you saying fish eye lenses are not available?  How is analyzing video footage to determine the type of lens used not valid?

       Why is that a problem?  The standard flat earth model has Antarctica as a ring around us with no knowledge of what is too far past the edge of that ring.  You assume that there must be an "edge", but what if it is an infinite flat plane?

       If that's all it takes for you, then you will only ever know what someone else wants you to think.  Give yourself more credit than that.  One of the most important things while investigating conspiracy theories is to cultivate your ability to reason.  In order to do that you have to actually consider the evidence.  It appears that you have rejected this idea after only the most cursory examination.

       Do you seriously think the Earth is flat? Not the Greeks, Columbus, or Queen Isabella even did. But now in 2015 you've somehow convinced yourself that its is? Have you ever been on plane? Have you ever looked at the sky at night??

       I have looked at the sky at night, I have been in a plane many times.  I suggest you actually research this yourself.  It's not a joke.  Of course it seems outlandish at the outset, but set aside your disbelief and consider the arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe that man has been to the moon, then you should start with researching NASA first.  It is very difficult to consider flat earth until you realize that NASA is a complete fraud.

       Don't take any individual as the leader or person with all the answers on the subject.  There is an enormous amount of information out there.  If you dismiss it after 10 minutes you do yourself a disservice. Also, don't dismiss someone the instant you hear them mention something religious.  Feel free to ignore any arguments based on scripture and focus on physical, empirical evidence.

       I am not 100% sure.  I am sure that the standard spinning globe model that we have been given does not work.  Proving another model completely correct is much harder.

       Public knowledge is not the same as all knowledge.  Likely there are some people who absolutely know the true nature of our world.  For example those who control militaries.  I don't have any way to verify this myself.

       Almost all, yes.  I think there are a couple that are taken in such a way to deceive, ie through a round window.  NASA themselves admit they make composite photos.

       If you don't know if the earth is flat maybe you shouldn't poison this sub by making it appear that we believe in something so unsupportable that even it's believers can't support it. It's like saying we support segragation without a bit of evidence . It's disinformation that is meant to do us harm.

       Exactly man. Can't tell you how much I hate people here who go on about free speech and it being one of the main reasons why the world is fuc*ed, then on the other hand jump down your throat with shit like.. "No flat earth conspiracy please".. All I can say with that sort of demeanour no wonder folk like me and you find it difficult to truly express our own thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because our model doesn't fit into someone else's model of the solar system doesn't mean that their outlook is right. It's the same with science.. Like alot of the elites everything is on a " need to know basis"

       because i don't believe in segragation, the same way some of you still kick it in news and politics though obviously not welcome. have you seen how they treat me? I'm a fucking science experiment to them you conspiratard. How can a loon like me be so accurate while dipships like you get the most upvote play still? That's the mystery the professors are trying to solve. Only reason Bob tolerates me and lets me even call out his alts. Now die you freaky alien genotype, in the pits of hell. =)

       here's a comment to downvote? what dumbassery is this? I know there are those here that kick it in news and politics. infact, after hearing a day of ban bitching, I straight up asked, "why go then?" and they straight said, "Because someone has to speak the truth." and that makes sense.

       What's telling is that you don't think you've made your point without name calling . You make accusations that more fit yourself than those you accuse and when challenged to support you own position you find it better and easier to call names and change the subject..

       Putin vanishes for a week. Everything from the powers that be killed him to a clone replaces. I calmly inform everyone it's okay, Putin is fine, and in the Ukraine talkin with the troops. At the end of the week, the news reports Putin returns to the world stage after visiting the troops in the Ukraine. Got any evidence you're not here to derail, and defame and accuse. tl;dr the rest. You're a used maxie pad, just a bloody mess that has no use left.

       The topic is the flat earth post.

      <p>
       Neither OP  nor any but one commenter could or would address his topic but he  has given our opposition on a sub dedicated to discrediting this sub  tips on how to fool us   and is discrediting this sub while not even OP can post any kind of answer to the on topic questions that I posed
      </p>
      <p>
       Is the Earth flat?
      </p>
      <p>
       If so, does it have an edge ?
      </p>
      <p>
       If so has anyone ever seen it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are all of the  space based photo's of Earth  fake?
      </p>

       Dude, why would OP bother answering your questions if you completely ignored his. Honestly you're a fucking moron, just read OP's post. He's looking for a vid DISCREDITING flat earth. OP doesn't think the earth is flat idk how you even got that. You're the only one posting flat earth bullshit... the answer to all your question is obviously no.

       He's the OP of flat earth posts on conspiracy and was just trying to bring up that topic while such subs as
       <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">
        /r/topmindsofreddit
       </a>
       which he is a member of, just crows about how
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       believes in the topic the he himself introduces.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a set up in my opinion which  he is central to.

       I have looked at the sky at night, I have been in a plane many times.  I suggest you actually research this yourself.  It's not a joke.  Of course it seems outlandish at the outset, but set aside your disbelief and consider the arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe that man has been to the moon, then you should start with researching NASA first.  It is very difficult to consider flat earth until you realize that NASA is a complete fraud.
