<blockquote>
<p>On Wednesday evening, a brutal massacre was perpetrated against nine black Americans, including several clergy and a State Senator, who were attending a Christian education class at a historic church in Charleston, South Carolina. </p>

<p>A suspect, Dylann Roof, now in custody, is a white male who was allegedly being prescribed antidepressants and was found in possession of weapons.</p>

<p>The mainstream and pseudo-alternative media have predictably gone into overdrive, pushing the story into whichever direction suits their single-issue agendas: pro- or anti-Second Amendment rights, the dangers of psychotropic pharmaceuticals, and the threat of domestic or “homegrown” terrorism. </p>

<p>Instead, this can be seen as a potentially manufactured event designed to displace attention from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) opposition movement, as well as the ongoing worldwide mass strike upsurge, highlighted this week by a powerful intervention against the nefarious Whirlpool Corporation in Caserta, Italy.</p>

<p>We know from patterns of past events that the events in South Carolina have the stink of an intelligence operation: a troubled individual with a convoluted past appearing out of nowhere; a highly manicured and social media presence; early reports of multiple shooters; and the quickness with which Roof was fingered for the crime and apprehended.</p>

<p>Just one day prior, the New York Times published an editorial about the pivot by local and metropolitan police departments away from radicalized foreigners towards domestic “right-wing extremists” (i.e., the white working class). The Southern Poverty Law Center, a well-known foundation funded by leftist oligarch George Soros, was among the first to push the narrative of Roof as a neo-Confederate dupe with a “recent history of anti-black” sentiments, congruent with the fishy origins of the suspect’s Facebook account.</p>

<p>We seek to draw attention to the fact that, regardless of its realities, this tragedy is being used by the controlled media to hide the successful passage by of the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) by the House of Representatives, a standalone version of Trans-Pacific Partnership’s controversial “Fast Track” provision. </p>

<p>It gives the President greater unilateral power in pushing secretive deals and is not linked to any other legislation, including TPP.</p>

<p>This lurid story is also part of an ongoing counterinsurgency effort against the poor and working classes, designed to divide white and black Americans and to prevent them from uniting around mass traction demands. </p>

<p>These demands include opposition to the TPP with protective tariffs for American producers, and the strengthening of labor against predatory mega-corporations like Whirlpool. </p>

<p>Rather than building mass movements and capitalizing on mass strike trends worldwide, what we see between these groups—egged on by incompetent cultural and institutional leadership— is labeling one another as anti-law enforcement thugs and racist murderers.</p>

<p>This does not mean we are excusing the alleged actions of provocateurs or their handlers. Instead, we have to keep our eyes on the political football. We can do so by analyzing this from a higher level of organizing that seeks out the political reasons for such potentially staged events, rather than getting bogged down in the technical obscurities of the crimes.</p>

<p>The events in the Palmetto State also come on the heels of a blown synthetic terror operation in Garland, Texas, by “Islamophobia” network operative Pamela Geller, and the general failure of the public to respond to ever-increasing doses of provocations perpetrated by ostensibly Muslim fanatics in Massachusetts, Kansas, and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, flagging campaigns of imperialist aggression against sovereign states such as the Donbass Peoples Republic, Iraq, and Syria, along with nuclear deal favorable to Iran and a walkout by the International Monetary Fund in the eleventh hour of Greek debt negotiations, indicate the growing desperation of the international ruling class and banking cartels. </p>

<p>The apparent lack of enthusiasm for these subversive campaigns on the part of President Obama, who is also facing a spree of new security threats within the Secret Service, has caused these cliques to turn up the heat. </p>

<p>This change of tone signified by the events in Charleston potentially signal a new cycle of the “strategy of tension” first pioneered in Operation Gladio in Cold War-era Italy and Western Europe. </p>

<p>The ruling class reliably stages atrocities against populations in order to distract them as well as to shore up their political weakness.</p>

<p>In addressing Wednesday’s events, President Obama characteristically embraced the media’s tropes instead of issuing a strong rebuff to the blind alley of wedge issues and the incompetence of his closest advisors. </p>

<p>It should also be noted that Obama knew the pastor of the Charleston church who was killed, State senator Rev. Clementa Pinckney. While the deceased’s surname is spelled differently than that of imprisoned anti-Whirlpool Corp. crusader Rev. Edward Pinkney, and presumably of no relation, this is a chilling coincidence.</p>

<p>The grisly events of Charleston should be investigated to their fullest extent and the truth of the allegations sought out by the appropriate parties, but this writer must implore you to ignore the banal sensationalism of the media and concentrate on agitating against the monstrosity of the Trans-Pacific Partnership legislation, as well as the entry of Donald Trump into the presidential nominee circus, whose aim is to dragoon moderate American voters from buying into the GOP quest for the presidency. </p>

<p>With practical political demands, we can break the power of the Wall Street networks who facilitate these crimes and discredited politicians and achieve justice on all fronts. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2015/06/charleston-church-shooting-larger.html">CBS News is reporting</a> that Dylann Roof was arrested on February 28 in a mall, while he was asking a store clerk “out of the ordinary questions.” At that time, he was found in possession of a medicine called Suboxone.</p>

<p>It is an addicting drug used to treat opiate addiction. Some adverse effects: agitation, hostility, hallucinations, attempted suicide, depersonalization.</p>

<p>Rapid withdrawal from Suboxone can be more dangerous than taking it.</p>

<p>Getting the picture?</p>

<p>Of course, the distinct possibility that the drug pushed Dylann Roof over the edge into committing murder isn’t part of the “correct” narrative aimed at accelerating racial hatreds.</p>

<p>The truth? Irrelevant. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>After days of research on this, here&#39;s a cobbled theory:</p>

<p>These events are designed to achieve more than one goal. There are multiple benefactors, always.</p>

<p>1) A pissed-off president, during a lame duck session, lectures a congregation of bloomberg mayors (against ill guns) that &#39;enough is enough&#39; in a &quot;don&#39;t you dare even question this&quot;-type tone. The timing of that mayor event with the church event is wicked weird. Can&#39;t get much more iron clad than a black president (victim by association to the church victims) crying for more gun control to the very people (mayors) who are lock-step with Bloomy.</p>

<p>2) This senator (reverend) was mired in a state-level financial scandal of pretty big proportions. He was also a stick-in-the-mud on the voting floor of the state senate. He was one of only two nays earlier that morning on a voter-ID bill.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the stately Senate chamber, he greeted more friends on the floor and took a seat next to Senator Vincent A. Sheheen, a fellow Democrat. It was here that Mr. Pinckney made his mark that day. When Mr. Sheheen nervously prepared to voice his opposition to a compromise reached with Republicans on their effort to introduce a voter ID bill, he was shocked to hear Mr. Pinckney’s booming voice call out, “No.” “When I heard him voting no, loud and clear, I knew I was doing the right thing,” Mr. Sheheen said. They were the only two to vote in dissent. Mr. Pinckney left another meeting early, telling colleagues that he had an appointment at his church back in Charleston.&quot; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/us/a-day-at-the-statehouse-and-a-night-of-slaughter.html">source</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>3) This kid, as mentioned, was busted at a mall TWICE carrying a drug that is not only used to treat opiate addiction, but is used in &quot;hypnosis therapy&quot; by psychiatrists (MK) (Suboxone is actually a compilation of two substances). His &quot;friends&quot; who were interviewed said he mentioned his plans to shoot-up a college, but then ended up at a church instead? This is after being busted at a MALL twice acting nutty. So, mall, college, church, psych drugs, &quot;given a gun by his dad&quot; (he may have been instructed to ask for the gun (perfect for the legal-purchase narrative)), makes facebook pages from public library right before event (even though he apparently &#39;spent countless hours on his computer looking at &quot;those crazy&quot; websites&#39;), which leads to another benefit.</p>

<p>4) It only took a day or two for the MSM to report in bold letters that the DOJ is already discussing if this was an act of terror. If they get that, all &quot;radical&quot; websites/content related to this kid&#39;s well-crafted (p-shopped) ideology would then be considered enemies of the state under whatever the SPLC/US senate decides downstream.</p>

<p>This is not mentioned in the NYTimes article you linked to. Got another source? I can&#39;t find one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This kid, as mentioned, was busted at a mall TWICE carrying a drug...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, the article says he was busted ONCE for carrying Suboxone, and the second time for <em>trespassing</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;given a gun by his dad&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, no, the article says his parents gave him money for his 21st birthday and then he bought the weapon himself.</p>

<p>Did you even read the article you posted? Apparently not closely...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The financial fraud is available by search using a browser and search engine. He was busted twice at the mall which is odd in itself, the drugs may have been just the one time, didn&#39;t mean to mislead (not perfect, nail me to the cross for fuck sakes).</p>

<p>BTW, I&#39;m not your fucking secretary. His dad gave him the gun. Verify that shit on your own time. Lazy fucks ...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The uncle also said Roof&#39;s father had recently given him a .45-caliber handgun as a birthday present. &quot;I don&#39;t have any words for it. Nobody in my family had seen anything like this coming,&quot; he said&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. These are a series of events that are part of what we&#39;re calling <em>the pattern</em>. Do you truly think that a young man could do this? No, of course not, racism doesn&#39;t exist. It&#39;s obvious that it&#39;s the machinations of a sinister government plot to take all the guns and create a race war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s hilarious it that it presumes that people actually give a shit. As someone that started a bit of a movement around the TPP, and even spent my own hard earned money on advertising and tried to stage several protests, despite having over 5000 people join our Facebook page &amp; a fair amount of support from the usual suspects, let me tell you that the average person feels two things: no confidence in their ability to change anything and thanks to that, apathy. You don&#39;t need to stage a fucking mass shooting to get the TPP across the line, you have just have to <del>bribe</del>lobby enough politicians.</p>

<p>Not at all. Anything goes here. </p>

<p>I post things I disagree with all the time because I value the education I typically get from the ensuing discussion here.</p>
