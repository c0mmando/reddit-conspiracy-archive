Its as if living before it happens is just meaningless limbo. No reason to plan for a better future within the current system or have any hopes or dreams. Anyone feel me? Anyone know a time table? I herd something about September for the stock market due to it coinciding with the Jewish shimita or however you spell it. Thanks guys, any thoughts would be much appreciated and may I just add all of you have been very helpful in the past with these specific questions I have asked. Thank you :)</p>

<p>WWII was the nuclear war. Nukes are just money laundering schemes now. I can buy one for a billion dollars. Getting it to go off will be immpossible unless it&#39;s allowed to go off by the Master Race. </p>

<p>The maya were right in the calendar, but Hollywood (ministry of truth) created the energy to be trapped on the one specific day (21/12/12). Thus everyone goes back into the state of complacency and disregarded ANYTHING ancient. Exactly what thy wanted. The the true mindfukery started around mid 2013. Look up the wheel of time and study Jainism/ look up the Hopi &quot;worlds&quot;/ Google the ragnarok ...good luck.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The economic shit will hit the fan once the pieces are in place.   You&#39;re going to create chaos, but you need to have it under control.  You need military assets in high risk of revolt areas and a population that will be OK with mass murder of a group of people for their ideology.  We already have all of that.  What we do not have is control of the next world currency. That ball is in China&#39;s court.  Once they get that worked out it&#39;ll be on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like for  it to wait long enough to try to call out, in public,  some of the sociopaths who run for office,   first.</p>

<p>I really believe that if a few are put on the spot and sort of made to  prove they aren&#39;t sociopaths,    even if they just  lie about it,  they will quickly begin to be screened out of those positions of power where they act out their aggressions on humanity.  </p>

<p>The ones already in office  would at least see the need to hide their tendency to be sociopathic. </p>

<p>That need to hide it  alone will reduce their opportunities to act out their greed driven  aggression.</p>

<p>I think just asking them in public if they can demonstrate any history of having a conscience.
  may start things in the right direction without the destruction and millions of deaths .</p>

<p>I&#39;d hate to have this kind of public test myself but fuck &#39;em they&#39;ve had their day and then some.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact it would only take roughly five publicly seen instances of sociopaths being called out in this way  to start a decline in their being elected. Those already in office and those who lie well enough to still be elected,  would then be placed in a position where they would need to hide their inability to give a shit  about the people they want to lead and that in itself will make the world almost instantly better. </p>

<p>If they think they want to lead me, (or you?), they  should at least give a shit whether I live or die.</p>

<p>Candidates   should be able to demonstrate some kind of conscience.</p>

<p>The method of public shaming of these candidates at their time of most  vulnerability would make it all too apparent  to the general public what the problem is with our current leadership.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no fundraising needed.There aren&#39;t millions and millions of people that have to be convinced before the   plan can begin and even move forward. There&#39;s no war to fight. No millions of mercenaries coming for your head. No destruction of cities, counties,  states or the country. The damn electricity wouldn&#39;t even need to go off.</p>

<p>If it all falls apart before this simple , quick and peaceful  method can be tried mankind may not survive to ever get another chance.</p>

<p>Sociopaths have reduced levels of human qualities such as compassion, conscience, empathy and remorse. They make decisions based solely on personal greed and outsized ego. They are not fit for office for that reason.</p>

<p>edit typos as usual.</p>

About the end of the time that ends, there will be a stock crash bigger than ever which will call for looting and riots due to a government that&#39;s not there for its people but for its corporations. (TPP).. Housing will go into foreclosure and adding to the loots... And just lucky enough for everyone. The military will already be in the field and will be called to action. There will be fema camps cause people don&#39;t have anywhere to live and then there will be a massive false flag.. Guccifer. Look up his nuke predictions. So to answer your question.

    <div class="md"><p>True but the one thing that could be a game changer is how much longer they have to live, givin that they are human with human life spans.

My mother is a manic depressive drunk. I ignored all that bullshit and studied hard, went to college, and then got a job (which I lost after 9/11). Life is a struggle, but I am back on my feet, and better off than my ancestors were. I have a son, he is one year old now, and he is happy and healthy. I own my own home, and I have my own dog. I scraped this life together from nothing, and I&#39;m not about to give it all up because some lazy punk thinks his life is miserable so mine should be too.

    <div class="md"><p>Wait, don&#39;t blame yourself 100%. You have ancestors who did nothing to help elevate your starting position, so they kind of left you high and dry. Blame them too. You see, I cannot blame my ancestors, their tiny village was invaded by the world&#39;s most advanced military power at the time... so they get a pass. But in one generation, we&#39;ve gone from picking potatoes in the plains of Eastern Europe, to living comfortably in the USA. </p>

<p>If it is at all possible for you to change your outlook on things, consider this: you can bust your ass and try your hardest to make life a little easier for those who come after you (if not your own children, maybe a friend&#39;s children, or some distant cousins). If you make their starting position a little better, and they do the same for their descendants, and they for theirs, and so on... within a generation or two, things will be better for those who come after us. If you really feel there is no hope for you, try and pass some hope on down the bloodline. Years from now, some distant relative who has no idea who you were will appreciate it. Imagine for a second if your great grandfather left you a trust fund so that you could start your own business. You certainly wouldn&#39;t be working minimum wage, right? It has to start at some point, or you are just part of a miserable self-defeating cycle. All the rich and powerful people on this planet owe their ancestors a bit of gratitude, some more than others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because I hate people who think it&#39;s going to be &quot;fun&quot; and &quot;exciting&quot; when &quot;the shit hits the fan&quot;. Things are going to get ugly, and the kids who are praying for it to happen so they don&#39;t have to go to school or mow the lawn are going to be very sad when the suffering begins. I will be fine. I am prepared, and willing to do what it takes to survive a collapse. The kiddies who think it&#39;s going to be a party will become victims fast. That is my only solace. </p>
