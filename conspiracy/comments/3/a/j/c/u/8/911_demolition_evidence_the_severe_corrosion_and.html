<li>The thinning of the steel occurred by high temperature corrosion due to a combination of
oxidation and sulfidation.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol>
<li>The sulfidation attack of steel grain boundaries accelerated the corrosion and erosion of the steel.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol>
<li>The high concentration of sulfides in the grain boundaries of the corroded regions of the steel occured due to copper diffusing from the HSLA steel combining with iron and sulfur, making both discrete and continuous sulfides in the steel grain boundaries.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>C.6 Suggestions for Future Research:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The severe corrosion and subsequent erosion of Samples 1 and 2 are a very unusual event. No clear explanation for the source of the sulfur has been identified. The rate of corrosion is also unknown. It is possible that this is the result of long-term heating in the ground following the collapse of the buildings. It is also possible that the phenomenon started prior to collapse and accelerated the weakening of the steel structure. A detailed study into the mechanisms of this phenomenon is needed to determine what risk, if any, is presented to existing steel structures exposed to severe and long-burning fires.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, way to read the report man! The sulfer found on the site caused eutectic compound to form on the steel weakening it. This is a well know reaction that has been used by blacksmiths for centuries. This isn&#39;t debated at, what is, is where the sulfer came from. Gypsum, contains sulfer which can be released when burned and when combined with water and heat, it formed sulfer oxide which coated the steel support structures. These support structures are not homogenous on a microscopic level and this sulfer oxide mix caused the steel to weaken in parts hence the Swiss cheese look. </p>

<p>Kind of an ironic thing for someone to say that thinks sulfur from building materials can cause holes in steel.  I mean, if you want to talk about pulled-from-thin-air bullshit...</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Excusing your hilarious pun.  Show me any scientific evidence that sulfur from building materials can magically combine during an office fire to create a substance capable of making holes in steel.  You are the one making the off the wall claim so lets see any evidence whatsoever to back it up.</p>

<p>But lets just say that you do find some evidence that building materials can magically form to create a eutectic.  Wouldn&#39;t the reasonable conclusion in that case be that&#39;s what made the building come down in a fashion that looked like controlled demolition.  Because the thing is that holes in steel being caused by building materials is an unheard of event.  As is a building collapsing due to thermal expansion.  So isn&#39;t kind of weird that <em>both</em> of those unheard of events happen in the same building on the same day?</p>

This reaction has been used since the early 1900s by blacksmiths using sulfurous coal to lower the melting point of steel. So yeah, sulfer from drywall is a totally legitamate source.

<blockquote>
<ul>

<p><strong>Les Young — High-Rise Architect</strong>: <a href="https://youtu.be/zceJhfYV69M">https://youtu.be/zceJhfYV69M</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>What? Are they informed of the fact that: </p>

<p>Fraud: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/301e6t/breaking_news_nist_maintains_that_wtc_7_collapsed/">NIST maintains that WTC 7 collapsed due to fire acting upon the 13th floor &amp; A2001 girder. But — NIST omitted flange-to-web stiffeners on the south end of the girder A2001. These omitted stiffeners would prevent the girder flange from folding when the girder web moved beyond the seat.</a></p>

<p>NIST Fraud 2: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/30mmj3/911_coverup_nist_says_shear_studs_were_not_used/">They also said shear studs were not used on WTC 7 girders — and claim the 13th floor A2001 girder was pushed off its seat at column 79 by &#39;thermally expanded&#39; beams. If shear studs had been used on the girders, it would have been impossible for the beams to push the girder off its seat.</a></p>

<p>If they are unaware of these facts, how could those 96% make an informed opinion?...<strong>or are you claiming that they are all aware of the stiffener/shear stud omissions in the NIST report and simply don&#39;t care?</strong></p>

<p>What needs to be shut down is the &quot;truth movement&quot;, because it has clearly failed to convince anyone relevant: <strong>96% of architects think there&#39;s no need for any new investigation</strong>.

<p>Few people are capable of expressing with equanimity opinions which differ from the prejudices of their social environment. Most people are even incapable of forming such opinions.
~ Albert Einstein</p>

<p>The exact contrary of what is generally believed is often the truth. ~ Jean de la Bruyère</p>

<p>Once you have seen certain things, you can&#39;t un-see them, and seeing nothing is as political an act as seeing something.
~ Arundhati Roy</p>

<p>The crimes of the United States have been systematic, constant, vicious, remorseless, but very few people have actually talked about them. ~ Harold Pinter</p>

<p>If pigs could vote, the man with the slop bucket would be elected swineherd every time, no matter how much slaughtering he did on the side. ~ Orson Scott Card</p>

<p>Our government has kept us in a perpetual state of fear, kept us in a continuous stampede of patriotic fervor, with the cry of grave national emergency.

<p>We&#39;re left to ponder why.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The AIA believes that incidents involving the catastrophic failure of buildings and other structures must be investigated using the highest standards of science-based investigation and analysis in order to provide accurate and meaningful information in the development of model building codes. In adherence to the scientific method, investigations should:   </p>

<p>• Consider all available data;<br/>
• Consider hypotheses that most readily explain the available data;<br/>
• Test those hypotheses and analyze the results without bias; and<br/>
• Provide for external review and replication by making all data available.    </p>

<p>The AIA recognizes that many members of the architecture profession believe the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) investigation into the complete collapse of 7 World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, did not adhere to these principles and, as a result, the conclusions of the NIST investigation are fatally flawed. The AIA believes this perspective merits further study and supports a new investigation into the complete collapse of 7 World Trade Center.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What? Are they informed of the fact that: </p>

<p>Fraud: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/301e6t/breaking_news_nist_maintains_that_wtc_7_collapsed/">NIST maintains that WTC 7 collapsed due to fire acting upon the 13th floor &amp; A2001 girder. But — NIST omitted flange-to-web stiffeners on the south end of the girder A2001. These omitted stiffeners would prevent the girder flange from folding when the girder web moved beyond the seat.</a></p>

<p>NIST Fraud 2: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/30mmj3/911_coverup_nist_says_shear_studs_were_not_used/">They also said shear studs were not used on WTC 7 girders — and claim the 13th floor A2001 girder was pushed off its seat at column 79 by &#39;thermally expanded&#39; beams. If shear studs had been used on the girders, it would have been impossible for the beams to push the girder off its seat.</a></p>

<p>If they are unaware of these facts, how could those 96% make an informed opinion?...<strong>or are you claiming that they are all aware of the stiffener/shear stud omissions in the NIST report and simply don&#39;t care?</strong></p>
