<p>On this podcast, I interview interesting people.  I don&#39;t necessarily understand or even agree with a lot of the theories I see posted here regarding the Illuminati, or whatever you want to call the one world government.  But I find the ideas fascinating and would love to talk about them with someone who has studied this more than I have.</p>

<p>I have no intention to mock you or even challenge your believes.  Quite a few things I see on here I even agree with.</p>

<p>If you are interested, shoot me an e-mail at <a href="mailto:collin@awkwardmomentspod.com">collin@awkwardmomentspod.com</a></p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Collin,</p>

<p>As someone who doesn&#39;t post a lot here but does read quite a bit, I can tell you there are highly intelligent people in this community very dialed in to both current events and historical analysis. Putting a post up where you say you do not agree with the theorems expounded here, but then noting that some of them are not that crazy, comes across as condescending and will not lead to a quality candidate to interview. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How bout this guy. Awkward enough?</p>

<p>“For more than a century ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents such as my encounter with Castro to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions. Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as &#39;internationalists&#39; and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure--one world, if you will. If that&#39;s the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.”

    <div class="md"><p>CFR President,  Richard N. Haass
Sovereignty and globalization  2006</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/9903/sovereignty_and_globalisation.html">http://www.cfr.org/publication/9903/sovereignty_and_globalisation.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Globalization thus implies that sovereignty is not only becoming weaker in reality, but that it needs to become weaker. States would be wise to weaken sovereignty in order to protect themselves, because they cannot insulate themselves from what goes on elsewhere. Sovereignty is no longer a sanctuary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As soon as the fast track reaches it&#39;s goal post the TPP will illuminate you as to the means and method of reaching a One World Government.</p>

<p>Corporations are being  being made superior to governments by giving themselves the right to sue governments worldwide for profits they &#39;might have&#39; made&#39; if government  didn&#39;t get in their way.</p>

<p>This all has the effect of making sovereign governments become local jurisdictions and corporations, the world government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haass, one of the nations most important non governmental leaders of the time, spelled out a need for corporations to assume their &#39;rightful place&#39; of world political power. </p>

<p>He couched it in a couple of deceptive words saying &#39;not&#39;, in one place where he clearly meant definitely or the rest of his speech would make zero sense. </p>

<p>The CFR thus declared the goal that  corporations  wanted to have world political power and now the TPP is set to give it to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s talking about a persons statement. A person in an influential think tank with a powerful position. This person spoke about the sovereignty of states, like Texas is a sovereign state. </p>

<p>Italy is a sovereign state, Iceland is a sovereign state, the USA is a sovereign state etc etc. </p>

<p>States are non tangible vessels that hold the centralized authority of a government whether it is democracy, dictatorship, communist,etc etc. </p>

<p>This influential person at this think tank essentially said states should want to lose their sovereignty to be protected from the increasing globalization of corporations. </p>

<p>Basically threatening sovereign states through litigation (or lawsuits) from multinational corporations because as the NWO aka globalization increases sovereignty decreases. </p>

<p>If you have any more questions about this simple yet complicatedly worded topic just ask.</p>

<p>I have not read or seen anything that has convinced me that 9/11 was anything other than a plot by a relatively small group of Islamic extremists, but I keep an open mind.  It&#39;s entirely possible that there&#39;s more to it than the public knows.</p>

<p>I&#39;m interested in talking to someone who would be called a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;, although I know that term is usually used to be condescending and dismissive (and I believe was openly created and spread by the CIA to discredit people who investigate their dealings)</p>
