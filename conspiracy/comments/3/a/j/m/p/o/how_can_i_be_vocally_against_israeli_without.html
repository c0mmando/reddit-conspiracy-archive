    <div class="md"><p>Zionism is basically Jewish Nationalism. It has nothing do to inherently with the jewish religion and many ultra-orthodox Jews are themselves
Anti-Zionists. If he comes with the Holocaust argument, mention that the state of Israel was not founded by refugeess from the holocaust, but mostly planned migration, financed from rich Jews from western Europe (and not the poor easter Jews who were the main victims of the holocause). Also that many who survivors of the holocaust were not greeted with open arms, but more like &quot;We told you&quot; in that the Jews that didn&#39;t want to participate in the Zionist state deserved to be killed because they didn&#39;t listen to the Zionists. 
Concerning the threat against Israel, mention that Jews are protected by the law in Iran and garantued seats in parliament (as well as Armenian Christians and Zoroastrians).
Basically try to explain the differences between Jews and Zionists and that many Jews themself don&#39;t support Zionism.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it&#39;s sad, I saw a commercial for Holocaust survivors in Israel, about how poor they live, and they&#39;re supposed to get stipends or actual life payments from the government.  It bothers me that Israel can use the Holocaust so much and treat Holocaust survivors like that.  But like we don&#39;t do the same, and neither do other countries.  This world is becoming more and more self-destructive for the benefit of a few elite of any and all backgrounds.</p>

<p>You do realise how much money the German government gives each holocaust survivor? The fact that they choose to spend it on the Ukrainian sex slaves in Israel or drugs rather than a house or food is their fault entirely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take it from someone who knows: I met a real honest-to-God  holocaust survivor when in Israel. She was in her late 80s and was forced to eat CAT FOOD. She got NOTHING from &quot;reparations&quot;- she told me that the &#39;fat cats&#39; stole all that money. She was given a tiny apartment by the Israeli government and about $125/mo to live on.  She couldn&#39;t afford to run air conditioning when I visited and it was easily over 40c.</p>

<p>I had $2000 for my trip. She wouldn&#39;t let me give her a cent so when I left her home, in tears, I bought a greeting card, paid someone to write in Hebrew what a hero I thought she was for standing up to all she had in life, and enclosed ten US $100 bills. I then addressed this to her and sent it. </p>

The so called European Jew is not part of the Hebrew race and are not Semitic. So if you go back and read you&#39;ll see where God promised that land to the &quot;seed&quot; of Abraham and not to the followers of Judaism. Also explains rev 2.9.

    <div class="md"><p>Aren&#39;t we all related to each other? The Samaritans are an interesting topic, but I think the whole blood and racial purity think is bullshit. 
Yeah Ashkenazim are genetically different from the Hebrews of 900BC, but also different from the Christian majority population, mainly because of Endogamy, still they are related. The question whether Jews are just a religion or their own race is a long and complicated one. 
To be honest to me it doesn&#39;t really matter and I don&#39;t think that there is some God Chosen people as much as there is eine Herrenrasse. 
I don&#39;t think the Ashkenazim are some european people who converted to Judaism to hijack Israel and the God Chosen status or anything. Their genetic differences are mostly normal genetic drift, because except for the Khazar there were few mass conversions to Judaism as there were to Christianity or Islam. 
On the theological level the Samaritans are clearly closer to original Judaism than most other Jewish subgroups. That said Armenian Christians might call themselves closer to original Christianity because they were the first country to convert and not Rome. 
But yeah I don&#39;t think it really matters, mostly because look at history what this &quot;Not a real Christian/Jews, I am more original&quot; brought us.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The Khazard did convert to Judaism, at least the majority of the Khazar elite. Their descendents still live around Easter Europe and are called Karaim or Karaites. However they are not the same as the Ashkenazim (Basically the biggest group of european Jews) and make up only a tiny minority within Judaism. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>technically have no right to claim that Israel is their land</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with you on that. The Zionist claim on Israel that is based ony that it was a Jewish land around 2000 years ago is as valid as the claim I would have to Anatolia, just because I and the people who lived there 2k years ago are Indoeuropean... so its technically a bullshit claim. </p>

<p>The Ashkenazim are descendents from Jews who settled in the early middle ages in western Germany and later migrated (because of an invitation of a Polish King) into Eastern Europe. Their language, yiddish is basically a medieval german dialect with many hebrew and slavic loanwords. There are other smaller groups of Jews around Europe. Why are they there? Mostly in Roman times they settled all over the Empire and thanks to Caesar they even had the roman citizenship, which hardly anybody had in the Empire (mostly only people born in the Latium and other select italic people, later it was broadened, but Jews were basically the first non-italics given the citizenship). 
Of course they are genetically not the same as ancients Hebrews, but in my opinion thinking the Ashkenazim are just a group of germans who began to pose as Jews in the middle ages to claim the state of Israel is bullshit. They are different because of genetic shift and intermarriages with gentiles and so on. But they are also a bit different than the surrounding christian, because although intermarriage did happen it happened not very often.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No thing. Thats at least what I know about the different subgroups of Judaism, mostly thanks to my History and Religion teacher in school. He wasn&#39;t a Jew, but obviously really liked Jews and sometimes it was a bit annoying when... didn&#39;t matter what topic he somehow found a way to bring Jews into it. I said it once to him and since that he wasn&#39;t as nice to me anymore. I wonder why really no one turned antisemite after his classes. 
Either way the distinction between Antisemitism and Antizionism is in my opinion too often ignored.
I think the best think one can do to his enemy is to censor them. This will always put one in the position of the victim and radicalise them. Giving people the impression they are not allowed to critise Israel and saying Antizionism is the same as Antisemitism will just further hate against Israel and broaden it against all Jews. 
Yes the majority of Jews is pro-Zionist, but 39 the majority of germans thought they need Lebensraum im Osten. 
So basically I don&#39;t think their is some all-jewish conspiry going, just people being manipulated by power hungry governments. </p>

<p><a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datei:Jews_1490.png">If you don&#39;t believe that there is just one Hebreic-Jewish people and want to know more about Jewish subgroup, this is a map showing the different groups in the year 1490, before the Sephardim were kicked out of Spain</a>. Many of these communities don&#39;t exist anymore. The Ethiopian and Yemenite Jews for example were almost all brought to Israel... because it is apparently their ancestral homeland yadda yadda </p>

That said I think people should be thinking of Zionism like any other nationalism. We comdemn german nationalism, english, russian, white supremacy etc. We condemn any other form of supremacist thinking, but Jewish Zionism. Really we should treat them no other than some white Neo-Nazi retards. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another tactic may be the one many german leftists use. First make the distinction clear that Jews and Zionists are not the same with the stuff I mentioned in my first comment. Then go on like. &quot;Well because our ancestors committed the Holocaust, we think it is our moral obligation to warn Israel not to commit another genocide.&quot; 
At least that around the thought process of german Antizionists I can think of. Put it like you want to help Jews and Palestianians the same (which might actually be true) and think the Zionist state is a threat to both Jews and Arabs. 
Furthermore you might play the guilty road on the Zionists themselves. Saying stuff like &quot;They betrayed the dream of Theodor Herzl (Austrian-Jew and founder of Zionism)&quot; in that he wanted to give a persecuted people a homeland and you think it would be against him when other people have to be driven from their homes because of Zionism. 
Concerning the 6666 Goyzillion or whatever number. Idk I thought german education about the Holocaust is the most guilt ridden, but seriously many American really believe that only Jews and really 6 million were killed, I didn&#39;t learn that in school. What I learned was that it were 6 million <strong>people</strong> (Not even 6, just 5 million btw was the number we learned in history class). Of this number probably just half were Jews (and probably many inflate the number by not just counting those killed in the camps, but also those who fought in the Polish or Soviet Army). Then there were Gypsies, Communists, Homosexual, Mentally Ill people, Unruly youth (the former concentration camp near my hometown was even mostly for youths and just a few Jews), Asocial people like homeless and people who didn&#39;t want to work etc. Take the gypsies and what differs them from the Jews. Really when you think about it they have a similar history. Were regarded as foreigners in Europe, were discriminated, expelled, killed the full package, but the main difference! They don&#39;t have a rich lobby with an agenda behind them today. So gypsies are still in Eastern Europe discriminated, while Jews have become Holy Cows. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your dad seems misinformed on the teachings of the Bible.</p>

<p>First of all, the jews were &quot;chosen&quot; by God for Jesus to come through the bloodline.  <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+1&amp;amp;version=NKJV">Matthew 1</a> is full of &quot;begots&quot;, showing that Jesus came from the lineage of Abraham.  That&#39;s the only thing the jews were &quot;chosen&quot; for...then they killed Jesus.  </p>

<p>Biblically speaking, they don&#39;t get a free ride to heaven.  After Jesus left the planet, a shitload of jews were confronted at a celebration by Peter.  After hearing what Peter had to say, the jews said, &quot;What do we have to do to be saved?&quot; And Peter told them.  Read it for yourself in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+2&amp;amp;version=NKJV">Acts 2</a>, then show your dad.  All throughout the book of Acts, jews are converted to Christianity.</p>

<p>Then point out to him that the eastern european jews are not even of the original 12 tribes.  They are Khazars, a group of people who were forced to convert to judaism around 740 ad by their king Bulan.  They have no legal, historical, nor Biblical right to the land they are stealing in the Mid-East.  </p>

<p>Google Khazaria (it was once the largest country in Europe).  Google King Bulan.  Google Thirteenth Tribe.  Share these with your dad, then show him <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation+2%3A9&amp;amp;version=NKJV">Revelation 2:9</a> and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation+3%3A9&amp;amp;version=NKJV">3:9</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Hebrews downfall in the Bible was their willful ignorance in recognizing that God&#39;s promise was more spiritual than worldly. There was a land promise, but that promise was contingent on Israel&#39;s continual obedience to God. They failed in that, repeatedly.</p>

<p>It was a conditional promise, and God held up his end. Present day &quot;Israel&quot; has no land-claim on the territory which God gave to the Hebrews, and they count on the misunderstanding of well-intentioned, but ignorant, Christians to support their claim.</p>

<p>From Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A modern theory, that the core of Ashkenazi Jewry emerged from a hypothetical Khazarian Jewish diaspora, is now viewed with scepticism by most scholars, but occasionally supported by others. This Khazarian hypothesis is sometimes associated with antisemitism and anti-zionism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not saying your other points are incorrect, just ironic that the search query you postulated to dispute claims of antisemitism led directly to a term associated with &quot;hypothetical&quot; and &quot;antisemitic&quot;</p>

<p>Uhm what are your sources? The Turkish Jews you are meaning are the Karaites or Karaim Jews. They are distinct from the Ashkenazim in that they are descendents from the Khazars and speak Karaim a turkic language. The Ashkenazim are different. First Ashkenaz is the old Hebrew word for Germany and later it was broadened on all of Western Europe. Many Ashkenazim flew into Eastern Europe, where they lived untill many migrated to America, Israel, where killed during the Holocaust. Many still live there but the old Shtetl culture was eradicated during WW2. The Ashkenazim also speak Yiddish, which is originally a medieval german dialect with many hebrew and slavic loanwords. In the past it was called Judendeutsch. The Ashkenazim are today the biggest group of Jews and make around three quarters. In 1932 they made around 90% of all Jews, in the Middle Ages they made up only 2% of all Jews. The second biggest group are the Sephardim, the descendents from spanish Jews that were expelled 1492, IIRC they make today up around 10% or 15%. 
There are many other smaller Jewish subgroups which all have their own teachings (Among the Ashkenazim the Hazidim are a prominent group that mostly make up Ultra-Orthodox Jews). Of course their teachings have differences to the original tribes, but so are there many different confessions of Christianity. 
Concerning the blood purity... I don&#39;t believe that there is an inherent semitic race or some bullshit. The Ashkenazim are definitely differently in their genetics than Jews from 500BC, but they are also a bit different than many Europeans, because of Endogamy, but so are Basques. I don&#39;t think the Ashkenazim hijacked the Jewish religion (because again racial and blood purity are bullshit in my opinion), but nonetheless Zionism was a shitty idea mostly created by rich Jews/Ashkenazim from western Europe. 
(The majority of Ashkenazim lived in eastern Europe in their Shtetl) 
So not the Jews were hijacked by the Ashkenazim, but the Ashkenazim (and later all other Jews) were hijacked by Zionists. 
Btw am a Goy and Antizionist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>when someone calls you an anti-semite, they&#39;re attacking you personally, not your ideas.  It&#39;s the ad-hominem fallacy.  They&#39;re trying to discredit you, so the only way to fight it is to call people out when this happens.  It can also be helpful to come back with things like, &quot;no, actually, I don&#39;t hate all the Canaanites or Babylonians or Arabs, (because the semites are a language group)  and of course I don&#39;t hate the Jews either, I&#39;m just trying to have a discussion and you&#39;re attacking me.&quot;</p>

<p>Generally I&#39;ve found that people support Israel really think that Jews are entitled to that land because of the Bible, which if I&#39;m not mistaken is textbook religious extremism.  Try asking your dad if he thinks he&#39;s a religious extremist.  If not, why not?  Because it sounds like he&#39;s saying that religious scripture gives them the right to have conquest of certain lands that do not belong to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it possible that this argument is worth your time.  My father is an Ashkenazim Jew, so you know what that makes me.  My grand father was a full blooded person and my grandmother was all German.  I don&#39;t deny that the Holocaust happened, nor do I think that in any way I relate to any ancient Jewish people.  If anything, I thing that the Palestinian people and Arab Jews in the middle east are as close as they can be to being Jewish.  I was brainwashed growing up.  I distinctly remember my grandfather telling me that &quot;we built the pyramids&quot; of ancient Egypt (right?).  It has taken me years to overcome this.  Don&#39;t be surprised if your father takes some time.  He is probably afraid to confront the reality that many so called Jews are of Turkish origin and therefore only bear a small relation to any Jew.  Being called an anti-Semite isn&#39;t that bad as long as you know that you are not some pro Nazi Hitler youth.  Many people are changing their opinions of &quot;Jews.&quot; Did you see any of the rallies where people were protesting Zionism, point to that.  </p>
