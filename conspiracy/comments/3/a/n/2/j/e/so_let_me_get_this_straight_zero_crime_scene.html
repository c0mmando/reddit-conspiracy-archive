       Maybe I haven't looked hard enough, but is all we have are a  bunch of yellow tape crime scene photos again? (Sandy Hook). Maybe I'm jumping the....errr gun, and its too early for stuff like that to be released but you'd think we would have seen a bullet hole by now. Of course last time it was "no one needs to see bodies of small children". What's the excuse this time?

       OP makes a good point. Do I know this really happened? If so, how do I know? Why the obscene amount of money funneling to these victims families again, like at Sandy Hook? Why are all these family members out there forgiving right away and talking about love and even smiling (just like at SH)? Why were the families allowed to speak at the arraignment? And wasn't it strange he was on a video monitor and not in court? The spirit of the OP is to ask questions about the reality being presented.

       Maybe some of them, but not all. It's highly unlikely an entire congregation, regardless of religious belief, would release the memory of their beloved without a fight. There would still be those calling for this guy's head, wanting him to be treated like an animal for what he did to their family. Simply because their teacher says to forgive, it doesn't mean all of them have learned how.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, whether they feel these emotions and hide them for the camera to seem like "good Christians" and not show a spark of negativity in the lot we're called to feel sorry for, that still implies a media PR system hiding details from the public to make the pill easier to swallow.

       Agreed.  As a Christian, I still get mad at people who cut me off in traffic.  I'm far from living like Christ daily.  Not saying that these people are perfect, but they've matured enough that they live out the teachings of Christ far easier than those "calling for this guy's head".

       Often Christians are just people who are struggling with living within their worldview.  Being a Christian is not an easy thing, especially when there are so many temptations to do what you'd rather do than what Christ would do.

       If you look at a Google Maps satellite view of the church parking lot, the parking stalls match. The shot in the video you posted of his car shows it heading exactly where it would have to go to get around the side of the church to get to where the angled handicap parking spots are located.

       It's hard to tell, but street view matches it as well. From the looks of it, that front entrance has a gate and was probably locked up at the time. It looks like, based off the limited space on the side of the building, that he would have to do a 10 point turn to get the car parked the right way.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for someone looking to escape, it's not too bright of him to be parked in what would be a dead end if that gate were locked. One car could have blocked his ability to get away.

       Funny how the same people who readily accuse someone who DOESN'T see a conspiracy, of just being gov't shills or "sheep" who blindly believe what the mainstream media says; are the same people who blindly believe whatever they read on here, BIN, GLP or InfoWars. How about just use your own reasoning and come to your own conclusions based on the evidence YOU find without being prompted or influenced by "alternative media".
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternative media like what Alex Jones shovels, is really a vehicle to promote alternative and homeopathic medicine and remedies, all of which are a crock of shit. Similar to what you think of the mainstream medias push of mainstream medicine. Funny that. They're the same type of outfit, they just push different products.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just more entertaining to battle a bogeyman though, instead of confronting the reality. The monster under your bed who disappears when you go to look for him is much easier to deal with than the harsh reality that REAL monsters like Dylann Roof exist. That story isn't interesting enough? You need to add a layer of political intrigue? Life isn't a Tom Clancy novel I'm sorry to tell you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of these conspiracy theorists are folks with attention disorders, they don't feel important enough in their every day life and being a part of some " movement" makes them feel special, because they
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       they know more than the average Joe. When the sad truth is the reality is what it is, and it doesn't give a good shit what you
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       happened.

       loose lips tony, you sure do have your logical fallacies in check. I mean after typing that paragraph the only thing that stood out to you was the fact that I called you an idiot. Why would you be so offended over something so small? I think we both know why. There is no "issue at hand" to discuss, a kid, most likely on SSRI's, was mentally unstable, and shot a bunch of people in a church. This happens
       <em>
        all the time
       </em>
       , yet it
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       be some herp a derp conspiracy. Everytime you say shill it just reminds me of how paranoid and delusional you are. I disagree with you so I must be someone being paid to comment on some small subreddit to keep the masses in check. You can live in la la land, it doesn't affect me. I'm just trying to fix your problem.

       Where is your evidence that it's a conspiracy? Or is it just blind faith, because that is the ONLY explanation that this could've happened. You're so worried about the media distracting people but then you're distracted by this bullshit. You're wasting your time on this one. Go concern yourself with real issues like the effects of the 16 trillion dollar corporation bailout, or Israel's involvement in purposely perpetuating conflict in the middle east. There's plenty of real issues you could be researching yet you insist on drinking the Jonestown kool-aid.

       Believe me, I used to have the same mindset because I was tired, bored, and logically it made sense. But it's a trap. It's like if a=b, b=c, and c=d then a must equal d. Things are more complex than that. A majority of disinformation follows this structure and it is carefully distributed to make people say "oh that makes sense" then suck them in. It's kind of like boiling frogs. A frog will jump out of boiled water if thrown in but if you put the frog in before it is boiled, it wont notice the increasing heat before it is too late. Before you know it they have constructed a bias within you and caught you in the trap. Disinfo is a huge business.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing could change my mind as all of my opinions were established truths in my mind even though I thought I was open minded. Everything was looked at with a conspiratorial bias. It's not healthy.

       So I Google mapped the church, both of those parking spots are in the church and not far from one another. But it appears the one with the slants is a one way and for him to appear to be turning into the first spot (in photo two) he would have had to pull some pretty crazy ass drifting mechanics to end up in the slanted spot (In picture one). Nice video though, good find.

       It would be difficult to release these, because they don't exist to begin with.  You will never see anything more then a grainy picture of any of the "victims" either,  nor despite an apparent surveillance camera,  nothing more then a still frame of the "suspect" either.

       I don't get this line of reasoning. Crime scene photos (especially homicide) are rarely released by the authorities, and if they do make their way into the public view it is usually by someone sneaking them out without permission or the crimes have happened many years previous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe I am incorrect in this assessment, but maybe someone could point out some instances of authorities releasing evidence images of a multiple homicide for public consumption.

       It doesn't even have to be a crime scene photo. A cell phone picture, a video of the shooting or aftermath, anything. I find it hard to believe in this day and age of the citizen paparazzi that no one took out their phone while this was going on.

       Theres a baptist church right next door, most likely having wed night service as well, no one heard 30-40 rounds of gunshots? Why do you make it out like I'm implying it has to be someone with a gun pointed at their head to be filming.

       The lack of cameras is very strange. I grew up in a small church and even we had two cameras inside to film and broadcast the service on local stations for the sick and elderly who were unable to attend.
      </p>
      <p>
       That was back in the early 90's and it's almost unheard of for any church to not film service so I find it odd there is no video of the inside.

       To be fair, this was just a small bible study in a room I believe. But surely they must have more than 2 cameras on the corner of the church.

       A societal structure beneficial for them and their kin by allowing large tax breaks to those earning extortionately high amounts of money while punishing any on average or below wages who don't pay their full share, then having said money laundered through the banking industry to reach the right pockets.

       No, but it doesn't really need to. It just needs to kick up a social discussion about whether or not action should be taken against the right to bare arms. So long as the people argue amongst themselves over an inconsequential issue, they'll overlook the larger aspects of the political theatre, such as Obama's power to fast-track trade deals with known view towards TPP/TTIP being one example of stories that will be ignored while things like the "racial tension" and "gun fever" are being thrown back and forth for the fiftieth time. Honestly, if the government wanted to take your guns, they'd do it.

       Well, whether they use false flag initiatives, or merely jump on whichever tragedy they can to use as a distraction piece, they're clever, we must give them that. It's why it's so hard to outright show the cracks in the veneer - they're there if you look, but from a distance it seems as smooth as glass.
      </p>
      <p>
       We, as a society, are more than happy to call our governments corrupt, but only in so far as harming us. They'd never harm us. Our government is our friend. Our government is our protector. Our government's interests are that of my own, and there's no way individuals within would ever harm the people who put them there.

       It makes me laugh when people come in here just to moan about people being 'paranoid', 'lonely', 'gun toting', 'crazy', or whatever else you can think of. "You're just looking for something to go off about!" "You're just looking for false flags!"
      </p>
      <p>
       No, but given recent history, and a little further back if you care to delve so deep, there does seem to be a parasite atop the social structure akin to the brain slug from Futurama. Do we know, for fact, that Charleston was another false flag? No. Does this mean we should stop questioning the incident, stop looking for inconsistencies, stop thinking outside the linear narrative offered by the media? Of course not!

      <p>
       The mark of an educated mind is to entertain a thought without accepting it. The mark of an uneducated mind is to go around insulting others for daring to think further than "What does the FOX say?" Yes, Ylvis, it is another bunch of drivel.

       Don't expect those on the downvote payroll here to answer you. These are legit questions that are impossible to avoid in a healthy discussion.

       It's hard to tell, but street view matches it as well. From the looks of it, that front entrance has a gate and was probably locked up at the time. It looks like, based off the limited space on the side of the building, that he would have to do a 10 point turn to get the car parked the right way.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for someone looking to escape, it's not too bright of him to be parked in what would be a dead end if that gate were locked. One car could have blocked his ability to get away.

Simply because their teacher says to forgive, it doesn't mean all of them have learned how.
