    <div class="md"><p>That 13 year old article describes various &#39;experiments&#39; carried out by HMG on the public including spraying from aircraft, trucks, and ships offshore. It does not say anything that would prove contrails are really chemtrails. Similarly, you won&#39;t find a single patent that describes creating 200 mile long plumes of white powder across clear blue skies. Apart from the physical impossibility of fitting all that powder into a relatively tiny aircraft, which already has a full complement of crew and passengers, there is the big unanswered question: Why don&#39;t they do their secret toxic spraying at night when nobody can see it?</p>

<p>Actually, if you watch the GeoengineeringWatch videos Dane Wigington explains that they do spray chemtrails at night as well, but most of them are during the day for efficiency reasons. I can&#39;t remember the specifics anymore, it has been a while since I&#39;ve watched the videos, but he does provide a sufficient answer to this question. As for your other ridiculous remark about fitting &quot;all that powder&quot; into a &quot;relatively tiny aircraft&quot;: Firstly it&#39;s not a powder, it&#39;s a liquid aerosol, and secondly most of the aircraft are anything but tiny.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a powder (or liquid) which is sprayed into air to become an aerosol.</p>

<p>Sorry, liquid aerosol. Regardless, still not a powder. </p>

<p>That&#39;s irrelevant. It&#39;s not traditional cloud seeding that is happening.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s a liquid, 10-100 Micron aluminum particles are not powder, please stop using powder.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Really? Can I get a source on this? I&#39;ve never seen this data where they&#39;ve actually measured the amount of ice in a contrail.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not what they&#39;re spraying to mitigate global warming though, so stop trying to confuse people by purposely confusing which process does what.</p>

<p>There is cloud seeding, which ionizes the particles around the clouds to make them form into rain clouds.</p>

<p>There is also global warming mitigation, which takes 10-100 micron aluminum particulate matter and sprays that to act as a shield against the sun.</p>

<p>You have no idea what you are saying; just throwing technical sounding terms into the ring in the hope that one of them makes sense. FYI, &#39;Ionising&#39; refers to radioactivity, not cloud formation. Aren&#39;t you slightly embarrassed when you make these howlers?</p>

<p>That is what I said, do not purposely misquote me to fit your narrative.</p>

<p><a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1961GeoPA..50..118M">I do know what I&#39;m talking about</a>, and one method of cloud seeding is to induce conditions which lead to the ionization of cloud nuclei, which is achieved through X-ray and other radio frequency manipulation.</p>

<p>You could also just straight up spray sulfur-dioxide to seed clouds as those act as cloud nuclei.</p>

<p>Both of these activities, are weather modification activities designed to manipulate cloud formations and rain systems.</p>

<p>Those are NOT the same as the atmospheric aerosol spraying of particulate matter to mitigate the effects of global warming.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6r0GqbH9Os&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">Here you go</a>.</p>

<p>Ground water and soil samples which contain the chemical composition of aluminum, strontium, barium, and other elements in coal ash serve as direct evidence for these &quot;global warming mitigation&quot; activities.</p>

<p>You are a ridiculous propagandist, but know that you are LOSING.</p>

<p>Every day you try and continue your fight against the truth behind global weather manipulation and geo-engineering, is a day wasted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, I must have missed some previous discussions.  What are you claiming here?  You mention geoengineering and have a bunch of links detailing that it is clearly something for which there have been small scale tests and some level of interest, so what is the conspiracy?  Do people actually believe geoengineering straight up doesn&#39;t exist?</p>

<p>Also, how do chemtrails factor in?  I thought that was a pretty discredited idea in that the condensation trails behind jets are exactly what one expects with zero additives.  </p>

<p>Some of the planes are military or private contractor like &#39;Evergreen&#39; (look them up).  others are just added to the fuel of commercial airliners (STADIS-450).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have witnessed trails persisting and forming cloud cover that covers a large region. Who is suggesting that isn&#39;t true?  But that is entirely consistent with the scientific explanations regarding persistent contrails, as reported in the scientific literature for as long as there&#39;s been high-altitude air travel.</p>

<p>Consider the 1970 paper from the Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences (&quot;Airborne observations of contrail effects on the thermal radiation budget, <a href="http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0469(1970)027%3C0937%3AAOOCEO%3E2.0.CO%3B2">http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0469(1970)027%3C0937%3AAOOCEO%3E2.0.CO%3B2</a> ), stating: &quot;The spreading out of jet contrails into extensive cirrus sheets is a familiar sight. Often, when persistent conditions exist from 25,000 to 40,000 ft, several long contrails increase in number and gradually merge into an almost solid interlaced sheet.&quot; There&#39;s a lot of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;amp;q=persistent+contrail">scientific literature on the topic</a>, from the 1950s to today.</p>

<p>So, to claim (as you said) that &quot;should be no correlation with a plane passing by and the formation of clouds along the path,&quot; is indeed to disbelieve (as I said) &quot;the decades-old explanation from the scientific literature on atmospheric physics, regarding contrail formation and persistence in ice-supersaturated air.&quot; </p>

<p>Why is it that on perfectly clear days with no humidity, I can see two of the same sized planes flying in the sky, with one having a contrail which persistently lasts for about 300 yards or so behind the plane before tapering off ( a short tail which follows the plane and then vanishes, not showing its&#39; entire flight path ), and the other plane seeming to be engaging in atmospheric aerosol spraying, leaving a very thin trail which persists behind it for hours as it slowly expands outwards making the line thicker?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_seeding">Cloud seeding</a> as it is currently practiced isn&#39;t similar in effect to &quot;geoengineering&quot; proposals.  It involves the release of materials into existing clouds, to induce or enhance precipitation.</p>

For gods sakes the history channel played documentaries about Viet Nam, where we actually were able to extend the monsoon season for an additional month, as an attempt to bog down the Ho Chi Minh trail. &quot;Cloud seeding&quot; they called it. To say this technology or... type of weapon, isn&#39;t being used to this day is a skepticism that I will be needing proof of. Good luck with that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is absolute bullshit.  If you look at what most &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; have thought chemtrails are it has always been  geoengineering.  For instance, years ago in a forum I went through a thread and counted up what all the people that believed in chemtrails vs. all the debunkers - the &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; unanimously thought it was geoengineering.  The only people bringing up the idea that &quot;chemtrails&quot; are meant to kill people etc. were debunkers.  It has <em>always</em> been a straw man argument.    </p>

<p>Of course this won&#39;t convince someone like you, because you may notice that you are actually using the strawman argument itself.  And why use the strawman argument in the first place?  Precisely because geoengineering doesn&#39;t sound nutty - in order for you guys to debunk the &quot;chemtrail conspiracy&quot; you have to make it sound like we are talking about something nutty.  </p>

<p>&quot;Tarnishing of the sky: Aerosols will noticeably affect the appearance of the sky, resulting in a potential &quot;whitening&quot; effect, and altered sunsets&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many projects in history we are only now learning about, where unsuspecting populations were exposed to aerosol sprays for various and sometimes very dark reasons. The &#39;Big Thing&#39; now is  Solar Radiation Management - various schemes for dimming the Sun&#39;s intensity. </p>

<p>One of those schemes, called Stratospheric Aerosol Dispersal, would involve spraying substances like aluminium and sulphur into the upper atmosphere where they would drift for up to five years before reentering the weather system. The problem with SAR is that the only way to test it is to do it. And if we do it there&#39;s no turning back. We will have opened a can of worms which can never be closed. It&#39;s insanity. There is a supposed ban on large scale geoengineering but there are exemptions for local cloud busting and &#39;experiments&#39;. So you can be sure they are experimenting the hell out of it.</p>

<p>That&#39;s where the danger is. Ten miles up in the atmosphere where you can&#39;t see it. All the time you spend &#39;Looking Up&#39; at the contrails is a waste of time and energy. They really are just clouds of ice crystals, and their problem is not that they&#39;re poisonous, but the constant haze of cirrus cloud they create which traps heat and adds to global warming.
Contrails are killing the planet. The effect is so subtle we haven&#39;t noticed it yet, but it&#39;s happening. The once-blue skies are now often a haze of artificial cirrus, and it will only get worse as air travel increases.</p>

<p>It would be great if slow heavy lifter airships came along to take over much of air freighting. They would fly at low altitude and never create contrails. But forcing existing aircraft, which have been optimised to operate at 30 to 40,000 feet, to fly lower would certainly increase their fuel consumption. </p>

<p>But it&#39;s either that or we develop a zero-contrail fuel (difficult if not impossible) or we resort to geoengineering to &#39;Cirrus Strip&#39; away the clouds. One way or another we have to make the skies blue again.</p>

It&#39;s insanity, and my worry is that commercial interests are wanting in on the action (if and when it starts in earnest). Other SRM schemes don&#39;t worry me as much. Maritime Cloud Brightening seems fairly benign and controllable, for instance. </p>

<p>Honestly, I just don&#39;t get your level of denial.  You don&#39;t see a huge contradiction in saying there can be schemes done at sea level or higher than 6 miles, but anything between those two levels?  Preposterous.</p>

<p>Read anything about SAD and they also always mention Mt. Pinatubo...can you please explain to me how it is that a volcano on the surface of the earth can measurably cool the Earth&#39; climate, but Airplanes emitting sulfur aerosols would not?

<p>Fine.  Couldn&#39;t agree more.  But you are just full of shit if you think these are simply the same old contrails we&#39;ve always seen.  I used to bike commute to work everyday for over 10 years past an aiport.  Never once in the first 8 years did I see a plane leave a trail that persisted and spread out to cover a huge portion of the sky in white.  They clearly made some intentional change.      </p>

<p>But just keep buying (and selling) the Koch Brothers bullshit pal...that&#39;s what you are doing everytime you repeat the lie that contrails are the same as they&#39;ve always been.  I at least hope you are getting paid for this shit.  </p>

<p>If you read up on the Mt Pinatubo eruption you&#39;ll see that the sulphur went straight up 25 miles into the stratosphere. That&#39;s what happens with SAD as well. Putting sulphur into the atmosphere at airliner height would just make acid rain in a short time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a very unfair response. I admire her whistleblowing; she is very brave to speak out about the strange chemicals being brought onto her base. But at the same time, the military was quite right to sack her as a security risk. I watched evrything about her until quite recently. She never claimed to have any idea what the chemicals were for, and back then she never associated them with aircraft dispersal.  As she said (and I quoted) her whistleblowing was about GROUND contamination. I will watch your vid to see if her message has suffered mission creep. </p>

<p>She only became a media whore AFTER accepting a few invitations to speak. She liked the attention. Good for her. But when she starts talking about chemtrails she loses most of her audience in favour of thrilling a few conspiracy minded people.</p>

<p>edit: I had to google Sofia Smallstrom. She seems to be an advocate of every conspiracy theory under the sun. Such people lack any critical thinking skills and have a high degree of gullibility.</p>

<p>edit 2: How am I &quot;interfering with not only her right to speak, but our right to hear her speak out on this important issue&quot;? I encourage people to read EVERYTHING on chemtrails, if they&#39;re interested. Even Wigington&#39;s website.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So here&#39;s my personal conspiracy theory about geo-engineering.</p>

<p>When 9/11 happened, and the US shut down its air traffic for a few days, day-time temperatures spiked noticeably enough to attract the attention of scientists. Theories emerged that aircraft contrails were having a cooling effect on the atmosphere, which was negated when they stopped flying during that brief window.</p>

<p>So, we&#39;ve got a system designed here, to ensure that global temperatures go up when air traffic ceases. What could cause global commercial air traffic to cease? A major war, for starters. Now, what if it&#39;s a nuclear war? Now you&#39;re dealing with the prospect of nuclear winter.</p>

<p>What if our atmosphere has been carefully calibrated to ensure humankind&#39;s survival in the event of a nuclear war? What if someone with a lot more brain power than us has done the calculations, and ensured that any civilization-endangering temperature drop caused by a nuclear winter is offset (at least partially) by a spike in temperature caused by the withdrawal of the modulating effect of commercial air traffic upon the atmosphere?</p>

<p>Probably talkin&#39; out my ass here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well i know in certain areas of the u.s. you absolutely dont want to drink the water. back where i lived in wisconsin the water was full of minerals, fluoride, etc and you could tell after drinking it how it &quot;clouded&quot; your mind, not as sharp, etc. after i moved to hawaii, breathing fresh air, drinking clean water, and eating natural foods has really changed the way i think. it feels like this is the way i should feel. </p>

<p>those chemicals in the air, in the water, in food really hinder the consciousness of people and they dont realize it because those harmful chemicals accumulate in small amounts over time. but after being away from all of that it feels great. and by far the strongest of those factors was water. get a filter for your taps and even your shower. all i can say about that</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;d ever read a word I said before attacking me you&#39;d know that I am deeply worried about geoengineering and the effect it could have on the planet. Schemes like Stratospheric Aerosol Dispersal can&#39;t be properly tested before putting them into action, and then there will be no way back. It&#39;s insanity, and my worry is that commercial interests are wanting in on the action (if and when it starts in earnest). Other SRM schemes don&#39;t worry me as much. Maritime Cloud Brightening seems fairly benign and controllable, for instance. </p>

<p>But none of the schemes being suggested or even tested involve spraying huge 200-mile clouds of aluminium or anything else at six miles altitude, where airliners fly. SAD is done at twice that altitude, and MCB at sea level.</p>

<p>So the white trails across the sky really are just clouds of ice crystals, and their problem is not that they&#39;re poisonous, but the constant haze of cirrus cloud they create which traps heat and adds to global warming.</p>

<p>Contrails are killing the planet. The effect is so subtle we haven&#39;t noticed it yet, but it&#39;s happening. The once-blue skies are now often a haze of artificial cirrus, and it will only get worse as air travel increases. One way or another we have to make the skies blue again.</p>

<p>What a preposterous thing to say when you already acknowledge that global warming is real, or is that just a scare story too.  Besides, you&#39;ve already acknowledged that at least some geoengineering has taken place, which you may retract since you are a liar.  </p>

<p>Do you honestly think that all the American politicians are too stupid to realize that global warming is real?  Do you honestly think they don&#39;t realize that something has to be done to stop it?  </p>

<p>Edit:  and are you really so out of touch with reality that you expect people to believe that the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo went directly 25 miles up into the atmosphere?  </p>
