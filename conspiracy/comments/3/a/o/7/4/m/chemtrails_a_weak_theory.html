       So, it is known that sometimes, airplanes seed clouds by adding chemicals into their contrails. That is well known. It is also speculated that these cloud seeding chemicals can cause health problems/environmental harm. That is a valid concern.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I am not so sure on the credibility of any group putting mind control/intentionally harmful chemicals into contrails. You know why? Because everyone, rich or poor, government or not, breathes the same air. And why would the government/corporations want to harm themselves by poisoning the very air that they breath themselves?

       It's actually not known that "sometimes, airplanes seed clouds by adding chemicals into their contrails."  Cloud seeding is a real thing, but it's not related to contrails. It involves releasing materials into existing clouds, to induce or enhance precipitation.  The most common aerial methods involve

       that are attached to the wings or body of the aircraft.

       Strictly speculation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The short answer is that the people who can order and fund such outsized projects  probably feel invincible  because of their probable extreme levels of ego.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cloud seeding isn't that important because it isn't that widespread or effective. What is more important is geo engineering. Geo engineering is done because of the ideas of radically egotistical minds that think they have the right to secretly change the entire atmosphere experimentally. They wish to change the reflectivity or  albedo,  of the earth in order to ward off some of the sunlight using alumina  or nano scale  aluminum oxide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although they have the insane ego and criminal mindset to think they have the right to do this it is ineffective for their purpose and actually does the opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rather than reflect heat because the material isn't very reflective and the particles aren't oriented in any one direction, the material traps heat. producing the 'global warming' that they really wanted in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       This way they can have their usual Problem Reaction,Solution in which they can turn the problem up or down or off at their bidding.
      </p>
      <p>
       The insanity becomes a nightmare because although the military will assure you, if you ever get into a debate over this as I once did. that the albedo enhancing material "Never Comes Down"
      </p>
      <p>
       What goes up, must.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has been suspected for many decades that aluminum breathed by humans migrates to the pituitary gland and produces Alzheimer's Disease.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter their current  denial and the fact that no clear proof exists about all of this it is nevertheless true that Alzheimer's Disease is suddenly the number Three killer of people in the U.S. with no other explanation forthcoming.

       a growing list of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s dementia, Parkinson’s disease, and Lou Gehrig’s disease (ALS) are strongly related to exposure to environmental aluminum.

       They do not. Cloud seeding is done at 5 to 10,000 feet altitude. Contrails don't start to form until a plane reaches 23,000 feet.

       True. Aerodynamic contrails can form at any altitude, but they only last a few seconds. As you say, they come off airliners landing in foul weather, but fast fighter jets can make them in fair weather by performing low-level high speed turns, like at airshows.

       Wrong, for two reasons. 1, they aren't chemtrailing the entire planet, for the most part just major population centers, not holiday estates/rich areas necessarily, and 2) chelation therapy is amazing, and can remove toxins accumulated, particularly if they are known toxins and/or if an antidote has been developed.

       I think otherwise.  It would be impossible to pin point where the chemicals make landfall if spraying is happening.  Lets say you wanted the chemicals to make landfall on west coast of Africa, you would have to do the spraying from the east coast or Midwest of the US. Even then the winds could take it to Europe or the jet stream could take it as far as China or even right back to the place it was sprayed. There is also the problem of dilution, the longer the chemicals are in the air the more spread out they become.  If spread out enough the chemicals would be in such low levels once they make landfall that they would have no effect.  The only way to get around that would be to stray a lot but there is a problem with that to, spray mass quantities would insure that the chemicals were land everywhere.  Meaning, no place would be safe.

       This all relies on them spraying at very high altitude, that is not necessarily the case.

      <p>
       That is an assumption that if they are spread out, that they have no effect. You don't know what they're spraying if they are spraying intentionally, it would not be a great leap of logic to assume that if they have a multi billion dollar spraying program, they are using chemicals that are still effective even when diluted.

       It depends on what your goal is. If we are talking general aerial distribution, 10 thousand feet is appropriate, especially if it is happening in large numbers, and ESPECIALLY if it is put directly into the jet fuel.

       We aren't talking high concentrations here, saturation is the goal, not concentration.

       Then it has nothing to do with the airliner contrails at 30,000 feet. I don't deny there have been schemes to spray various populations with various stuff for decades. They probably still happen (stuff like releasing inert pathogens into subway systems to see how they disperse, etc). But none of that proves that 'chemtrails' exist.

       30 thousand feet is also appropriate, just not as accurate. Not that it particularly matters, given the sheer number of aircraft flying over major population centers on a daily basis.

       If that was the case the planet would now be coloured white from the hundreds of thousands of tons of aluminium oxide from the 'chemtrails' which have been left by aircraft since aircraft first flew high enough to create them, which was in1922. There is zero evidence for the claim that contrails are really 'chemtrails' containing metals and poison.

       Never given this theory much attention. but it seems to be showing up a lot lately..

       If there was a conspiracy to it, it would make more sense to just pollute the ground water with chemicals added to the seeded clouds. Contaminating the atmosphere with airborne poison just seems too noticeable( smells, color,etc.).

       It'd probably make even more sense to just add it to food. Slip it into anything processed. If the government was behind it, or even big corporation, it would make all the sense in the world because nobody would be cracking down on it.

       No it's not. 90% of the population would call you a "chemtard" or a "tinfoil hat wearing crazy" if you said that. Don't believe it? Today at work or school or in the line at Starbucks, strike up a conversation about Geoengineering. Ask someone if they know that cloud seeding is real and it's going on right now. I think you'll find that Geoengineering is anything but "well known".

       Barely ANYONE thinks this is happening. This is the small small minority of people. It's a strawman that the media hang up and beat to death when someone tries to talk about Geoengineering. It would do everyone in this sub good to stop saying the word "chemtrails" all together, it's a loaded term that's been turned into a disinfo dog whistle. Only say "Geoengineering".

       I mean, if they wanted to 'mind control' or 'poison' us they would need an astronomical amount of planes and chemicals to douse us all in it, and that's taking into consideration most of it gets dispersed immensely before it hits the ground.

       Not a problem, given the government's black ops budget, in the tens of billions of dollars, especially if planes are specially designed for it.

       That's precisely the point, it disperses, spreads over wide areas. You act as if dispersal means it just doesn't exist anymore, what that word means is that it spreads out...
