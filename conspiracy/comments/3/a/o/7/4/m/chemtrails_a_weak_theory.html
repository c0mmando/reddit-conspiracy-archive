    <div class="md"><p>Strictly speculation.</p>

<p>The short answer is that the people who can order and fund such outsized projects  probably feel invincible  because of their probable extreme levels of ego.</p>

<p>Cloud seeding isn&#39;t that important because it isn&#39;t that widespread or effective. What is more important is geo engineering. Geo engineering is done because of the ideas of radically egotistical minds that think they have the right to secretly change the entire atmosphere experimentally. They wish to change the reflectivity or  albedo,  of the earth in order to ward off some of the sunlight using alumina  or nano scale  aluminum oxide. </p>

<p>Although they have the insane ego and criminal mindset to think they have the right to do this it is ineffective for their purpose and actually does the opposite.</p>

<p>Rather than reflect heat because the material isn&#39;t very reflective and the particles aren&#39;t oriented in any one direction, the material traps heat. producing the &#39;global warming&#39; that they really wanted in the first place.</p>

<p>This way they can have their usual Problem Reaction,Solution in which they can turn the problem up or down or off at their bidding.</p>

<p>The insanity becomes a nightmare because although the military will assure you, if you ever get into a debate over this as I once did. that the albedo enhancing material &quot;Never Comes Down&quot;</p>

<p>What goes up, must.</p>

<p>It has been suspected for many decades that aluminum breathed by humans migrates to the pituitary gland and produces Alzheimer&#39;s Disease.</p>

<p>No matter their current  denial and the fact that no clear proof exists about all of this it is nevertheless true that Alzheimer&#39;s Disease is suddenly the number Three killer of people in the U.S. with no other explanation forthcoming. </p>

<p>a growing list of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s dementia, Parkinson’s disease, and Lou Gehrig’s disease (ALS) are strongly related to exposure to environmental aluminum.</p>

<p>They do not. Cloud seeding is done at 5 to 10,000 feet altitude. Contrails don&#39;t start to form until a plane reaches 23,000 feet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True. Aerodynamic contrails can form at any altitude, but they only last a few seconds. As you say, they come off airliners landing in foul weather, but fast fighter jets can make them in fair weather by performing low-level high speed turns, like at airshows.</p>

<p>Wrong, for two reasons. 1, they aren&#39;t chemtrailing the entire planet, for the most part just major population centers, not holiday estates/rich areas necessarily, and 2) chelation therapy is amazing, and can remove toxins accumulated, particularly if they are known toxins and/or if an antidote has been developed. </p>

<p>I think otherwise.  It would be impossible to pin point where the chemicals make landfall if spraying is happening.  Lets say you wanted the chemicals to make landfall on west coast of Africa, you would have to do the spraying from the east coast or Midwest of the US. Even then the winds could take it to Europe or the jet stream could take it as far as China or even right back to the place it was sprayed. There is also the problem of dilution, the longer the chemicals are in the air the more spread out they become.  If spread out enough the chemicals would be in such low levels once they make landfall that they would have no effect.  The only way to get around that would be to stray a lot but there is a problem with that to, spray mass quantities would insure that the chemicals were land everywhere.  Meaning, no place would be safe.</p>

<p>This all relies on them spraying at very high altitude, that is not necessarily the case.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That is an assumption that if they are spread out, that they have no effect. You don&#39;t know what they&#39;re spraying if they are spraying intentionally, it would not be a great leap of logic to assume that if they have a multi billion dollar spraying program, they are using chemicals that are still effective even when diluted. </p>

<p>If that was the case the planet would now be coloured white from the hundreds of thousands of tons of aluminium oxide from the &#39;chemtrails&#39; which have been left by aircraft since aircraft first flew high enough to create them, which was in1922.

<p>No it&#39;s not. 90% of the population would call you a &quot;chemtard&quot; or a &quot;tinfoil hat wearing crazy&quot; if you said that. Don&#39;t believe it? Today at work or school or in the line at Starbucks, strike up a conversation about Geoengineering. Ask someone if they know that cloud seeding is real and it&#39;s going on right now.

<p>Barely ANYONE thinks this is happening. This is the small small minority of people. It&#39;s a strawman that the media hang up and beat to death when someone tries to talk about Geoengineering. It would do everyone in this sub good to stop saying the word &quot;chemtrails&quot; all together, it&#39;s a loaded term that&#39;s been turned into a disinfo dog whistle.
