       I realize that we're all afraid of global government. The TPP fast track scares the shit out of me. Without some form of international cooperation on this issue though, we're all fucked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also for the 'skeptics' on this page, read up on ice core samples that go back hundreds of thousands of years and show unprecedented concentrations of both CO2 and methane since the Industrial Revolution. Yes, there have been natural fluctuations in our climate thru time with Ice ages and whatnot, but we're currently headed towards more extreme events because of how humanity has altered the environment via fossil fuel consumption and mass deforestation.

       Because it hasn't been verified.
      </p>
      <p>
       CO2 follows temperature increases in the the historical record by hundreds of years: the world warms giving more habitat for life, which leads to more CO2.
      </p>
      <p>
       CO2 was predicted to have a positive feedback, the feedback was found to be negative: water vapor doesn't add to warming, it mitigates it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Greenhouse gases act as coolants in the upper atmosphere. This has been known for a long time, but confirmed by NASA.
      </p>
      <p>
       No predicted hot spot has been found. Many studies have attempted to find one, and one recent studies claims they have. They used a statistics tool called kriging which can basically let you find any data you want.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ice caps were predicted to melt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Coupled with all the false claims, Mike's nature trick, adjusted data, the theory is just hard to support.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 97% figure includes self-described skeptics.
      </p>
      <p>
       To the real reason. Climate changists abhor solutions. They won't talk about them. For example thorium, which could significantly reduce CO2 emissions isn't discussed. When reports come out about off the grid folks getting hassled, no climate changists speak out.
      </p>
      <p>
       They want a global tax. The big six oil companies want it. The pope wants it, Obama wants it.
      </p>
      <p>
       A global tax means a global government with global enforcement. This was described in The Report from Iron Mountain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most opposition is controlled. It shouldn't matter to anyone who can follow the scientific method, but does confuse the issue. Keep it simple. They put the cart before the horse for historical data and all their predictions have failed and we have already reached peak oil. They won't suggest solutions to what they describe as an urgent catastrophic problem.

       This is a good response.  We are absolutely destroying our environment with chemicals.  But the environmental movement has been co-opted into a false crusade against CO2 which is just being used as another system of control.

       Climate change means different things to different people now. Some people think it's just pollution, some people think CO2 in the atmosphere causes the global temperature to go up higher than it has ever been causing massive floods, hurricanes, and impending doom.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, define independent science. Is this the science that says high CO2 levels
       <em>
        cause climate change
       </em>
       ? Or do you mean trends and projections based on recorded empirical data over time?

       i have a question for you. why did they change the name from global warming to climate change?
      </p>
      <p>
       p.s. do you know co2 comprises less than 0.2 (zero point two) % or 1in 500 of earths atmosphere? do you really believe a 0.1 or even a 0.5% increase is going to have any significant impact on global temperatures? if you do you must have been looking out the window during science and math. carbon taxes? rofl, please.

       Because we feel powerless in the face of  such a terrifying threat. Due to this sense of powerlessness and uncertainty, a part of our brain called the amygdala kicks into gear, which causes us to see the threat in such a way that we know the "real truth" while other's don't. Thus a sense of control and comfort is achieved.  As far as ignoring independent scientific data, people will ignore this due to something called confirmation bias (this is the idea that we filter out new information that conflicts with our preexisting views).

       Yeah I agree that some are, but I think it's a minority.  Is it plausible that Tupac, Elvis, Bin Laden, Jim Morrison, and Hitler are all still alive? Are the Reptilians, Free Masons, Illuminati, and Bilderbergs  all leading the New World Order? So out of all of the different conspiracy theories, what percentage of them  are actually true?

       I agree that global warming is going on but what are the solutions. The right and left both want a carbon tax. The Pope is calling for a "Global Organization" to decide what happens. Don't buy the bullshit.

       I phrased it as global cooperation as opposed to a global organization with the same worries in mind- what is so terrible about a carbon tax other than international cooperation? as long as we don't unify EVERYthing, what's the harm? We already have UN departments for economic and social affairs, drugs and crime, trade and development... I get that this crowd trusts no establishment, and for good reason, but I guess I'm just confused why lots of conspiracy theorists diverge on this point.

       What is an extra tax going to fix? Global warming is happening so we need to pay the government more money? Why? Have they promised to invest it in new technologies? Have they promised to start phasing out fossil fuel? New public transportation projects? No. They hide technology that could make gas and oil obsolete.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's an analogy: Let's say we work together in a building and the boss comes out and yells, "The building is on fire three flights up!" Most of the people (including me) agree that the building must be on fire but some people don't believe because they hate the boss. Since we both believe the building is on fire we disregard the naysayers. Now, I yell "What do we do?" If the boss says, "The building is on fire so all of the women in here need to suck my dick and let me fuck them", what would your reaction be?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's exactly how I feel about the global warming fraud. Is there a fire in the building/global warming? Yes. Should the solution be to suck the boss' dick/Pay ANOTHER fucking tax even though 30% is taken out of my paycheck every week? No. That's why global warming is a fraud, not because it is fake, but because the "solutions" aren't solutions at all, they are bullshit traps that people fall into because they are afraid and confused.

       i appreciate your passion on the issue, but i think your analogy is a bit of a stretch. I agree that the tax must come with guarantees of some or all of those things. but I also hope that the tax comes at a greater expense to corporations and businesses that have benefited from fossil fuels, rather than individuals. I think it's a long shot given how little faith i have in our gov't but I think attempting it is better than dismissing all solutions as "sucking your boss's dick"

       The planets actually cooling down.. The sun goes through a 206 year cycle ... Just like our earth has its seasons. The sun has been getting so much more colder then it usually is but we are seeing intense hot periods due to the activity of the sun. There's nothing verified about global warming. They're gonna use it to tax each and everyone of us in the future for it so don't worry.
