<p>I did read a story about how George W Bush bought a ton of land in some country in South America. People were wondering about the purchase because the land itself didn&#39;t seem to have any obvious value in terms of mineral wealth, location etc.</p>

<p>One thing it did have was a huge supply of fresh water in the form of rivers and lakes. Now keep that thought in mind as you recall Bush&#39;s connections to the oil industry. </p>

<p>Is it possible that he and his friends know how bad things are going to get (because of fracking) in another couple of decades? Is it possible that he used this knowledge to buy billions of dollars worth of water for a few million? </p>

<p>Bush himself might not reap the full benefits, but his descendants surely will. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep! Bush and his daughters purchased close to 300,000 acres of land in Paraguay. Beneath is one of the worlds largest aquifers (acuifer guarano [sp?]). It&#39;s enough water to last the world like 150 years and the infamous oil baron has gotten his and his brood&#39;s claws into the water already.</p>

<p>Definitely the top dogs know what&#39;s the estimated outcome of the future so they are investing now. If there ever is a real global opposition against these guys where people get together to overthrow and punish them for screwing up everything, I think it will most likely start with water.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah how about we just recognize that no one can own land air water animals plants humans anything... I mean... ultimately that&#39;s what is causing all war poverty and all the things that spawn from poverty. The truth is, he can buy all the land and water he wants, but it&#39;s not his, it never was, and it never will be. It&#39;s ours. Unless you created it yourself, you do not own it, and you can lie to yourself about it for lifetimes but it doesn&#39;t change the fact that it&#39;s not yours and it doesn&#39;t change the fact that it&#39;s wrong and it doesn&#39;t change the fact that the harm such beliefs cause will inevitably be a price we will all have to pay at some point. The original Americans were right, and we slaughtered them for our beliefs, that should tell you something about the nature of this belief.</p>

<p>I know people will probably downvote this, and that&#39;s fine, but lets just keep going down this road and see where it leads. Eventually we will summon the darkness we are unwilling to recognize. Eventually evolution will force us to see the ugly truth of ourselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, Paraguay. I&#39;m glad someone else is familiar with this story. I was halfway expecting someone to call me out on lack of sources for this one.</p>

<p>This is how they stay on top of the rest of us. Advance knowledge of how things are going to go. By the time anyone else realizes what&#39;s up, they&#39;ve already got a 3 decade long head start.</p>

<p>On a positive note. If you know that water is going to get expensive in the near future, act accordingly based on your own resources. If you see a company starting up that supplies water, or water filtration etc. Buy stock in that company. You might be getting in on the ground floor of the Exxon of the 21st century.</p>

<p>As for me. I live in a country with no oil industry and lots of rivers/fresh water. Hopefully my kids will be OK.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, there are different types of fracturing.  One is acid fracturing and another is hydraulic fracturing.  </p>

<p>Many anti-fracking sites confuse the two in an attempt to make their rants more believable.</p>

<p>Many pro-fracking sites downplay the two to make them both seem safer than they are.</p>

<p>Lesson 1: A drill bit goes into the Earth and drills and drills and drills until it hits oil or gas, RIGHT?  </p>

<p>No! in fact it is rare to actually hit an oil or gas dome.  The well is actually drilled and the oil or gas is produced by permeating through the rock.  This is accomplished either by permeating through the rock (literally) in the case of sand stone, or seeping through fissures between layers of less permeable rock.</p>

<p>In both cases, the oil production is limited by how much pressure it takes to push said oil through the rock or fissures.  Another limiting factor is the size of the well bore.  Suppose the hole is 12 inches in diameter.  Well, you can only produce oil through the sides of the well bore.  A larger well bore in the exact same location would produce more oil.  </p>

<p>However, drilling through hundreds of feet of rock with a larger bit is expensive and slow.  Essentially, doubling the size of the well bore would require removing 4 times as much material.  4 times as many drill bits, larger pipe which is heavier, a larger rig to support the heavier pipe, more labor since the larger bit will drill slower etc.  </p>

<p>The down side is doubling the bore size will cost more than 4 times as much money to drill, but it will only produce twice as much oil.  This is because the volume of the well bore is pi<em>radius</em>radius<em>depth and the production surface is 2</em>PI<em>radius</em>depth.</p>

<p>Also, the production surface increase is only important in the production zone, so all the other material removal bears no improvement to production.  So, the added cost is more than 4 times and the production increase is typically far less than double since the production zone is usually only a small length of the well bore.</p>

<p>Suppose we could drill a small hole down to the production zone, then enlarge the hole to 20 times its size once we reach the production zone.  We have solved many issues associated with drilling a 20 foot diameter hole.  </p>

<p>During the drilling of a well, mud is pumped down the well to lift the cuttings off of the bottom.  this mud serves several purposes besides that, but that is its main purpose.</p>

<p>ACID FRACKING
Acid fracking essentially does just that.  Once the well bore is drilled, acid is back pumped into the well.  When it hits the production zone, it significantly increases how much permeates into the rock.    This is because the production zone is more permeable than the non-production zones.  For a conceptual idea, assume only the production zone is permeable.  So, acid is pumped down and when it hits permeable rock, it flows into the rock.  the acid reaction dissolves elements that bond the particles of sand together.  </p>

<p>When the acid has done its thing, the well is switched back to full circulation. The sand starts falling away and is carried back up the well bore along with the mud.  The result is a a huge cavern is opened up in the production zone.</p>

<p>Now, when the well is put into production, it has a huge surface area in the production zone in which oil flows into.  Not only that, but the distance to the oil dome is reduced (by the radius of the cavern) so it also takes less pressure to push oil through the rock.</p>

<p>Acid fracking typically does not take place during the drilling operation though.  It can be, but it is more often performed after production has started to decline in the well.</p>

<p>chemicals used in acid fracking varies, but typically include salt (fresh water will really fuck a well up) Hydrochloric acid (HCl) and a real nasty Hydroflouric acid (HCl-Hf.  HCL is used in swimming pool cleaning and poses the most threat during application.  It readily spends itself and commonly breaks into water and Chlorine...just like what is in a swimming pool.</p>

<p>HCl-HF is a different beast though.  It is Amonium Hydrogen Diflouride dissolved in Hydrochloric acid.  This shit will eat glass...which is why it is so effective in sandstone production zones.</p>

<p>Both acids spend into harmless byproducts though.  Hcl-Hf is commonly sold as a rust and lime remover called Whink.  I am not advocating the safety of this stuff.  DO NOT get that shit on you.</p>

<p>More Later...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very good explanation.  Actually I worked on workover rigs out of Williston in the early 80&#39;s.  We fracked about 50 to75 percent of the wells just drilled. All of the fracking fluid was &quot;swabbed&quot; back.  We used to get covered in the stuff.  I am not sure in our area where the production zone averaged 9k feet would affect a water well at th most, correct me if I am wrong, 800 feet.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It largely depends on the area, but water wells are limited in depth for several reasons.  One is that centrifugal pumps are limited in head pressure.  Down hole pumps have to over come a hydrostatic head.  Top end pumps are severely limited in depth because water can only be lifted to a hydrostatic limit of one atmosphere. So a top end pump, regardless of design, can only lift water a little over 30 feet.</p>

<p>The latter limit cannot be overcome by pump design, but the former can be.  Positive displacement pumps can achieve enormous head pressures, but they are difficult to design to fit down a 6 inch hole.  Even then, they would likely only be a single arm pump.  Single arm pumps have large surges which make them less viable for direct water supplies.  So, to get around that, the water well would need some sort of surge pot or water tower to smooth out the surges.</p>

<p>Centrifugal pumps start bypassing at a fairly low head pressure, but they are good for high rate, low pressure movement.  Positive displacement pumps have very high bypass pressures, but they start cavitating at high speeds.  So, they are good for high pressure movements but not so good at high flow rates.  they can be designed for both, but they get considerably more expensive as the arms get larger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eventhough &quot;acid&quot; fracturing sounds dangerous and everything, it is actually fairly safe.  There is no scientific evidence that it is causing earth quakes.  And if its chemicals are getting into well water the you have a pretty deep friggin well.  But, suppose your well IS getting chemicals from an acid fracking operation...your well would most likely be getting oil and or gas in it anyway...even before the oil well was drilled.</p>

<p>Now get this, suppose you had a water well that was getting oil in it from a nearby dome.  by increasing production in that dome, the oil wells are actually relieving dome pressure.  this causes the well to produce less oil and also DECREASES the amount of oil leaking into your water well.</p>

<p>So, acid fracking is probably not creating any real issues with ground water.</p>

<p>Also, the caverns opened up under ground by acid fracking are hundreds of feet down. modern vertical rigs can go thousands of feet deep.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>HYDRAULIC Fracturing:
Now, suppose the production zone was not sand stone but something harder and less permeable.  Oil and gas would be produced through fissures instead of through permeable rock like sandstone.  Some fissures would be in the horizontal plane and some would not.</p>

<p>Now, suppose these fissures are one eighth inch tall.  Oil production would be limited by that one eighth inch tall gap.  Now suppose we could increase that gap to one fourth inch.  Oil production would increase accordingly.</p>

<p>Hydraulic fracturing does just that. By back pumping the well with enough pressure, the Earth actually rises up a fraction of an inch and allows those fissures to increase in size.  the problem is, when we relieve that pressure, the fissures close back up.</p>

<p>So, we need to open the fissures up, then put something in them to hold them open. That is called propant.  Many anti-fracking sites talk about the dangers of propant, but it is nothing more than sand that has been sorted to a uniform size.  It is typically dredged from rivers and sorted in various ways.  It needs to be uniform so it all stays in place in the fissure.  Suppose one big piece of propant holds the fissure open wide, all of the smaller propant would be washed out when the oil came through.  So, uniformity is fairly important.  </p>

<p>Now, propant CAN be treated with chemicals, but propant itself is nothing more than sand.</p>

<p>Now, we have a way to hold the fissure open.  All we need now is a way to get it down there.  we could just put it in water, but by the time it gets 15,000 feet down the drill pipe, it will be clumped together and not uniformly distributed.</p>

<p>To fix this, the propant is carried down in a gel.  Gel compositions vary based on purpose, but a great many of them are made from HydroxyEthyl Cellulose..commonly used in food and makeup and a host of other things that need thickening up.  It is derived from either corn or cotton typically.</p>

<p>Now, we have a thick medium to carry the propant down the well evenly.  the problem here is that the gel is much thicker than gas and many crude oils.  Ideally we want the propant placed and the gel to turn to a low viscosity fluid so it can be displaced from fissures easily.  To accomplish this, a &quot;breaker&quot; is put in the gel immediately before it is sent down the well.  Breakers are designed to be time or temperature activated so the status of the gel is known.  Many times the breaker is deposited on the propant to simplify the operation since they can usually be added at the same time.</p>

<p>So the whole process is gel is created with designed properties.  Propant is added, breaker is added and it is sent down the well.  As it reaches the production zone, the well is closed in and the well pressure is increased to force the fissures open.  the gel enters the fissures, carrying the propant with it.  The breaker starts to react with the gel and the propant falls out onto the bottom of the fissure.  After a time, the pressure is released from the well and the fissures attempt to close but the propant holds them open.  </p>

<p>the production is started and oil starts heading to the well bore.  as it does, it pushes the broken gel back into the well bore and to the surface.</p>

<p>The earthquake theory is that forcing the fissures open is causing earthquakes.  But part of that assumption is that hydraulic fracturing turns the rock to fine particles and brings them to the surface (this is confused with acid fracturing) which it doesn&#39;t do.</p>

<p>Granted, there are some cases in which earthquakes can be felt around shallow hydraulic fractures, but it is usually not too cost effective to frack shallow wells.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gel compositions vary but can be made from cotton cellulose corn cellulose or diesel. Many proprietary formulas exist, but most are derivatives of these.</p>

<p>Of course diesel essentially came from a well. so pumping it back into a well is not really as nefarious as it sounds.  There are additives put in diesel, but most are put in at the refinery of distribution center and are in almost all diesel..including what is sold at gas stations.  Of course there are other additives added during fracking, but the vast majority of those listed on anti-fracking sites are also in the diesel burned in semi trucks. Many of the gelling agents for diesel based gels are actually just sodium bentonite ...commonly known as clay.</p>

<p>Bacteriacides/biocides are used to prevent staged gel from breaking too soon.  They essentially sterilize the gel so its properties remain stable until proppant is in place.  These Bacteriacides are proprietary but are mostly all the same set of chemicals.  </p>

<p>Many of the &quot;chemicals&quot; pumped down a well during fracturing (mainly salts) are put in the fracking fluid for a very specific purpose.  See, when putting gel down a well, you want to make sure you know the properties of the gel under well conditions.  So, in order to do this, a sample of well water (water trapped in the well with the oil) is analyzed.  This gives the gel designer the chemical composition of the water already in the well.  This is used to produce a synthetic brine that closely matches the water in the well. This brine is then used to create the gel recipe.  this process helps make sure the gel remains stable until the time comes to break it back down.  Virtually all &quot;chlorides&quot; serve this purpose.  So in short, these pose no more of a risk than the untapped oil dome did before fracking.</p>

<p>No fresh water is pumped down a well.  It MUST be synthesized into at least a compatible brine.  Putting fresh water into an oil well is a sure way to plug it up for ever.  the fresh water causes certain clays to swell and plug up holes in sandstones.  Once they are plugged, it is extremely difficult to unplug them since you cannot back pump into them anymore.</p>

<p>Do you even know how Fracking works? Large amounts of water are required for the fracking process itself, which in turn permanently contaminates the water rendering it useless because, ya know, irreversable radioactivity/toxicity and what-not. On average, millions of gallons of water are used per well.</p>

<p>Stop talking about things you know absolutely nothing about. It&#39;s embarrassing...</p>
