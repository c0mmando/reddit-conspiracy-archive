        U.S. Constitution

      <p>
       The NWO-Zionist shit infesting the U.S. gov absolutely intend TPP to create global governance.  It is being negotiated in secret because they can, and because it is completely rewriting the law of the land.
      </p>
      <p>
       For reference, article 2 on Presidential power:
      </p>
      <blockquote>

        He shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur;

       No. If you make a claim and someone asks for proof then you provide it, not this "you can google it yourself" shit. Also, there're different sources of knowledge that contradict each other, so debates are a good way to shed light on incorrect details. Since I claimed your sources as worthless all you do is attacking me instead of my point.

       I did check them but as these sites are generally spreading bullshit I rather not believe what they say.

        RT: anything close to a government should automatically be suspicious and they have repeatedly been caught lying

        salon, huffpost and rolling stone are well known feminist clickbait shitholes
       </li>
       <li>
        infowars: I've seen it slammed as disinfo at multiple places (even here), it's also too sensationalist to my taste (another red flag)

       I trust nothing blindly. I'm yet to come across a news site that's actually neutral (reuters maybe coming close). Apart from that: no obvious and overwhelming political bias, respect towards readers (not the condescending tone of leftist media) and preferably containing/sourcing proof that can be scientifically tested.

       It's good to see? No, not really. Its not good to see history repeating itself. Wherever you are from will eventually collapse and you will be enslaved by a system that's worse than the system enslaving us all now anyway.

       What I meant: no big empire lasts forever. Surely a new big tyranny will rise (and there're a few already) but this one will fall. I think I'll pretty much feel a war with Russia (if it happens) because I live close to Ukraine, so I might not even be alive when (if) the NWO comes to fruit. We'll see.

       Uhh, so you wanna be forced to fight wars to preserve our prosperity...which we already had, but was sold out for short term profits....you wanna be forced to fight for that? Because they actually pay soldiers at the moment. When the money dies, you'll be forced to fight. It'll be worse than the draft. THEY should fight this war, not us. We aren't profiting from the down fall of America, they are. Go right ahead and volunteer to fight their wars for them while they sit back and laugh at you.

       We need to make it so corporations are not considered "people"...we needed to do it long ago. This is blatantly usurping our personal freedom in the name of making it easier for international corporations (NOT living people) to establish hegemony over pretty much everything. Fuck this.

       Interesting, although wiki has already spelled out the loophole:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        although the case itself was with regard to an executive agreement, not a "treaty" in the U.S. legal sense, and the agreement itself has never been ruled unconstitutional.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So that will be another opportunity for the Supreme Court to shit on the Constitution and legislate from the bench.

       Such an agreement would be a treaty. But the TPP affects governance within borders for countries. To use a real potential example, if New Zealand has a law saying no company can charge more than X wallaby-dollars for a medication, under their law, that's an internal rule. This agreement would essentially undermine such laws, giving a corporation such as Pfizer authorization to sue to remove said law as an impediment to their business. This is therefore not a normal treaty because it shunts legislative control from the people and their government to corporate actors.

       That's standard though, most countries are part of various treaties that affects governance within borders. The EU, the UN, the WTO are all built on treaties that affect member countries' governance, not to mention the dozens of trade treaties most countries are in that standardize various industry regulations.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a country feels like the negatives outweigh the positives they can leave the treaty and have thier independence back.

       Not if in so doing they violate, say, a country's constitution. Let's go back to the US. Let's say Blizzard approaches a TPP tribunal(which is not covered, if you were wondering, by any of the statutes in this country, nor does it have any of the protections or flexibility of our own legal system) and that tribunal, which consists of interchangeable corporate attourneys taking turns as advocates and judges, decides that Penny Arcade making a comic about a Dickwolf quest in WoW doesn't fall under fair use. Now in a US court, Blizzard could still make their case, but PA'd be protected, it would fail because of our system of precedent and case law. In fact, it's so obvious that they don't have a dick-limb to stand on Blizzard would likely end up liable for PA's court costs. With the TPP, free speech guarantees don't matter; if the tribunal rules against you, the nature of the treaty supercedes our court system entirely and PA is suddenly on the hook for a trademark violation as well as tortious damage to Blizzard's corporate image, which is now covered, literally, in penises.

       This is also true of sharing files, whether private or copyrighted works, so
       <em>
        Bauhaus
       </em>
       could conceivably sue if pics of Peter Murphy's cock caught in a
       <em>
        Sticky Fingers
       </em>
       record jacket were posted to
       <a href="/r/fiftyfifty">
        /r/fiftyfifty
       </a>
       , which he attempted because Murphy's Member is so much smaller than Jagger's he was sure it would fit. In the UK
       <em>
        Bauhaus
       </em>
       'd be out of luck because they have the GRR Martin "floppy weiner" precedent on the books, but maybe his johnson was damaged in the attempt and now Germany wants the pic taken down unless the wang-blood is recolored green due to their bizarre and frankly inexplicable violence code. They, too, can petition for removal of Peter's peter from the internet and if the TPP says the pp has to go, they might be able to get the offending ISP shut down over a single trouser snake.

       To make this more troubling, this would also affect copyrighted pictures, so if Peru decides to pass a law taking a big steamer on Walt Disney's corpse by saying that after 100 years your copyright is over, no matter how many ex-celebrities/congressmen are killed by trees. So while everyone in Lima is dunking roast Guinea Pig legs ala
       <em>
        101 Dalmations
       </em>
       in XO sauce and doing
       <em>

       shooters until there's no more grape Schnapps south of Costa Rica, Eisner takes a break from eating the foreskin of gentile babies long enough to petition the TPP and the next thing you know they've shut down every dollar store in the country.

       as I mentioned, the US is already party to various treaties similar to the TPP in regards to what your talking about. From

       we enter has IP provisions in it that have the same power as any other treaty.
      </p>
      <p>
       the main criticisms of these treaties is that they Favor the United states too much. The developing world makes tons of money out of making generic versions of expensive US made medicines or software and then reselling them in markets with lax IP law. US has of course always been trying to find ways to protect american IP.

       You have to keep in mind for this agreement to ever actually be agreed upon it will have to be something that will  pass through one or two dozen legislatures. most of the leaks have been proposal drafts from various blocks trying to get this to shape out their way.

        as I mentioned, the US is already party to various treaties similar to the TPP in regards to what your talking about. From TRIPS(as part of the WTO) to WIPO, enforced in the US as DMCA, to NAFTA. In general Every Free trade agreement we enter has IP provisions in it that have the same power as any other treaty.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yes. And each of these undermines the liberty of everyone it touches. The WTO is a bunch of unelected fucks, there's no transparency, there's no accountability, there's no sovereignty. We've seen them willing to destroy small countries' economies, and good jobs, to derve the purpose of Dole, Chiquita etc as in the case of Ecuador. All in the name of so-called free trade, but really in the name of corporate world ownership.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the main criticisms of these treaties is that they Favor the United states too much.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They favor our corporations, not our people. They favor the transfer of capital upward. They favor the concentration of power in the hands of the few.

      <p>
       A watered-down fuck-you to the working poor is still a big enough fuck-you to oppose. This agreement is an affront to human rights, to sovereignty, to self-determination of the individual, and to good sense. The free-trade cock-monglers who beat the drums for it are the same fuckfaces that oppose regulation in all forms, the same ones who say that the free market is the answer to everything but then ignore the fact that nearly everything real or thought of is already owned and not free. They are, in short, on the wrong side of history, and if you support this then so are you.

       The 75% of the population who refuse to participate deserve whats coming. If that 75% revolts and takes back what is theirs, then they are worthy of respect. The current level of apathy at all stages of action only reinforces ideas that American are worth less than they ever were.

       What? Most of the 75% are either ignorant or complacent.  Same as the 25% who actually partake in the vote.  That's leaving a mere 0% of the population who actually can understand what is going on.  The media tells us nothing and the only people who we can vote for are rigged to be there.  This is a crony capitalist democracy and it is bs.

       Not if in so doing they violate, say, a country's constitution. Let's go back to the US. Let's say Blizzard approaches a TPP tribunal(which is not covered, if you were wondering, by any of the statutes in this country, nor does it have any of the protections or flexibility of our own legal system) and that tribunal, which consists of interchangeable corporate attourneys taking turns as advocates and judges, decides that Penny Arcade making a comic about a Dickwolf quest in WoW doesn't fall under fair use. Now in a US court, Blizzard could still make their case, but PA'd be protected, it would fail because of our system of precedent and case law. In fact, it's so obvious that they don't have a dick-limb to stand on Blizzard would likely end up liable for PA's court costs. With the TPP, free speech guarantees don't matter; if the tribunal rules against you, the nature of the treaty supercedes our court system entirely and PA is suddenly on the hook for a trademark violation as well as tortious damage to Blizzard's corporate image, which is now covered, literally, in penises.

       This is also true of sharing files, whether private or copyrighted works, so
       <em>
        Bauhaus
       </em>
       could conceivably sue if pics of Peter Murphy's cock caught in a
       <em>
        Sticky Fingers
       </em>
       record jacket were posted to
       <a href="/r/fiftyfifty">
        /r/fiftyfifty
       </a>
       , which he attempted because Murphy's Member is so much smaller than Jagger's he was sure it would fit. In the UK
       <em>
        Bauhaus
       </em>
       'd be out of luck because they have the GRR Martin "floppy weiner" precedent on the books, but maybe his johnson was damaged in the attempt and now Germany wants the pic taken down unless the wang-blood is recolored green due to their bizarre and frankly inexplicable violence code. They, too, can petition for removal of Peter's peter from the internet and if the TPP says the pp has to go, they might be able to get the offending ISP shut down over a single trouser snake.

       To make this more troubling, this would also affect copyrighted pictures, so if Peru decides to pass a law taking a big steamer on Walt Disney's corpse by saying that after 100 years your copyright is over, no matter how many ex-celebrities/congressmen are killed by trees. So while everyone in Lima is dunking roast Guinea Pig legs ala
       <em>
        101 Dalmations
       </em>
       in XO sauce and doing
       <em>
        Maleficent
       </em>
       shooters until there's no more grape Schnapps south of Costa Rica, Eisner takes a break from eating the foreskin of gentile babies long enough to petition the TPP and the next thing you know they've shut down every dollar store in the country.

       And this deal is secret, so this is only the shit we
