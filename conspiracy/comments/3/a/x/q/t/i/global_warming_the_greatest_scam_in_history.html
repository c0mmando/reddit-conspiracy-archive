<p>From article:</p>

<p>&quot;Climate expert William Happer, from Princeton University, supported Mr Coleman&#39;s claims.</p>

<p>He added: &quot;No chemical compound in the atmosphere has a worse reputation than CO2, thanks to the single-minded demonisation of this natural and essential atmospheric gas by advocates of government control and energy production.</p>

<p>&quot;The incredible list of supposed horrors that increasing carbon dioxide will bring the world is pure belief disguised as science.&quot;</p>

<p>The 2010 InterAcademy Council review was launched after the IPCC&#39;s hugely embarrassing 2007 benchmark climate change report, which contained exaggerated and false claims that Himalayan glaciers could melt by 2035.&quot;</p>

<p>And before you fallback on &quot;big oil is funding ...&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I fell for it too. I had been working as an engineer overseas when I had my son. He was born with lung problems. I sold my business and pursued a masters in bioengineering with the intent on developing tools and methods to help tackle pollution. I still hold out hopes, but most of our tech is readily ignored.</p>

<p>For most projects, you have to mention climate change to receive funding. But it was during my graduate studies that I came to see the fraud. I had been overseas for most of my career and I came back to a rapidly degenerating nation. The hope of change post-Bush was already clearly not going to happen. So I was somewhat skeptical of things being sold by the MSM.</p>

<p>Part of my studies were in Sustainability. We were quickly indoctrinated. I already kind of generally believed in global warming, but then I started questioning the things we were presented with. </p>

<p>A graph was shown using a 400,000 year timeline of CO2 levels and temperatures. They lined up quite closely and we moved on to the supposed population dilemna. We were put through discussions and asked to write about how it was necessary for people to die to protect the rest. One project involved showing how we can&#39;t be energy independent. </p>

<p>People started bringing up solutions. They were either immediately hostily shot-down or ignored.</p>

<p>At this point I started to dig. I looked at the graph in more detail. CO2 increases followed warming by 600 years. I discussed this and people lauded a new report suggesting that it followed by only 300 years. To me it was blatantly disingenuous of the professors to show a graph and claim it proved global warming without adding this little fact. </p>

<p>Every time someone questioned the narrative, we were told that big oil funded the counterclaims. I looked this up. Yes, apparently it&#39;s true to a certain extent. A few problems with that though: </p>

<ol>
<li>Governments make more off oil than oil companies due through tax. 2. Oil companies would earn higher profits if oil was restricted but no alternatives were available. 3. The BBC had internal discussions on whether or not to report on contradictions to the global warming theory in the 90&#39;s and decided not to. 4. There is significantly more funding for climate change research than against it.</li>
</ol>

<p>For a long time I have been stating that global warming theory is a friend to big oil. They have just requested a carbon tax. </p>

<p>There is a lot more, but this post is getting long. In short, no part of climate change theory has been proven, the 97% figure includes climate skeptics and people who secured funding for unrelated research by including the term &quot;climate change&quot;. And Agenda 21.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mean the one titled &quot;Paying for Carbon&quot; signed by the six largest oil suppliers in the world, published on BP&#39;s own website? Which states:</p>

<p>&quot;For us to do more, we need governments across the world to provide us with clear, stable, long-term, ambitious policy frameworks. This would reduce uncertainty and help stimulate investments in the right low carbon technologies and the right resources at the right pace.
We believe that a price on carbon should be a key element of these frameworks. If governments act to price carbon, this discourages high carbon options and encourages the most efficient ways of reducing emissions widely, including reduced demand for the most carbon intensive fossil fuels, greater energy efficiency, the use of natural gas in place of coal, increased investment in carbon capture and storage, renewable energy, smart buildings and grids, off-grid access to energy, cleaner cars and new mobility business models and behaviors.
Our companies are already exposed to a price on carbon emissions by participating in existing carbon markets and applying ‘shadow’ carbon prices in our own businesses to test whether investments will be viable in a world where carbon has a higher price.
Yet, whatever we do to implement carbon pricing ourselves will not be sufficient or commercially sustainable unless national governments introduce carbon pricing even-handedly and eventually enable global linkage between national systems. Some economies have not yet taken this step, and this could create uncertainty about investment and disparities in the impact of policy on businesses.
Therefore, we call on governments, including at the UNFCCC negotiations in Paris and beyond – to:
 introduce carbon pricing systems where they do not yet exist at the national or regional levels
 create an international framework that could eventually connect national systems.&quot;</p>

<p>Our companies are already taking a number of actions to help limit emissions, such as growing the share of gas in our production, making energy efficiency improvements in our operations and products, providing renewable energy, investing in carbon capture and storage, and exploring new low-carbon technologies and business models. These actions are a key part of our mission to provide the greatest number of people with access to sustainable and secure energy.</p>

<p>The plan involves capturing carbon to sell for reuse.  Hence, the discussion of prices in BP&#39;s plan.</p>

<p>Instead of using precious minerals from the ground, captured carbon can be used to  produce chemicals like sodium bicarbonate and hydrochloric acid by reacting it with rock salt.  </p>

<p>&quot;The ocean is not rising significantly.</p>

<p>&quot;The polar ice is increasing, not melting away. Polar Bears are increasing in number.</p>

<p>&quot;Heat waves have actually diminished, not increased. There is not an uptick in the number or strength of storms (in fact storms are diminishing).</p>

<p>Here is an article on a John Hopkins study <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/02/140202111055.htm:">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/02/140202111055.htm:</a></p>

<p>&quot;Since water vapor is a very strong greenhouse gas, this effect leads to a negative feedback on climate change. That is, the increase in water vapor due to enhanced evaporation from the warming oceans is confined to the near- surface area, while the stratosphere becomes drier. Hence, this effect may actually slightly weaken the more dire forecasted aspects of an increasing warming of our climate, the scientists say.&quot;</p>

<p>Have the climate changists incorporated this into their models? </p>

<p>Article on a Nasa study <a href="http://www.principia-scientific.org/new-discovery-nasa-study-proves-carbon-dioxide-cools-atmosphere.html:">http://www.principia-scientific.org/new-discovery-nasa-study-proves-carbon-dioxide-cools-atmosphere.html:</a></p>

<p>&quot;NASA&#39;s Langley Research Center instruments show that the thermosphere not only received a whopping 26 billion kilowatt hours of energy from the sun during a recent burst of solar activity, but that in the upper atmospheric carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide molecules sent as much as 95% of that radiation straight back out into space.
The shock revelation starkly contradicts the core proposition of the so-called greenhouse gas theory which claims that more CO2 means more warming for our planet. However, this compelling new NASA data disproves that notion and is a huge embarrassment for NASA&#39;s chief climatologist, Dr James Hansen and his team over at NASA&#39;s GISS.&quot;</p>

<p>Here is an image of the carbon cycle with the hydro cycle:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/outreach/carbon_toolkit/images/carbon_cycle.jpg">http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/outreach/carbon_toolkit/images/carbon_cycle.jpg</a></p>

<p>Notice that CO2 reaches above the clouds? So how much warming is CO2 causing in the lower atmosphere vs cooling in the upper? According to NASA, it blocked out 95% of in the upper atmosphere. </p>

<p>Where are the revisions to the theory based on these discoveries? </p>

<p>There has been significant amounts of provably false data that has been submitted claiming to prove climate change. Where&#39;s the proof that it&#39;s real? Can I get a hotspot? Can I get some warming over the last 18 years?</p>

<p>Fuck it right, the debate is over according to one side. Does that mean they will all give up their funding and move it towards solutions to the problem? According to their predictions, we&#39;re fucked if they don&#39;t, so I&#39;m sure they won&#39;t mind giving up their positions and salaries.</p>

<p>&quot;For the three day period, March 8th through 10th, the thermosphere absorbed 26 billion kWh of energy.  Infrared radiation from CO2 and NO, the two most efficient coolants in the thermosphere, re-radiated 95% of that total back into space.</p>

<p>In human terms, this is a lot of energy.  According to the New York City mayor’s office, an average NY household consumes just under 4700 kWh annually. This means the geomagnetic storm dumped enough energy into the atmosphere to power every home in the Big Apple for two years.</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, there’s no practical way to harness this kind of energy,” says Mlynczak.  “It’s so diffuse and out of reach high above Earth’s surface.  Plus, the majority of it has been sent back into space by the action of CO2 and NO.”&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, look at overall trends. Overall trends show that the planet warms, creating more habitat, creating more life, which then dies and emits CO2. The warming stops, CO2 continues to rise as the life starts to die and then follows the temperature down. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Overall trends show that the planet warms, creating more habitat, creating more life...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is not accurate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excess carbon in the atmosphere warms the planet and helps plants on land grow more. Excess carbon in the ocean makes the water more acidic, putting marine life in danger...</p>

<p>Water vapor concentrations in the air are controlled by Earth’s temperature. Warmer temperatures evaporate more water from the oceans, expand air masses, and lead to higher humidity. Cooling causes water vapor to condense and fall out as rain, sleet, or snow.</p>

<p>Carbon dioxide, on the other hand, remains a gas at a wider range of atmospheric temperatures than water. Carbon dioxide molecules provide the initial greenhouse heating needed to maintain water vapor concentrations. When carbon dioxide concentrations drop, Earth cools, some water vapor falls out of the atmosphere, and the greenhouse warming caused by water vapor drops. Likewise, when carbon dioxide concentrations rise, air temperatures go up, and more water vapor evaporates into the atmosphere—which then amplifies greenhouse heating...</p>

<p>With more atmospheric carbon dioxide available to convert to plant matter in photosynthesis, plants were able to grow more. This increased growth is referred to as carbon fertilization. Models predict that plants might grow anywhere from 12 to 76 percent more if atmospheric carbon dioxide is doubled, as long as nothing else, like water shortages, limits their growth. However, scientists don’t know how much carbon dioxide is increasing plant growth in the real world, because plants need more than carbon dioxide to grow.</p>

<p>Plants also need water, sunlight, and nutrients, especially nitrogen. If a plant doesn’t have one of these things, it won’t grow regardless of how abundant the other necessities are. There is a limit to how much carbon plants can take out of the atmosphere, and that limit varies from region to region. So far, it appears that carbon dioxide fertilization increases plant growth until the plant reaches a limit in the amount of water or nitrogen available.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I told you I won&#39;t reply, but you and friends have managed to leave this thread in oblivion so I guess no one will ever know.</p>

<p>Second paragraph, first line: excess carbon in the atmosphere warms the planet:</p>

<p>True. When deforestation happens, i.e. removing carbon from the atmosphere, it causes cooling. When deserts are reforested, it causes warming.</p>

<p>Nothing to do with CO2.</p>

<p>3rd paragraph, 2nd line: Carbon dioxide molecules provide the initial greenhouse heating needed to maintain water vapour concentrations.</p>

<p>False on many levels. The sun provides the heating. Since NASA, the author, also states that CO2 is one of the two most efficient coolants in the thermosphere, we can&#39;t really take the rest of the paragraph and by extension the proposed process seriously. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t say: when CO2 concentrations drop, Earth cools, therefore causing ... when you have elsewhere stated that CO2 in the upper atmosphere blocks out radiation from the sun which heats the planet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And the sun doesn&#39;t live in the earth&#39;s crust. </p>

<p>That same sun which is reflected by the CO2 in the thermosphere, is the same one that provides the heating for the CO2 near the surface. </p>
