        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>from Wood Harrelson&#39;s Rampart to Morgan Freeman, it&#39;s fucking obscene how IAMA is literally an interview for celebrity exposure and marketing. I&#39;m not even going to guess how much they pay for Victoria to &#39;help&#39; them.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s got on a tangent. Is anyone fucking sick of Ellen Pao censorship, soapboxing subreddit removal while leaving nasty ones like CoonTown and PussyPassDenied free to fester? How SRS bombarded mensrights with red herrings enough for them to be labeled as a hate group? How a mod of videos is a cop and refusing police brutality to become public.</p>

<p>This fucking site is heroine. I love it so much, but it&#39;s so fucking worse than what it used to be. But it&#39;s sanitized and cultivated for corporate interests. Softball questions thrown on IAMA by interns, corporate and government corruption posts removed and the rise of &quot;safe spaces&quot; as if this is a fucking McDonalds.</p>

<p>Anyone remember Aaron Schwartz? The man who believed in freedom of speech, freedom to organize and protest, freedom for access to information? This isn&#39;t what Reddit was. <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> is my main news source now, it actively shows how much fucking censorship occurs here.</p>

<p>And watch this. $10 says I&#39;ll be shadow banned by tomorrow.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t Reddit anymore. This is a safe space. Safe for the powers that be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree with what you wrote, you have to keep things in perspective. Reddit is trying to monetizes its service. This has been going on as long as social web sites have been around.  There are two things you can do. One is to leave Reddit, but you&#39;ve already said that you won&#39;t do that. The second is to create a new site that has the positive sides of Reddit without the part you find negative.</p>

<p>I left the most important thing for last and this is why I started that you have to put things into perspective. If you really feel sickened by the commercialized Reddit, then you are going to have a bad time in life. There are many things one can feel sickened by, but this isn&#39;t one of them. If you aren&#39;t sickened but were just using the word for effect, then don&#39;t do it. It&#39;s too much.</p>

<p>If you want to try an alternative, voat.co is picking up steam.  It&#39;s still a tad slow, but there is far less commercialization and artificial newsaganda shoved down your throat.</p>

<p>Also, download ublock or adblock plus is you haven&#39;t yet.  If you still visit, denying reddit ad revenue is at least a good step in the right direction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything that achieves a certain level of popularity gets commercialized as soon as some rich douchebags realize there&#39;s some easy money to be made.</p>

<p>Why would reddit be any different? As for manipulation of content, upvotes etc. That&#39;s because reddit isn&#39;t just popular, it&#39;s also a form of communication and a source of information. A couple of hundred people, or even a few thousand, talking directly to each other and sharing opinions and info are not a threat. But <em>millions</em> of us?</p>

<p>That&#39;s something that TPTB want to bring under control. Safe space has nothing to do with it. The whole safe spaces thing is just a symptom of the underlying agenda of control. </p>
