<p>Fast track for TPP, TTIP and TISA has just passed it&#39;s latest hurdle in the US Congress with 60 traitorous Senators voting for the Corporations and against the interests of 99% of people, to enable the anti democratic Fast Track process to proceed to the next stage. The final vote is on Wednesday. If Fast Track is approved by Congress so will these disastrous &quot;trade&quot; deals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of my parents, (I was adopted as a kid), helped draft NAFTA, World Bank contracts, and things like the TPP.</p>

<p>The language is extremely important, but far more important is who is able to interpret it. Historically, the US has been dominant in dictating the terms. This is no longer the case. In order to understand the effects of the TPP for the US, it&#39;s necessary to look at countries who found themselves on the weak end of such previous agreements: those who had the interpretation thrust upon them. As written, the agreements were found agreeable.</p>

<p>The U.S. must act in secrecy whereas previous agreements were open because it must include obvious concessions in interpretation and enforcement we must make in order to establish the TPP. Otherwise, the language used wouldn&#39;t necessitate secrecy: we would have a document which we would expect to be able to interpret favorably due to our position.</p>

<p>While you see many corporations faltering in the US, they are profiting abroad. We have long witnessed the exodus of small to large players overseas. This agreement, written by the major players who simultaneously fund the politicians and who are seeking better markets elsewhere, will allow them to use the final bit of US dominance to sell the US out. </p>

<p>This is an exit strategy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>AFAIK the arbitration processes available under NAFTA were World Bank and UN related, and presumably comparable to what will be in place for the TPP and TTIP.</p>

<p>The secrecy of the TPP negotiations is no different than what was used for NAFTA.  Interim drafts are confidential for a number of years, the actual negotiated version will be made publicly available in its entirety well before a binding vote is held.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The negotiations will be kept secret until 4 years after the deal comes into force.</p>

<p>The texts are being kept secret until after Fast Track authority is gained, to prevent a riot on the streets.</p>

<p>After Fast Track approval is gained it will be a simple up / down vote with no amendments allowed so its a foregone conclusion pretty much whatever the final texts say.</p>

<p>The negotiated version of the TPP will be fully publicly available for at least 60 days prior to any binding vote -- you will be able to read it all, just like you could have read NAFTA.</p>
