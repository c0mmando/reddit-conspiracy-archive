       To be honest I don't understand the concept of shadow-banning. Just inform the person that they were banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's the point of making someone go through the trouble of several ignored posts/comments until they find out? It just seems like such a fucking stupid concept.

       It makes a bit of sense from the perspective of dealing with spam bots, as the bot will theoretically take longer to realize it's banned and therefore switch accounts. In practice, however, any half-decent bot coder would just check whether the bot was shadowbanned from a separate account, so I find shadowbanning to have little to no practical effect in this regard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using it against persons who do things deemed against the rules is just petty.

       Generally, spam bots are just reported to the admins and/or regular banned. Subreddit shadowbans are really only meant to be used against known persistent spammers and trolls who keep making new accounts, or if there's a reason to believe that they will make new accounts.

       I don't think you are. I only see one comment of yours, which was auto removed for some reason (I approved it). I don't actually have access to the automod config anyway, so I honestly couldn't tell you either way. I really just stick with comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have mail either at this point, but if you worded it like that ("Why am I auto moderator banned from
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       "), it comes off as accusative and I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't get a reply.

       Look that used to be true. Now being shadow banned is a known thing it's very simple to check if you or some bot you're running is shadow banned or not. Just see if your comment loads without sending the cookie.

       It's a concept that was primarily used as an anti-spam measure, since back in the day, bots would make the spam posts (through proxies and typical measures, and they validated their server response).  If you just banned the user, they would have instant feedback and start a new army.  A silent measure was needed;  something that flagged them but pretended the system was operational, meanwhile, the entire effort is going into a black hole.  Google pioneered a system along these lines for fake account creations.  They would actively allow bots to create mass accounts e-mail, while silently capturing user heuristics, allowing spammers to expend a tonne of energy in what they thought was a successful campaign only to have their entire army wiped over night.
      </p>

       But over the years reddit has come full 180.  It's a legitimized spammers heaven (we call it PR now,  just make sure you go through the appropriate  channels and your product will be front page, complete with a 85% comment circle jerk).
      </p>
      <p>
       So now it's used on the opposite end, to silence anyone who makes too much noise.  It's basically like the patriot act, started for "our safety" but in the end, used against us.
