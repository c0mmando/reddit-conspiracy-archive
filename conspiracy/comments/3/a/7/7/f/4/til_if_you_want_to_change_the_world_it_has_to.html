       Fear, hatred, greed, jealousy, condemnation, dictating what other people should think. That's the world we've got. That's the prison, but paradise is waiting just a thought away, just an attitude away, a choice. Love. If we love the world, and each other the world is fundamentally changed, and our lives are fundamentally changed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit; and we are the generations strange as it may seem, I passionately believe are going to love the world into the paradise it was always meant to be, and was always designed to be.

       I apologize for the following because I appreciate the sentiment of your post.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is new-age hippy-like bullshit ideology. The change the self part starts when you take an active role in your thoughts, actions and family. It starts when you decide to stop swallowing the gallons of media-coma induced kool-aid and start talking about the problems you are seeing. It starts when you accept the awkwardness of the disagreements you will have. It starts when you realize that people everywhere consistently do fucked-up shit for personal gain including yourself, and you decide that now is the moment you are going to stop fucking about and address it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The change the world part happens when we
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       engage in this behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think you're going to be able to just work your shit job and pay bills, have a cold beer and a bowl and watch real change happen on a fucking computer screen while you zone out into some Woo-Love Trance, the world is going to burn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Changing yourself means actually doing something about things that you can do something about, not fucking choosing to ignore things.

       You missed OP's point, he's not saying that if you only change your mindset, something will happen.  In fact, I'm willing to bet that he agrees with what you are saying.  I'm going to try to steer you in the right direction here:
      </p>
      <p>
       Alright, so if you do sit on your ass, loving everyone and everything in the "woo" way you mentioned, yes, the world will burn, you aren't doing anything to help anyone and all you are doing is being delusional.  My hypothesis is this, if you love others and the things around you in a "treat others the way you want to be treated" type of way, while actively helping others reach the same mindset, the world will become a better place.  OP isn't purposing that you change only yourself, but the people around you.  Instead of calling your friend dumb when they do something incorrect or don't understand something, point them in the right direction.  If everyone loved each other in the way OP mentioned, our problems would be solved.  Conflict does not help anyone, it only creates a larger problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go out and love people, show them the hypothetical "light" of sorts that can cause a chain reaction of love among people.

       You are missing my point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conflict is the only way any kind of change is going to happen. You are going to experience conflict when you start pointing out b'fuckery, and that's what is needed. What you are talking about is taking a passive "woo love" approach to addressing real problems. No amount of "turning the other cheek" or "treating them the way you want to be treated" is going to stop someone from exploiting you via the threat of violence. A billy club isn't going to stop because you "love" the person swinging it. This kind of sentiment amounts to "lay down and accept shit, maybe it will change somehow". Nothing in this world moves without energy being applied.
      </p>
      <p>
       Addressing problems and resolving them
       <strong>
        is
       </strong>
       conflict and that exactly what I meant about accepting the awkwardness of the disagreements you will face. Nothing will change unless you get into people's faces and point out that they are party to fucked up shit. No amount of "letting my love light shine" is going to do shit, and people pushing this sentiment aren't helping anyone. Real change is action, and it starts with changing out of this passive acceptance mindset sponsored by thoughts like these.

       Einstein once said "You cannot solve a problem with the same level of consciousness that created it" conflict in fact is the problem. There are so many false divisions in todays society that we see ourselves as separate from one another. That is not the case. The self realisation of who we truly are among other things is the problem solver not your conflict. You misunderstand my message. A golf ball sized consciousness will have a golf ball sized understanding of things.

       You are presuming entirely too much there, Mr. Woo-ru.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, what are you even talking about? I'm on your side trying to sharpen your argument by forcing you to think critically about your viewpoint and you are dismissing me as a "golf ball sized consciousness"? Should I break out my lexicon of obscure quotes? Your level of consciousness is functioning at a place that is causing a problem with our ability to exchange ideas as equals.
      </p>
      <p>
       This speaking thing we are doing here, this is a form of conflict. It is true that society possesses many divisions both large and subtle, and yes we are ultimately one, but do you really think you are going to be able to approach every single cat in the street with that? If you want real change, you are trying to pour water on sodium. No amount of telling people "we are one" is going to do shit except marginalize you, because most people aren't ready for that message yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can't even have this conversation with me, how are you going to convince your wife, your husband, your brother or sister, or mom and dad? Attacking the ugly that grows from the beliefs people have accustomed themselves to
       <strong>
        will
       </strong>
       result in conflict. Changing any system as entrenched as the one we suffer under
       <strong>
        will
       </strong>
       result in conflict.

       Just browsing this tells me that you've made at least four major assumptions. What are you trying to achieve here? I'm not here to debate it! People can think for themselves I'm not trying to shovel anything down anyone's throat, on the contrary you are. Thinking critically is what started this whole journey for me, please don't assume that I'm unable to do so. This is frustrating because again you're missing the meaning of the message. I'm not 'attacking anyone' I'm just putting the information out there, people can make what they wish with it. The most difficult subjects can be explained to the most slow witted man if he has not formed any idea of them already, but the simplest thing cannot be made clear to the most intelligent man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows already, without a shadow of doubt, what is laid before him.

       you're not saying much of any substance, this does sound like woo-woo. If you understand history and what happened during the hippy movement you will know when the message of "look within yourselves" was shared, people stopped going out onto the streets to change things which in reality actually crushed the movement and inevitably lead to a state of mind that stole their ability to continue their path as they did not connect with people anymore or try to materialize their efforts...  faulty logic you're trying to pass along, read history and you will see what omenofdread actually makes more sense than what your OP message says.

       We are our own gods
We create a reality subjective to whomever wants through doctrine. Whether it be religion or nationalism statism. Belief in a system of law. Whether it be the Torah Hammurabis code or the constitution or Islam. It's the system that we accept and believe. It is what keeps us separated but together.  It is good and it is evil, but all in all its just people doing things and others following. It is Christianity it is science it is THE method of living. Some preach of love like Jesus some preach hate like Obama and his recent predecessors. It is the law. It is God, synonymous with ego. some say soul some say consciousness. It's all Tomatoe and toemotto. It's your chains that you do not see or the freedom you perceive. It's what drives you. It's why money makes the world go round. But look around. Society is poor, and money is the root of all evil. Money is our God, we are slaves to the oldest trick in the book. Externalizing our God to sociopaths.

       Completely agree. This is why I'm vegan and just bought a house with some acreage to have my own garden / live off the land. Will be operating my own business from there. This def has caused arguments in my family but feel like this is the authentic path.

       If 1 city surrounded police stations daily armed . That would end the tyranny as the will have to respect the fact that is exactly why the 2nd was written so when we decide enough is enough we dont have to protest unarmed against a padded protected mob . do you think they would break a law or act aggresive when they know the protesters are armed. Remember #Bundy ranch that should be how every peaceful protest is.Evenly matched makes compromise and change inevitable .The tools are their use them or watch the revolution.Be very afraid if you leave it to people like me because well i would execute every federal,state,and county employee,elected or appointed official.Why ,because I was following orders,or afraid too lose my job is even worse that being a fuck that enjoys taking all you allow them too.(they done no wrong but be human and greedy and we let them) .All of us where meant to check them ,we seemed to have forgotten. Fuck the docile ,fuck a peaceful protest and fuck the police.

       yes, we have to save ourselves. i always fall back on a favorite quote:

       <em>

       must be that change we wish to see in the world.

       The whole world does't belong to this thought. If you don't like your country, get up and move or do something about it. I couldn't think of a worser place to live than in America.. well maybe Israel.

       I couldn't think of a comment with "worser" grammar.  Your comment is slightly right but when you word it in a way a first grader would I have a hard time taking it seriously.

       It's not a conspiracy, just an answer, a reminder. With love we can accomplish anything. We have to start with self, then project that outwardly. This is the solution to everything. The whole economic system is a house of cards and we're holding it up. Mass non compliance is the answer, and love.
