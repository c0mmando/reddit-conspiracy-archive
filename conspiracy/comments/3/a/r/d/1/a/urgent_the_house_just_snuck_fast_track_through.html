<p>I enjoy this summary best lately from <a href="https://medium.com/govtrack-insider/the-house-passes-the-tpa-again-7bdef576c708">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the second vote in the House on TPA. The last vote was on the Senate’s Trade Act, H.R. 1314, that combined TPA and TAA. <strong>Although House Democrats support TAA, they voted against it last week to tank the whole bill (see our previous coverage and full explanation of TPA, TAA, and TPP). By doing so, they gave House Republicans the opportunity to pass the TPA alone and risk losing the one part of the trade deal they supported.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>And the theory is that it&#39;s necessary because, if Congress amends the treaty, it would be undoing months or years of negotiations with all of the foreign countries.  The amendments would have to go back and be re-negotiated with everyone.  And they&#39;d never have confidence in future negotiations with USA, that the same wouldn&#39;t happen again.  It would defeat the whole treaty-negotiating process.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s wrong with allowing Fast Track, as long as there is plenty of debate in Congress before the vote on the actual TPP treaty.  That is, if ALL Fast Track means is &quot;no amendments allowed&quot;, maybe it&#39;s an okay thing.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure why the treaty text has been kept secret; that makes no sense, with or without Fast Track.</p>

<p>This vote made H.R. 2146 the vehicle for passage of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal currently being negotiated. H.R. 2146 was originally introduced as a bill to address issues with retirement funds of federal law enforcement officers and firefighters. With this vote, the House added TPA to the end of H.R. 2146 and passed both components together, sending the bill to the Senate.</p>

<p>H.R. 2146 is titled the &quot;Defending Public Safety Employees’ Retirement Act.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. They typically give much less than they have given to every vote related to TPP. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a shame some people feel they have to lie to make their point. In part the problem is that there are a lot of impressionable readers. OP may know he is lying, but what about all the people who read his lies? They might just take his word for it and then go and spread his lies to other people.</p>

<p>The Founding Fathers believed our system could only work if citizens were informed. OP is directly attacking that foundation of our society by spreading lies and misinformation.</p>

<p>It&#39;s sad more of our fellow citizens don&#39;t care about this bill, but it&#39;s not the fault of the House of Representatives. We can&#39;t blame them for what citizens fail to do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and 2) the MSM has been awfully quiet about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t agree that the MSM has been quiet about it, but that&#39;s a subjective evaluation that every person will have to make on their own. There has been fairly extensive coverage of it, I think. In any case, it&#39;s not the fault of the House that the media has covered it to the extent they have.</p>

<p>So: I don&#39;t see any justification for the thread title &quot;House just snuck fast track through.&quot;  This is dishonest fear mongering and it suggests some kind of shady behavior on the part of the House. But OP has not shown that the House did anything to &quot;sneak&quot; this bill through. This bill was passed in exactly the same publically visible way that all bills are passed. They didn&#39;t seal the chamber doors. The vote was scheduled and announced well in advance. The public and press were able to watch the proceedings in person or on C-SPAN. The roll call vote was public and has been published for all to see.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s important to be honest. OP has a responsibility to be straight with the people who read his posts. Instead, he is being deceptive and he is editorializing.</p>

<p>Find me a link to the full text.  It&#39;s funny that you say the citizens are failing to read something that&#39;s being hidden from them.</p>

<p>So where is the full text?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the text of the <em>treaty</em> that will remain secret for a while longer. The recent vote was not for the treaty; it was for fast track authority. And the bill to provide fast track authority is <em>not</em> secret.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a different topic. I was not commenting about that. I was responding to the claim that this bill was &quot;snuck through.&quot;  It wasn&#39;t. It was passed exactly like every other bill, except with far more media coverage than most bills. I was also responding to the claim that the text was secret. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s the text of the treaty that is currently secret (because it has not been finalized and is still under negotiation). But the bill that just passed the house is not secret a d can be read by anyone who is interested. </p>

<p>To answer your questions:  I&#39;m completely and totally opposed to TPP. I think it will cost us some of our sovereignty and make corporations even more powerful. And it will probably accelerate the war on the middle class. But the public will see what is in it long before it is voted on. There is supposed to be a period of a few months between the time it becomes publicly available and when congress votes. Fast track just means congress can&#39;t amend it or filibuster it. It doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t read it. And those provisions are perfectly normal for treaties. This is how treaties have been handled in the US for many decades. </p>
