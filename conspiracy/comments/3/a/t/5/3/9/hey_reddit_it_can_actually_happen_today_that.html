<p>Conspiracy won&#39;t get to Reddits front page anymore. It&#39;s been banned from there and best of.</p>

<p>Do you really think voting or writing or calling your &quot;representative&quot; means a damn thing? It doesn&#39;t. Your representative is a puppet in the democracy show. There is no stopping anything. </p>

<p>But SOPA, we stopped it you say? Only because the corporate puppetmasters wanted it stopped. For now anyway. Anyone who knew about SOPA didn&#39;t want it. Only when Google and other huge corporations stepped in did it get pushed back. I think it was a psy op. Conditioning you to subconsciously realize that corporate has the power. </p>

<p>When Google came out against it everyone cheered. &quot;I welcome our Google overlords&quot; was stated thousands of time across this site. A country supposedly by the people, for the people, bowing down to a fucking search engine.</p>

<p>Stop wasting your time participating in the puppet show. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like I already had this discussion with you, but I guess you really could be another person on another account. Regardless, you more or less responded to my line of argument with the sopa thing. So, yeah: round two.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you really think voting or writing or calling your &quot;representative&quot; means a damn thing? It doesn&#39;t. Your representative is a puppet in the democracy show. There is no stopping anything. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course it means something. High-level SOPA supporters were scared of the people they were fucking over. They were scared for their well-being, not their jobs.</p>

<p>Do you remember how many times they failed before they moved their efforts elsewhere? Doesn&#39;t sound like the behavior of a group that always get&#39;s what it wants. It&#39;s think it&#39;s silly to say that &quot;the puppet-masters&quot; wouldn&#39;t want the greatest puppeteering tool of all time.</p>

<p>Not really sure where are those Google-worshiping redditors are, but I don&#39;t care if people believe in a god or not. If someone wants to be part of the heard, they will be. No use crying over spilled ideology.</p>

<p>And if you wanna talk about psy ops... Assuming you claim to be on the side of the free-man, maybe you should stop enforcing the concept of corporate control in the young minds of the internet.</p>

<p>Apathy is the problem.</p>

<p>Your words perpetuate apathy and hopelessness.</p>

<p>You are part of the problem.</p>

<p>Most people just run scripts for their reactions, unless it&#39;s something they care about. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> attracts people who are passionate for truth, so we&#39;re just engaged on a broader series of topics than most people, because we are more likely to challenge conventional wisdom or the default explanations.

<p>I&#39;m sorry, but no.  This sub is for people who want the complete opposite of whatever &quot;conventional wisdom&quot; is.  It&#39;s for contrarians.  No doubt there&#39;s some truth here, but it&#39;s slanted in an anti-American point of view which forces you to draw incorrect conclusions about what you&#39;ve read.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I think gets lost on people.  When a lot of this subs basic assumptions are based on anti-American propaganda, you become a tool of our enemies.  You can see this going back decades and probably centuries.  The Soviets heavily funded and manipulated the Civil Rights and Anti-War movements of the 20th century, just as we do for our favorable causes abroad.  You should be skeptical, but you should also not be so skeptical that, in order to avoid &quot;American propaganda&quot;, you fall into the hands of foreign/leftist propaganda. This is an amazing country that has done amazing things for the world.  The world is better than it&#39;s ever been because of our contributions.

    <div class="md"><p>Look at the similarities between the rise of the Third Reich and the current neoconservative path the country has taken. It is uncannily similar. You&#39;re an intelligent guy, go check it out. The major difference between then and now is that then they required all the people to spy on each other, and while that is getting a lot of support right now with the &quot;see something say something&quot; campaign, the electronic surveillance present today is an incredibly dangerous addition to fascist ideology.</p>

<p>And there are still years before all of the laws and executive orders passed are completely integrated and functional. It&#39;s a slow grind.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Can you elaborate on this point?  We have similar cultures and Germans make up the largest ethnic group in the country.  I don&#39;t reject the notion that some of our customs are the same, but I also don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to compare even Cheney and Rumsfeld with anyone that was in the Nazi Party.  I absolutely 100% do not mean this in a condescending way, but look into the policies towards political opposition for the Third Reich.  You&#39;ll find that there is nothing similar to them in the United States.  Dissent was absolutely not tolerated; you were killed for &quot;protesting&quot; or inciting against the regime.  Opposing political parties were completely banned.  There was no independent media.  America is an incredibly free nation, and you can ask any immigrant what they think of America, and it will almost always be outstandingly positive.  I&#39;m not convinced that the NSA is using, or is planning to use, bulk-collection to target political opposition.  I have seen no evidence, at least none of what Ed Snowden released, suggesting that they are doing anything except for targeting those who might be prone to commit political violence.  I see the &quot;slippy slope&quot; argument, but I don&#39;t give it much credibility.  I have yet to hear of a case of someone being knock and talked for doing absolutely nothing questionable.  </p>

<p>We have an assertive foreign policy, which is a result of our post-war status as the beacon of the western world.  We were charged with defending our way of life from the communists, and that required us becoming more militant.  Here&#39;s my thing.  I am well aware of the extent of our use of coercion and subversion to advance our goals, but that is only one small part of our geopolitical strategy.  The most important part of America&#39;s soft power is not the CIA and its occasional coups, but our diplomatic and economic clout.  We have created a rules-based international system of trade and diplomacy that has made the world incredibly peaceful and prosperous.  Mistakes happen, like Iraq, but the trend is clear.  The American-way works and we should remain assertive.  </p>

<p>With great power comes great corruption. Sure, we&#39;ve been a great nation that&#39;s come to the defense of the good peoples of the Earth when the specter of holocaust loomed over the glove, but remember that the concentration camps were based on Hitler&#39;s study of how the US government dealt with our native population(OK, and the Boers). We have a lot to be proud of, but as I&#39;ve said elsewhere, we shouldn&#39;t get complacent. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3alxvc/admins_force_rmuseum_a_legitimate_art_sub_not_a/csehnic">After all, we have a few things to work on.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t agree with most of the things you linked in that post.  I did at one point, I&#39;ll grant you, but you&#39;re falling for exactly what I did.  You&#39;ve been suckered into foreign propaganda in your effort to avoid American propaganda.  I only post here because I feel strongly that this kind of echo chamber is very bad for people.  It exists based on faulty assumptions.  There are legitimate facts here, but they are normally taken without regard for context or intention.  Posts like the one you linked portray such a grossly distorted view of reality that it would hardly pass as a recognizable caricature.  </p>

<p>I can&#39;t begin to reply to it all because it&#39;s based on such opposing assumptions to my beliefs that it would be a futile effort.  You have absorbed the very worst take on the United States, and it&#39;s kind of sad.  Not sad like &quot;you&#39;re stupid&quot; or &quot;you&#39;re pathetic&quot;, but sad like it&#39;s a shame.  This is a great country and we have so much to be proud of.  This is the best place on Earth to live for the vast majority of people.  It&#39;s not perfect, but it&#39;s definitely worse in almost all other countries.  We take for granted all of the advantages and freedoms we have here and complain about what we don&#39;t have or that the world isn&#39;t perfect with us at the helm.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess the main thing that keeps me from &quot;appreciating&quot; what we have is that I do not see us moving in a positive direction for so much of what made/makes us great. More and more money rules all our politics, even the judicial branch. More and more the people are screwed over for the corporate state. It absolutely <em>is</em> a shame, and it needs fixing. And that&#39;s why I have the attitude I do; you don&#39;t get the world in better shape by looking at what we have, really the ruins in many ways of what we <em>did</em> have, and declaring it praiseworthy. I don&#39;t know how to fix every problem we&#39;re running across, but I do know that first, we have to acknowledge that things need some serious fixing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;They were scared for their well-being&quot;</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p>&quot;wouldn&#39;t want the greatest puppeteering tool of all time&quot;</p>

<p>You mean the TPP? SOPA isn&#39;t dead either, it&#39;s being broken up piece by piece and being shoved in with other bills. Why is it that ever session of Congress has bills being pushed through to the general detriment of the citizenry? Every damn major decision being made since before I was born hurts us regardless of which political party is in office.</p>

<p>&quot;Not really sure where these Google worshipping redditors are&quot;</p>

<p>LOL.</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t care if people believe in a god or not&quot;</p>

<p>What does believing in God or not have to do with this? The mental acceptance of a private company with no allegiance to anything but themselves having power over our supposedly representative government is a stepping stone to disaster. </p>

<p>The concept of corporate control needs to be pointed out, otherwise it will go unseen in young minds. It will be normal for future generations unless it is beaten to death now. No company operating within our borders should have power over the well being of the people. None. And it&#39;s our governments job to make sure of that. They have utterly failed.</p>

<p>Our poor soldiers are killing and dying supposedly fighting for our freedoms, freedoms our own government is stripping from us quicker than ever before.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right that apathy is the problem. Apathy toward the well being of other people.  Pointing out that our current political system is broken and needs change that may be impossible at this stage without a major overhaul of government is not the problem. No candidate or god is coming to change it. Voting will not change it. Violence will only further it. The only chance we have is mass non participation. </p>

<p>Your words perpetuate a system designed to fuck you, and every other person in the world. </p>

<p>Accusing me of being the problem shows exactly how much control of your life you&#39;ve already given up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A psy op can be many things, and have many proponents* and detractors. </p>

<p>A bill like SOPA is put into Congress. It is designed to fail, while also designed to succeed. Simply by bringing it to a vote allows parts of it to live on in other legislation. The idea is now on the table. Now it&#39;s just a matter of breaking it into small enough pieces for the public to swallow. </p>

<p>The TPP, well what we know of it anyway being that it&#39;s such a big secret, allows circumvention of Congress for things like SOPA to take effect. Something like &quot;you&#39;re hurting our business by not allowing us to have a fast lane&quot; then gets a trial in front of a paid for judge.  Voila, internet fast lane. </p>

<p>Just one way it could go, but trust that it will eventually go.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>And I never once implied nobody else understands anything, nor do I consider myself some kind of genius. I understand exactly what you&#39;ve been taught about how the political system officially works, but I also know that behind the smokescreen, the divide and conquer method of political control is in full effect. Race vs race, straight vs gay, cops vs citizens, Muslims vs Jews, rich against poor, pro life vs pro choice, on and on it goes.</p>

<p>LoL protractors whoops.</p>

<p>what is fast track authority</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It means that Congress will not be able to amend or filibuster the trade agreement, they&#39;ll only be able to vote on it.</p>

<p>The concept first came to life in 1974, fell apart in the &#39;90s, and was renewed by Bush in 2002.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It means that Congress can only consider the bill as written; they can&#39;t propose any amendments or modifications. They also cannot filibuster. It just means a straight up or down vote.</p>

<p>The reason for this is because the details of the bill have been painstakingly negotiated with 51 countries over a period of years. If Congress starts changing it, we&#39;d have to renegotiate the changes with those 51 countries.</p>

<p>Fast Track has been the way treaties have been considered in Congress for many decades. </p>

<p>From Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The authority was in effect from 1975 to 1994, pursuant to the Trade Act of 1974, and from 2002 to 2007 by the Trade Act of 2002. Although it expired for new agreements on July 1, 2007, it continued to apply to agreements already under negotiation until they were eventually passed into law in 2011. In 2012, the Obama administration began seeking renewal of the authority. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, not really. Fast track does nothing to make passage more likely. If anything it harms its chances. Not that it matters; it&#39;s probably a done deal and will pass. But not because it was fast tracked. It will pass because our representatives in Washington represent the super rich and corporations and they are happy to see the population of the country suffer.</p>

You can see this going back decades and probably centuries.

You should be skeptical, but you should also not be so skeptical that, in order to avoid &quot;American propaganda&quot;, you fall into the hands of foreign/leftist propaganda.
