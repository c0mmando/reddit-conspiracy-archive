       A few months ago there was some exciting talk over at
       <a href="/r/space">
        /r/space
       </a>
       about the experiments run at NASA's Eagleworks lab. They had proven that there was indeed thrust from the "impossible machine". Well, back then if you Googled NASA EM Drive you could find a direct link showing the discussions NASA Eagleworks scientists were actively having on Eagleworks threads. These were THE scientists talking, their credibility intact.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am currently writing a fitness article and was aiming to reference how the human body is not 100% efficient. I referenced the NASA EM Drive and wanted to link to a Google search in order to give the readers who didn't know what I was talking about an idea of what the EM Drive was. Well I Google searched "NASA EM DRIVE" and every article was about how it was all "poppycock". "Well shit" I thought, "there goes my credibility,  can't link to that."
      </p>
      <p>
       I read several of the top articles and they were all just a bunch of conjecture that put down the eagleworks experiments which had showed thrust in the EM Drive. All of these new articles on Google provided little to no evidence and yet all concluded these experiments were bunk.
      </p>
      <p>
       I go to bing.com and type in the same search "NASA EM DRIVE". What did I find? Actual articles linking to real data and discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, this shows beyond a doubt that the government is censoring the Internet through the use of Google. How you might ask? Well by shear mass of  internet users Google has a grasp of. My thought while writing my fitness article was "well shit, I can't link to Bing to give the readers a comical-yet-informative link to a search engine result. If I link to bing it will only make me look silly, not funny, nobody uses bing except for porn."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's that very thought that gives power to Google. It's the one road block all other search engines can't get around. Google know this and so does the government. If they can keep that perception of the Internet as a whole then they can censor however they like.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has to get out! This is scary big data control that actually concerns me! I'm not a conspiracist. I look at a lot of stuff, shrug my shoulders and move on. But this is different. This blows up all credibility on the internet. This disrupts the  flow of knowledge that allows the human race to grow exponentially as it has.
      </p>
      <p>
       The censorship is a HUGE issue, but perhaps even bigger is the question: 
"what does the government have to hide about the "warp bubble" that was located inside the "Impossible" EM Drive?"

       Yea I'm noticing a lot of new innovative things are hidden in Google, yet other search sites display it. I think Google has its hands deep in New patent law and listing so to get the favor, they cut out competition. Strange time with the tpp, ttip tisa. The automated cars is a good example.

       In my BING search, I got older articles than with the Google search.
      </p>
      <p>
       The searches should give you a bunch of articles that state the EM Drive is poppycock.  The only independent test to show the EM Drive may have thrust is inconclusive thus far (although it's use of the phrase "quantum vacuum virtual plasma" (something that doesn't exist) puts the entire study into question) and considering the EM Drive would drastically alter some well established laws of physics, they are going to need to show some dramatic proof in a well designed and executed study.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't link to the BING results just because it gives you old articles especially when new science has been done since then.

       I don't think it's censorship, the only sites that call it "poppycock" is wired. And it's not the EM drive that they are calling BS, it's the term "Warp Drive". Because it's not a warp drive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it hasn't really produced a whole lot of thrust. We are talking micronewtons of thrust. Barely measurable.
