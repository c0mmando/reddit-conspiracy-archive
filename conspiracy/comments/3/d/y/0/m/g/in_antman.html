       <strong>
        if you don't want to talk about conspiracies..why not just leave?
       </strong>
       cause you're just here to cause shit. This sub is full of you paid retards.
      </p>
      <p>
       Near the beginning of the movie, Dr. Creed unveils his "Yellow Jacket" suit, heralding it as a return to warfare away from the public eye. Loosely quoted, "in a world where the use of military force is constantly under public scrutiny,"
       <em>
        cue bystanders using cell phone cameras, cue Internet users sharing said footage
       </em>
       , "isn't it time we took the fight back to the shadows?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Hyper aware of media propaganda, it's easy to spot when an agenda is being pushed. Moments like these stand out to me and I wanted to take a moment and deconstruct this idea that the government shouldn't be monitored and held accountable, and open discussion about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's important to note that
       <strong>
        Hollywood makes this message purposefully vague.
       </strong>
       The idea of
       <em>
        government accountability
       </em>
       is not one that the average moviegoer really cares about. Much of that apathy is because we're told the government is always correct, and we should follow blindly, because they have our interests in mind. We don't need to worry, because they have it covered.
       <em>
        We
       </em>
       know that isn't the case, but the average moviegoer doesn't question it. Not only is it unpleasant to think about, because they came to a movie to have fun and
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       think about problems like these (keep them distracted), but it is also offensive to question everything they've been told to believe and have subscribed to.
      </p>
      <p>
       The case presented,
       <em>
        Anti-Governmental Surveillance
       </em>
       , is brought to our attention in such a way as to
       <strong>
        dissuade discussion on the topic
       </strong>
       , causing people to not want to talk about it. The first point is that the presentation is given by the "bad guys," saying that governments shouldn't be held under scrutiny. This is the first lump of mud to confuse the message. By having the bad guys bring up the topic of surveillance, the topic immediately becomes something that people want to distance themselves from, and so they start to "turn off" to the topic right from the start.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, the presentation implies that governments need to be free to operate on their own terms and that when you record them doing something bad, you are keeping them from completing their goals (unspecified). This supports the pre emphasized rhetoric that governments have our best interests in mind. The problem with this is that when people record governments doing shady things, then those shady things must be accounted for, and the perpetrators must be held accountable. We will be quick to assert the line they feed us, "If you're not doing anything illegal, you have nothing to hide," but they want to (through censorship of discussion) have us believe they are innocent yet hide their own actions from scrutiny. The message of accountability conflicts with the cookie-cutter story they tell us, and viewers will further turn off to the idea, because here in America, critical thinking is not exactly praised. If it's hard to understand, might as well just forget about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, a solution is provided for the governments that have less than public-friendly goals: just make sure they don't see you doing it. Yes, this idea, under the guise of fancy new *
       <strong>
        cool
       </strong>
       * technology, will allow governments to operate behind the view of the public. Not only do you accept that your masters will do as they please, but deep down, you like it. This seems to be the most telling piece of the puzzle, essentially reinforcing the idea that there
       <em>
        have been
       </em>
       things we don't know about, there
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       things going on we don't know about, and there are
       <em>
        going to be
       </em>
       things we don't know about, all of which could never happen if it was out in the light for us to see and hold them accountable for.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have to hold them accountable for the criminal actions that they commit. Just because media is pulling you under like a strong undertow, it is our responsibility to continue filming police acting against our rights, continue whistleblowing for crimes our government commits against U.S. and other nations, and continue calling out falsehoods, derailments and threats while engaged in conversations that matter.

       don't want

       I wasn't talking about the movie as a whole. I was referring to this specific instance that seemed a little out of place and the way it supported certain goals that the elite attempt to accomplish, not just in this film, but pretty much all of them. The whole movie doesn't have to be propaganda, and in fact that would be highly suspect, but these small instances, shown over and over, issues pressed further and further, they eventually build and people get used to concepts they would not accept if presented as a whole. By trickling the concepts, it works on a deeper than logical level, and that's why it's so hard to convince people about what is really going on in media.
Overall the movie was pretty cool, which is probably what everyone else watching it will think too. They won't even remember the scene I brought up, but if you mentioned it, I'm sure they'd recall, but with distaste. Holding governments accountable for unsanctioned acts of war, despite its necessity, will not be a topic of conversation.

       Probably because he is making a really good argument as Captain America: Winter Soldier is literally about corrupt elements of American government run amok and spying and sampson options to the extreme.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure why people find movies about comic book characters to have propaganda elements. It's just a fictional story, kids movie.
      </p>
      <p>
       One where people can shrink to the size of an ant, and gods from other planets protecting the Earth. Etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally nothing in the Marvel Comics movies is realistic at all. It's portrayal of governments and their actions should be viewed in a similar light.

       I don't agree with anything you wrote, the movie Ant Man is not pushing any sort of propaganda like you claim. It's just a comic book movie with ridiculous fantasy elements. I watched it over the weekend, and nothing about it deserves a post in r/conspiracy.

       Well that's your opinion. Keep a) sucking that man's dick that's paying you to subvert this conversation, or b) living in shackles and willful ignorance. I literally don't care about you or your opinion, and you simply disagreeing with my post does not refute it. People are going to read what I wrote and hopefully it gets them thinking.

       So you are asserting (without evidence ofcourse) that every movie produced by Hollywood this year is approved by some  massive powers to further their agenda. Everything from the indies to sharknado to Jurassic world to furious 7 to even the worst movies of all time

       Yes every single movie, TV drama and video game that is created is laced with propaganda and mind control subliminals. If you see Capitalism being celebrated, anti-God themes, pro-judeo christian religious themes, Christ tropes, hierarchy being exalted (every sports, war and buddy movie ever made), violence being portrayed as necessary, nature being portrayed as scary, the military being portrayed as good or a necessity, nobility/aristocracy being portrayed as good guys etc.) you are witnessing propaganda.

       People like seeing them because their opinions are formed by their environment, people don't innately like watching transformers they like it because they are projecting internal phenomena externally. I know you like to feel like a free agent when you consume but you're actually being an automoton when you "choose" to watch your favorite "programming".  I do have proof, every single media production in existence only exists to subliminally program the subconscious of the viewer. Entertainment has no other purpose.

       Every group that approves movies is linked back to the same cabal in hollywood. One group disseminates knowledge to feeder groups which then control all the scripts, story boards and writers. It is possible, every single movie has occult connotations in it.

       Uhh, no that's not how movies happen at all man. Someone writes a script and concept for a movie individually, which is then pitched to different hollywood studios. if a studio likes a script they can purchase the right to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       A movies primary purpose is to make the studio money, a studio can only make money by sales and advertising. A LOT of movies use this formula, not because of a faceless group controlling everything. But because dumb, simple movies with tons of product placement can makes them millions if not billions of dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, that doesn't mean there isn't propaganda for example military being portrayed in a positive light. 
But that's not because of a group dictating that. It's just the military has a program where they will lend 
real military equipment to a studio if they portray the military positively.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example The Movie Independence Day -  the US military was going to lend the studio their equipment for the film, until they saw one part in the script they didn't like. The part with Area 51, they wanted that portion cut out or changed, the studio refused. And the US military withdrew their support for the movie. True Story

         <p>
          The U.S. military originally intended to provide personnel, vehicles, and costumes for the film; however, they backed out when the producers refused to remove the script's Area 51 references.[6]

       Read more shakespeare and Orphic myths you will see what i mean. They repeat the same themes and tropes over and over because of the memetic effect sigils have on our collective unconscious. They bring up old traumas and deep seated anxieties from our entire species. Micro traumas are indented into our subconscious every time we relive these anxieties and opportunities for psychological manipulation are amplified by constant exposure. If you think you can watch constant programming and not be influence by what you are seeing then you are deeper into the trance than you think. People who expose themselves to the bible over and over become more bible minded, people who read evolutionary science often become evolutionary minded, people who spend all day watching tv become tv minded (attention deficit, undisciplined, slow, autistic, malleable, collectivist, profane)

       Good point, that's why meditation and discernment exist. You can watch Tv all you want and stay mentally clean, you have to use deconstructive methods of mediation. I can't tell you much: they are a ring of producers, directors, agents and financiers; they have unquestionable sway over the Studios choices of what movies to produce. They hire actors who have undergone previous trauma programming like Jennifer Lawrence, Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, James Franco, Keanu Reeves, Scarlet Johansen. The script is laced with trigger phrases and talismanic words like "freedom" "light" "power" "sex" "fire" "god" "death" etc. (its not as simple as just the word their needs to be adequate preamble and context around the phrase otherwise the words don't hold enough power to trigger people's subconscious reactions to them) the themes of the movies are specifically geared towards mythography and astotheological motifs. The Sun Story (batman Dark Knight Rising, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Starwars episode 5 and 6) there is the sacrifice story (saving private ryan, top gun, Gladiator) and more. They use mostly Shakespearean and Greco-Roman mythography (often times from the Orphic Mysteries as Dionysus seems to be a favorite character for them to project onto their actors). Have you ever wondered why political agents are referred to as actors in foreign policy? Or why Obama reads a script, or why our White House Staff follows specific traditional protocol for every dinner, meeting and press conference? They're all reading off a script.

       Interesting "i met Keanu Reeves" i'm supposed to believe but you won't believe me about the tropes or the fact that
jennifer Lawrence is obviously mentally disturbed as is Tom Cruise. I see how you think and yes you are very strongly influenced by your own prejudices

       But you have no proof to back up your claims, not a shred. How can I believe your rant about all of these people you claim are programmed mind control slaves? Or that there is a secret ruling elite cabal that checks the content of ALL movies and TV programs?

       That's an assertion that you can't really make with anecdotal evidence and not watching movies
      </p>
      <p>
       You are making a statement on the 1000s of movies each year produced based on watching a few 10 or maybe 15/yr

       Even if you watched 50. You are making assertions about a whole industry based off a small sample size

       The fact that this sub is called "conspiracy" means that we don't have all the facts, but that the people in charge are stupid enough that we can figure it out anyway. It's a discussion board about conspiracies, and you are part of the problem.

       Certain topics are like that. I posted this comment in the fear mongering Russian bomb thread yesterday:
      </p>
      <p>
       Demonstration of power is when you drop bombs on a country and then use the possibility of having them as an excuse to attack another country.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was voted up right away, and then hit hard until it disappeared. It then hovered around unseen but as soon as it got to -4 would immediately be driven back to -7 or -8.

       People want to believe their hug bubble of TV, Movies, Comic Books and Video Games are innocent and the big bad government and corporations are only bad when they shoot protestors and pay off senators. They would never try to influence the public through mindless, easily consumable mass media that nearly 50% of the population consumes at an addictive level. Nope nothing to see here..

       You really should win an award for your levels of intellect. I would be quite shocked if you did not have a genius level iq

       Your sarcastic wit is beyond me however. I simply cannot fathom the levels of genius it takes to accomplish these multi-layered and truly hysterical levels of sarcasm. I bet you are a riot at parties! Of course you probably go to such fantastic parties, I would never get to experience that high caliber of raw talent. You must make panties drop right off unsuspecting dames. You must cause the jealousy of the masses, with no doubt how handsome your high wit causes you to appear. Even now, to have a the pleasure of being rebuked by your powerful diction, your mentally engorging presence causes my pathetic manhood to fill at the absolute marvel of your unquestioned superiority.

       Certain topics are like that. I posted this comment in the fear mongering Russian bomb thread yesterday:
      </p>
      <p>
       Demonstration of power is when you drop bombs on a country and then use the possibility of having them as an excuse to attack another country.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was voted up right away, and then hit hard until it disappeared. It then hovered around unseen but as soon as it got to -4 would immediately be driven back to -7 or -8.
