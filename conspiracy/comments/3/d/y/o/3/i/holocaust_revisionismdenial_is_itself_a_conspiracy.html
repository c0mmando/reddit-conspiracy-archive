        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;The real purpose of holocaust revisionism is to make National Socialism an acceptable political alternative again.&quot;<br/>
-Harold Covington of the National Socialist White Peoples&#39; Party</p>

<p>I posted this previously, but can&#39;t seem to find anyone in r/conspiracy who is willing to really engage this thesis on the merits.  Frankly, it looks to me like any skepticism of the Holocaust is grounded in antisemitism and white supremacy, rather than a sober and dispassionate assessment of the historical record.  </p>

<p>Like I&#39;ve said before: having read up on it, I&#39;ve been unable to find a single revisionist allegation that couldn&#39;t be rebutted by an open mind and some simple research. It&#39;s uncanny.
For one example, consider the revisionist claim regarding the Soviet exaggeration of deaths at Auschwitz. The Soviets installed a plaque that read &quot;Four million people suffered and died here at the hands of the Nazi murderers between the years 1940 and 1945.&quot; Later, in 1990, the plaque was replaced with one reading, &quot;May this place where the Nazis assassinated 1,500,000 men, women and children, a majority of them Jews from diverse European countries, be forever for mankind a cry of despair and of warning.&quot;
Revisionists have suggested that such a reversal is evidence of a Jewish conspiracy. Of course, even assuming that Jewish interests dominated the entire USSR, there&#39;s a perfectly plausible alternative explanation: that some non-Jewish Russian bureaucrat independently elected to exaggerate the figures.  </p>

<p>As before, I will continue to accept downvotes as evidence of revisionists&#39; unwillingness to engage.  I don&#39;t mean to take some condescending &quot;downvote = lose&quot; tack, but you guys seem to pride yourselves on your open-mindedness, and I&#39;m really not seeing that.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The purpose of the Shoa is to endowe a group with perpetual victim status so that thier actions and beliefs can never be criticised. I&#39;m not buying it. 100 million or more people died in WW2. Many people suffered unimaginably. I have no special sympathy for any group. The whole thing was a set up to get Israel claim rights to Palestine (Balfour Declaration). So, if it is ever discovered that the USA was drawn into the war by Jewish Millionaires (equivalent to billionairs today) just to acquire Palestine (Known today as Israel) then I think the public will turn. Image is everything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree with a lot of what you&#39;re saying (e.g. the Balfour Declaration was issued in 1917, years before Hitler&#39;s rise to power), but all of that&#39;s irrelevant.  </p>

<p>If you think Israel shouldn&#39;t be playing the victim, then say that- but it has nothing to do with whether or not the Holocaust actually happened.  Let&#39;s try to stay on point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, we can pass refutations all day long. How about we listen to other ideas and be open minded for once? This guy was in the Administrations he speaks of. He was at the meetings he speaks of. He isn&#39;t giving a 3rd party account. He is giving a 1st person account..his. He is of Jewish Heritage. He is Semitic. So, I could claim people who are deriding him are anti-Semitic. How dare a Semitic individual stray from the narrative? He was an INSIDER for decades who came to terms with what he saw as an ethic he abhorred and spoke out about it. He is a brave human being, IMHO. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a really long video- I&#39;ll watch it, but just give me a little background.</p>

<p>I know he says he&#39;s an insider, and other revisionists say he&#39;s an insider, but all I can find about his professional background is that he worked for a soap company and as a small-time venture capitalist.  He&#39;s not a [former] rabbi or a big industrialist, so it seems strange that he would be privy to all this information.  After all, he was born in 1890, and so would only have been 24 when WWI broke out.  </p>

<p>What evidence is there that he really <em>was</em> an insider?  Like, these Administrations- what are their names? I just want to see if I can find some independent verification.</p>

<p>I mean, let&#39;s say you were on a secret committee that had fraudulently led the U.S. into a war.  Eventually, the war ends and nobody&#39;s the wiser.  Then a new guy, who was in his mid-twenties when the war began, joins the committee.  Would <em>you</em> fill him in on 100% of all old business, or would you restrict his access to ongoing activities?  </p>

<p>Also, Freedman sued the American Jewish Committee for libel in 1946.  Even setting aside the fact that the case was dismissed after only a month, this suggests that he had a falling out with them before the Nuremberg Trials- so how could he possibly have known all this stuff?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If he hated the Jewish people, with whom he had parted ways, maybe he wanted to slander them?  As a convert to Christianity, he may have wished to demonstrate his new-found loyalty or, perceiving Jews (who tended to be a progressive, liberal group) as a threat, he may have seen this as a means to the end of discrediting them. Alternatively, he may have wanted to make a name for himself as an author and speaker-- after all, I assume this speech, given at a fancy hotel, was a paid engagement, right?  </p>

<p>Those are just a few possibilities, and without any supporting evidence, they make a lot more sense to me.  </p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m reading <a href="http://www.biblestudysite.com/factsarefacts.htm">this</a> and seeing a lot of errors.  To give an example that&#39;s more humorous than it is significant:   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is not one word of &quot;Yiddish&quot; in ancient &quot;Hebrew&quot; nor is there one word of ancient &quot;Hebrew&quot; in &quot;Yiddish&quot;.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The phrase &quot;geyn kaken aften yam&quot; is a Yiddish put-down, meaning &quot;go shit in the ocean.&quot; &quot;Yam&quot; is also used to mean sea or ocean in ancient (and modern) Hebrew.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Freedman said they were Khazars, but the article says otherwise:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The finding should thoroughly debunk one of the most questionable, but still tenacious, hypotheses: that most Ashkenazi Jews can trace their roots to the mysterious Khazar Kingdom that flourished during the ninth century in the region between the Byzantine Empire and the Persian Empire, Richards and Ostrer said.  </p>

<p>The genetics suggest many of the founding Ashkenazi women were actually converts from local European populations.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, what on earth does 6 million have to do with anything- especially in that context?  So, Flavius Josephus (a Jewish apostate who renounced his heritage and was granted Roman citizenship) reported that six million Jews lived in the Roman Empire in 70 A.D.  So what?  If you think <em>that</em> confirms your views on the Holocaust, then you aren&#39;t the critical thinker I&#39;d hoped you&#39;d be.  </p>

<p>Look, six million is just a number.  It has no special significance, and <strong>everyone</strong> agrees that it is, at best, a rough estimate from a deeply chaotic time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty much everyone does. There was an idea of the &#39;new Jew&#39; after the holocaust, a more militant one. Many Jews couldn&#39;t understand why people didn&#39;t fight back (some did obviously but most didn&#39;t) there are even films of Jews jumping off trucks and running next to a trench to be shot in the head. </p>

<p>The idea of the new Jew made Jews fighting the first Arab Israeli war much more determined</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not a Nazi, nor a &quot;white supremacist&quot;.  This has nothing to do with hating anyone.  It has to do with an impartial review of the facts.</p>

<p>I used to believe what I was taught by the textbooks and the media until a few years ago when I decided to take a closer look.  </p>

<p>The facts are these:  We have been shown <em>no proof</em> of the three main claims of the holocaust...(a) six million jews were killed, (b) many in gas chambers, (c) due to an order from Hitler.</p>

<p>(a) No one went down the line counting, &quot;5,999,997...5,999,998...5,999,999...6,000,000!&quot;  Six million is propaganda that was used multiple times in newspapers many years before WW2.  See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dda-0Q_XUhk">this</a> and <a href="http://www.zioncrimefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/The-First-Holocaust.pdf">this</a>.</p>

<p>(b) To date, there has never been an autopsy report of a holocaust victim who died from zyklon-b poisoning.  <a href="http://whatreallyhappened.info/pinknotblue.html">The &quot;eye-witnesses&quot; to the &quot;victims&quot; claim they saw black-and-blue bodies, when in reality (the real world, the world in which we live) zyklon-b poisoning causes a body to become pink or red.</a></p>

<p>Besides, on the surface, the gas chamber story is ridiculous. The expedient Germans wouldn&#39;t have pulled fighting men off the front lines to bring millions of jews into camps by train, then spent millions of wartime funding on Zyklon-B to kill them (with no receipt, by the way), then millions more in wartime funding on coke for cremation (again, no receipt), then totally disposed of all the evidence, when they were needing all able-bodied men and all their money to fight a war on two fronts. And they wouldn&#39;t have purposefully killed off a work-force of confined laborers when workers were desperately needed for the war effort.  If killing all jews was the top concern, they would&#39;ve simply put a single bullet in the back of the skull back in the Warsaw ghettos and elsewhere.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=typhus+auschwitz+proof&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8#safe=off&amp;amp;q=typhus+concentration+camps">The majority of jewish deaths in the labor camps were caused by typhus.</a>  </p>

<p>(c) There is no proof that Hitler ever ordered the genocide of jews.  <a href="http://www.writing.upenn.edu/%7Eafilreis/Holocaust/wansee-transcript.html">The claim is made of a &quot;final solution&quot; at the Wannsee Conference on January 20, 1942, but no mention of killing jews can be found, and Hitler was not in attendance.</a></p>

<p>Perhaps it is you who doesn&#39;t have an open mind.  Your &quot;proof&quot; is based on what you&#39;ve been told, rather than hard evidence.  Just because a person can&#39;t handle the truth doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s hateful or a lie.</p>

<p>It <em>could</em> mean what you say- but it could also mean that they&#39;ve decided that the danger of forgetting such a sinister chapter of human history outweighs the societal value of holocaust revisionism. Unless you have already convinced yourself that there is a conspiracy at hand, I think you will agree that this simpler explanation makes a lot more sense.  </p>

<p>He was inciting racial hatred by using bad science to &quot;show&quot; that the Holocaust never happened, thereby implying the existence of a Jewish conspiracy to suggest it did.  </p>

Bischoff reminded the manufacturer that the doors had to have a spy-hole of double 8-mm glass &quot;with a rubber seal and metal fitting.&quot; The order was characterized as &quot;very urgent.&quot; ...there is also a request for a &quot;handle for the gastight door&quot; (Order No. 162, 6 March 1943) and a request for &quot;twenty-four-gastight anchoring screws for gas tight doors&quot; for Cremas 4 and 5 (Order No. 280, 6 April 1943).&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>(A) I am aware of the previous claims of 6,000,000 being killed.  Let me ask you what’s more likely: that it’s a coincidence, or that the Elders of Zion are smart enough to fool everyone and manufacture all this evidence, yet dumb enough to repeat the same claim twice in thirty years?  It’s not like six million is some kind of magic fucking number.  What’s more, if they manufactured all that proof for the “second” Holocaust, why didn’t they manufacture the same for the “first” one?  Why did Wilhelm Hottl testify that Eichmann told him six million were killed?  I understand that you aren’t an anti-Semite, so why do you think that the Jewish people, writ large, can’t be trusted to tell the truth?  </p>

<p>I just skimmed the first chapter of that book, but so far it’s just about how wealthy and influential the Jews were. I don&#39;t see the relevance.  Could you summarize it a bit, or at least refer me to pages with important information? It’s hardly fair to expect me to read 150 pages immediately.  </p>

<p>(B) I’ve read up on it, and that red/pink pigmentation argument doesn’t hold water; when you’re malnourished, you can’t oxygenate your blood efficiently.  According to medical examinations conducted on Jews still in ghettos (i.e. before being moved to the camps, where conditions were even worse), the average cardiac output was 50% of normal.  You can read more <a href="http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.com/2011/12/belzec-sobibor-treblinka-holocaust_6507.html">here</a><br/>
Ah, I’ve seen you use this “expedient Germans” language before, in another thread!! While it’s interesting to see you equating the Nazis with the German people, I disagree.  The Nazis were not expedient.  In his memoirs, Speer has a lot to say about the absurd redundancies and inefficiencies that pervaded the Third Reich.  How do you think they found themselves in a war on two fronts?  Because they were idealists, that’s why.  They adhered to a idealist racism that demanded an all-out war against “Jewish Bolshevism,” extending from the SS to the Wehrmacht itself.  See <a href="http://bookzz.org/s/?q=Army+bartov&amp;amp;t=0">Omar Bartov’s “Hitler’s Army”</a> for more.  (You can just skim it- the facts are borne out on virtually every page).  </p>

<p>Simply put, Nazi Germany would not have <em>been</em> Nazi Germany without the Holocaust and the war crimes in the East.  The following is from an entry in Goebbels’ diary, dated 12/12/1941: 
&quot;... Concerning the Jewish question the Fuhrer is determined to make a clean sweep. He prophesied that, if they were once again to cause a world war, the result would be their own destruction. That was no figure of speech. The world war is here, the destruction (Vernichtung) of the Jews must be the inevitable consequence. The question must be seen without sentimentality. We are not here in order to have sympathy with the Jews, rather we sympathise with our own German people. If the German people have now once again sacrificed as many as 160,000 dead in the Eastern campaign, then the authors of this bloody conflict must pay with their lives&quot;.</p>

<p>This account was later corroborated by Hans Frank. <a href="http://www.hdot.org/en/trial/judgement/06-15.html">See here for much, much more</a></p>

<p>As for the destruction of a potential source for slave labor: nobody ever said that Jews were gassed indiscriminately.  You can find tons of sources for that.</p>

<p>(C) Hitler’s involvement and responsibility for the Holocaust does not turn on his attendance of the Wansee conference or its proceedings.  This question was litigated extensively in Irving v. Penguin Books &amp; Lipstadt, and a non-Jewish judge determined that Hitler quelled any lingering sympathy for the Jews in 1941.  Thereafter, it was <a href="http://www.hdot.org/en/trial/judgement/13-12.html">open season</a>.</p>

<p>I first began reading up on revisionism because I thought I might be convinced.  That is why I have read so extensively, and why I choose to engage in debate on the subject.  I have spent an hour writing this post alone. This isn’t about me.</p>

<p>Let me ask you what’s more likely: that it’s a coincidence, or that the Elders of Zion are smart enough to fool everyone and manufacture all this evidence, yet dumb enough to repeat the same claim twice in thirty years?</p>

<p>I believe the number was Communist propaganda, and they continued to use the number because it was already in the public psyche.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What’s more, if they manufactured all that proof for the “second” Holocaust, why didn’t they manufacture the same for the “first” one?</p>

<p>No need to manufacture proof, as it appears it was being used in humanitarian money-making scams, fleecing American Jews and Christian zionists.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did Wilhelm Hottl testify that Eichmann told him six million were killed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps he was tortured into saying that.  Regardless (1) no one counted, and (2) it is second-hand from a Nazi war criminal.  It is word-of-mouth, not proof.  In fact, it appears that <em>all</em> of the &quot;proof&quot; is word-of-mouth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I understand that you aren’t an anti-Semite, so why do you think that the Jewish people, writ large, can’t be trusted to tell the truth?</p>

<p>I believe that most just believe what they are told to believe by their leaders.  Just like many Americans who still believe Saddam had something to do with 9/11, and had WMDs.</p>

<p>Take your time, there&#39;s no rush.  I spent a few years doing research.</p>

<p>(B and C)</p>

<p>No questions directed at me through here, but still, there is no science to show that anyone died in a gas chamber.  And there is no proof Hitler ordered genocide against the jews.</p>

<p>Logically, burden of proof is on the person or persons making a claim, not on others to disprove the claim.  If you want me to prove that six million weren&#39;t killed, that&#39;s easy...I can <em>not</em> show you six million dead bodies all day long.  Word-of-mouth is not proof.</p>

<p>Good luck on your search for the truth.  Have a cool day!</p>

Don&#39;t know what that second &quot;it&quot; refers to. If you mean the &quot;first&quot; Holocaust, then there&#39;s still need for proof.  If you mean it was effective despite a lack of proof, that still doesn&#39;t disprove the &quot;second&quot; Holocaust.  </p>

<p>Insofar as the 6,000,000 is an estimate, that&#39;s because of the extent of the Nazis&#39; destruction.  As to Hottl&#39;s testimony, there&#39;s no evidence that he was tortured, so why assume a more complex explanation where a simple one would do?  Eichmann&#39;s statement is not hearsay, or at least would be <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_801">excluded</a> from the general legal precept against hearsay as <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_803">both a present sense impression</a> and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_804">a statement against interest</a>. I don&#39;t mean to be rude, but part of me thinks &quot;leave it to a revisionist to dismiss a confession simply because the speaker is a criminal!&quot;  </p>

<p>People will believe anything- sure enough.  </p>

<p>There is plenty of science: see <a href="http://www.hdot.org/en/trial/judgement.html">section VII. Auschwitz</a> and genocide on such a scale could not have been committed by a single order-- but there is nevertheless ample evidence of Hitler&#39;s involvement. <a href="http://www.hdot.org/en/trial/judgement/06-7.html">See here</a> for more like the following:</p>

<p>&quot;This criminal race [the Jews] has the two million dead from the World War on its conscience, now again hundreds of thousands. Noone can say to me: we cannot send them in the morass! Who then cares about our people? It is good if the terror (Schrecken) we are exterminating Jewry goes before us&quot;. (Hitler, Oct. 25, 1941)  </p>

<p>Anyway, I get that you&#39;ve got things to do- no hard feelings.  To paraphrase that notorious criminal, Billy Joel: don&#39;t go changing just to please me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Answer two questions and cite the numbers: How many Jews were living in occupied Nazi territory during the war and lead up to the war? How many Jews were paid annual reparations for surviving the holocaust after the war was over?</p>

<p>You&#39;ve also cited the revision of 4 million people dying at Auschwitz down to 1.5. Obviously that 4 million figure was used to come to the 6 million figure. Since the number was officially changed by the Jewish organization running Auschwitz themselves, where did those extra 2.5 million dead people go?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shit, I just accidentally deleted my comment!!  </p>

<p>Ok, so three questions. I know you&#39;re going to criticize my sources because they&#39;re too Jewish, but try to bear in mind that most non-Jews aren&#39;t going to be interested in proving something so widely accepted as the Holocaust.</p>

<p>1) As for the number of Jews, look <a href="http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005161">here</a>.  Approximately 6.5 million in Eastern Europe, 1.5 million in Central Europe, and 1 million in Western and Southern Europe.  </p>

<p>2) This has nothing to do with whether or not the Holocaust happened, but rather your own valuation of human life.  At any rate, I don&#39;t know of any individual Jews who accepted reparations.  You&#39;re welcome to provide contrary evidence.  Israel did accept reparations, but I don&#39;t think that decision was very popular with the average Jew.  At any rate, whether you think they were overly greedy depends on your point of view.  You can read more about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reparations_Agreement_between_Israel_and_West_Germany">here</a>.  </p>

<p>3) I don&#39;t think it&#39;s &quot;obvious&quot; that western scholars&#39; accounting of the number of Jewish victims would have relied on a single Soviet-era plaque, located deep within the Iron Curtain.  That&#39;s exactly why this &quot;Jewish organization&quot; removed the plaque: because it was incorrect.  At any rate, the six million figure seems to predate the plaque.  This number was first suggested by Wilhelm Höttl, an SS officer and a Doctor of History, during the Nuremberg Trials: &quot;[At a meeting in August, 1944] Eichmann ... told me that, according to his information, some 6,000,000 (six million) Jews had perished until then – 4,000,000 (four million) in extermination camps and the remaining 2,000,000 (two million) through shooting by the Operations Units and other causes, such as disease, etc.&quot;  </p>

<p>Yad Vashem acknowledges it&#39;s very hard to come up with a precise figure, given all the chaos, but openly displays the names of 3,000,000 individual victims at its visitors&#39; center.  </p>

<p>Do you have anything else?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you just said 9 million in all of Europe, but 8.5 million were in Germany, Austria, Poland, and Czechslovakia? Meaning, there were only 500k in England, France, and all the other allied countries?

See why no one believes the numbers? 9mill in Europe, 8.5 in occupied Nazi territory? That doesn&#39;t seem strange to you? </p>

<p>Furthermore, there 4 million &quot;survivors&quot; of the holocaust that were paid annual reparations by Germany. Your own (ridiculous) number (8.5mil), STILL doesn&#39;t cover the official 10million that were claimed to have gone through the camps (6 million killed, 4 million survivors).</p>

<p>&quot;Eastern Europe&quot; was not under control of the Nazis, only czechoslovakia. &quot;Central Europe&quot; was not under control of the Nazis. And &quot;southern Europe&quot; was not under complete control of the nazis. In all of these regions you&#39;ve named, only a few countries each were held by Germany.

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary_in_World_War_II">Hungary, part of the Axis powers, occupied by Germany in May 1944</a>.<br/>

<p>Dogg, if I&#39;m confused, and that&#39;s possible, I think it&#39;s because you&#39;re not being clear.  What the hell is &quot;occupied Nazi Germany&quot;? Germany wasn&#39;t &quot;occupied&quot; by the Nazis.  Do you mean &quot;occupied Nazi territory,&quot; the phrase you initially used?  </p>

<p>If so, you&#39;ll have to excuse me for thinking that countries like Hungary, which were effectively German puppet states, should be included.  Please start over, and be specific! I promise I&#39;ll try to accommodate you.  </p>

<p>PS: 100% of Holocaust reparations have gone to survivors, so why would this lead anyone to exaggerate the number of victims?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Got any hard evidence of mass graves? Or gas chambers? With 6 million dead, it shouldn&#39;t be too much to ask, since it clearly couldn&#39;t have been a small operation.<br/>
There are plenty of wild claims regarding the subject that were made in the past that have since been shot down. I&#39;m assuming that you&#39;ve heard about things such as steam chambers and electrocution chambers? These were mentioned at the Nuremberg trials, but they are not mentioned much these days. Many parts of the story have been pruned away over time to make things more believable and many wild or totally baseless claims have been swept under the rug. Undeniably a lot of bullshit surrounding the subject, so why believe anything without any real evidence? All that exists is testimony from Nuremberg, much of which was &#39;extracted&#39; by torture and threats. Again, I&#39;m assuming that you&#39;re already somewhat aware of this? You did say you you&#39;d read up on the subject. Is it not at all troubling that the evidence is so very flimsy?</p>

<p>There&#39;s plenty more, but I&#39;m not going to get any more specific than that when you&#39;re just asking for &quot;hard evidence.&quot;  </p>

<p>I have heard about those, yes.  I&#39;ve even read about a &quot;corpse roller coaster,&quot; which turned out to be just a tram that carried corpses from the gas chambers to the crematoria-- exaggeration for comic effect is typical of Holocaust revisionism.  </p>

<p>Now, it&#39;s true- a few witnesses mentioned things like steam chambers. It&#39;s possible that this is evidence of cracks in the conspiracy.  Then again, everyone exaggerates. Everyone gossips.  When you&#39;ve suffered, when you&#39;re desperate for revenge, you&#39;re even <em>more</em> likely to exaggerate, <em>more</em> likely to spread rumors.  But is this proof of a conspiracy? No, it isn&#39;t.  </p>

<p>Usually, when authorities discard unreliable testimony, people realize it&#39;s because they want to focus on what can be proven.  If you aren&#39;t pre-assuming a conspiracy, what makes you think that here, they were &quot;sweeping it under the rug&quot;?</p>

<p>There were plenty of witnesses who limited their testimony to the facts- that Hitler approved the killing of Jews and others, through gas chambers and other methods, and so forth. Many of these witnesses were Germans who were neither tortured nor threatened.  Some would go on repeat their stories verbatim in West Germany&#39;s criminal trials during the 1960s.</p>

<p>Of course, there is also plenty of independent, contemporaneous evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The <strong>first link</strong> you gave regurgitates information from &#39;The Kola investigation&#39; and &#39;The 1945 Polish investigation&#39;.<br/>
You&#39;ll notice a lot of claims made on that page that are stated with apparent confidence. The fact is though, that they are only claims. Did you bother to look into the Kola investigation report? If so, did you find any proof of what they claimed to have found, or are you just taking their word for it? The report does not show any human remains, the report offers nothing but unsubstantiated claims. Where&#39;s the test data and where&#39;s the scientific analysis? This is not science, it&#39;s worthless. </p>

<p>On to the <strong>Second link</strong> Really, you&#39;re linking to a daily mail article about caroline sturdy colls? Again, this is not science. You think this is proof, really? You&#39;re not aware that she is a laughing stock? You&#39;ve not seen the &#39;star of david&#39; tile debacle? <a href="http://newobserveronline.com/smithsonian-red-faced-after-treblinka-star-of-david-tiles-shown-to-be-not-jewish-at-all/">http://newobserveronline.com/smithsonian-red-faced-after-treblinka-star-of-david-tiles-shown-to-be-not-jewish-at-all/</a> Her investigation was a farce from beginning to end. </p>

<p><strong>third link</strong> More baseless claims. This time some photos in the linked sources. Some show bones on the ground, except the bones were supposed to have been crushed up, so this doesn&#39;t even match up with the official story. Not that there is even any proof that the photos were even take at Treblinka anyway. Besides, people died and were buried, which is what the photo suggests. Nothing that suggests anything more sinister. It is more likely that these bones were found at Treblinka I(quarry) and not Treblinka II (the alleged death camp.) and are bones of corpses that were not cremated, and not from the alleged death camps, (and therefore almost certainly not Jewish.) Otherwise, we would not expect to see so many intact bones. No proof of anything here. Moving on.</p>

<p><strong>fourth link</strong> More claims that rely on Kola&#39;s investigation, which as I already said, offers zero actual evidence.</p>

<p><strong>fifth link</strong> Yet more from the same dumb website. Try getting some better sources because this proves nothing. The Auschwitz museum director is on tape admitting that the structure they tout to visitors as a gas chamber was actually built by the Soviets after the war. There is no poof that a real one ever existed at Auschwitz.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But is this proof of a conspiracy? No, it isn&#39;t. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never said it was. What it is, however, is a reminder that all claims should be taken with a grain of salt unless there is additional evidence to support them.</p>

<p>In conclusion, you failed to offer any proper evidence. Your sources are devoid of any credibility. A subject like this demands rigorous science, not a bunch of unsupported claims that anyone could have made up. </p>

Before you insist that they would have decomposed: <a href="http://cswd.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Landfill-Carrots.jpg">these are carrots after ten years in a landfill.</a></p>

<p>Like I said in the OP, any fair-minded person would accept that on face value, but deniers/revisionists are forever moving the goalposts.  They claim to be open-minded, but in reality they are too committed to their fantasies of Zionist conspiracies to face facts.  </p>

<p>As for Caroline Sturdy Colls&#39; work: you&#39;re right, she seems to have misinterpreted a logo emblazoned on the tiles as a Star of David. This was a stupid assumption that &quot;immediately [sprung] to mind&quot; (per your article) on her first seeing the tiles.  Note, however, that this <strong>does not</strong> invalidate her findings.  That first paragraph? About how revisionists will bend over backwards to accept anything as a victory, no matter how minor?  I wrote that before I even got to that article. Amazing.  </p>

<p><strong>Third link</strong> &quot;baseless claims,&quot; supported only by &quot;photos&quot; that don&#39;t correspond with your understanding of what is &quot;supposed&quot; to have happened.  Nobody said that the skeletons were crushed to a fine powder.  I see loose femurs and what you might describe as a &quot;whole lot of small white rocks.&quot;  The lack of coffins, markers, individual plots, or even a fence all suggest something sinister- but you&#39;ve got your agenda.  </p>

<p>Yes, your own agenda, which is why I need &quot;better sources,&quot; but you&#39;re content to just say &quot;The Auschwitz museum director is on tape...&quot; without providing a link to some audio.  Anyway, there were <a href="http://www.cvce.eu/content/publication/2005/1/28/a0e14dad-88da-44a2-be6f-4f08b2b87d94/publishable.jpg">multiple gas chambers,</a> just as decorated Polish resistance fighter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witold_Pilecki#Auschwitz">Witold Pilecki</a> indicated in his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witold%27s_Report">report on Auschwitz</a>, available <a href="http://witoldsreport.blogspot.com/2008/05/volunteer-for-auschwitz-report-by.html">here</a> in full.  </p>

<p>Proper evidence? Testimony is proper evidence.  Forensic studies are proper evidence.  Photographs, both contemporaneous and subsequent, are proper evidence. Internal SS memoranda are proper evidence.  </p>

<p>You disregard all of them, and in favor of what, exactly? A misinterpreted logo on some floor tiles and your gloss on one decontextualized quote from a museum director.</p>

<p>The report says &quot;they found.&quot; I don&#39;t believe scientists can distill human remains into Internet form.  Again, you&#39;re hewing to two different standards of proof; one for me, and another for yourself.  </p>

<p>Hence your selective interpretation of this interview, in which the museum director also speaks at length about other gas chambers, authentic and untouched.  Purely for the sake of argument: if you accept his account of the rebuilt chamber, you should accept his account of the original ones, as well.  Now, I&#39;ll grant you that the Soviets rebuilt one of the gas chambers, and that this one is used for tours. After all, it makes perfect sense not to bring tourists into the originals, which should be preserved.  </p>

<p>Re: Treblinka.  That Wikipedia article says they &quot;crushed the remaining bones with mallets,&quot; not that they worked them over with a mortar and pestle.  There&#39;s no reason to think that slave laborers would apply themselves to make sure that every single bone was pulverized beyond recognition.  For that matter, there&#39;s no reason to think they would have adhered to the same process throughout the time Treblinka was operating.  Moreover, the photograph at issue is extremely grainy- it&#39;s silly to say the photo definitely doesn&#39;t contain anything smaller than a femur when you can&#39;t actually tell.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I suppose the ground is very hard.  </p>

<p>Incidentally, Jews <strong>do not</strong> scatter ashes, in Treblinka or otherwise- cremation is not only prohibited by religious mandate, but frowned upon as a cultural taboo.  I cannot imagine this has ever happened, let alone that it happens &quot;often.&quot; The very idea is laughable.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing silly in anticipating your arguments.  I had already done it once before, when I predicted your embrace of anything that would support your claim, no matter how irrelevant- i.e., Coll&#39;s misapprehension about the tiles&#39; logo.  </p>

<p>I am being reasonable. I presented proof, but you demanded more.  I accommodated, and still you were not satisfied.  You moved the goalposts- I simply called a spade a spade.  You rejected the Daily Mail when all it did was provide a convenient summary of Colls&#39; findings, yet hold up the New Observer Online as some shining beacon of intrepid journalism.  You are wrong, but you will not own it.</p>

<p>I am tempted to accuse you of running away, but <em>that</em> would be pointless.  Everyone has things to do, and I can&#39;t ask you to sit around all day debating. That said, &quot;I&#39;ll not&quot; is an archaic construction and it does not do you any favors.</p>

<p>Ok, one more post. Since no one is likely to be reading any of this, aside from ourselves, the only reason to continue this exchange is to debate with you. You have already proven to be incapable of reasonable debate as I pointed out before so this really is the last, otherwise you&#39;ll accuse me of not sticking to my word.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Again, you are acting as though the report has some kind of inherent authority. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Simon Srebnik said &quot;We carried the bones there, where others had to crush them. It was <strong>very fine</strong>, that <strong>powdered bone</strong>. Then it was put into sacks, and when there were enough sacks, we went to a bridge on the Narew River, and dumped the <strong>powder</strong>.&quot; This is taken from <a href="http://www.hdot.org/en/learning/myth-fact/incineration10.html">http://www.hdot.org/en/learning/myth-fact/incineration10.html</a> , the website you seem so fond of. It is also testimony, which you claim is proper evidence. So, if we play by your own rules, that appears to be a good reason to believe that they were pulverized.
But perhaps that&#39;s not enough, so here&#39;s some more...</p>

<p>More from that page: &quot;the ashes fell through the grates and were constantly removed and <strong>crushed to powder</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We broke the bones and ground them up <strong>very, very fine</strong> and the Germans scattered the ashes in the Vistula River so that <strong>no traces would remain</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Incidentally, one of those statements is from Höss, who was almost certainly tortured and made to sign a confession that was written in a language he could not speak. </p>

<p>Wait, wait. You&#39;re still not convinced are you? None of those sources refers specifically to Treblinka, so maybe for some reason they did things differently there? A special case, right? Yeah sure... Well here&#39;s the final nail in your proverbial coffin...</p>

<p>&quot;However, Pavel Leleko, a Ukrainian guard in <strong>Treblinka</strong>, did testify directly about the bone crushing process: &quot;After the bodies had been burned, the prisoners belonging to the &quot;working crews&quot; <strong>passed the ashes through a sieve.</strong> The parts of the body that had burned but had preserved their natural shape were put <strong>into a special mortar and pounded into flour.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>They even specifically mention a mortar, whereas you painted all these ideas as laughable hogwash. yet there they are, all present and correct in your beloved testimony, sourced from the very site you&#39;ve been using to argue against me. They even apparently passed everything through a sieve, a fucking sieve!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Ok, &#39;often&#39; was incorrect, that was a mistake on my part. However, it HAS happened, it HAS been recorded on video and HAS been reported on by various news outlets. Your imagination has failed you.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/60051/where-she-needed-to-go-mothers-ashes-scattered-at-treblinka-where-her-famil/">http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/60051/where-she-needed-to-go-mothers-ashes-scattered-at-treblinka-where-her-famil/</a></p>

<p>First, I&#39;ll remind you that this is the internet and I&#39;m not a professional writer. I do not care about these kinds of intricacies. I only aim to get my point across and that has been enough to satisfy everyone I have ever talked to online, you being the sole exception. This suggests that your pedantry goes beyond what most would consider reasonable. 
And second...<br/>
Really? You&#39;re criticizing my writing on the basis that it&#39;s out of vogue? You really think it does me no favours? As if most people would even notice it, let alone care? Are you really that delusional as to assume that anyone else here cares about this even a little bit? Either that, or you are trying to grab every little victory you can regardless of how irrelevant it is. Something you accused revisionists of earlier. 
I could sit here trying to justify my choice of words, after all language is a <em>tool</em> for communication and it has great flexibility, while idioms, slang and colloquialisms prevent it from becoming dry and academic and thus serve an important purpose. On that basis, I&#39;m free to use language in any way I see fit, so long as the meaning I attempt to impart retains a reasonable level of clarity. But you didn&#39;t mention this supposed faux pas in order to suggest that my writing was tough for you to parse (it clearly isn&#39;t, since the phrase is familiar enough for you to have developed an apparent distaste for it), or for any other practical reason like that. You mentioned it with the sole purpose of petty one-upmanship.<br/>
See, this is why I&#39;m not debating you anymore. I&#39;m not running away. I&#39;m simply refusing to waste time on someone who revels in taking every little opportunity to discredit me. </p>

<p>Didn’t you just say I was being “silly” in trying to predict <em>your</em> arguments?  If so, you’re doubly silly, because I literally closed that post by saying I was tempted to accuse you of running away, but that I wouldn’t-  I realize you may well have better things to do.   Heck, you quoted me on it!  </p>

<p>The report does have inherent authority: it was written by people who went to the camp and took samples.  You can’t just <em>assume</em> they’re lying.  What, am I supposed to book us a flight to Poland?  </p>

<p>At first, you had me at a loss w/r/t the mass graves at Treblinka.  I have since come up with a few possible explanations:  </p>

<p>-As the source we’ve both used says, “Sometimes the bones were crushed with machines and sometimes by hand. It was not a precision process but it worked.”  Presumably, then, there is room for inconsistency and inattention to detail, especially when you’re dealing with something so unpleasant as a pile of dead bodies.   </p>

<p>-Srebnik’s testimony concerns Chelmno, but you realize that processes would vary from camp to camp, so no problem.  </p>

<p>-When I first read your quote of Pavel Leleko, I was <strong>sorely</strong> embarrassed.  Sincerely. It was a good burn, no pun intended.  However, I want to direct you to the next few lines from Leleko’s deposition, which are available <a href="http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/l/leleko-pavel-v/leleko-002.html">here</a>:  </p>

<p>‘During the first year of the existence of the &quot;death camp&quot;, the bodies of the dead people were not burned but were buried. Starting in 1943, after the incinerator was built, the pits with the bodies buried in them were opened up and the content burned. All this work was done by the prisoners waiting to die under the supervision of the Germans and of us, the policemen.’<br/>
‘One after the other they were brought to the end of the pit, laid on the dead bodies and their heads were cut off or split up with an axe or wooden mallet.’<br/>
Here is evidence that they did not adhere to the same procedure.  </p>

<p>Ok, so one survivor had her ashes scattered there in 2010.  Still, I don’t think that qualifies.  </p>

<p>I regret commenting on your writing style.  It was needlessly snarky.</p>

<p>All that exists is testimony from Nuremberg, much of which was &#39;extracted&#39; by torture and threats.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have revisited this issue, and I do not find any compelling evidence whatsoever.  <a href="http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v07/v07p389_Faurisson.html">Here,</a> the IHR alleges that Rudolf Hoess&#39; confessions were obtained by torture.  They argue by reference to purported irregularities in Hoess&#39; confessions (including the presence of &quot;English style&quot; handwriting, whatever that could mean), but they also rely heavily upon  Hoess&#39; own memoirs.  </p>

<p>The following is from Hoess&#39; memoirs, and is actually quoted in the IHR article itself: &quot;the interrogations were extremely unpleasant, not so much physically, but far more because of their strong psychological effect.&quot;  </p>

<p>You can find selections from Hoess&#39; memoirs <a href="http://ducis.jhfc.duke.edu/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/death-dealer_0056.pdf">here.</a> What stands out most, to me, is the wheedling way in which he skirts any and all responsibility for his actions. There is a prime example on page 153, where he writes, &quot;I could not allow myself to form an opinion as to whether this mass execution of the Jews was necessary or not.&quot;  </p>

<p>If this autobiography was extracted by torture, it is impossibly sophisticated.  On reading, it does not smack of Allied propaganda, but of Nazi ideology; see page 155, where he defends the Commissar Order on the grounds that &quot;they started it,&quot; when in fact the order totally predates Operation Barbarossa and the invasion of the USSR.  </p>

<p>The IHR, a premier voice of Holocaust revisionism, accepts the provenance of Hoess&#39; memoirs.   They should: the memoirs are nuanced and subtle. They contain a full accounting of Hoess&#39; life, humanizing him at every turn.  While he acknowledges his involvement in the Holocaust, he takes great care to disclaim his moral responsibility.  Indeed, he even goes so far as to marvel at the &quot;eager assistance&quot; of the Jewish Sonderkommando (pp. 158, 161).  This is something the brazen &quot;Jewish torturers&quot; would never have done, especially given the IHR&#39;s account of their sloppy, bloodthirsty methods and fanatical mindset.  </p>

<p>Hoess&#39; memoirs were not used in the trial against him, and were published well before any doubts arouse concerning the validity of his various confessions. Simply put, they are the real deal.  </p>

<p>&quot;In the spring of 1942 hundreds of people in the full bloom of life walked beneath the budding fruit trees of the farm into the gas chamber to their death, most of them without a hint of what was going to happen to them.  To this day I can still see these pictures of the arrivals, the selections, and the procession to their death.&quot;<br/>

<p>I present one bloody nosed Rudolph, paired with some quotes. </p>

<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mc3y-6DobeQ/UBCXnJPk1WI/AAAAAAAAHW8/s84N-roe8FA/s640/1.jpg">http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mc3y-6DobeQ/UBCXnJPk1WI/AAAAAAAAHW8/s84N-roe8FA/s640/1.jpg</a></p>

<p>&quot;During the first interrogation they beat me to obtain evidence. I do not know what was in the transcript, or what I said, even though I signed it, because they gave me liquor and beat me with a whip. It was too much even for me to bear. The whip was my own. By chance it had found its way into my wife&#39;s luggage. My horse had hardly ever been touched by it, much less the prisoners. Somehow one of the interrogators probably thought that I had used it to constantly whip the prisoners.&quot;(11)
<strong>Hoess, p. 179.</strong></p>

<p>Rupert Butler:</p>

<pre><code>&quot;The prisoner was torn from the top bunk, the pajamas ripped from his body. He was then dragged naked to one of the slaughter tables, where it seemed to [Bernard] Clarke he blows and screams were endless. Eventually, the Medical Officer urged the Captain: &#39;Call them off, unless you want to take back a corpse.&#39;&quot;Butler, Legions of Death, Hamlyn, (London, 1983), p.237. Also:
R. Faurisson, &quot;How the British Obtained the Confessions of Rudolf Hoess.&quot; The Journal of Historical Review (JHR) 7(4) (1986) pp.389-403.** 
</code></pre>

<p>The admission of Bernard Clarke was corroborated by Mr. Ken Jones in &#39;The Wrexham Leader&#39;, October 17, 1986.
Mr. Jones was then a private with the Fifth Royal Horse Artillery stationed at Heid in Schleswig-Holstein.</p>

<pre><code>&quot;They brought him to us when he refused to cooperate over questioning about his activities during the war. He came in the winter of 1945/6 and was put in a small jail cell in the barracks,&quot; recalls Mr. Jones. Two other soldiers were detailed with Mr. Jones to join Hoess in his cell to help break him down for interrogation.&quot;

&quot;We sat in the cell with him, night and day, armed with axe handles. Our job was to prod him every time he fell asleep to help break down his resistance,&quot; said Mr. Jones.

When Hoess was taken out for exercise, he was made to wear only jeans and a thin cotton shirt in the bitter cold. After three days and nights without sleep, Hoess finally broke down and made a full confession to the authorities.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>There are also countless examples of people who condemned the Nuremburg trials as a farce, Edward L. Van Roden said: &quot;all but two of the Germans, in the 139 cases investigated, had been kicked in the testicles beyond repair. This was standard operation procedure with our American investigators.&quot;</p>

<p>and  </p>

<p>&quot;Torture with burning matches driven under the prisoners&#39; fingernails; knocking out of teeth and breaking jaws; solitary confinement and near-starvation rations. The statements which were admitted as evidence were obtained from men who had first been kept in solitary confinement for three, four, and five months&quot;</p>

<p>So those are just some of the reasons why I think torture was likely. Enough to consider it a possibility at the very least. Did you not find any of that, or perhaps you have reason to dismiss it all?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That Hoess quote is from a memoir in which he discusses, in detail, all the acts that were contained in his confession.  Also, he signed other confessions, but that only concerns the one following his first interrogation.  </p>

<p>They would hardly have brought his whip to the prison, so presumably this happened immediately upon arrest.  This account does not taint his subsequent confessions, let alone his own memoirs, in which it appears.  </p>

<p>As for Rupert Butler’s book- the IHR claims <a href="http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v07/v07p389_Faurisson.html">here</a> that Butler was anti-Nazi, but such is not the case.  Outside of Butler’s book, I cannot find a single shred of evidence that Bernard Clarke ever existed.  Neither Bernard nor Clarke are Jewish names, despite the IHR’s suggestion.  [Addendum: also, I don&#39;t know why Butler would have asked after his religion or noted it in his book.]</p>

<p>Ken Jones does not corroborate this Clarke’s account, because he does not say they beat Hoess, but rather kept him awake.  Tiresome, to be sure, but hardly torture.  I’m sure he caught up on his sleep before writing his memoirs, which I note you have not addressed.  </p>

<p>Incidentally, Hoess states <a href="http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v07/v07p389_Faurisson.html">here</a> that “I was arrested on 11 March 1946 (at 11 pm).” The temperatures could not have been very brutal.  Anyway, strange for them to give him some yard time.  </p>

<p>You are mistaken- Edward L. Van Roden was speaking about the Malmedy Massacre Trials, not the Nuremberg Trials.  The difference is significant, because the defendants were in the care of two different armies (the American and the British, respectively), with manifestly different attitudes when it came to the treatment of prisoners.  </p>

<p>There may be enough evidence to consider it a possibility.  You do not do this.  You insist that it happened, despite Hoess’ memoirs which corroborate everything that he was “tortured” into confessing.  </p>

<p>This is why I say you move the goalposts:<br/>
<strong>You:</strong> show me hard evidence of mass graves.<br/>
<strong>Me:</strong> [photo of a mass grave]<br/>
<strong>You:</strong> who knows where it was taken? Who knows when it was taken? The bones are not broken up in a manner consistent with [inconsistently employed] procedures.  </p>

<p><strong>You:</strong> &quot;All that exists is testimony from Nuremberg, much of which was &#39;extracted&#39; by torture and threats.&quot; Hoess was &quot;almost certainly&quot; tortured.<br/>
<strong>Me:</strong> Hoess’ memoirs, which were not testimony from Nuremberg, corroborate these accounts.<br/>
<strong>You:</strong> “…those are just some of the reasons why I think torture was likely. Enough to consider it a possibility at the very least.&quot;  </p>

<p>Again, I will not fault you for cutting off our correspondence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Information concerning both Russian pogroms and the Gulag has always been sketchy, but their historicity is not in doubt. Jews were not the primary victims of the Gulag, but Russian-American Jews (many of whom lived in New York City, home to many of these newspapers) maintained relatively strong networks and advocated for their relations back in the old country- hence these reports of Jews canvassing their governments and, even more, <em>their own communities</em> for aid.  </p>

<p>People might want to discuss this with me because they are open-minded and willing to consider simpler explanations that do not commit the &quot;furtive fallacy&quot; of assuming that &quot;history itself is a story of causes mostly insidious and results mostly invidious... that history happens on the back stairs a little after midnight.&quot;</p>

<p>Incidentally, you say 1902, but your source begins in 1915.  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s another quote for you: &quot;In an extreme form, the furtive fallacy is not merely an intellectual error but a mental illness which is commonly called paranoia.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know when my source begins.  If you want to find a reference from 1902 that claimed six million Jews are dying or being killed in Europe, just google it. That&#39;s it you don&#39;t need me.  Why do you care about a debate, to make a big stupid show for reddit?  Who cares what other people think?   </p>

<p>Is your hangup because you&#39;re Jewish?  So what get over it.  I don&#39;t make a big deal about being an Irishman/Italian/German/whatever else I am.</p>

<p>Start standing for the truth and praying to God and he might give you the graces to save your soul.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a really long video- I&#39;ll watch it, but just give me a little background.</p>

<p>I know he says he&#39;s an insider, and other revisionists say he&#39;s an insider, but all I can find about his professional background is that he worked for a soap company and as a small-time venture capitalist.  He&#39;s not a [former] rabbi or a big industrialist, so it seems strange that he would be privy to all this information.  After all, he was born in 1890, and so would only have been 24 when WWI broke out.  </p>

<p>What evidence is there that he really <em>was</em> an insider?  Like, these Administrations- what are their names? I just want to see if I can find some independent verification.</p>
