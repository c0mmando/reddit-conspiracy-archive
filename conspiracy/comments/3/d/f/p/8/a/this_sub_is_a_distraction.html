       Y'all are too wrapped up in bitching about reddit, and making wild, unprovable accusations under the guise of "speculating" with no evidence to show. Nothing but assumptions and massive jumps with little logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       You claim that every large media event that happens is an intentional distraction (as if news wasnt a business that cares about money and will feed sheep whatever stupid celebrity bullshit they want... a little different then intentional distraction), but this subreddit as a whole is a distraction in itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The majority of posts ive seen for the past while have just been idiotic, about something going on internslly at reddit, factually wrong but upvoted by all the ignorant people filling this sub, or just some random article about something a jewish person did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your actions in this subreddit  make it very easy for all of reddit to  all you nuts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your "open mind" is just as closed as anyones just looking from a different perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       You take any disagreement with your narrative as an idiot buying into the media's narrative, not an opportunity for honest logical discussion which BOTH sides may learn from
      </p>
      <p>
       You exist here on reddit for two reasonsm To distract, and froth into this stew of ignorance, and assumption.
      </p>
      <p>
       For all the wild accusations people throw around, maybe they need to take a look in the mirror and see what part theyre  playing.

       You don't  have to know you're  a pawn to be one.

       It happened 14 years ago and as far as i know no major new evidence has really come out since. I think given that it was 14 years ago people need to drop it as the go to conspiracy. was jfk the go to until 9/11? Wonder how long thisll last.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it hard to believe that the us governement did not know it would happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not sure about their ability to prevent such an attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am sure that they exploited the events that occurred, whoever committed these acts, to use them for political means and gonto war in countries they should  not be in, and that since then they have gotten ballsier going into more countres they REALLY shouldn't  be in like yemen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not sure who committed the attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that people need to realize there is a massive difference between committing an attack on you own population,  and exploiting a tradgedy for political means.

       Your passion is evident, but you need to dig deeper. When you write "I'm not sure who committed the attacks," it makes me think: What are you doing here then? Don't you want to find out? It is the SINGLE MORE IMPORTANT SUBJECT TO BE ADDRESSED BY THE COUNTRY.
      </p>
      <p>
       If 9/11 was an inside job -- and it sure looks like a rogue element of the government was behind it, yes, in tandem with other countries -- it means we are under occupation, the corporate media is complicit, and we need to question EVERY other story that comes down the river. How do you not see that? How can you not want the answer to that?

      <p>
       It's hard, coming to the realization of how dark our timeline has actually become. But we will be unlikely to change it if we do not.

       Not "the" country.  not my country. Dont assume the world is USA.  I would like to find out, i doubt that even if that information was made public  that it would have massive implications. Things will keep on keeping on. The world wont riot.
      </p>
      <p>
       the reason i say im not sure who committed the attacks is because the only people who currently are sure are the ones who planned and committed them. Until i see substantial evidence one way or the other i will not be sure.

       It does not mean the media is complicit. It does not necessarily mean that we are under occupation. Those are massive assumptions with zero evidence, the exact thing i made this post about. Who is to say that the media is not as blind as us, and just pushing whatever sells? If were going to go with baseless speculation that seems a lot more probable then every single western media outlet being owned/bought out. Occupation? How are you defining occupation? Is the usa under occupation by lobbygroups, individual protestors, or anyone who seeks to push the direction of the country along? Isn't that an essential part of democracy that all have the potential to influence the countries  outcome? Why is a group attempting to influence your countries path mean your country is "occupied"?
      </p>
      <p>
       The questioning story thingshould apply regardess of whether or not it is corporate media. I question the ATM when it dispenses the bills.

       And being fully disconnected from reality will not help anything. If we want to make a change we NEED evidence. Not speculation.

       We should be striving to  uncover conspiracies. Not write fantasy conspiracy theories, then pat eachother on the back and tell eachother how right we all must be because the fiction that we have created conforms to our world view.

       Man, so much excellent digging has been done on 9/11, it's clear you just really haven't been doing much digging yourself.

       You sound like you aren't really interested in investigating at all, you'd rather dismiss the subject out of hand.  If you are actually interested in learning something though,
       <em>
        Crossing the Rubicon
       </em>
       would be a good place to start.  Or
       <em>
        The Big Bamboozle
       </em>
       .

       No... if evidence is reliable  it can be confirmed by more then one source. Im not taking any individuals word as fact. Im just asking for the exact same evidence, from an alternate source. I know i do not have the time to watch a bunch of documentaries i know the sheer amount  that exist and have watched many.  I would rather  read. That is all.

       No, i want the sources that the documentaries are citing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Documentaries are rarely ever filmed from an unbiased point of view.
      </p>
      <p>
       They rarely ever just present facts and let the viewer make up their opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their goal is to "teach" the viewer about whatever they think is fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why i can watch a 2 hour documentary on the horrors  of sex work and go "wow thats terrible!" Then turn around, watch another documentary about the benefits, and people who are sex workers who love and enjoy their jobs and are way more successful than me and say "huh. Guess its not terrible."
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at documentaries like an incovenient truth, or gasland. These are documentaries that present THEIR facts, and THEIR  side,  but fail to mention how they distort facts or omit information to make you agree with the premise.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want ALL the facts laid out inbiased infront of me for me to figure out.
      </p>
      <p>
       If its so hard for you to understand that, i suggest you stop being a sheep, and start to use your ability to critically think.
      </p>
      <p>
       It blows my mind how many conspiracy theorists use the term sheep to condescendingly refer to the average person, and they dont even realize the majority of these conspiricists are just following a different shepherd.

       Again, you are giving me another movie to watch. Give me the direct sources if it is well sourced and i will look into those. Did you even read my reply?

      <p>
       Its not about "mainstream" sources. Its about reputable ones. I dont trust sources that post blatant lies and misinformation. I trust cnn/fox the same that i trust Alex Jones or natural news. Theyre all just spreading "their truth ". Im more interested in THE truth.

       At this point it's really not that hard to see, think about it dude.
      </p>
      <p>
       Six gigantic media corporations control everything you see on tv, and all the music you hear, and ANYTHING, absolutely anything you see on their mainstream news. Each one of them has their own respective mega news cast (Fox, abc, cbs, etc.,) which are all viewed generously by America, and the rest of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you really just sit there and think about it for a good, long, moment.. And I mean I really want you to entertain the thought, of how much control they really have. Think about all of the stuff you have seen on TV or on a movie, or heard on a song at least in the past year.. And think about how every bit of that is something that they want you to see, hear, or read.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's how they want you to think, act, react, and fear. It's how they want you to speak, it's how they want you to act in public. It's what they want you to be scared of, it's what they want you to be distracted from. It's how they want you to think about the world, and it's entirely everything they want you to think about eachother, and yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's everything dude. Cable TV/Hollywood is everything they want American society to be, in a nutshell.

       My main source of news is the cbc... publically funded. In fact, the vanadian government regently has been trying to force cuts. They do great investigative work.
      </p>
      <p>
       If movies /tv shows/ music are influencing yournlife that heavily  its your parents that have failed you, not  the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, im not convinced there isnt something malicious going on eth many media outlets... but if it didnt sell they wouldnt keep pushing it. People  feed into it constantly. Im not sure if its intentional  evil, or the idiocy of the masses. Afterall media tends to just do whatevers popular.

       You think it's by choice that we live like this? Sure I'll abandon society and go thrive in the plains, farmland, and dead woods of Illinois because I don't have any money, because I have to have a job for that. If I had a job though, I could just buy food, a house, and comfort.

       Does the fact that we all helplessly depend on everything about the system really make a difference as to how they are exploiting us as human beings? Because It seems through a great strive of social engineering got us this way in the first place.

       Being unable to react and stop an attack is not allowing it to happen. Do not assume anything. I have no idea exactly what happened and do not claim to know but have an open mind.

       Are you a building engineer? Im not. I agree tower 7 is extremely sketchy. But like i said i am not educated enough to see a video that was widely published (why only selectively hide film?) And say "aha! These intelligent supersecretive clandestine organizations fucked up! And i caught them!". Sketchiness does not indicate guilt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lack of video isnt  really that sketchy  considering the amount of other videos  that were broadcast worldwide. Why would you selectively hide one video? It doesnt make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, suspicion does not mean guilt. I never said that things werent kinda fishy. I just am saying that there is no strong evidence. Just suspicions and speculations. Ask any black man in the 60s how it felt to be convicted on evidence consisting of solely "suspsicion".

       My point about the pentagon video is that the pentagon has more surveillance than any other building in the world, and you're telling me they can't release a video that shows the plane hitting the building??? It's just ludicrous

       and i support a truly independent  investigation from people who are properly educayed. You do realize that this needs to begin with an unbiased view however right? No matter what structural evidence is found that solely points to how the towers came down. not  who took them down.

       And allowing so much other video and information to be released while hiding one small clip  is equally ridiculous. Either way, it is not evidence towards anyones guilt.

EVIDENCE!

       Its as if ACTUAL critical thinking is being opposed here...
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, in reality it is most likely the userbase being comprised of mostly morons. The word conspiritard applies heavily to many so called conspiracy theorists.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time my paranoid conspiracy theorist side is almost laughing at this. I mean, if anyone is running campaigns to discredit conspiracy theorists, and we KNOW similar campaigns (to influence people's ideas through fake online profiles and their postings) ARE being run by countries like china in website comments everywhere, then i'd consider this one HIGHLY successful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit has the power to bring to light many things that individuals do not. From added perspectives/thoughts/general putting our brains together, we posses an immense amount of power to decipher information and sort out the real from the fake. And this sub has become a shitpile, that regularily downvotes and insults any critical thinking, anything that goes against THEIR percived narrative. Theres not much good a supercomputer can do when its stuck in a loop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell you got downvoted for just saying you agree and giving an opinion. Downvotes are not for disagreement. Regardless of your opinion it adds to this conversation.

       Exactly!  I was told by someone on this thread that it's dangerous to believe everything your told.  To which I replied it's just as dangerous to believe everything your told is a lie.  Your observation about being just as close minded, but from a different perspective is dead on.  You deserve a thousand upvotes for it, unfortunatly I can only give you one.

       Every time i comment pointing out someones complete lack of evidence i get downvoted by the circlejerk. I don't contribute much to reddit as a whole aside from comments. This sub is no different. You can't expect everyone who has an interest in conspiracy to be frequent posters  or be devoting their lives to uncovering something.

       Do you need to be able to sing to comment on whether or not rebecca black had talent when recording friday?

       Do you need to ge a stripper to be able to say whether or not it was a good lap dance?

       Do you need to be a drywaller to mention that the guys left a big bump in your wall?
