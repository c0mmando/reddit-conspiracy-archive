<blockquote>
<p>Investigators monitoring air quality at the World Trade Center, after the September 11th attacks, found extremely high levels of volatile organic chemicals as well as unusual species that had never been seen before in structure fires. Data collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency indicate striking spikes in levels of benzene, styrene, and several other products of combustion</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Professor Steven Jones, one of the scientists who made the &#39;WTC nano-thermite composite&#39; discovery, and one of the writers of the study published in The Open Chemical Physics Journal, <strong>has offered his WTC dust samples for NIST to use in their own tests, and has asked NIST to acquire their own materials for the tests, but NIST apparently has not even replied to his letters.</strong></p>

<p>On Professor Jones&#39;s discovery NIST has commented that is not &quot;scientifically valid&quot; because Jones can&#39;t prove the &quot;chain of custody&quot; of the dust he tested.</p>

<p>For NIST and debunkers, Professor Jones has replied, &quot;They don&#39;t need my dust to test. They have plenty of dust of their own where they know the chain of custody. They just won&#39;t test it.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can&#39;t say I wouldn&#39;t be concerned about giving out my samples after what happened to Kevin Ryan</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Immediately after the article was published, it appeared that a response might be forthcoming due to inexplicable damage to several packages sent, via the US Postal Service, between some of the investigators who were involved. When my colleague Steven Jones sent a sample of the red-gray chips to my post office box in late April 2009, the samples had been removed from the double envelope package through a series of slits just barely big enough to slide the small vial out. The postal inspector never responded to my complaint. But when I later mailed something to my colleague James Gourley, the envelope arrived with a corner ripped out, in a gross kind of damage that neither of us had ever seen.[iv] </p>

<p><a href="http://www.ultruth.com/Mail%20damage.htm">http://www.ultruth.com/Mail%20damage.htm</a></p>

<p>Which would be cause for concern if I were Basile as well. According to <a href="http://www.aneta.org/members/Rick/">Rick Shaddock</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Mark is working on the project and is in monthly contact about the progress being made for a study that can be published. The independent lab or labs or details will not be disclosed until the tests are complete and the study is being prepared fo publication. ISF (used to be JREF, disowned by James Randi) may try to sabotage the experiment by contacting the lab. &quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just like the known &quot;debunker&quot; who hired the known fraud James Millette to &quot;refute&quot; the Active thermitic paper says, I think we should wait and see.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ve been told that no information will be released untilo the final results are published. I believe Mark Basile has said he will release all data, whatever the outcome, but don&#39;t quote me on that just yet. All communication from me to Mark has beenn one-way. We don&#39;t know if any of the suggestions I relayed to Mark from Sunstealer and others here were taken into account when they developed their protocol. Wait and see... &quot; - Chris Mohr</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mohr also states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There WERE multiple donors, including one fairly major one I think, and they are trying to gear up for this now. <strong>If it&#39;s anything like what I went through trying to find Jim Millette, it will take some time.&quot;</strong> - Chris Mohr</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All that time spent by Mohr and he <strong>still</strong> ended up hiring a fraud.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>EPA whistleblower Dr. Cate Jenkins used the phrase “deliberate misrepresentation” with regard to their studies in which samples were manipulated through pre-conditioning to lower the pH before testing.  Millette’s name shows up in Jenkins’ report four times because he participated in several EPA-funded studies that Jenkins has charged with <a href="http://www.journalof911studies.com/volume/200704/DrJenkinsRequestsSenateInvestigationOnWTCdust.pdf">fraud.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.peer.org/news/news-releases/2015/04/21/egregious-epa-misconduct-delivers-whistleblower-win/">http://www.peer.org/news/news-releases/2015/04/21/egregious-epa-misconduct-delivers-whistleblower-win/</a></p>

<p>I believe we were promised peer review / publication of that fraud&#39;s paper by Mohr. What happened with that?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In addition, the results will soon be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. &quot; - Mohr</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but the faithers all find this perfectly acceptable.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t seem to be making an accusation? Plus why would a former editor be privy to any internal information?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Scholarly peer review (also known as refereeing) is the process of subjecting an author&#39;s scholarly work, research, or ideas to the scrutiny of others who are experts in the same field, before a paper describing this work is published in a journal or as a book. The peer review helps the publisher (that is, the editor-in-chief or the editorial board) deciding whether the work should be accepted, considered acceptable with revisions, or rejected. Peer review requires a community of experts in a given (and often narrowly defined) field, who are qualified and able to perform reasonably impartial review. Impartial review, especially of work in less narrowly defined or inter-disciplinary fields, may be difficult to accomplish; and the significance (good or bad) of an idea may never be widely appreciated among its contemporaries. Peer review is generally considered necessary to academic quality and is used in most major scientific journals, but does by no means prevent publication of all invalid research. Traditionally, peer reviewers have been anonymous, but there are currently a significant amount of open peer review, where the comments are visible to readers, generally with the identities of the peer reviewers disclosed as well.</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review">Source</a>  </p>

<p>Abstract  </p>

<p>A complex modulated structure of reactive elements that have the capability of considerably more heat than organic explosives while generating a working fluid or gas. The explosive and method of fabricating same involves a plurality of very thin, stacked, multilayer structures, each composed of reactive components, such as aluminum, separated from a less reactive element, such as copper oxide, by a separator material, such as carbon. The separator material not only separates the reactive materials, but it reacts therewith when detonated to generate higher temperatures. The various layers of material, thickness of 10 to 10,000 angstroms, can be deposited by magnetron sputter deposition. The explosive detonates and combusts a high velocity generating a gas, such as CO, and high temperatures.</p>

<p>No such spaceship exists. </p>

<p>And, similarly, there is no evidence of &quot;nanothermite&quot; ever being used in any actual explosive demolitions, before or after 9/11, in the military or civilian world. Given it supposedly did such a remarkably perfect job, bringing the building down in its own footprint, you&#39;d think it would have replaced all conventional explosives by now. Or, at least, been used on ONE other occasion. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Peer-reviewed, scientific research confirmed the presence of extremely high temperatures at the WTC[1] .</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Claims made in the paper, “Extremely high temperatures during the World Trade Center destruction” Journal of 9/11 Studies volume 19 2008, which has not undergone the peer-review process. This study uses samples of questionable origin (see Argument: Evidence of thermite found in previously molten metal, WTC dust and steel) and a sample size too small to determine statistical significance.</p>

<p>Sources:</p>

<p>[<a href="http://www.journalof911studies.com/articles/%E2%80%8BWTCHighTemp2.pdf">www.journalof911studies.com/articles/​WTCHighTemp2.pdf</a> ]</p>

<p>PLEASE STOP MISLEADING READERS AND MIS-REPRESENTING INFORMATION</p>

<pre><code>A peer-reviewed scientific publication has identified the presence of nanothermite in the WTC dust.
</code></pre>

<p>According to the paper, “Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9/11 World Trade Center Catastrophe”, the samples analyzed were obtained by citizens of NY on 9/11 and 9/12. These four samples were not collected and stored in sterile containers, nor is there any information guaranteeing that these four samples have not been contaminated. In a call for samples put out in 2006, five years during which samples could become contaminated, only five samples were able to collected and none by other researchers that obtained dust samples in sterile containers? In the Materials &amp; Methods section, there are no sources given about standard sample collection procedure nor is there any information as to requirements for samples obtained, i.e., was the “general request” merely for dust collected in proximity to the WTC following collapse or was it more specific in asking for only samples in which these “red/gray chips” of such interest could be found? Without information about sample collection, the “experimental” results are void. The fact that the fifth sample obtained was not included in the study due to the owners unwillingness to disclose his identity is suspicious and requires explanation. Again, citations showing standard sample collection procedures are needed.</p>

<p>What is this evidence for thermite? Is it simply trace elements that could be commonly associated with many other sources, or is it something that can only be explained by the use of thermite?</p>

<p>Steve Jones has claimed to have found iron, sulfur, aluminum, potassium, manganese, fluorine &amp; titanium in the samples he tested, all of which are commonly used in thermite. Could there be another possible (and more likely) explanation for these elements being found?</p>

<p>Sulfur: The third most common ingredient in the WTC construction was gypsum-based drywall, which is 18.62% sulfur.</p>

<p>Iron: Used in paint &amp; electronic devices.</p>

<p>Potassium: Used in concrete.</p>

<p>Manganese: Used in the structural steel, paint, batteries, &amp; ceramics.</p>

<p>Fluorine: Used in Freon. 200,000 pounds of Freon cooled the WTC complex. This was the largest air-conditioning system in the country.</p>

<p>Titanium: Used in paper &amp; paint &amp; made up 2% of each of the 767’s. WTC7 was also clad in polished steel &amp; titanium.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t it make sense to find natural sources for these elements before jumping to “thermite” as a cause?</p>

<p>Another of Jones’ claims is that 3000lbs of thermite (1000lbs per building) would be needed to demolish the three buildings (WTC 1,2, and 7). Thermite is 2% sulfur, thus the total amount of sulfur in the theoretical thermite charges would be about 60 pounds. Approximately 1 million tons (2 billion pounds) of dust blanketed lower Manhattan. So, based on Professor Jones’ estimates, a thermite reaction would result in the WTC dust containing approximately 0.000003% (3 millionths of a percent) sulfur. Such a low percentage would be unlikely to be detected, especially when compared to USGS dust samples in which as much as 5.4% sulfur was reported. Now, since we have elements which have a natural explanation, how about chemical signatures that are unique to thermite, such as aluminum oxide and barium nitrate? Neither the USGS nor Steven Jones himself report finding any traces of either of these elements – two telltale elements of thermite.</p>

<p>Jones also claims to have detected 1,3-diphenylpropane from “sol-gel” used to affix the thermite to the support structure of the building. 1,3-diphenylpropane is a common bi-product of burning polyvinyl chloride (plastic). Considering the massive amounts of plastic in use in two 110 story (and one 47 story) office buildings, this would be a much more likely case than the much smaller amount of sol-gel necessary to place 3000lbs of thermate charges. Also, 1,3-diphenylpropane was reported by the EPA three weeks after the attacks. * This is even mentioned in an article that Steve Jones sources. **</p>

<p>Does Prof. Jones have credentials that enable him to make these claims? Does he have training as a civil engineer, in demolition or building collapse forensics? Is he a metallurgist? Was his paper submitted for peer review in a respected journal related to the topic of his paper, such as The Journal of Engineering Mechanics?</p>

<p>A complex modulated structure of reactive elements that have the capability of considerably more heat than organic explosives while generating a working fluid or gas. The explosive and method of fabricating same involves a plurality of very thin, stacked, multilayer structures, each composed of reactive components, such as aluminum, separated from a less reactive element, such as copper oxide, by a separator material, such as carbon. The separator material not only separates the reactive materials, but it reacts therewith when detonated to generate higher temperatures. The various layers of material, thickness of 10 to 10,000 angstroms, can be deposited by magnetron sputter deposition. The explosive detonates and combusts a high velocity generating a gas, such as CO, and high temperatures.</p>

<p>The 1993 Patent read your mind. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A method for providing chemical energy and energetic compositions of matter consisting of thin layers of substances which will exothermically react with one another. The layers of reactive substances are separated by thin layers of a buffer material which prevents the reactions from taking place until the desired time. The reactions are triggered by an external agent, such as mechanical stress or an electric spark. The compositions are known as metastable interstitial composites (MICs). This class of compositions includes materials which have not previously been capable of use as energetic materials. <strong>The speed and products of the reactions can be varied to suit the application.</strong>  </p>

<p>The 23-member 9/11 Consensus Panel is building a body of evidence-based research into the events of September 11, 2001. This evidence -- derived from a standard scientific reviewing process -- is available to any investigation that may be undertaken by the public, the media, academia, or any other investigative body or institution.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.consensus911.org/methodology/">Methodology and Results</a>  </p>

<p>A full account of the 9/11 Consensus statements is presented below.</p>

<p>A simplified Delphi method was used over a six-month period to arrive at the Panel’s Consensus Points regarding the official account of the events of September 11, 2001.</p>

<p><em>The Delphi technique is used in medicine and other applied sciences to generate consensus statements of the best available evidence for treatment protocols, using a series of surveys in which the expert respondents are blind to one another.</em></p>

<p>Starting with Set One in 2011, to establish the best evidence with regard to the alleged events of 9/11, a group of proposed Consensus Points (formulated by Dr. David Ray Griffin and Elizabeth Woodworth) were initially evaluated by four persons expert in 9/11 evidence – persons who remained blind to one another during the process.</p>

<p>Their feedback was incorporated into the Points, which were then forwarded to a further 19 people with expertise in 9/11 evidence – also blind to one another.</p>

<p>The larger group rankings and feedback were in turn incorporated into the formulations, and two further rounds of review were conducted, again blind, for all participants who still had reservations about any of the Points or their supporting references.</p>

<p>As of September 2014, the Consensus Panel has published eight sets of Consensus Points, for a total of 44 Points to date.</p>

<p>Rather, I&#39;m using scientific method BS to suggest that the &quot;overwhelming evidence of preplanned demolition&quot; is incorrect on it&#39;s face. There are so many flaws and errors and suppositions in this &quot;overwhelming evidence&quot; that it simply doesn&#39;t stand up to scrutiny.</p>

<p>So there is evidence worth investigating, but it shouldn&#39;t be investigated because the investigators are criminally complacent? Is this some sort of quantum collaboration? You are fine as long as you don&#39;t start analyzing the facts, because if you do you suddenly become one of the conspirators?

<p>For example, valuable information could come from analysis of the blackened steel from the floors engulfed in flame after the airplane collisions. Steel flanges had been reduced from an inch thick to paper thin, Astaneh said. <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/news/berkeleyan/2001/10/03_grou.html">Source</a>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We need to know how the &quot;eutectic action&quot; happened that&#39;s why astaneh&#39;s timeframe is important. <a href="http://www.internationalskeptics.com/forums/vbimghost.php?do=displayimg&amp;amp;imgid=27691">Can you imagine 15.8mm of steel gone in 8</a> days or an inch of steel turning to a &quot;<a href="https://www.wpi.edu/News/Transformations/2002Spring/steel.html">razor sharpness</a>&quot; in just 2 weeks?   </p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/ijKf1J6">Dr. Astaneh-Asl findings are similar to FEMA&#39;s</a> &quot;It is also possible that the phenomenon started prior to collapse and accelerated the weakening of the steel structure. A detailed study into the mechanisms of this phenomenon is needed to determine what risk, if any, is presented to existing steel structures exposed to severe and long-burning fires. </p>

<p>Now we can see why after NIST said it would address &quot;all major recommendations in the (FEMA) report&quot; they couldn&#39;t dare mention the swiss cheese steel!  If a spontaneously created mixture  in the WTC office fires involving drywall releasing sulfur gas can melt steel in 8 hours we need to find out specifically how this happened. </p>

<p>Whoa slow down there pal. Nowhere in my comment that you have responded too did I claim that the fires did, or didn&#39;t, melt the steel. I was simply refuting the claim that it isn&#39;t possible to extract sulfur from gypsum by burning it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The main point to be taken from that report is that it is indeed uncommon for sulfur to be present in drywall, and is only there if it is what the report calls &quot;problematic&quot;; sulfur is in fact so uncommon in drywall that it can only be reliably identified by first looking for a signal: strontium.</p>

<p>You attempted to present that report as if it showed sulfur was common in drywall, while disguising the context of the report: only drywall that was suspected of containing sulfur because of the strontium levels was tested. That is deceitful.</p>

<p>A second point would be that your earlier conflation of elemental sulfur with sulfur dioxide was also either deceitful or simply ignorant. </p>

<p>You are now attempting to tell me what theories you think I subscribe to in order to pretend you have somewhere given a plausible explanation for the presence of sulfur in WTC7 steel, but in fact you have not.</p>

<p>Dave Thomas of Skeptical Inquirer magazine, noting that the residue in question was claimed to be thermitic because of its iron oxide and aluminum composition, pointed out that these substances are found in many items common to the towers. Thomas stated that in order to cut through a vertical steel beam, special high-temperature containment must be added to prevent the molten iron from dropping down, and that the thermite reaction is too slow for it to be practically used in building demolition. Thomas pointed out that when Jesse Ventura hired New Mexico Tech to conduct a demonstration showing nanothermite slicing through a large steel beam, the nanothermite produced copious flame and smoke but no damage to the beam, even though it was in a horizontal, and therefore optimal position</p>

<p>You don&#39;t look for a specific kind of evidence. You just gather all the evidence. If you are looking for something, you are going to likely mold evidence to fit what you are looking for. </p>

<p>For example; In examining 911, if you were looking for explosives you might mistake the materials in the dust for thermite (not an explosive, but still), and forget or ignore the fact that the materials were already present in the contruction materials of the building and in much larger quantities than you would expect to find in residual thermite.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t pick up a sample of dust and say, &quot;Lets find some explosives!&quot; You say, &quot;Lets see what&#39;s in here and then factor that into our theory!&quot;</p>

<p>Do you need the police to do an investigation to be sure explosives didn&#39;t kill your dog? Or can you look at your dog, see the evidence, and determine that it is pretty unlikely that explosives ran your dog over?</p>

<p>So eutectic formations were found and possible explainations for such an event were given.

<p>a) looking for explosives
b) mistook regular office materials for thermite.</p>

<p>a is false. If it isn&#39;t, feel free to prove it. But, and this is the most important part, it doesn&#39;t matter what their intention was, they&#39;ve found explosives/an incendiary.</p>

<p>b is false. The elements for nano-thermite are not available in regular office buildings. It&#39;s a highly specialized material only used in military applications.</p>

<p>And just for the sake of argument, plain old thermite does not magically form because you have rusted steel and gypsum walls in a building. If you attribute this claim to reason and logic, I really feel for you. You seem to be forgetting that they did not find the separate elements, but the actual thermitic material, <strong>which reacted violently</strong>.</p>

<p>If those compounds magically form in a building, don&#39;t you think you should be able to prove this? Anything to back it up? How about rewriting building requirements?

<p>There may very well have been explosives used in the demolition as well, in addition to thermite charges. However, since NIST never investigated for explosives, we cannot prove additional explosives, only thermite. </p>

<p>Eh no. I am keenly aware of where we are and what the topic of this thread is. I am also keenly aware of how crap the posted evidence is.

<p>Wouldn&#39;t evidence of explosives been found along side the &quot;evidence of thermite&quot;?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Except that nobody has proven that thermite was in the dust. Only that elements that can be used in thermite <em>and also the construction materials of the building</em> were in the dust. Furthermore, when looking at evidence you don&#39;t need to look for something specific or confirmation bias will crop up. That&#39;s why, when looking for thermite, common elements used in construction can be used to confirm your bias (that being that thermite was used). </p>

<p>The dust samples were not the only evidence for thermite. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wouldn&#39;t evidence of explosives been found along side the &quot;evidence of thermite&quot;?</p>

<p>Yes, if the dust was tested for traces of explosives, which it hasn&#39;t been.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s more to it than that and you know it. Simply because some of the elements of the reaction can be explained away as being elements already in the building does not explain the micro spheres indicative of thermitic reactions nor does it explain the ridiculously hot temperatures observed at the scene even weeks afterwards, nor does it explain carbon nanotubes found in first responders lungs. Etc. etc.</p>

<p>The fires at Ground Zero could not be put out for several months. Despite the application of millions of gallons of water to the pile, several rainfall events at the site, and the use of a chemical fire suppressant, the fires would not subside. Thermal images made by satellite showed that the temperatures in the pile were far above that expected in the debris from a typical structure fire. Only thermite, which contains its own oxidant and therefore cannot be extinguished by smothering it, can explain this evidence.</p>

<p>(My note: Don&#39;t try to explain the above away by giving me some theoretical model of how hydrogen/steam reaction could lead to the observed effect. Even though in theory it could lead to hot temps temporarily, it would not keep temperatures that hot for over a month)</p>

<p>Numerous vehicles were scorched or set on fire in the area. Photographic evidence shows that cars parked within the lower-level garage areas of the WTC complex burned as if impacted by a super-hot wind like that described by the eyewitnesses. All non-metallic parts of the cars, including the plastic, rubber, and glass, were completely burned off by a hot blast.</p>

<p>Carbon nanotubes have been found in the WTC dust and in the lungs of 9/11 first responders. Formation of carbon nanotubes requires extremely high temperatures, specific metal catalysts, and carbon compounds exactly like those found in nanothermite formulations. Researchers have discovered that nanothermite produces the same kinds of carbon nanotubes. That finding has been confirmed by independent analysis in a commercial contract laboratory.</p>

<p>Perhaps if there was not a plethora of other evidence pointing to thermitic reaction you would have a decent point, however that is not the case, as the evidence for thermite lies not merely in byproduct elements being observed, but in the other points mentioned above. </p>

<p>Wrong, it&#39;s been proven multiple times it can cut the exact style of steel beams used in the WTC complex. </p>

<p>The evidence it was thermite is far stronger than the &quot;evidence&quot; (lol) for the pancake theory or structural damage to WTC 7, for numerous reasons. </p>

<p>Also, NIST intentionally never looked for explosives or explosive esque compounds in their &quot;investigation&quot; so it&#39;s already flawed science from the start. In addition, the &quot;models&quot; they used supposedly showing WTC 7 collapse have never been released to the public, because they don&#39;t work. </p>

<p>Lets start with a simple and on-topic point. The &quot;evidence of thermite&quot;, ignoring the shoddy methods used to collect samples and report results, is easily explained by the already present materials in the towers that had been there for years. </p>

<p>Before your rebuttal, you should probably state exactly which conspiracy theory you are standing behind. There are many, and they often contradict one another. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry but that is not <strong>scientific evidence</strong> for the official theory. Which is what he suggested.</p>

<p>They are baseless claims thrown around on JREF and similar sites in an attempt to discredit. These claims are also purely aimed at those who watch from the sideline, anyone who does the least amount of effort to check out the validity of these claims will realise that they are unfounded.</p>

<p>And this is something that keeps happening... official theory proponents cry foul about the lack of scientific process whenever they can, but they usually do so by simply throwing claims around, and then they do not bother to actually verify them. Instead, they get repeated ad nauseum until people start believing them</p>

<p>To illustrate my point, your claim that the materials were already in the tower is of course laughably false and rebutted by the authors of the paper. Yet here you are, stating it once again. I really wonder then, if you just haven&#39;t read these rebuttals, or if you just don&#39;t want to hear them.</p>

<p>On top of that, do you yourself <em>really</em> believe that gypsum wall and rusted steel forms a highly energetic incendiary/explosive material in a collapsing building? What is the evidence for this? Can it be reproduced? Why do you accept this as an explanation just because someone utters the words? Why are you not crying foul about the lack of a scientific process when the claim supports the theory you believe?</p>

<p>It&#39;s because every single compound found in that dust <em>was indeed present in the building before collapse in mundane material</em>. Thermite <strong>is just</strong> a metal fuel and a metal oxide. And it&#39;s laughable that you think it needs to be at nanoscale. You could scrape together a rudimentary thermite from the stuff in your house <em>right now</em>. </p>

And that&#39;s really all debunkers have to go on, incredulity, facts or science have nothing to do with it.

<p>&quot;10.000&#39;s of people in the conspiracy!&quot;
&quot;millions of scientists agree with the official story!&quot;</p>

<p>Silly one liners for the simple minded, with the only intent to deceive the reader.

<p>That is the reason why I do not believe the official story, not only is it completely void of evidence, you need to accept all these impossibilities and ignore all of the attempts to cover up the truth. 
When you dissect the story the mainstream media has told about 9/11, nothing really remains, it falls apart on every side, it was changed so many times that nobody really knows what happened, everyone is just left with a vague amalgamation of sound bites they&#39;ve heard throughout the years.</p>

<p>Are we supposed to believe what NIST said or not? Why does this suggested hypothesis that disagrees with NIST being offered as evidence?
<a href="http://debunking911.com/collapse.htm">http://debunking911.com/collapse.htm</a>
NIST did not describe the specific sequence of events after global collapse initiated.
Not at all bothersome to that site that NIST said they would determine why and how the buildings fell and failed to do so. Also not bothersome that NIST didn&#39;t address the melted steel FEMA found? Not addressing all the evidence does not make for a compelling read. For example High Velocity Bursts of Debris From Point-Like Sources in the WTC Towers&quot;</p>

<p>A link about squibs, a link about molten metal.</p>

<p>Are you linking things you don&#39;t believe or something?</p>

<p>Did you or did you not provide 2 different sources, one being squibs one being molten metal.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just asking which one of these you believe, it obviously can&#39;t be both because both explosives and thermite wouldn&#39;t have been used together.</p>

<p>And you&#39;re not telling me why both would ever be used together.</p>

<p>Second, the study linked in this thread has been debunked 100 times.</p>

<p>I assumed you knew this study was complete bullshit, which is why I didn&#39;t bother refuting it.</p>

<p><a href="https://willyloman.wordpress.com/2009/08/23/more-bad-science-surrounding-the-nano-thermite-red-herring/">https://willyloman.wordpress.com/2009/08/23/more-bad-science-surrounding-the-nano-thermite-red-herring/</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s a bunch of debunkings of the thermite angle, directly from the truther movement.</p>

<p>Even most truthers know the thermite thing is bullshit. That&#39;s why there are 2 different sides.</p>

<p>One side says thermite one side says explosives. The explosive guys push the squibs angle and the thermite guys push the molten metal angle.</p>

<p>You tried to push both, which leads me to believe you kind of just believe everything you read and don&#39;t have much critical thinking ability.</p>

<p>There is no logical reason to use both.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what I&#39;m talking about.  Since you can&#39;t wrap your head around the fact that 9/11 was perpetrated by the powerful elite,  even though the evidence is overwhelming,  you resort to these debunking websites that narrow the focus to a tiny fraction of the days occurrences and spend pages explaining why it proves that the official story is in fact correct,  so that you can sleep at night knowing the unchangable world you live in is intact.  The debunkers have a dysfunctional mind in which only one half is working, the left  half,  in which logic means everything but are missing the more holistic view of the right half.  They have no imagination or creativity, just a sterile and static mainstream worldview in which all existing theories are correct and immortal and anything that challenges them must be debunked no matter how ridiculous the explanation.  This is what your faith in government and the belief in the benevolence of those in power have turned you into - a dysfunctional automaton that is programmed to serve them.  The genius is that you are totally oblivious to how your mind has been hijacked and that you are so absolutely sure of the legitimacy of your beliefs your mind can never be changed no matter the evidence.  All you have to do is look up that subject and debunked on a search engine and then sigh in relief as the cognitive dissonance recedes.</p>

<p>Yours has nobody actually credible.</p>

<p>I linked these websites because they link to studies/evidence against what you&#39;re saying.</p>

<p>This is what annoys me the most with conspiracy theorists, they act like they&#39;re intelligent when in reality they&#39;re just really gullible people with extreme cases of paranoia and confirmation bias.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not on the &quot;smart&quot; side here friend and if by &quot;automaton&quot; you mean person with critical thinking ability not on par with a 4 year old I&#39;ll take it.</p>

<p>The really weird part to me here is the fact you seem to believe my side is the one that lacks evidence, and yours is the one with evidence?</p>

<p>You do realize it&#39;s the other way around correct? I&#39;ve actually read both sides of basically every argument and the debunking side is far more rational and has far more credible evidence than the truther side.</p>

<p>Every single conspiracy around 9/11 has been firmly and soundly debunked by experts at this point.</p>

<p>I feel bad for people like you because you probably actually believe you&#39;re the sane/rational one here and it&#39;s really depressing.</p>

<p>My argument doesn&#39;t come from &quot;faith in the government&quot; it comes from understanding numbers and knowing how to read evidence and detect bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well yes, it&#39;s in the NIST report. So we have a pretty good indication. From the impact zone, only 3 pieces showed evidence of having reached temperatures of 250°C. None of the analysed steel showed evidence of having reached temperatures of 650°C.</p>

<p>Which is entirely what you would expect in a normal fire, and which <strong>is not enough</strong> to weaken steel, especially not in an hour time, but not even in 24 hours, and certainly not globally and instantaneous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the NIST FAQ:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, when bare steel reaches temperatures of 1,000 degrees Celsius, it softens and its strength reduces to roughly 10 percent of its room temperature value. <strong>Steel that is unprotected (e.g., if the fireproofing is dislodged) can reach the air temperature within the time period that the fires burned within the towers.</strong></p>

<p>Do you disagree with this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no reason to disagree with that. But NIST plays clever semantic trickery in answering the question to hide the fact that they are talking about a hypothetical impossible situation, and not the fires on 9/11.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s break it down:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>when bare steel reaches temperatures of 1,000 degrees Celsius</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, they mean IF bare steel reaches that temperature. It does not happen in office fires. Because the conditions for that only happen briefly, rarely, during/right after a flashover. To suggest, as NIST does, that these conditions were there during the entire fire, for more than an hour, is preposterous.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Steel that is unprotected (e.g., if the fireproofing is dislodged) can reach the air temperature within the time period that the fires burned within the towers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, they suggest that the fire was 1100°C during the entire event. They know this wasn&#39;t the case (you just have to read their fire analysis to know this), so they do not say it out loud, they suggest it.</p>

<p>The only thing you can say about that paragraph, is that they are not lying, but they are miles away from being truthful, or from the actual events from September 11 for that matter.</p>

<p>It is food for the passer by, not for someone who stops to think about what they are saying and suggesting between the lines.</p>

<p>What an absolute fool you are. You have no clue about anything, you&#39;re just throwing out one guess after the other.</p>

<p>1100°C is the <strong>maximum upper air layer temperature</strong>, it is very rare and only achieved briefly during a flashover. The temperature of the fire was only about 3-400°C (also straight from the NIST report.) Because it was just a regular office fire, aside from how it was started, there was nothing special about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was NOT 3-400 c only, at least not in every area.</p>

<p>The fire was 1100-1800 F depending on area.</p>

<p>400 C is the average office fire, if you think this was an average office fire you&#39;re delusional.</p>

<p>&quot;Based on its comprehensive investigation, NIST concluded that the WTC towers collapsed because: (1) the impact of the planes severed and damaged support columns, dislodged fireproofing insulation coating the steel floor trusses and steel columns, and widely dispersed jet fuel over multiple floors; and (2) the subsequent unusually large number of jet-fuel ignited multi-floor fires (which reached temperatures as high as 1,000 degrees Celsius, or 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit) significantly weakened the floors and columns with dislodged fireproofing to the point where floors sagged and pulled inward on the perimeter columns. This led to the inward bowing of the perimeter columns and failure of the south face of WTC 1 and the east face of WTC 2, initiating the collapse of each of the towers. Both photographic and video evidence—as well as accounts from the New York City Police Department aviation unit during a half-hour period prior to collapse—support this sequence for each tower&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>But it <em>was</em> an average office fire. Why would it be different? An office fire does not magically burn hotter because it was started differently. Jet fuel would not even increase the heat, and even if it did, it burned up on impact almost completely, what was left burned up during the first few minutes of the fire.</p>

<p>Please tell us how this fire was different from another office fire, why would it burn hotter? And why do we have all this evidence of this being nothing more than a (relatively) cool burning office fire? The analysis of the steel tells us it was normal, so does the imagery we have which shows small fires, little flame and lots of smoke, we have reports from the firefighters in the towers. There were people in the impact zone that survived. And there people above the impact zone that got out by traversing the impact zone.</p>

<p>So basically, everything points to a regular office fire, yet, NIST goes out of their way to turn this into a raging inferno for which they do not have any evidence, just a computer model, which nobody can see, which they admittedly altered to achieve observed effects. In other words, they reject hard evidence in favor of numbers they pull out of thin air just because it makes the building behave as it did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing you&#39;ve linked here said it burned at 400 C, in fact is says what I said.</p>

<p>You made the claim that the fire was 400 C, the report you just linked says it wasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Second, no that isn&#39;t how jet fuel works.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t instantly gone, and it wasn&#39;t the only thing fueling the fire.</p>

<p>honestly I can read through 9/11 quack bullshit all day and in the end it means nothing.</p>

<p>The overwhelming majority of scientific evidence is on my side, the truther movement is dead and the only people left are just not wanting to accept reality because it doesn&#39;t fit their world view.</p>

<p>Like the entire thing is just stupid, even if you don&#39;t want to get into the mechanics of it the conspiracy has other glaring issues.</p>

<p>Like the fact something like this would need thousands of people planning and carrying it out, and nobody has come forward yet which is fucking insane.</p>

<p>Bill Clinton couldn&#39;t keep a blowjob secret and only 2 people knew about it, Nixon couldn&#39;t keep watergate under raps and like 10 people knew about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is why your whole post is crap</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Peer-reviewed, scientific research confirmed the presence of extremely high temperatures at the WTC[1] .</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Claims made in the paper, “Extremely high temperatures during the World Trade Center destruction” Journal of 9/11 Studies volume 19 2008, which has not undergone the peer-review process. This study uses samples of questionable origin (see Argument: Evidence of thermite found in previously molten metal, WTC dust and steel) and a sample size too small to determine statistical significance.</p>

<p>Sources:</p>

<p>[<a href="http://www.journalof911studies.com/articles/%E2%80%8BWTCHighTemp2.pdf">www.journalof911studies.com/articles/​WTCHighTemp2.pdf</a> ]</p>

<p><strong>PLEASE STOP MISLEADING READERS AND MIS-REPRESENTING INFORMATION</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A peer-reviewed scientific publication has identified the presence of nanothermite in the WTC dust.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the paper, <strong>“Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9/11 World Trade Center Catastrophe”,</strong>  the samples analyzed were obtained by citizens of NY on 9/11 and 9/12. These four samples were not collected and stored in sterile containers, nor is there any information guaranteeing that these four samples have not been contaminated. In a call for samples put out in 2006, five years during which samples could become contaminated, only five samples were able to collected and none by other researchers that obtained dust samples in sterile containers? In the Materials &amp; Methods section, there are no sources given about standard sample collection procedure nor is there any information as to requirements for samples obtained, i.e., was the “general request” merely for dust collected in proximity to the WTC following collapse or was it more specific in asking for only samples in which these “red/gray chips” of such interest could be found? Without information about sample collection, the “experimental” results are void. The fact that the fifth sample obtained was not included in the study due to the owners unwillingness to disclose his identity is suspicious and requires explanation. Again, citations showing standard sample collection procedures are needed.</p>

<p>What is this evidence for thermite?  Is it simply trace elements that could be commonly associated with many other sources, or is it something that can only be explained by the use of thermite?</p>

<p>Steve Jones has claimed to have found iron, sulfur, aluminum, potassium, manganese, fluorine &amp; titanium in the samples he tested, all of which are commonly used in thermite. Could there be another possible (and more likely) explanation for these elements being found?</p>

<p>Sulfur: The third most common ingredient in the WTC construction was gypsum-based drywall, which is 18.62% sulfur.</p>

<p>Iron: Used in paint &amp; electronic devices.</p>

<p>Potassium: Used in concrete.</p>

<p>Manganese: Used in the structural steel, paint, batteries, &amp; ceramics.</p>

<p>Fluorine: Used in Freon. 200,000 pounds of Freon cooled the WTC complex. This was the largest air-conditioning system in the country.</p>

<p>Titanium: Used in paper &amp; paint &amp; made up 2% of each of the 767’s. WTC7 was also clad in polished steel &amp; titanium.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t it make sense to find natural sources for these elements before jumping to “thermite” as a cause?</p>

<p>Another of Jones’ claims is that 3000lbs of thermite (1000lbs per building) would be needed to demolish the three buildings (WTC 1,2, and 7).  Thermite is 2% sulfur, thus the total amount of sulfur in the theoretical thermite charges would be about 60 pounds.  Approximately 1 million tons (2 billion pounds) of dust blanketed lower Manhattan. So, based on Professor Jones’ estimates, a thermite reaction would result in the WTC dust containing approximately 0.000003% (3 millionths of a percent) sulfur.  Such a low percentage would be unlikely to be detected, especially when compared to USGS dust samples in which as much as 5.4% sulfur was reported.  Now, since we have elements which have a natural explanation, how about chemical signatures that are unique to thermite, such as aluminum oxide and barium nitrate?  Neither the USGS nor Steven Jones himself report finding any traces of either of these elements – two telltale elements of thermite.</p>

<p>Jones also claims to have detected 1,3-diphenylpropane from “sol-gel” used to affix the thermite to the support structure of the building.  1,3-diphenylpropane is a common bi-product of burning polyvinyl chloride (plastic).  Considering the massive amounts of plastic in use in two 110 story  (and one 47 story) office buildings, this would be a much more likely case than the much smaller amount of sol-gel necessary to place 3000lbs of thermate charges.  Also, 1,3-diphenylpropane was reported by the EPA three weeks after the attacks. *  This is even mentioned in an article that Steve Jones sources. **</p>

<p>Does Prof. Jones have credentials that enable him to make these claims?  Does he have training as a civil engineer, in demolition or building collapse forensics?  Is he a metallurgist?  Was his paper submitted for peer review in a respected journal related to the topic of his paper, such as The Journal of Engineering Mechanics?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NOT TO MENTION THE OTHER NUMEROUS EVIDENCE:</p>

<ul>
<li>Collapse of towers at FREE FALL speed. Basic physics tells us that something cannot come down at free fall speed if there is resistance involved. The resistance would normally be the steel girders of the numerous floors beneath the site of the plane crash. But in this case the collapse encountered no resistance. This is why Architects for Engineers has a group of hundreds of professionals who have also come to the conclusion that it was done by controlled demotion</li>
<li>The fact that our emergency air intercepting system NORAD which can shoot down planes was told to stand down numerous times by Dick Cheney. </li>
<li>The fact that firefighters encountered multiple pockets of intense molten steel that could only produce that temperature given nano termite. Jet fuel cannot do that sort of melting.</li>
<li>The towers had weeks of maintenance during irregular hours prior to the attack when they could have been wired with explosives</li>
<li>Larry Silverstein owner of the towers increased his insurance policy on the building and even had plane crashes added to the policy.</li>
<li>WTC 7 which never had a plane hit it also came down at free fall speed. The cause for it&#39;s collapse? Nearby debrie from the other towers causing office fires.</li>
<li>ONLY instance in world history of steel towers collapsing due to fire. </li>
<li>Hundreds of witnesses including professionals and firemen saying they heard explosives like that of controlled demolition</li>
<li>OTHER BULL SHIT: We are supposed to believe that passports survived the crash and just happened to be picked up by the FBI and they identified the culprits that way.
No black box evidence revealed. The cell phone calls people made while in the air. The pentagon hole that looks exactly like a missile hole and we are supposed to believe a dumb terrorist that was on a jihad but also had sex with hookers and snorted coke was smart enough to crash into the worlds most safe building at an angle nearly parallel to the ground . In a part of the pentagon that wasn&#39;t even operational. </li>
</ul>

<p>I can tell you the reasons this happened if you are curious. But this is all documented stuff. Mostly stuff you can even test yourself. Don&#39;t be fooled. This is how politics works. They get the public to believe they were attacked so then we can go attack somewhere else in the world. Its so you will feel as if the imperialism is due justice when in fact it is mass murder. </p>

<p>Larry Silverstein just happened to have a doctors appointment that day. RIGHHHHTTTTTT.

    <div class="md"><p>If you can prove through science that the towers and wtc 7 collapsed naturally which no one has yet been able too I&#39;ll gladly take it into consideration.  The science I know tells me that it is impossible for the building to come down the way they did without some type of demolition involved.  That you can&#39;t see it tells me you are easily fooled by hack scientists who are paid or scared to say what the truth is.  That you are easily manipulated by the government and your type is the reason that government is running amok over its citizens.  You would rather believe an institution that has been proven time and again to be absolutely corrupt and a consolidated media that the government controls.  For all this, it is you sir that are totally delusional,  living in a matrix built of lies so dense that you can&#39;t see anything through them.  You have become a slave to corrupt powers that are destroying humanity and in fact work for them in your adherence to attacking whoever they say the crazies are and spouting the latest mainstream talking points.  You are pathetic and can&#39;t even say you own your own mind let alone tell me that you think critically.  </p>

<p>Eh no. I am keenly aware of where we are and what the topic of this thread is. I am also keenly aware of how crap the posted evidence is. The evidence suggests that the materials found in the excurciatingly small (and questionably collected and stored) sample being discussed come from the heaps of already present materials used in the construction of the buildings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There may very well have been explosives used in the demolition as well, in addition to thermite charges.</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t evidence of explosives been found along side the &quot;evidence of thermite&quot;?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, since NIST never investigated for explosives, we cannot prove additional explosives, only thermite. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except that nobody has proven that thermite was in the dust. Only that elements that can be used in thermite <em>and also the construction materials of the building</em> were in the dust. Furthermore, when looking at evidence you don&#39;t need to look for something specific or confirmation bias will crop up. That&#39;s why, when looking for thermite, common elements used in construction can be used to confirm your bias (that being that thermite was used). </p>

<p>So eutectic formations were found and possible explainations for such an event were given. There isn&#39;t a need to check specifically for explosives or thermite because if they found evidence of eutectic formations then evidence of explosives or thermite would be even more apparent, would they not? </p>

<p>400 C is the average office fire, if you think this was an average office fire you&#39;re delusional.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it <em>was</em> an average office fire. Why would it be different? An office fire does not magically burn hotter because it was started differently. Jet fuel would not even increase the heat, and even if it did, it burned up on impact almost completely, what was left burned up during the first few minutes of the fire.</p>

<p>Please tell us how this fire was different from another office fire, why would it burn hotter? And why do we have all this evidence of this being nothing more than a (relatively) cool burning office fire? The analysis of the steel tells us it was normal, so does the imagery we have which shows small fires, little flame and lots of smoke, we have reports from the firefighters in the towers. There were people in the impact zone that survived. And there people above the impact zone that got out by traversing the impact zone.</p>

<p>So basically, everything points to a regular office fire, yet, NIST goes out of their way to turn this into a raging inferno for which they do not have any evidence, just a computer model, which nobody can see, which they admittedly altered to achieve observed effects. In other words, they reject hard evidence in favor of numbers they pull out of thin air just because it makes the building behave as it did.</p>

<p>This is NIST&#39;s fire analysis: <a href="http://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=101420">http://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=101420</a></p>

<p>You might want to read through this document regarding their simulations to better understand how NIST is deceptive and untruthful in producing their reports:

<p>On Professor Jones&#39;s discovery NIST has commented that is not &quot;scientifically valid&quot; because Jones can&#39;t prove the &quot;chain of custody&quot; of the dust he tested.</p>

<p>For NIST and debunkers, Professor Jones has replied, &quot;They don&#39;t need my dust to test. They have plenty of dust of their own where they know the chain of custody. They just won&#39;t test it.&quot; </p>

<p>Can&#39;t say I wouldn&#39;t be concerned about giving out my samples after what happened to Kevin Ryan</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Immediately after the article was published, it appeared that a response might be forthcoming due to inexplicable damage to several packages sent, via the US Postal Service, between some of the investigators who were involved. When my colleague Steven Jones sent a sample of the red-gray chips to my post office box in late April 2009, the samples had been removed from the double envelope package through a series of slits just barely big enough to slide the small vial out. The postal inspector never responded to my complaint. But when I later mailed something to my colleague James Gourley, the envelope arrived with a corner ripped out, in a gross kind of damage that neither of us had ever seen.[iv] </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Just like the known &quot;debunker&quot; who hired the known fraud James Millette to &quot;refute&quot; the Active thermitic paper says, I think we should wait and see.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ve been told that no information will be released untilo the final results are published. I believe Mark Basile has said he will release all data, whatever the outcome, but don&#39;t quote me on that just yet. All communication from me to Mark has beenn one-way. We don&#39;t know if any of the suggestions I relayed to Mark from Sunstealer and others here were taken into account when they developed their protocol. Wait and see... &quot; - Chris Mohr</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mohr also states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There WERE multiple donors, including one fairly major one I think, and they are trying to gear up for this now. <strong>If it&#39;s anything like what I went through trying to find Jim Millette, it will take some time.&quot;</strong> - Chris Mohr</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All that time spent by Mohr and he <strong>still</strong> ended up hiring a fraud.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>EPA whistleblower Dr. Cate Jenkins used the phrase “deliberate misrepresentation” with regard to their studies in which samples were manipulated through pre-conditioning to lower the pH before testing.  Millette’s name shows up in Jenkins’ report four times because he participated in several EPA-funded studies that Jenkins has charged with <a href="http://www.journalof911studies.com/volume/200704/DrJenkinsRequestsSenateInvestigationOnWTCdust.pdf">fraud.</a></p>

<p>I believe we were promised peer review / publication of that fraud&#39;s paper by Mohr. What happened with that?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In addition, the results will soon be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. &quot; - Mohr</p>
