       For politicians, I'm guessing it's not so much that they're stupid, but more that they just don't care. They just won't vote for anything that affects them personally. Most of them live in a bubble. Pay cut on their salary? Fuck no. Increase tax on the wealthy? Fuck no.   Mass surveillence on the common folk? Fuck yeah.

       One of the little-discussed consequences of Nazism (and 20th century totalitarianism in general) was the instruction to future governments on how to totally deceive a population.  9/11 and the Reichstag fire are the exact same thing--false flags in order to win the support of the public through deceit.  It's like what Goering said about making the people think they are being attacked--it always works to bring about an unpopular war.

       It's called "framing" basically you speak terrorist terror then attack then you put Sadam Hussein in the middle then you talk about terrorism and something else involving fear and people naturally construct in their minds Sadam is a terrorist spreading fear.

       I agree.  The people on the god-box said, "The towers just collapsed," and everyone believed it because the people on the god-box said so.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they had reported truthfully about what was happening (and what is clearly visible to all with functioning eyes and brain), they would've said, "The towers just exploded and turned to dust."

       Perfectly put, my friend. It's refreshing to know that at least the entire world hasn't gone crazy. That there are still some rational people around, who will put their own eyes ahead of a TV screen as a source.

       But I didn't at first.
      </p>
      <p>
       Worse, on the afternoon of 9/11, I stood holding my wife in the living room of our home, as we watched
       <a href="https://youtu.be/B8v2Oc9HizE">
        Dan Rather comment on the "collapse" of WTC7
       </a>
       , and I stated openly, "Now
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       was controlled demolition."  But the next morning, the "official" lie had taken over, and I didn't think of it again until a girl on Myspace sent me
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUrxlSVAnm8">
        the 10-second video of WTC7
       </a>
       in 2007, and it all came rushing back.
      </p>
      <p>
       I eventually came to my senses, and unplugged that box of filth and lies in 2009.  It's been over six years, and I'm still coming to terms with how badly I was brainwashed.
      </p>
      <p>
       To anyone reading this:
       <strong>
        UNPLUG.
       </strong>
       After about a month, you will feel better and see more clearly than you have your entire life.

       The tv tells you what to believe.  No discussion is allowed other than what the media owners let you see.  There are no "comment" sections for dissention.  No way to check to see if what you are being told is true.

       I know it didn't take very long because I was looking for WTC7 footage (to reply to another comment) and found
       <a href="https://archive.org/details/cbs200109111651-1733">
        this video
       </a>
       from
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center#Collapse_of_7_World_Trade_Center">
        WTC's wiki page
       </a>
       . Right after WTC 7's live collapse at 32:06, they end up switching over to talk to someone about Bin Laden. This was supposedly around 5:21 pm EDT, just after WTC 7's full collapse. So, it only took them
       <em>
        7 hours to start saying his name.
       </em>
       Even if they were mentioning Bin Laden earlier in the day, that ends up being even worse.

       ...and I just started watching earlier videos. It appears they started talking terrorism within the hour. They even tried to suggest it was a Palestinian organization behind the attacks. Unbelievable. I was 12 when this happened and attending a Florida middle school that didn't allow any of us to know anything about what was happening. I missed all of the early broadcasts, so seriously, thank you for sharing this with me.

       It's alright. I rather enjoy rabbit hole diving now, even though sometimes I get anxiety attacks from it. I was actually planning on watching all of what you linked over the next few days because I feel I need to know what I missed. Also, some of the words being used are awfully familiar. It's almost hard
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       to hear the buzzwords and talking points because they are still using them today.

       On ABC's live coverage, they were interviewing their "man on the street" at 9:01 AM. He happened to be Don Dahler, who was not just any dude, but who worked for ABC too!
      </p>
      <p>
       If you listen to their back and forth as the
       <em>
        second plane
       </em>
       hits the South Tower - take careful note of about 17 seconds before impact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then find that same time frame for NBC, and listen careful at the same time (17~ seconds) on a different network.
      </p>

       And let me know what you think.

       17 seconds prior to impact of the second plane shown on ABC's news coverage (31:06 for when she

        1993 WTC bombing
       </a>
       , which was deemed a terrorist attack, seemingly speculating and implying that this first plane in the North Tower was the result of a terrorist action. The first plane had already made impact at 8:46 am. The second plane then made impact at 9:03 am (31:44 in the previously linked video). 17 minutes after it all starts, terrorism is already being thrown out there as a possibility by what appears to be a coordinated news team. Interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       What...holy shit. 17 seconds prior to impact of the second plane shown on NBC's news coverage (31:42 in

       ), Katie Couric asks her eyewitness on the ground (NBC News Producer Elliott Walker...hmm) about the 1993 WTC bombing, as well. Another coordinated topic of conversation?
      </p>
      <p>
       17 seconds prior to impact of the second plane shown on CNN's news coverage (14:39 in

        this video
       </a>
       ), Winston Mitchell (CNN's eyewitness at the moment) adjusts his position so he can see the hole in WTC 1 better (no close mention of 1993 here). A couple seconds before impact, we see a glitch at 14:56 (when it appears impact has been made) and then we hear:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "The building's EXPLODING right now, we've got people running up the street...okay, the whole building just exploded some more...uh, am I still connected?"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No plane was mentioned...just an idea that the first fuselage might still be in the first tower and references to "second" explosions.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Now, one of our producers said perhaps a second plane was involved and let's not, let's not even speculate to that point, but at least put it out there that
        <em>
         perhaps
        </em>
        that may have happened...the second explosion would certainly back the theory from a couple of eyewitnesses that the plane fuselage perhaps stayed in those upper buildings. Now, if you look at the second building...both Twin Towers are on fire now...and we're going to check on the second flight, if perhaps that had happened..."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The impact of the second plane shown on Fox's news coverage is at 31:52 in
       <a href="https://archive.org/details/fox5200109110831-0912">
        this video
       </a>
       . At 32:08, we hear the Fox news anchor say,
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Now it's obvious...I think we have a terrorist act of proportions that we cannot begin to imagine at this juncture...obviously, uh, suicide, uh, terrorist attack on the World Trade Center...what we have been fearing for the longest time here, apparently, has come to pass..."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I didn't pick up on all the names of every anchor and eyewitness, and I bet that is important to this (all news affiliates possibly?). I am rather amazed at how swiftly they slipped in the word terrorism (especially Fox News).

       No, it's alright, I play a lot of video games and obviously hang out here on reddit often, so I get mistaken for a male frequently. I only corrected you because I felt we were going to continue talking and I didn't want you thinking I was a man this whole time. :3
      </p>
      <p>
       I will say I'm not all that great at picking out visual artifacts on film, but I'll do my best. I have been curious about one thing in particular: why does
       <em>
        no one
       </em>
       seem to notice the plane actually coming in? Not one newscaster stops talking nor one eyewitness pauses as they gaze in horror on what is inevitably coming. They talk on as if there is nothing there and only when the second explosion occurs do we hear about a plane hitting the tower from ABC, NBC, FOX, and eventually (reluctantly it seems), CNN.
      </p>
      <p>
       At 31:29 on
       <a href="https://archive.org/details/abc200109110831-0912">
        ABC's coverage
       </a>
       , I hear an odd double beep, fairly moderate-high frequency and pretty loud. What is that, do you think? Again, the eyewitness does not appear to see the plane coming in somehow and only reacts
       <em>
        as soon as the explosion is visible
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       At 31:35 on
       <a href="https://archive.org/details/nbc200109110831-0912">
        NBC's coverage
       </a>
       , Couric tries to reign in Elliott and question her about the 1993 WTC bombing, and I notice at this time that the camera view has changed, almost as if it was timed. In these seconds, we see the plane come into view, and once again, no recognition from anyone is heard that something really bad is about to happen (as would be obvious to any onlooker at this point).
      </p>
      <p>
       At 14:56 on
       <a href="https://archive.org/details/cnn200109110848-0929">
        CNN's coverage
       </a>
       , that weird black glitch manifests and again, we hear no reaction from anyone until the explosion happens. This video is a bit harder to prove that either parties saw a plane coming in as the anchor is presumably only looking at that particular camera angle (though that is unlikely), and the eyewitness is in a diner, I believe, on the ground level of NYC, so seeing a plane come in from afar might have been more difficult from the ground nearby the towers. However, the anchor doesn't officially claim that a plane hit the second tower until he gets word from his producers about the possibility, then immediately and instead tries to say perhaps the first plane's fuselage exploded. Why would he state this if he had access to most likely multiple camera angles and would have seen a plane come in if it really had?
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, at 31:52 on
       <a href="https://archive.org/details/fox5200109110831-0912">
        FOX's coverage
       </a>
       , the impact is clear as everyone in the news room instantly reacts and the main anchor states,
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Oh my goodness, there's another one...oh my goodness, there's another one...now it's obvious,
        <em>
         I think that there's a second plane just crashed into the World Trade Center...
        </em>
        "
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again, why did no one in that news room see a plane come into view prior to impact? Rather, why did no one point it out? And he
       <em>
        thinks
       </em>
       there's a second plane?
       <em>
        He isn't sure
       </em>
       ? If there really was a plane, which we are all led to believe there was, how did no one seem to see it coming,
       <em>
        even with all of the world's eyes glued to these towers, the two tallest in NYC at that time
       </em>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm coming to a conclusion that may be totally off the mark, but were there any planes at all? What if these were doctored feeds we were given? It's hard to tell as well if the emotions heard are genuine as we know news anchors are trained to talk about the most gruesome things with a straight face, but I still find it disturbing that this was supposedly LIVE and was one of the most terrible things we had witnessed as a nation, yet no one started screaming or bawling on the air. I would have. This reeks of memorized lines to me.

       Pardon my French, but...
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck. I was hoping that wasn't it, but damn. No. Fucking. Planes.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've got to be shitting me.
      </p>
      <p>
       This then explains how there was no way that a plane could be going that fast without its wings shearing off, as was explained by a Boeing representative (and others) in
       <a href="https://youtu.be/O1GCeuSr3Mk?t=1h36m11s">
        this documentary
       </a>
       . It's because there weren't any damn planes. I already know there is some weird shit surrounding where the planes actually went (landed at an airport and the passengers were "disappeared," shot down in air, etc.), which only adds to this premise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Excuse me while my head explodes.
      </p>
      <p>
       ...

      <p>
       All the world's a stage. They were absolutely not perfect about this...there were a few who messed up their lines, got cut off because they weren't supposed to be interviewed yet perhaps, or people who just didn't react believably enough. They painted it as such an awful tragedy that they ended up subsequently demonizing anyone who actually combs through the mess they made as a morbid denier of truth. I find what they've done evil. 9/11 already amounted to what was essentially a large human sacrifice for the favor of the "gods," who then received insurance payouts, war appropriations, and a new label they could slap on anyone that would fuel fighting across this planet until the end of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, if it makes people uncomfortable, oh well, but I'm going to start discussing this here and on
       <a href="/r/C_S_T">
        /r/C_S_T
       </a>
       . I'm beyond intrigued and now a bit more than convinced that this was all a well-coordinated, but definitely not perfect, play written by TPTB to be played out among the lower castes of society for their amusement and gain.

       As for the Pentagon interview, I assume you are referring to all the stuff that comes after 2:33 in
       <a href="https://archive.org/details/cbs200109110954-1036">
        this video from CBS 9
       </a>
       (the D.C. affiliate for CBS). The Pentagon coverage officially begins at 28:50 in
       <a href="https://archive.org/details/cbs200109110954-1036">
        this video
       </a>
       , and it starts getting interesting with the eyewitness reports coming in
       <a href="https://youtu.be/Z0m81Y7IWwQ?t=52m21s">
        here
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The reports are varied and it seems like they had multiple "witnesses" ready to report at a moment's notice. The first eyewitness (they couldn't get Dave Statter on the line),
       <a href="https://youtu.be/Z0m81Y7IWwQ?t=52m53s">
        Lauren Ashburn
       </a>
       , states that she couldn't confirm what the aircraft looked like that went into the Pentagon, but prior to stating that, Mike Buchanan tried to get her to confirm the report from AP that there was a large airliner that had "plunged into the Pentagon." Their second eyewitness,
       <a href="https://youtu.be/Z0m81Y7IWwQ?t=56m39s">
        Don Chauncey
       </a>
       , states that "from my office, I was able to see a white jet, like a Gulfstream-type, commuter jet, I guess, just came at a high rate of speed. I can see National Airport's tower from our office, and it just increased its speed as it got closer to the Pentagon and I saw the big, yellow ball of fire."
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://youtu.be/Z0m81Y7IWwQ?t=58m30s">
        Dawn Vignola (third eyewitness)
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "I saw the, it was an American Airlines 757 and it came and hit the side, it hit the heliport, came down Columbia Pike and hit the heliport next to the Pentagon. I live in an apartment building on that side of the Pentagon, and it just crashed right into it. I don't know if it damaged the side of the Pentagon, but the Pentagon doesn't look that badly damaged, but I know it hit at least the heliport on the side of the Pentagon."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Andrea Roane:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "You said it was a 757, how could you tell? Could you see that?"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Vignola:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Yes, I could see it. Uh-huh. And my roommate is an airplane person and he saw it too, I mean, we saw the whole thing."

      <p>
       Buchanan:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Did it, it didn't come out of National, it came in from the west?"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Vignola:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "It came right down Columbia Pike...low and with throttles on."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Buchanan:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "With the full, like, full throttle?"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Vignola:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Yeah...he actually added power right by the Sheraton."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Roane:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "And that's what we heard from Dawn as well, he added power and went straight for the Pentagon, so this was no accident, it was deliberate."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The fourth eyewitness,
       <a href="https://youtu.be/Z0m81Y7IWwQ?t=59m57s">
        Shawn Lansdowne
       </a>
       , contradicts his own story here:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "
        <em>
         I was sitting in my bedroom back at home
        </em>
        ...it's right in Arlington, I'm like four minutes, three or four minutes away from the Pentagon, and
        <em>
         I was sitting in my living room
        </em>
        and my building started shaking, and I knew that don't no plane supposed to make my building shake. Well, when I turned around and looked up, I seen this plane, and
        <em>
         I agree with the young lady that was just speaking it was like a 757.
        </em>
        "
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       He's abruptly cut off by Roane who switches to interviewing Dave Statter, their fifth eyewitness.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://youtu.be/Z0m81Y7IWwQ?t=1h28s">
        Dave Statter (there's glitchiness in his last few sentences...odd)
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "The west side of the Pentagon, the helicopter port off of Washington Boulevard, plane into the side of the building. There's a bit of a hole on that side of the building...the plane did not seem to go into the building like the World Trade Center attacks, it seemed more to glance to the side of it and certainly do some damage to the west side of the building...believe this when I tell you, everybody here is scanning the skies, looking for a possible second attack...it definitely hit the building, but certainly it did not seem to leave a gaping hole like we saw at the World Trade Center.
        <em>
         I can't even tell you what size plane it is because it's pretty much consumed.
        </em>
        "
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I also found the coverage of the
       <a href="https://youtu.be/Z0m81Y7IWwQ?t=1h21m42s">
        E Ring's collapse
       </a>
       , and thought it was an odd set of dialogue and events leading up to it:
      </p>
      <p>
       Buchanan:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Let's go to Frank Herzog, who is near one of the most visible monuments in the city, the Washington Monument, Frank, what do you see, what do you hear?"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Frank Herzog:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "I'm on the west grounds of the Washington Monument. The area has been completely evacuated by park police. I think I can answer Dave Statter's question about that secondary explosion?"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Both Buchanan and Roane together:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "YES."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Herzog:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "It wasn't an explosion, that was the sonic boom of jet fighters that were scrambled out of Andrews AFB,
        <em>
         we believe
        </em>
        . They just circled the Washington area, flying from the east out to the west, and they were in a hurry and they were high up in the air. So jet fighters, at least one, possibly two, were scrambled, probably as a precautionary measure. Needless to say, downtown Washington D.C. except for the vehicular traffic, which is bumper to bumper, the rest of the city has been shut down. It looks like a Sunday morning here, the mall is absolutely empty. Park police came through about ten minutes ago and evacuated the entire area and told tourists to go somewhere else.
        <a href="https://youtu.be/Z0m81Y7IWwQ?t=1h22m38s">
         (camera zooms in on the damaged section of the Pentagon...hmm)
        </a>
        But I can tell you right now that at least one, if not two, jet fighters have been scrambled. They are patrolling the skies over Washington."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Buchanan:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Frank Herzog, thank you very much. Let me just read you the Associated Press lead just came out of New York. Uh, first of all, let's check in with Dave Stattert at the Pentagon, Dave?"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Dave Statter:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Uh, oh it collapsed right now as you can see LIVE I assume you are taking our picture, I do not have a monitor, but right now we just had a middle section here of the E Ring of the Pentagon collapse from the amount of fire and destruction from this. So obviously there was a great deal of damage here. It just collapsed. We don't know who was inside or how many people were inside. We heard somebody, one of the people who was inside of the building talk to us a short time ago and said this E Ring of the Pentagon has a great many senior officials, so if somebody was planning something, this might have been the place if they wanted to get senior officials. Um, again, most of the fire on the outside of the building has been extinguished. There's still some spot fires on the outside of the building, and still from what I can see, a great deal of fire inside. So now you have a gaping hole on the west side of the Pentagon here at Washington Boulevard and this collapse just happened. It was not an explosion, a secondary explosion, this apparently the damage from the great deal of fire and the structural damage from the plane crash."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Everyone's report is really varied and they all seem to be making assumptions about what kind of plane it was. I'm still kind of amazed that anyone even saw it come in when it was flying
       <a href="https://youtu.be/O1GCeuSr3Mk?t=1h2m41s">
        over 500 mph
       </a>
       , let alone was able to identify it assuredly as a 757.

       Are you suggesting an alternative explanation for rapidly accelerating multi ton steel beams? If my physics is correct (it very well might not be) an object falling in air will fall at around 9 m/s, if it is moving faster it indicates that someone or something has pushed it.

       The main thing that I remember about that day was watching the towers fall and wondering why they were demolished so fast, what about the people inside? It was obvious that it was a smooth, professional demolition and not a consequence of the planes hitting the top.

       While these facts obviously don't prove anything, don't you think it is excessively arrogant and insulting to proclaim that the vast majority of people in support of a theory you disagree with are idiots who believe what they are told. I mean, have you ever actually went and discussed this with any educated individuals, maybe looked up and attempted to talk to some members of the ASCE? There are a lot of educated people (i.e. most educated people in the relevant fields) who disagree with you, and it seems you are pretty happy with proclaiming them all idiots with little justification.

       Thanks for stating it like it is.  Anyone who can watch WTC7 fall and think it looks natural is a brainwashed moron.  Or afraid to tell the truth.  Or afraid OF the truth.  A steel framed building doesn't collapse like that.  It's a matrix of steel.  It's totally impossible and has never happened, never will happen.  It gets so frustrating after a while arguing about it because it's so fucking obvious.  Just look at it with your eyes open!

       The sad part about this place is that anything slightly unusual or "unnatural" is deemed a conspiracy.

       People have this asinine thought process of "well if it ain't never happened before, it can't possibly ever happen ever", so they say anything that goes against their beliefs is propaganda and anyone who disagrees is brainwashed.

       Yea that's it, anything slightly unusual is a conspiracy.  Lol.  You really nailed us thousands of conspiracy theorists!  Asking questions about something unusual is not a crime.  Your problem is you don't question authority and put you your trust in the government,  the most corrupt institution on earth.  That's smart.  But you do that because you are brainwashed.  We question because our minds are free.  If something never happened before it just might be because it's impossible.  It was never explained how wtc7 collapsed.  If you mention NIST I will say they left out structures in their collapse model.

       Exactly what I'm talking about. You've constructed a reality in which anyone who disagrees with you must be an idiot. How arrogant and close-minded a position to hold, especially when your opposition includes massive and prestigious organizations.

       This isn't a matter of "disagreement".  This isn't "maybe this, but then again, at the exact same time, maybe that."  There is no way in the real world that WTC7 could fall in the manner that it did without some sort of cutter charges.  I don't care what the "opposition" on "the other side" says.  2+2=4, not 5, and it doesn't matter how many people say otherwise, nor how loudly they proclaim it.

       Just want to intercede, as a guy who's followed this whole thread, to say: Gotta be shill or serious cognitive dissonance slavery.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've spoken with three Engineers about WTC7. Two of them were in California and told me that the official explanation is impossible and that they know we did not get the full story on 9/11, whatever it may be. The third, and this was telling, was in South Carolina. He told me that it certainly could have happened that way, and when is started to ask questions, he cut me off and said "Look, anything's possible, okay?" Which I thought was a very weird response. But I didn't push it.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are afraid. Afraid for their jobs, afraid for their family, afraid of the TRUTH. Because the truth about 9/11 is absolutely horrible. It's disgusting. It's the deepest evil at the center of our government. It means that not only are Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld, etc., involved, it means Obama must know and he's not saying anything either. It means the Clintons, Bernie Sanders, Ron and Rand Paul, pretty much everybody knows. And nobody is saying. Which means they, too, are complicit. Or afraid. So what are they afraid of?
      </p>
      <p>
       So while I can appreciate your attempts at reason, dennabebotnoos, the WTC7 explanation is bullshit. It just can't be true. And the fact that a vote of Architects and Engineers to endorse it took place, doesn't make it any more true. You can believe what people tell you or you can believe what you see. I'll believe what I see, thank you.

       The trouble with the WTC7 theories is there were FDNY eye witnesses with years of experience on the ground that day who stated on record that they saw enough damage to make them believe the building was at high risk of collapse and that a collapse was anticipated. I can quote them if you like. Not that it ever seems to do any good because I've yet to find anyone who doubts the WTC7 story who accepted the quotes back the official story up. Perhaps you'll be the first. But they are valid eye witnesses with years of experience with building fires. I personally trust them over engineers who weren't there that day.

       There are also FDNY eye witnesses with years of experience who were on the ground that day who stated on the record that they heard explosions in the basements of the buildings and saw what looked like controlled demo explosions up and down the buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we've reached the juncture where we probably part, but I'll lay it out for you anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       My repeated experience through life is that secret societies have infiltrated every element of American society so they can find people to lie for them precisely in situations like this. The same way cops lie for cops, Judge Ito helped O.J., and so on and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont necessarily expect you to believe this or agree with me. But from small towns to big cities, I have seen this at work. Once upon a time, there was an "anti-Mason" movement in the country. Now people don't think about the Freemasons or other secret societies at all. But we should.
      </p>
      <p>
       I appreciate your civil response, but you are right that I'm never going to believe that WTC7 fell from fires. That building was supposed to be a fortress.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd recommend "The Most Dangerous Book in the World," by S.K. Bain. There is far more behind the attacks on 9/11 than you have even begun to imagine.

       They were describing the pancaking of the floors as the towers collapsed and it going "pow pow pow" I believe was the expression he used.. or similar. Either way the point is they said it looked/sounded like that.. not that it WAS that. They had just lost many of their own. They wouldn't be sat casually talking about a demolition if they felt that's what just happened. And they'd certainly make their voices heard in the aftermath.
      </p>
      <p>
       WTC 7 was struck by huge pieces of debris from the WTC collapse that cut a hole into the side of the building witnessed by people on the ground. They were unable to fight the fires that started so they were left to burn. And over time it became clear to those on the ground that the building was at risk of collapse. I'll end with just one WTC 7 eye witness account regarding that. I appreciate you've your own view. The above is mine too.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The biggest decision we had to make was to clear the area and create a collapse zone around the severely damaged [WTC Building 7]. A number of fire officers and companies assessed the damage to the building. The appraisals indicated that the building's integrity was in serious doubt."

       I love how many people are just chomping at the bit to prove my point. Somehow you feel totally justified thinking that anyone who disagree with you must be paid or uneducated. I have researched 911, for years. So have thousands of qualified academics. They've even constructed models and analysis (something I know the "truth" movement hasn't bothered with). I used to be in the inside job hypothesis, now I don't. For a number of reasons I won't get into with someone who clearly can't allow themselves to listen to opposing opinions anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       But because you can't handle a world where people have come to different conclusions than you, you are forced to conclude I am a shill, or an idiot. How pathetically insecure is that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why can't you just engage in conversation cordially and open mindedly, rather than immediately conclude I must be some force from some government working against you?

       From the available models, I would be inclined to say progressive collapse.

       Unlike most in this thread, I would be willing to change my opinions if strong evidence was presented and scientific rigor was applied. As of yet, that is lacking from the truther camp.

       It's hard to come up with the evidence that would sway your opinion in this case, because as it stands, it's been covered up. What we have is educated speculation into the events. We can't give you sources to back up what didn't happen because they aren't the "official" story.

       Because I've spent literally hundreds of hours looking into this and reading about 9/11, well beyond the buildings' collapse. I truly do not see how ANYONE who is not completely brainwashed or lying cannot following the brightly glowing trail of breadcrumbs to the real culprits.

       You can definitely hear a boom in those videos but it's tough for me to swallow that an explosion you can't see would cause more damage than WTC falling down next to it.  My problem with most of the theories is that they seem to require more faith than the official story.

       There are also many educated people who do not believe the NIST report and have educated arguments against their findings. Needless to say, battling experts has not resolved the major conflict of perception for all these years. I think it's "insulting" to tell us our eyes are not to be believed, that rational study of the details on both sides makes it very clear we are being lied to, and that information management is more important to news companies then really understanding what is happening in our world today.

       I am sure those engineers have already explained how a falling beam, weighing multiple tons can suddenly accelerate from 9 to 14 m/s without any type of explosive force pushing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       How does your official story explain this? Surely an object that is falling freely in the air will continue to fall, not suddenly accelerate and change direction in mid air.
      </p>
      <p>
       'Coincidentally' this change in accelerate just happened to occur at the same time as a big burst of white smoke coming from the beam.. but that is obviously just a coincidence. No explosives at all.

       David Chandler posted a video where he analysed a falling object, which turned out to be a section of the perimeter wall.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is falling at around 8 m/s then there is a big puff of smoke, the object changes its direction in mid air and accelerates to around 14 m/s
      </p>
      <p>
       There are is no way to explain how an object can rapidly accelerate mid air without some kind of external force. Do you have any suggestions to what that could be? Explosives is one. It would have to be a rather large force to move tons of material.

        People are afraid. Afraid for their jobs, afraid for their family, afraid of the TRUTH. Because the truth about 9/11 is absolutely horrible. It's disgusting. It's the deepest evil at the center of our government. It means that not only are Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld, etc., involved, it means Obama must know and he's not saying anything either. It means the Clintons, Bernie Sanders, Ron and Rand Paul, pretty much everybody knows. And nobody is saying. Which means they, too, are complicit. Or afraid. So what are they afraid of?

       NIST never proved anything.  They never released the numbers for their collapse model so that it can be peer reviewed.  There are multiple problems with how NIST formed their conclusions including leaving out key parts of the structure.  A physics teacher had to tell them that the building reached free fall.  That's ridiculous.  How can they be seen as competent?  The truth is NIST was trying to explain the impossible and fudged it, lied, and made something fit.  Is this crap what those people are agreeing with?

       NIST did not release the files in a public FOIA request. That does not mean they did not release said files to the journal of structural engineering or the ASCE.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the rest of your comment lapses into insults of these thousands of experts. Have you ever brought your concerns to one? There are 146000 members of the ASCE and you are claiming their organization may be involved in countrywide treason or at the very least, high school level incompetence. Have you even bothered to send some emails, and talk to these people you are accusing? 146000 people, I'm sure you can find some folks to speak to you.

       There have been multiple requests from the truth groups to debate the 9/11 and no one has stepped up.  They do not want to talk about it.   There was a post in the James randy forum asking any physicist or engineer to debate the collapses and no one stepped up and the post was removed.

       I've been involved from the beginning because I'm a new yorker and I lost a family member in Tower 2.  I used to believe the official story.  Over time as our family sought answers I have become convinced that the official story is a lie and 9/11 was orchestrated by the elite to push their agenda.   We have done our research and gone through hell in coming to our conclusions and I don't need to talk to anyone that trusts our government anymore.  I know what the truth is.

       I am aware, and yet their numbers are miniscule compared to those of organizations that back the NIST report. Now, that doesnt make either side right, but in my opinion it does warrant some sort of consideration as to why these thousands of world leading experts disagree. Which is why I object to the claims that anyone disagreeing with 911 truth ideals was some sort of sheep or idiot.

       What's crazy to me is the complete bipolarity of thinking. On one hand there are lots of people 99.9% certain it was a false flag, yet on the other hand, those in power often do not even permit questions to enter polite conversation, or say they are personally insulted by questions. It's somehow unspeakable that the terrorists were American and that they still roam free. Same with Boston Bombing -- Tsarnaev languishes in jail because TPTB can't admit they pulled a hoax.

       He may be a hopeless case. Try explaining petrodollars -- Saddam declared Iraq would no longer sell oil in US dollars -- as justification. Then point to Libya where it was patently clear we intervened after Quadaffi wanted to switch to gold dinars.

       No doubt many are as you say. I did say specifically "not all." I have known many such muslims personally. However, enough muslims, more than enough, have demonstrated the behavior I described that I feel it is an accurate statement.

       9/11 was just a ploy to create a surveillance, totalitarian, plutocratic, nation, because the Timothy McVeigh incident with the bombing of the Oklahoma federal building didn't have enough deaths to pass the Patriot Act, due to the other trucks not detonating. Now, if you want to travel domestically/internationally, the TSA figuratively rubs everybody's balls and clits because of a false flag attack.

       Haven't seen that thread connected here in awhile.

      <p>
       Many forget that massive bills like thr Patriot Act don't come out of the ether. They are carefull created and crafted, sometimes over years, and the chamber working on them every year will usually pass their side of it and just be content to let it sit there for months until an
       <em>
        Event
       </em>
       happens, then he Senate can pass it and the President can sign it usually within a day or two and
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        BOOM
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That now be the law. The Patriot Act was
       <em>
        written in response to 9/11
       </em>
       , they used 9/11 to get that shit passed.
      </p>
      <p>
       They did it (minorly) with all of those "terrorist bomb threats" on Airlines in the two days Section 215 of the Patriot Act expired (although it never did, we would later learn).
      </p>

       You're probably right, but the problem is pretty much everybody is acting as if the story were real. Soldiers still went abroad to kill innocent people in the Middle East, people were still tortured, and the media still pretends Muslim terrorists are a serious threat to America, referencing 9/11 as an example. It still uses the false picture it built of bin Laden as the bogeyman and it still encourages citizens to "support the troops" whoever they happen to be killing at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether people suspect/know or not has in a way ceased to be even relevant, because pretty much all of them have consented to the lie. Everyone except a handful of conscientious academics.

       It's easy to convince the public of whatever you want, when you control all the media, and spend years ensuring that anyone who varies from the official story is ostracised and labeled nuts.

       The fact they pulled off 9/11 and hoodwinked a nation (though not the world, I don't think) was what convinced me the media is completely corrupt.

      <p>
       And now that they've experienced the ability to get away with something like this, what do you think they have planned next?

       Even with so many of us -- or so it seems -- aware that something MAJOR is coming in September/October, I don't think it even matters anymore. They're going to try it anyway. They can manufacture consent expertly, they people who pretend to be men-on-the-street spouting the talking points they want, they have a bazillion distractions and side-stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everybody "in the know" knows something is coming; I just don't know if they know what it is exactly. But China &amp; Russia ain't buying all that gold for no reason.

       It's the economic collapse of the entire system. That's why almost every country is protecting themselves with gold and distancing themselves from the dollar. There are hundreds of indicators and tons of countries on the brink right now. There's no question here, it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       happening now. They kept it alive long enough to blame the collapse on another country or IS. Then they can play the heroes and reset the entire system after the war they're clearly preparing for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many things coming can be described as major. We absolutely will have another 9/11. Cheney's said it, IS propaganda put out by the west is saying it, tons of other threats and breadcrumbs are letting us know. There will be mass casualty, there will be mass blackouts. Nobody is coming up with any theories at this point, they're telling us or we can see it happening now.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be a very good idea to get some gold and silver yourself. Stock up on food, etc. for the day the banks implement their bail in documents and shelves are cleared like Greece. They're prepared for this, all these western nations will be like Cyprus. The documents are ready.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do the research and confirm this for yourself then get prepared because this is going to be bad. This is why they'll do whatever they have to in order to disarm the people. This is why they're putting giant spikes on the White House fence. This is why every country is training for civil disobedience and purchasing things like water cannons.
      </p>
      <p>
       The list goes on so please anyone if you read this check out the situation and get prepared. If you want to pretend everything is fine, that there's a recovery and US unemployment is 5.5% you do that. Just remember when you're starving for food or can't get "your" money out of the banks or are wiping your ass with a fucking leaf because you can't get toilet paper, you could've done something. Don't be those people.

       No one really convinced anyone the official story was true, Most just assume the government wouldn't lie and they never bothered to look at any evidence because they've already been told "nuts" are offering all kinds of crazy ideas about what happened and they see no reason to waste their time checking out facts for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those that did check out things or who did listen to alternative views were convinced the official story couldn't be true.

       It was pretty devastating for us.  I lost a family member in Tower 2.  He left behind two young daughters.  All of new York was just in shock and disbelief.  Most of the dead were working people with families.  Firefighters.  Businessmen. Cops.  Cooks.  It was traumatic for the whole nation but just times it a few for us new yorkers.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for understanding the truth I'd say there's more of a percentage of awake people here.  New yorkers are pretty cynical already.  It didn't take much for people to know something was very wrong about the whole story.  Every person who was near the towers has a story about what they saw or heard or experienced that doesn't fit the official fable.

       I often wonder about how higher education selects for compliance and submissiveness. It's like TPTB have dangling a carrot in front of students down to a science. As long as the students only have so much time per day to engage in revolutionary thinking, stability among intelligentsia is ensured. What's worse, the harder people have to work to scale an organizational hierarchy, the less likely they are to rock the boat.

And in all seduction of iniquity to them that perish; because they receive not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. Therefore God shall send them the operation of error, to believe lying:  God shall send: That is God shall suffer them to be deceived by lying wonders, and false miracles, in punishment of their not entertaining the love of truth.  That all may be judged who have not believed the truth, but have consented to iniquity.

       I am confident the false flag of 9/11 will be an accepted fact given enough time. 
The media controlled our opinions over the last 100 years and could condition the majority on the likes of the JFK assassination.

      <p>
       They are now losing that control, and the truth is all that's left.

       At this point, I find it's best to disbelieve any information given to me by the government, and should it be about a subject that I'm interested in, I will research and find alternate sources to verify their data.

       Otherwise, it's relatively safe to assume its heavily biased or outright incorrect propaganda.

       This is partly true. But there are also many people who whittle away their days sitting in front of the "god-box" (love that term and I'm stealing it, grandmaceasar) or playing video games or other wastes of energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Americans spent half as much time trying to lift the veil on their lives as they do wasting their time, they'd have the room to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the bigger problem is that learning is pain. The truth is terrifying and horrible. People don't want to see it, don't want to know it. They'd rather continue along in smaller lives, seeking moments of happiness and pleasure, not risking, not wanting to rock the boat, in hopes someone else will make things better.

       "Waiting on the World to Change," as John Mayer wrote, sums it up pretty well. But if you wait on somebody else to change the world, chances are they'll change it at your expense.

       IMHO the trouble with "conspiracy theories" is they often overreach and go too far down the rabbit hole. Iraq &amp; WMD.. "It was all fiction to start a war" rather than "Saddam kept the WMD lie alive because he was scared of Iran and the West ignored this regional geopolitical issue for their own gains". Or "JFK was killed by the CIA" rather than "JFK may have been killed by a conspiracy and no one could reveal the truth because it would reveal how close the US came to killing Castro whilst he had the support of Russia". Or "9/11 was an inside job" rather than "Let's look at who funded the bad guys and if an attack benefitted them and was allowed to happen". What I find somewhat curious is why no one ever suggests the USS Cole was an "inside job" or the US Embassies in Africa. Just 9/11. As if terrorism overseas is legit but as soon as it happens closer to home it's got to be staged.

       I think there certainly is some truth to what you're saying about Saddam, but at the same time the invasion was legitimised with lies, based on the false intelligence that Saddam had WMDs, intended to use them against the West, and could launch them at 45 minutes notice. The Israeli lobbyists wanted regime change, and the Iraq War is how they got it.

       JFK unfortunately isn't my topic of expertise. All I really know about the JFK shooting is that the official "magic bullet" story is ludicrous.

       9/11 is my topic of expertise and it very clearly could not have been achieved without the involvement of top level American officials. If you don't include top level American officials, you are left explaining how the perpetrators knew that NORAD would be otherwise engaged on 9/11, why Cheney purposefully let flight 77 slam into the Pentagon instead of ordering it shot down, and how at least 15 of the alleged hijackers were able to secure full American VISAs after submitting "incomprehensible" application forms to the state department.

       If you think that you have not researched enough.  Your mind is resisting the truth because if it's true your whole world view comes crumbling down and has to be rebuilt.  When I finally woke up I paced many sleepless nights trying to get my head right again.  It's not easy admitting you were wrong especially when you fought for a long time for the wrong side.  The majority of the world's population do not believe the official story which means you are now in the minority.  Watch a new pearl Harbor documentary on YouTube if you can really listen and take it in.  It's five hours of in depth evidence analysis.

       I actually went to college to better understand the events of that day. Which is why I side with the "official" story. I understand the allure of being one of the select few in the world who knows the "Truth" about 9/11, but it isn't supported by what I've studied.

       Like I said you aren't really listening.  Wtc was a steel framed building.  It came down so fast it reached free fall speed meaning that every single support column was removed at the exact same time and offered no resistance whatsoever.  That is impossible.  A matrix of steel doesn't just collapse like that.  How did a fire cause every column to fail at the same time?  NIST tried to explain it but left out key structures, just for starters.  They simply lied.  All this is glaringly obvious. That you can't see it tells me you just refuse to see it.

       If you read the report, it isn't. I really don't want to get into an argument about this, but the report gives a very satisfying answer for your claim. One that's backed by science and a big reason why over 99% of scientists aren't 9/11 Truthers.

       I just told you that NIST lied and left out structures of the building.  They took them out because that was the only possible way they could explain such a ridiculous assertion.  Even now that we know this it's hard to believe people still fall on NIST for answers.  Keep trusting the government, the most corrupt institution on earth.  Good luck.

       Things are actually better, focusing on 9/11 without proper evidences (evidences that need to fit the current propaganda model) is not doing a service to anyone. There are enough examples of proven conspiracies to talk about, and I would argue that's exactly why 9/11 conspiracies are used for, to discredit any other Government conspiracy.
