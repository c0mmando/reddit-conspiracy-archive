    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Cold sores&quot; are, by definition, caused by Herpes Virus.  Usually, they are caused by Herpes Virus 1.  Sometimes, they are caused by Herpes Virus 2.  In Chicken Pox, they are caused by Herpes Virus 3.</p>

<p>I have had a herpes sore on my lip, a so-called &quot;cold sore.&quot;  I have tested positive for a Herpes Virus infection, and I have tested positive for exposure to multiple Herpes Viruses.  </p>

<p>Keep in mind, Chicken Pox is caused by Varicella Zoster Virus, more properly known as Herpes Virus 3.  When was the last time you had a Chicken Pox outbreak (called &quot;shingles&quot;)?</p>

<p>The real conspiracy is the official story that Human Herpes Virus is permanent.  In fact, it can be cured pretty quickly with curcumin.  The only hard part is keeping the curcumin in the blood for reasonable amounts of time -- normally it is metabolized with a 15-minute half life.  The solution is to first take piperine, after checking for interactions with all your other drugs.</p>

<p>Anyway, the reason you don&#39;t see many cold sores is that people with cold sores rarely, if ever, have outbreaks.  Also, word of the cure has been spreading.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re getting at.  If there were some problem with drugs getting from the blood to the nerves, how would, e.g., famciclovir work?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m asking how does curcumin work.  Famciclovir doesn&#39;t get into the neurons either - that&#39;s why famciclovir doesn&#39;t cure herpes.  I&#39;m just trying to understand the process.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course Famciclovir does get into the neurons.  That&#39;s how it works.</p>

<p>The reason it doesn&#39;t cure Herpes is that the nucleoside analogs don&#39;t cure Herpes.  Helicase-Primase inhibitors, like BAY 57-1293, cure Herpes.</p>

<p>You didn&#39;t really ask how curcumin works.  It&#39;s a Human DNA Polymerase I ligand, which Herpes depends on for its life cycle.</p>

<p>Nucleoside analogs, like the -ciclovirs only work in cells that have active viral infections going on.  They depend on the viral Thymidine Kinase to be produced before they work.</p>

<p>Helicase-Primase inhibitors prevent active viral infections in cells.  That&#39;s why they are a cure and -ciclovirs are not.</p>

<p>As for curcumin, it also prevents active viral infection in cells.</p>

<p>All of these chemicals get from the blood to the neurons, that&#39;s how they work.  -ciclovirs couldn&#39;t possibly work in the bloodstream, there is no viral-produced Thymidine Kinase there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think there are any forums that I know of.  There are articles on pubmed from Indian researchers on it, though.  I imagine somewhere, people talk about it.</p>

<p>When I got Herpes, I started researching how to cure it.  It only has 80 genes, after all.</p>

<p>Once I found out that Herpes depends on Human DNA Polymerase I, I began to seek molecules that bound to that enzyme.  I found the pubmed articles on curcumin and came to find out that curcumin + black pepper (piperine) is an ancient Ayurvedic cure.</p>

<p>Anyway, I tried it, and it worked.  I lost my symptoms and my antibodies to HSV2.</p>

<p>So I guess you could say I am trying to start a forum.  It doesn&#39;t usually go well, as skeptics tend to turn up and show off their ignorant skepticism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know.  I had been on Famciclovir for 2.5 years before I spent the weekend taking such large doses of curcumin.  When I was prescribed Famciclovir, I had positive antibodies for HSV 1 and 2, positive PCR for HSV 2 shedding, and a skin biopsy test in which they observe the reaction of your T-cells: I was positive reaction for HSV 2 and not HSV 1.  Overall, that indicated I had HSV 2 and was probably not infected for HSV 1.</p>

<p>When I did the curcumin regimen, my symptoms went away starting about 2pm on the first day.  I kept taking the curcumin for three days.  Keep in mind I had HSV 2 somewhat worse than usual, because I had symptoms even though I was on famciclovir for 2.5 years.</p>

<p>Years later, I wanted to get back on famciclovir, just in case I was still infectious.  I got the prescription but they also gave me another antibody test (totally new doctor who wanted to verify the chart).  I tested negative antibodies (ELISA and Western Blot) for HSV 1 and 2.</p>
