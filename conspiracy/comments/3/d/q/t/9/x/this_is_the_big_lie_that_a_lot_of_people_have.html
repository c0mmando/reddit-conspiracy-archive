       We have been thoroughly lied to about the nature of this planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       All truth goes through three stages first it's ridiculed, then it's violently opposed and lastly it's accepted as self evident.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is the earth is flat, there's no antarctica and instead there is giant ice wall around the perimeter of the earth. Also the sky is not what it seems, there are no satellites, there are no planets in fact there is no space! There is simply the firmament, a glass ceiling a few miles up. What you see as stars are simply holes in the firmament, with the light from heaven shining through.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about this how can the earth be round when water doesn't curve. Water is self-leveling, how can you have a globe of 70% self-leveling water. Huge bodies of water such as Lake Taho and others have been proven to have no curvature, rivers that run thousands of miles such as the nile only drop a few feet over the whole distance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't take my word for it start critically thinking and researching for your selves.

       Think about this! When I look through my telescope I can see that Jupiter is round and I can see the round moons and round shadows on the planet. I can also see the planet spin very slowly but noticeable when recording it. I also know the earth is spinning because I have to track the planet as a gaze. Don't know if you are serious or trolling, but go fuck yourself!

      <p>
       You know who would be really easy to radicalize? Folks who are so fucking deluded that they believe the earth is flat. I  bet you could convince those fuckers that they are holy warriors and send them on clandestine missions to shoot innocents.

       The zealots are always the easiest to manipulate.

       So just a caution to you flat earthers. If you find yourself in a situation that seems like you are being recruited or maybe manipulated into giving out personal information RUN AWAY.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm serious here. This is some dangerous shit you guys are playing with. Regardless of your religious views please try to remember that there's no holy war and you shouldn't be inclined to go kill folks to start your war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, please stop proselytizing. I don't think it's appropriate for folks in this sub to try to box others into a specific religious paradigm.

       The recent emergence of the topic goes far beyond reddit, there is a lot of other internet out there where it is being seen.  Also, it is not necessarily religious.  Much of the evidence being put forward is physical measurements and observations you can do yourself.  People who look at it from a religious point of view find things that match of with their scriptures, but not many people are only interested in things that are more concrete.

       I'm an old man who personally has debunked the flat earth theory with mine own eyes. I've worked in the aerospace industry for a long enough time to have had personal experience with the spheroid we live on. So don't try to pull the flat earth ignorance bullshit on me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying this has nothing to do with religion either makes you ignorant or intentionally misleading. The flat earth theory has everything to do with religion. You are literally a blind follower if you throw yourself into that dark box. And being a blind follower has everything to do with religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, my original statement still holds true. If I were running an operation to find some idiots dumb enough to shoot innocents I'd look towards flat earthers and the like. You have to be a particularly exceptional type of stupid in order to subscribe to that thought process.

       I've spent quite a bit of time on this topic, never from a religious approach though as I've never been involved in any organized religion.  The push on the subject lately does not appear to be naturally occurring, but I think there is something tangible to it.  The standard flat earth model does have some problems, but so does the official globe model.  It appears that we are being pushed into a false dialectic.  I think it is important to point out that proofs against the globe is not proof of the standard flat earth model and vice versa.

       I'm fairly certain aliens is a completely manufactured topic.  I spent a couple of months down that rabbit hole.  There is a huge amount of material there.  The reason to believe it is the size of the conspiracy required to fake it.  However after spending enough time on it, my opinion is that there has been a long term plan to fake it.  Many UFO sightings are likely human tech no publicly available.  Also I think it is used on MKULTRA victims as both a way to spread the myth and to discredit their victimization should they speak out.  Project Blue Beam is a possibility (

       It was a legitimate question. Answer it, or keep up your childish game and run. Im sorry you're upset I don't believe in every conspiracy posted here. I'm sorry I don't believe in things with zero evidence behind them. You seem to think I'm a shill or purposely spreading disinformation, but you won't even post any info. I'm here to learn. Not to speculate. Just answer the question.

       There is this video of Phil Schneider where he says he saw an alien with his own eyes and the alien shot at him and he lost his arm. I entertained the idea for a while, but came to the same conclusion as you. It looks like a manufactured topic, and that along with Area 51 make people who look into conspiracies look like kooks and removes any seriousness from the act of scrutinizing government's claims. In a democracy, we have to hold the government accountable and it is their duty to furnish proof. They are guilty until proven otherwise. But very few people realize that, that is how it should be.

       Yes, I've seen that Phil Schneider video and found it very compelling at the time.  A lot of the things he was saying matched up with the stories told by others.  The descriptions on the attempts on his life and his killing after that presentation added to the 'authenticity'.  But I've since seen that faking opposition to authorities and faked deaths are standard tactics to increase credibility.

       Why don't you first present the tiniest bit of evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem that I have found with the flat-earthers is that they seem to be completely incapable of conducting any real-world experiments. Instead, we are treated to an endless array of pointless 'thought experiments' which supposedly indicate a flat, stationary earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why don't they perform any experiments themselves?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are some simple ones - build yourself a Foucault Pendulum. I have heard countless FE loons tell me that all the pendulum installations around the world are rigged in some manner. But not a single one of these dunces have ever constructed their own pendulum and shown absence of processional movement. Why not? What are they afraid of?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's another test - the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E%C3%B6tv%C3%B6s_effect">
        Eötvös effect
       </a>
       . This basically states that there is a small centrifugal effect on gravity from the rotating earth. This has several predictions. First, it predicts that your perceived weight would be slightly higher (about 0.3%) at the poles compared to the equator. It also predicts that perceived gravity would be slightly different when traveling with the earth's rotation compared to traveling against it. This effect is predictable - the Wikipedia page has some equations based on the earth's angular velocity that will allow you to predict the strength of the Eötvös force.
      </p>
      <p>
       So - why not simply get hold of a standard mass, say 1 Kg. Carefully measure it's weight at the equator. Then take the same mass to the North Pole and measure it there. There should be about a 3 gram difference. Or, measure its weight while traveling eastward at the equator, and then again while traveling westward. In each case, the change in perceived weight should match that predicted by the centrifugal force of the rotating earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       An even simpler test is this: a spherical earth predicts that there will be 24 hours of sunlight at the summer solstice at the South Pole. The closer you get to the pole, the more days of complete sunlight you will experience. At about 66.5 degrees, you would experience at least one full day of sunlight at the summer solstice (December 21-22).
      </p>
      <p>
       So - why not simply charter a ship to take you down to 66.5 degrees in late December, and see if there really is 24 hours of sunlight or not? This is literally the easiest test the the flat-earthers could do. In fact, there are any number of commercial cruises that offer exactly that. Why not take one of them, and see for yourselves? It's not that complicated.

       Planes don't fly over antarctica. Also why can you not take a straight flight from santiago to sydney. It goes to the united states making the flight twice as long, using twice the amount of fuel, but if you use the flat earth map it's on the same trajectory.

       Time to get out of the house and get a telescope my friend.  Have you actually been a on a plane?  Then you would have noticed that at a certain height you can quite literally see the curvature of the earth.  And yes I have seen it with my own eyes, not sure if you have any real world experience or you have left the house but you seriously need some real world experience.

       The curvature of Earth cannot be visually confirmed from your perspective on the ground.  It can't even be visually confirmed from within an airplane at max altitude.  You may believe you've seen it, but mathematically speaking, you absolutely have not.

       It comes from old woodcuts, showing the Earth enclosed in a hemisphere of the firmament with holes in it through which light shines.

       In medieval times, God was considered to be outside the sphere of the fixed stars. God was omnipresent beyond the stars, and God was light. It's not a big stretch from this view of reality to assume that the stars are actually the light of God, shining through an opaque sphere that causes the darkness of night.

       The Ptolemaic theory of the cosmos was somewhat different and more complex, but related to this view. In the Ptolemaic system, each planet was set in its own transparent, or crystaline sphere. The stars had their own sphere, also, but if you believe that God lies beyond the sphere of the stars, and that God is all light, it is not too great a jump of logic to assume that the sphere of the stars must be oqaque (otherwise the light of God would flood the Earth day and night), and if this sphere is opaque, it's not too big a jump to speculate that the stars are really just holes to let the light of God shine through.

       I do not like arguing things like flat earth when we all have to guess because of "Classified" information. I know the truth though. I also know that because of classified information people can make a strong argument either way. Divide and Conquer.

       Planes don't fly over antarctica. Also why can you not take a straight flight from santiago to sydney. It goes to the united states making the flight twice as long, using twice the amount of fuel, but if you use the flat earth map it's on the same trajectory.
