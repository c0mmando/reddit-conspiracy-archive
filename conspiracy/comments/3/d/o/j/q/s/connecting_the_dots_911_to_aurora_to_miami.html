<p>Let&#39;s connect some dots...</p>

<hr/>

<p>This story just broke a few days ago:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/3cu7jv/florida_cops_laundered_millions_for_drug_cartels/">[Miami] Florida Cops Laundered Millions For Drug Cartels, Failed To Make A Single Arrest: &quot;After laundering the cash, police would skim a three percent commission fee, ultimately generating $2.4 million for themselves.&quot;</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And I think we&#39;re savvy enough here to understand the US&#39;s role in drug trafficking:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/US+Coast+Guard/@25.8139542,-80.1443065,12z/data=!4m5!1m2!2m1!1scoast+guard+miami+beach!3m1!1s0x88d9b458d25048a3:0x9e12ba9315436476">US Coast Guard port, Miami Beach</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Nice little criminal operation there.</p>

<p>Who is the <strong>Police Chief of Miami Beach, Florida</strong>?</p>

<p>Dan Oates. (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Oates">wiki</a>)</p>

<hr/>

<p>The same Dan Oates who was <strong>Police Chief of Aurora, CO during the Aurora Theater massacre</strong>.</p>

<p>During press conferences, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW9eevSPogI">Police Chief Dan Oates repeatedly dodged questions regarding whether or not cameras were present</a>.</p>

<p>Evidence of multiple gunmen would be confirmed by video of the theater and/or emergency exit. However, all videos appear to have been seized by police.</p>

<p>From the comments:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What are the odds:</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Gun Ban Bloomberg&#39;s&quot; former head of NYC police Intelligence, Dan Oates, is chief of police for little Aurora Colorado.</li>
<li>Chief Oates has a perfect gun ban shooting in his town. His town out of all the towns in the country.</li>
<li>The shooting happens just before voting on ratification of a UN gun ban treaty.</li>
<li>The alarm on the fire door didn&#39;t work and the shooter was able to re-enter that way.</li>
<li>Reportedly there were 6 armed policemen at the main entrance for crowd control, yet nothing is said about them or how they responded.</li>
</ul>

<p>I just find all this interesting.</p>

<p>The exit doors located behind the screen are not necessarily fire exit only doors. Many are just regular exits, especially the ones that open up to rear parking areas, like the one in Aurora.</p>

<p>It was very common for people to leave through those exits for a quick smoke or to run to their car for something, prop the door with a small item so no light would get in, then re-enter unnoticed. No alarms would ever go off.</p>

</ul>

<hr/>

<h2>Reposted here:</h2>

<p>Although James Holmes is the sole suspect in the Aurora shooting, initial reports spoke of multiple shooters:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://willyloman.wordpress.com/2012/08/06/aurora-massacre-abc-reports-multiple-shooters/">Aurora Massacre: ABC Reports Multiple Shooters</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Throughout the investigation, there has been speculation that James Holmes either had assistance or was entirely framed. This speculation is bolstered by the presence of a second gasmask:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://willyloman.wordpress.com/2013/01/08/american-gladio-second-gas-mask-becomes-huge-issue-in-new-aurora-narrative/">American Gladio: Second Gas Mask Becomes Huge Issue in New Aurora Narrative</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Witness Corbin Dates told Hardball with Chris Matthews that there was a second shooter, <strong>a man with a goatee</strong> (Holmes did not have a goatee), who was lingering near the emergency exit.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/D4Gv3PGtsHg">Corbin Dates appears on Hardball to describe &quot;Man with Goatee&quot; - Possible Accomplice </a></li>
</ul>

<p>A &quot;man with a goatee&quot;. A goatee. Like Alex Milano, a noted gun-control advocate, who just happened to be present at the shooting and coincidentally interviewed on local news:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHVQOMxzrqI&amp;amp;t=1m10s">Aurora Theater Shooting Eyewitness Alex Milano Interview</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Alex Milano appeared in the gun control advocacy movie, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_3MFZYni6Y&amp;amp;t=9m5s"><em>Bowling for Columbine</em>, as &quot;DJ&quot;</a>, although <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0310793/fullcredits">he&#39;s been scrubbed from the IMDB credits</a> for some reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.</p>

<p>Watch his mannerisms in the Aurora interview closely. This guy is lying, making shit up.</p>

<p>edit:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalCartel/comments/3c0z3o/accomplice_identified_in_aurora_theater_shooting/csur4cb">from /u/Jordan1invest</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And last but not least his body language and speech, ticks, etc are all a liars recipe. Hands in pockets, smiling when it&#39;s a killing, weird mouth girations, he contradicts himself on who he was with and other personal facts, looks left (creation of story on gunman), but looks right when asked pointed facts that sound rehearsed. His whole facial movements and muscle ticks are odd and make me think he&#39;s lying on half of the story and scripted on the other details.</p>
