       While this may seem like an odd sub to ask this in, the book of Revelations outlines the "end of days" which very much seems like what's going on in the world today. I have some knowledge of the book, but not enough to know all that has come to be true and what else is to be expected. Figured I'd give it a shot here.

       In the book, the
       <code>
        mark of the beast
       </code>
       is spoken of. I found it resoundingly similar to the whole rfid thing going on, the verse is revalations 13, 16-18-
       <code>
        also it causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave, to be marked on the right hand or the forehead, so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of its name. This calls for wisdom: let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is 666.
       </code>
       this reminds me of rfid chips because a majority of them are implanted in the right hand, people have rumored to have found barcodes with 666 on it. And i also heard somewhere that they forced homeless to get implants or had some punishment(not sure if the 666 and the homeless part was rumour or real, cant remember the sources i found them in)

       The bible was written at a time when metaphors were used. Therefore one could say that the mark on the hand and head is really related to actions and thoughts. He can not buy or sell unless he thinks and acts of the will, or in the name of, the beast.

       Just one other possible interpretation of that passage.

       This is precisely right. The binding on the arm and / or forehead is an important
commandment in judaism, though recognized as a cultural idiom that represents
who's will is exercised by the work of your hands, and who's will is perpetually kept on your mind. This is also manifested physically in the tradition of

       I remember reading an article where some guy elaborated on thoughts and actions against God. Which meant that like basically, breaking any commandment, or sinning against God meant that you took the mark of the beast. And therefore, in end times, you will not be able to barter, trade, or sell goods if you are holy and live your life by God's way.

       That would mean the beast is absence of God not an individual theology. That would also mean that Christ died for nothing as IIRC the beast mark can not be atoned for. But if you tried to live exactly as Christ taught today it would be difficult to survive in western civilization.

       The climate of the world right now seems to fit the book but the only thing I can think of at the moment is a passage about there being many wars &amp; rumors of war, which we certainly have had a lot of lately.

       I think prophecy is kind of useless the way it is handled the majority of the time. Most of the stuff in Revelations is pretty obvious with a little extrapolation of human behaviour; famines, war, screwed up weather etc. Of course those things are going to happen as we keep breeding indiscriminately and raping the planet. Some of the more occult-y stuff is just too hard to nail down to specifics for it to be worth it imo, especially with the way the bible has been handled. I don't know how people can believe it is the pristine word of god when it has been passed down through power-seeking hands, edited, books removed etc.

       Don't forget, Revelations was written in parables.  the meaning of the parables were only revealed to John who was told to never tell them.  Revelations was intended to be hard to read and understand by itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       In all other books of the Bible, parables were explained.

The witness prophecy

       Supposedly they have a massive stock pile of materials.

       Theories vary about the labor, but many believe the free masons are destined to build it.  I haven't dug into that too much.  I know a few of them and they really don't seem to be that type of organization.

       Yes...there are many difficulties in building the 3rd Temple.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) The instructions for temple building are ancient and are being studied so it is done correctly.  rules like "No tools are to touch a single stone of the Temple" etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) The Jews fully intend to restart animal sacrifices in the temple (that is the Old Testament means of atoning for sins)
      </p>
      <p>
       3) There is an Islamic Mosque (Dome of the Rock) on the site (the Temple Mount) where the 3rd temple is to be constructed.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) even a peaceful coexistence with an Islamic Mosque (which is the most popular proposal) is unlikely because of the animal sacrifices.
      </p>
      <p>
       5) The 3rd Temple is gigantic.  Modern construction in Israel is tiny compared to the 3rd Temple.  Even the current Temples are a fraction of the size of the 3rd Temple.  It is intended to be THE place for the entire world to worship.

       For all you "prophecy believers" how do you rationalize all the false prophecies?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean how can you claim this shit is divine knowledge when they get half the shit wrong? Of course you can vaguely interpret this stuff to fit into modern day events.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wars, execution, famine, genocide, hunger, rich and poor, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       These things have always existed in human history so if this book talks about these things it's not prophetic... The prophecies are just vague statements and metaphors that can be interpreted in a hundred ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of it may apply but that's not really an argument for anything.

       The prophecy of the city of Tyre being destroyed and never existing again.
      </p>
      <p>
       The city of Tyre is in Lebanon. It's there. It exists. You can look at it on googleearth. You can speak to people who live there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Christian logic of course will say "but the prophecy can still be fulfilled!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Which just goes to show how useless your book of prophecies is. The Bible gets a thousand things wrong but when it gets one thing right its followers try to use that as an example of why we should follow it. It's totally nonsensical.

       A prophecy without a time frame is bullshit. Especially vague ones that can be interpreted in different ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can say anything vague like "The end times are near when the young become restless and the old become complacent" and it would apply to almost any time, place, or situation... I literally just made that up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without a timeframe and specifics a prophecy is just a vague, ambiguous, openly interpreted phrase.

       This video quickly explains how that prophecy was actually fulfilled. If the ruins of Tyre still exist, how is it rebuilt? There are many parts to this one prophecy, and all are fulfilled.

       Any Bible readers here know what has been made to look like it occurred/is yet to be made to occur from the book of Revelations?

       The notion of self-fulfilling prophecies or collusion on fulfilling them is not practical.  To do that, Jews, Christians and Muslims would have to decide whose prophecy was correct and the others would have to conform.  All of them have intermingling prophecies.  Jewish Prophecy and Islamic Prophecies are diametrically opposed to each other.  Christian prophecy actually allows both Jews and Muslims to realize their own prophecies, but Islamic prophesies fulfill a nefarious role in the Christian Prophecy fulfillment.

       I think that if anything, there are people trying to advance an agenda by self fulfilling these prophecies bringing them into fruition since about 1948.
