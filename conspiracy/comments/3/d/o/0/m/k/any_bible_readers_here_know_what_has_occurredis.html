    <div class="md"><p>In the book, the <code>mark of the beast</code> is spoken of. I found it resoundingly similar to the whole rfid thing going on, the verse is revalations 13, 16-18-<code>also it causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave, to be marked on the right hand or the forehead, so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of its name. This calls for wisdom: let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is 666.</code> this reminds me of rfid chips because a majority of them are implanted in the right hand, people have rumored to have found barcodes with 666 on it. And i also heard somewhere that they forced homeless to get implants or had some punishment(not sure if the 666 and the homeless part was rumour or real, cant remember the sources i found them in)</p>

Which meant that like basically, breaking any commandment, or sinning against God meant that you took the mark of the beast.

    <div class="md"><p>That would mean the beast is absence of God not an individual theology. That would also mean that Christ died for nothing as IIRC the beast mark can not be atoned for.

    <div class="md"><p>I think prophecy is kind of useless the way it is handled the majority of the time. Most of the stuff in Revelations is pretty obvious with a little extrapolation of human behaviour; famines, war, screwed up weather etc. Of course those things are going to happen as we keep breeding indiscriminately and raping the planet. Some of the more occult-y stuff is just too hard to nail down to specifics for it to be worth it imo, especially with the way the bible has been handled. I don&#39;t know how people can believe it is the pristine word of god when it has been passed down through power-seeking hands, edited, books removed etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes...there are many difficulties in building the 3rd Temple.  </p>

<p>1) The instructions for temple building are ancient and are being studied so it is done correctly.  rules like &quot;No tools are to touch a single stone of the Temple&quot; etc.</p>

<p>2) The Jews fully intend to restart animal sacrifices in the temple (that is the Old Testament means of atoning for sins)</p>

<p>3) There is an Islamic Mosque (Dome of the Rock) on the site (the Temple Mount) where the 3rd temple is to be constructed.</p>

<p>4) even a peaceful coexistence with an Islamic Mosque (which is the most popular proposal) is unlikely because of the animal sacrifices.</p>

<p>5) The 3rd Temple is gigantic.  Modern construction in Israel is tiny compared to the 3rd Temple.  Even the current Temples are a fraction of the size of the 3rd Temple.  It is intended to be THE place for the entire world to worship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The prophecy of the city of Tyre being destroyed and never existing again.</p>

<p>The city of Tyre is in Lebanon. It&#39;s there. It exists. You can look at it on googleearth. You can speak to people who live there. </p>

<p>Christian logic of course will say &quot;but the prophecy can still be fulfilled!&quot;</p>

<p>Which just goes to show how useless your book of prophecies is. The Bible gets a thousand things wrong but when it gets one thing right its followers try to use that as an example of why we should follow it. It&#39;s totally nonsensical.</p>

<p>I mean, you understand the concept of prophecies, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A prophecy without a time frame is bullshit. Especially vague ones that can be interpreted in different ways. </p>

<p>I can say anything vague like &quot;The end times are near when the young become restless and the old become complacent&quot; and it would apply to almost any time, place, or situation... I literally just made that up.</p>

<p>Without a timeframe and specifics a prophecy is just a vague, ambiguous, openly interpreted phrase.</p>

This video quickly explains how that prophecy was actually fulfilled. If the ruins of Tyre still exist, how is it rebuilt? There are many parts to this one prophecy, and all are fulfilled. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The notion of self-fulfilling prophecies or collusion on fulfilling them is not practical.  To do that, Jews, Christians and Muslims would have to decide whose prophecy was correct and the others would have to conform.  All of them have intermingling prophecies.  Jewish Prophecy and Islamic Prophecies are diametrically opposed to each other.  Christian prophecy actually allows both Jews and Muslims to realize their own prophecies, but Islamic prophesies fulfill a nefarious role in the Christian Prophecy fulfillment.</p>
