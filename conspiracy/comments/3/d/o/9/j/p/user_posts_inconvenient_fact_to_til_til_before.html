    <div class="md"><p>Well, I can&#39;t say for sure, but I&#39;d be willing to guess that this was in reference to the Mujahideen fighting the Soviets in the 70s. The Soviets were ruthless to the Afghan people then. Remember, when the Rambo movies were made, the US and Russia were involved in the cold war. You should start by googling the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Alliance">Northern Alliance</a>. The mujahideen became referenced as the Northern Alliance in the 90s. </p>

<p>&quot;Arguably the best-known mujahideen outside the Islamic world, various loosely aligned Afghan opposition groups initially rebelled against the government of the pro-Soviet Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (DRA) during the late 1970s. At the DRA&#39;s request, the Soviet Union brought forces into the country to aid the government from 1979. The mujahideen fought against Soviet and DRA troops during the Soviet War in Afghanistan (1979-1989); to which the United States provided assistance, aiding the mujahideen&#39;s cause.[11] After the Soviet Union pulled out of the conflict in the late 1980s, the mujahideen fought each other for control in the subsequent Afghan Civil War.[12]&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>the Mujahideen fighting the Soviets in the 70s. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That started at the very end of the 1970s, following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979, literally the last month of the decade, and continued throughout the 1980s (until 1989, when the Soviets left). So, it would be more accurate to say &quot;the Mujahideen fighting the Soviets in the 80s.&quot; </p>

<p>Rambo 3 was made in 1988.</p>

<p>And yes, the US openly supported the Mujahideen. It&#39;s not a conspiracy. It wasn&#39;t secret. It wasn&#39;t surprising or unexpected. The vast majority of people in America knew about it and supported it. We considered the Soviets a force of pure evil, and efforts to help the Afghan people resist the Soviet invasion was universally considered a good thing. The mujahideen were the vehicle for that resistance. </p>

<p>All that money and all those arms did come back to bite us in the end, of course, because we funded what became an extremely well trained and well armed bunch of militants. Those militants would go on to fight all over the Middle East, as far as Tunisia and Morocco and many other places. And this was the cauldron from which bin Laden emerged.</p>

<p>For people not familiar with the history, or interested in the history, it&#39;s easy to just learn a fact or two and walk away saying &quot;DUH US MADE DEM ALKIDAS!&quot;</p>

<p>Nobody said it was, so you&#39;re attacking a straw man argument. What was unexpected is for them to begin claiming, some twelve years later, that these same people were &quot;evil terrorist killers&quot;.</p>
