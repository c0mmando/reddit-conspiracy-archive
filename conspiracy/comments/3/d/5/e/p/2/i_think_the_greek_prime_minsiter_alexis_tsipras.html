<p>Well, their not having found a satisfactory answer is <em>one</em> possibility.  Another possibility is that the answer <em>is</em> in fact known in at least <em>some</em> very limited quarters, but the truth of it is suppressed from the understanding of the general masses.</p>

<p>The establishment suppresses quite a lot of possible truths that would tell a very different story of what&#39;s really going on.</p>

<p>Very correct.</p>

<p>Absolutely.  Agreed.  Walk away <em>and help each other in the process</em>, however.  Walking away will be made all the easier if we, again, all come together and help buoy each other against the TPTB&#39;s actions against us.</p>

Its soo easy now to just walk away. Technology is doing most of the heavy lifting. 3D printers can build homes, communication is global, so many things we have at our disposal.

<p>Somehow, many/most of us are still just stuck in the old way of thinking.  We are the equivalent of the abused spouse that simply doesn&#39;t know any other way to exist aside from getting battered over the head and told every day that they are nothing...so we believe it, consciously and subconsciously, and don&#39;t do anything (or nearly enough) to break out of the cycle of subservience.</p>

<p>Hell, if we <em>really</em> stood up, we could crowdfund, like you said, but then, after we&#39;re up and running...we really could do away with money altogether if we did all work with one another responsibly.  I know that perhaps this might be way too tall an order for humanity at this point, but money&#39;s not what makes and builds things and clothes and feeds us.  WE DO.  It&#39;s our work and our ingenuity and our working together that does so.  As such, we don&#39;t NEED money to make this civilization run.  We just need our mutual cooperation and our working together for ourselves and each other.</p>

<p>Gosh, I cannot agree more.  This is the very thing I&#39;ve been echoing over and over again, as it&#39;s the <em>truth</em>.  I&#39;m glad to hear someone else actually saying it as well.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is correct.  All we need is each other and our mutual cooperation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im glad you agree. There&#39;s so much that&#39;s changed since even 2008 in terms of how people view citizenship in this country. We keep defending this country believing it&#39;s about our freedoms. The incorporated Constitution we live under does not support sovereign citizenship. And under it, some Americans aren&#39;t even considered American citizens, but emancipated slaves. I don&#39;t have to mention the race here, but we all know what race. I can&#39;t believe that there are people who just don&#39;t want to wake up and break away. They are too tied in to the system, to used to paying the taxes, and being abused as you say. Enough is finally becoming enough for most people. The sad part is, even when people do wake up, there will not be a planned system to guide us in taking hold of our newly found sovereignty.</p>

<p>Yeah.  It’s one thing to break out.  It’s another thing to address the “now what?” moment and figure out how to stand on your own two feet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because he has no choice ?</p>

<p>I know common sense is sometimes thrown out the window in this sub, hopefully this thread won&#39;t do the same...</p>

<p>But anyway, Greece had two options:</p>

<p>Agree to austerity measures OR leave the euro and try reboot Greece&#39;s economy with reintroducing the drachma.</p>

<p>If he would had chosen the later, all of the greeks savings would be worthless, their inept government would have a tremendous task ahead of them not to mention, every single citizen affected by their &quot;loss&quot; of savings would never vote for him again.</p>

<p>Him being anti-austerity is just the typical politician act of lies and deceit, it landed him his current job and the greek people just ate out of his hand.</p>

<p>All in all it boils down to if he wouldn&#39;t had agreed to austerity measures, things would had gotten A LOT worse for a long time before it would had gotten better.</p>

<p>What i&#39;m trying to say is: he might had gotten a push to accept it, but him accepting it doesn&#39;t mean that he had to be pushed at all.</p>
