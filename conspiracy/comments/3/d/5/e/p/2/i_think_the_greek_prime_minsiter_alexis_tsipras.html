       We cannot come together in the Matrix they have crafted specifically to prevent it. The solution is really very simple; we don't even have to fight them, all we have to do is walk away. But it's no easy thing either, for we are not just living in their Matrix, it is also living in us.

       Well, their not having found a satisfactory answer is
       <em>

       possibility.  Another possibility is that the answer

       in fact known in at least
       <em>

       very limited quarters, but the truth of it is suppressed from the understanding of the general masses.

       The establishment suppresses quite a lot of possible truths that would tell a very different story of what's really going on.

       Absolutely.  Agreed.  Walk away
       <em>

       I am surprised that people continue to live in the matrix, considering if we all could crowdfund a civilization and decide on the laws ourselves using the power of the internet and technology. Its soo easy now to just walk away. Technology is doing most of the heavy lifting. 3D printers can build homes, communication is global, so many things we have at our disposal. All we as the 99% need to do is pool our resources, put aside our differences in terms of race, politics and religious ideology, and create a utopia of our own design. We don't need their banks or their social order. We don't need their classism or tyranny.

       Somehow, many/most of us are still just stuck in the old way of thinking.  We are the equivalent of the abused spouse that simply doesn't know any other way to exist aside from getting battered over the head and told every day that they are nothing...so we believe it, consciously and subconsciously, and don't do anything (or nearly enough) to break out of the cycle of subservience.

      <p>
       Hell, if we
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       stood up, we could crowdfund, like you said, but then, after we're up and running...we really could do away with money altogether if we did all work with one another responsibly.  I know that perhaps this might be way too tall an order for humanity at this point, but money's not what makes and builds things and clothes and feeds us.  WE DO.  It's our work and our ingenuity and our working together that does so.  As such, we don't NEED money to make this civilization run.  We just need our mutual cooperation and our working together for ourselves and each other.

       Im glad you agree. There's so much that's changed since even 2008 in terms of how people view citizenship in this country. We keep defending this country believing it's about our freedoms. The incorporated Constitution we live under does not support sovereign citizenship. And under it, some Americans aren't even considered American citizens, but emancipated slaves. I don't have to mention the race here, but we all know what race. I can't believe that there are people who just don't want to wake up and break away. They are too tied in to the system, to used to paying the taxes, and being abused as you say. Enough is finally becoming enough for most people. The sad part is, even when people do wake up, there will not be a planned system to guide us in taking hold of our newly found sovereignty.

       I guarantee he/his family was. You do not fuck with the banking cabal. Which is a shame, because I had high hopes for Greece.

       Because he has no choice ?

       I know common sense is sometimes thrown out the window in this sub, hopefully this thread won't do the same...
      </p>
      <p>
       But anyway, Greece had two options:
      </p>
      <p>
       Agree to austerity measures OR leave the euro and try reboot Greece's economy with reintroducing the drachma.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he would had chosen the later, all of the greeks savings would be worthless, their inept government would have a tremendous task ahead of them not to mention, every single citizen affected by their "loss" of savings would never vote for him again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Him being anti-austerity is just the typical politician act of lies and deceit, it landed him his current job and the greek people just ate out of his hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       All in all it boils down to if he wouldn't had agreed to austerity measures, things would had gotten A LOT worse for a long time before it would had gotten better.
      </p>
      <p>
       What i'm trying to say is: he might had gotten a push to accept it, but him accepting it doesn't mean that he had to be pushed at all.

       They will still lose everything to the 1%, but with austerity it will be slow and manageable, and politicians can be cut in as they go.
