<p>now I make a post where I state one single fact.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>cnn doesn&#39;t care about what message you are sending them on their feedback channel</p>
</blockquote>

<p>while the post was upvoted yet I get a lot of angry people telling me that I want people to let the abuse going, and that I want them to do nothing which is quite hilarious as I&#39;m mostly posting on r/conspiracy for fuck sake.</p>

<p>the reality is that your voice doesn&#39;t matter for cnn. how hard is to understand this? they are doing their job of creating opinion, inventing stupid problems to debate upon, propaganda and propaganda.</p>

<p>they perfectly know what people think and they chose their narrative based on this.</p>

<p>I&#39;m assuming many people want to believe that is enough to just &quot;give that senator a call and I will put him in his place&quot; or &quot;I will write this petition on &quot;we the people&quot; and all will be made as I want. or even &quot;I will send the cnn a feedback and they will be ashamed and will change their behavior&quot;</p>

<p>someone else have examples of this &quot;I don&#39;t want to know the truth and I will &quot;kill you&quot; if you will say it to me?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>maybe its because they see you as threatening their way of seeing things. if what makes you are your thoughts, values &amp; beliefs, then you were essentially seen as a threat to them. The same reason why when you discuss religion with a religious person or politics with a political person, &amp; you say something they disagree with (regardless of who&#39;s right or wrong)...you start seeing the smoke coming out of their ears.....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your getting at something here. People attach and create their identity around group belief systems, such as their religion or political party, or even more broadly, the political system in which they exist. When you attack this belief system, the people who identify with that group feel they are being personally attacked. And we do all do it, but we can learn to understand that We are not our ideas.</p>

<p>This is where practices such as meditation can be hugely beneficial. Understanding our mental processes can help us see how we are manipulated by our cultural biases and by other people and institutions. The problem is getting someone to understand why this is even something worth doing, when our cultural conditioning stigmatizes this as the Graham Hancock quote in the sidebar gets at.</p>

Also, basic human psychology is not normally wired to deal with gradually encroaching and vague and broad problems. We can deal with tigers, enemy soldiers etc via fight or flight, and we can (sometimes) pull together as a community to respond to disaster but prudence and foresight and prevention against multifacet problems just isn&#39;t in us unless we&#39;re weirdo introspective game theorists. </p>

<p>I have a dear friend who I exposed to 9/11 truth eight years ago.  He threatened to block all correspondence if I ever spoke to him about it again.  Over time, I slowly let more and more leak out to him.  Just a few months ago he admitted to me that he now knows the &quot;official story&quot; is a lie...but it took that long.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When we have established a way of life (or the illusion of) and we are comfortable with that narrative (America is number one!, Terrorists are everywhere, so if you have nothing to hide..., Blah blah blah, government is working for you, blah blah blah, system of checks and balances...) it becomes a detrimental paradigm shift, where our world as we know it comes crumbling down when someone else tells us what we know is wrong, incomplete, a lie, a fantasy. So many people don&#39;t believe that the government commits the atrocities it does, that there are monsters out there, and they are running powerful forces, making shadowy deals behind doors to increase their power, to increase their wealth. Even if they see the cracks and flaws in the system, they don&#39;t want the facade to fail, they want that simple world to be there. It can be jarring to just lay out proof or to start poking holes into the way someone sees the world. Sometimes its best to try and ease people into it. Little stories of corruption here and there, secret operations and espionage changing the course of history as we know it. It takes a long time for people to normally adjust and be willing to change their views on the world. Some people are more set in their ways than others. Others see whats going wrong, or know about the realities, and ignore them, or do nothing. </p>
