       so, the recent pao drama, there's this post where cnn take her side and call out redditors as scums and whatnot.
      </p>
      <p>
       now I make a post where I state one single fact.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        cnn doesn't care about what message you are sending them on their feedback channel
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       while the post was upvoted yet I get a lot of angry people telling me that I want people to let the abuse going, and that I want them to do nothing which is quite hilarious as I'm mostly posting on r/conspiracy for fuck sake.
      </p>
      <p>
       the reality is that your voice doesn't matter for cnn. how hard is to understand this? they are doing their job of creating opinion, inventing stupid problems to debate upon, propaganda and propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       they perfectly know what people think and they chose their narrative based on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm assuming many people want to believe that is enough to just "give that senator a call and I will put him in his place" or "I will write this petition on "we the people" and all will be made as I want. or even "I will send the cnn a feedback and they will be ashamed and will change their behavior"
      </p>
      <p>
       someone else have examples of this "I don't want to know the truth and I will "kill you" if you will say it to me?"

       I would ask you to consider the fact that CNN is generally considered a pathetic joke now, and only watched and read by people who are probably too far gone for saving anyway. These same zombies will listen to them when SHTF and die. Nobody who wants to know anything watches CNN.

       maybe its because they see you as threatening their way of seeing things. if what makes you are your thoughts, values &amp; beliefs, then you were essentially seen as a threat to them. The same reason why when you discuss religion with a religious person or politics with a political person, &amp; you say something they disagree with (regardless of who's right or wrong)...you start seeing the smoke coming out of their ears.....

       I think your getting at something here. People attach and create their identity around group belief systems, such as their religion or political party, or even more broadly, the political system in which they exist. When you attack this belief system, the people who identify with that group feel they are being personally attacked. And we do all do it, but we can learn to understand that We are not our ideas.

       This is where practices such as meditation can be hugely beneficial. Understanding our mental processes can help us see how we are manipulated by our cultural biases and by other people and institutions. The problem is getting someone to understand why this is even something worth doing, when our cultural conditioning stigmatizes this as the Graham Hancock quote in the sidebar gets at.

       Some of it is pure selfishness--for the most part we are rewarded for believing the lies. Also, basic human psychology is not normally wired to deal with gradually encroaching and vague and broad problems. We can deal with tigers, enemy soldiers etc via fight or flight, and we can (sometimes) pull together as a community to respond to disaster but prudence and foresight and prevention against multifacet problems just isn't in us unless we're weirdo introspective game theorists.

       People don't like thinking they can be fooled.  They try to hang on to what they "know to be true"---which is nothing more than what they've been indoctrinated with.  The cognitive dissonance hurts their heads.

       I have a dear friend who I exposed to 9/11 truth eight years ago.  He threatened to block all correspondence if I ever spoke to him about it again.  Over time, I slowly let more and more leak out to him.  Just a few months ago he admitted to me that he now knows the "official story" is a lie...but it took that long.

       I know. I wish I could travel back in time to tell this to younger me. He was a bit too pushy, and not thoughtful of how others think. Anymore, I listen to what people have to say, and I counter it with mine. If they don't want to believe it I just shrug. There's no sense in pissing people off when arguing about political corruption because it's blindingly apparent to most people. Most just do not know the extent of how bad it really is.

       I have friends who (surprisingly) admit that they would rather keep their head in the sand about most everything. It's easier for them to remain willfully ignorant, and easier to let someone else do the thinking for them. They say bad news or ideas make them depressed or angry. And they don't want to feel that way despite knowing that keeping their head in the sand does not make the problem go away.

       When we have established a way of life (or the illusion of) and we are comfortable with that narrative (America is number one!, Terrorists are everywhere, so if you have nothing to hide..., Blah blah blah, government is working for you, blah blah blah, system of checks and balances...) it becomes a detrimental paradigm shift, where our world as we know it comes crumbling down when someone else tells us what we know is wrong, incomplete, a lie, a fantasy. So many people don't believe that the government commits the atrocities it does, that there are monsters out there, and they are running powerful forces, making shadowy deals behind doors to increase their power, to increase their wealth. Even if they see the cracks and flaws in the system, they don't want the facade to fail, they want that simple world to be there. It can be jarring to just lay out proof or to start poking holes into the way someone sees the world. Sometimes its best to try and ease people into it. Little stories of corruption here and there, secret operations and espionage changing the course of history as we know it. It takes a long time for people to normally adjust and be willing to change their views on the world. Some people are more set in their ways than others. Others see whats going wrong, or know about the realities, and ignore them, or do nothing.

       I've pretty much given up on people realizing the predicament we are in. I just take care of my and my own now, I stock up on the essentials and have plans for all types of scenarios, as for everyone else, well, i have a shiotgun for those who aren't prepared.

       It's all based on fear. People know they are out gunned. They stay on the side that's wining by not facing reality.

       They think they will not be killed or harassed in the rise of the overt police state, because of some overarching appearance of loyalty to the status quo. They don't complain, they don't speak up. They go earn a paycheck, pay bills and put what they think is food on the table.
      </p>
      <p>
       Truth is probably: Unless you bought VIP backstage passes years ago by helping to instigate the overt rise of the police state, you're gonna be rounded up like everyone else. Your fate will be death or what will effectively amount to a lobotomy.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the whole Reddit firing some 'top' person distraction-circle-jerk, without knowing any details, the truth remains. The ill practices that make reddit profitable and maintain it as a lever to shift public thought will continue regardless of who they put 'in charge.' The straw-maning of "conspiracy" channels like this will continue, hell there's already a section specifically for doing that.

       There's actually a flat-earth forum - people are still arguing that the world is flat. They receive group validation of their beliefs from others. As far as they are concerned, we are all brainwashed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Likewise there are holocaust revisionists, and again it's much the same, they seek group validation for an extreme belief, and they use the same type of techniques - that they know the real truth and a greater force is manipulating everyone else
      </p>
      <p>
       In connection to your post, some people just have a problem understanding that the world isn't controlled. That there isn't some all-powerful force manipulating everything.. and hence they are apt to latch on to these beliefs

       You speak as if the flat earth hypothesis and revising the holocaust narrative are in the same ballpark with regard to how extreme those viewpoints are. You've probably absorbed that technique from the JIDF shills who like to conflate the most outrageous and least-believed conspiracy hypotheses with the idea that the historical record of WW2 might not be 100% accurate.

       it's because past a certain point, where our beliefs become engrained as our realities, for another to criticize our reality or tell us that it is wrong, it is the same as an attack on the ego or the self. Remember, your ego is part of your self preservation package. You are literally seeing a conflicting opinion or idea as an attack on your physical being.
      </p>

       I think it's a uniquely human trait due to our higher level thinking processes. It's not something that is taught to us, it's more a part of our primal self than anything else.
