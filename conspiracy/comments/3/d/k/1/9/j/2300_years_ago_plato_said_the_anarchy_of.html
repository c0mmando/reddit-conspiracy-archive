<p>From the Appendix, The Principles of Newspeak:</p>

<p>&quot;Its vocabulary was so constructed as to give exact and often very subtle expression to every meaning that a Party member could properly wish to express, while excluding all other meanings and also the possibility of arriving at them by indirect methods. This was done partly by the invention of new words, but chiefly by eliminating undesirable words and by stripping such words as remained of unorthodox meanings, and so far as possible of all secondary meanings whatever. To give a single example. The word free still existed in Newspeak, but it could only be used in such statements as &#39;This dog is free from lice&#39; or &#39;This field is free from weeds.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>The point was to make the communication precise so as to fit the party line and not leave the possibility of thought other than what the party deemed desirable. One way to do this is to only allow words to have one meaning.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This sentence is referring to the usage of one word for multiple meanings.</p>

<p>By using the word &quot;anarchy&quot; to mean two different things you&#39;re engaging in NewSpeak.</p>

<p>I, myself, made a distinction between &quot;anarchy&quot; and Chaos&quot; - which is the opposite of NewSpeak.</p>

<p>So, I&#39;m on Orwell&#39;s side.</p>

<p>You are not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This was done partly by the invention of new words, but chiefly by eliminating undesirable words and by stripping such words as remained of unorthodox meanings, and so far as possible of all secondary meanings whatever.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is one of the reasons why I like having a big vocabulary and one based on root words. I don&#39;t mind associations so long as the words being used are exactly what I intend to communicate. And, because of my large vocabulary I can do so not only precisely, but also with some subtlety.</p>

<p>By using anarchy to mean something other than anarchy you&#39;re engaging in NewSpeak.</p>

<p>So, I&#39;m on Orwell&#39;s side.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;To give a single example. The word free still existed in Newspeak, but it could only be used in such statements as &#39;This dog is free from lice&#39; or &#39;This field is free from weeds.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Holy fucking God. Just substitute &quot;anarchy&quot; for &quot;free&quot; and we have this very exchange. So, Orwell would completely back me up on this. Thank you for putting up that quote to make my point. It&#39;s unfortunate that it only proves that you didn&#39;t understand what was being said.</p>

<p>It&#39;s okay to be wrong, but, for the love of God, don&#39;t skim a book and pretend to discuss it without understanding what&#39;s being said within the book. It just makes you look idiotic and other people will come into this sub and you&#39;re going to represent all of us. I don&#39;t like that your ignorance is in any way associated with me by proxy.</p>

<p>Read more carefully and pick up a godamn dictionary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are wrong in every way. You seem to think that Orwell was all for Newspeak and that is why you think he is on your side. Orwell was an anarchist that believed in democracy.  Even in your delusional etymological displays you are wrong. Anarchy means without a leader as in without a chief. Democracy means &#39;demos kratos,&#39; which means an assembly of the people rule. They are not opposites at all. They are complementary like yin and yang.</p>

<p>You really don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about or saying.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to just assume you&#39;re either too young or simply unable to comprehend.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s try and make it easy for you:</p>

<p>Firstly:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NewSpeak = few words = limited thought</p>

<p>normal speech with a full vocabulary = free thought = precision in word = effective communication</p>

<p>Orwell was opposed to NewSpeak as am I. I honestly don&#39;t understand how you can confuse this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Secondly:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>kratos means &quot;state.&quot; You said it yourself &quot;the people rule.&quot; <em>RULE</em>.</p>

<p>Just because the rulers are a group of people doesn&#39;t negate the &quot;rule&quot; aspect.</p>

<p>So, again, you&#39;ve proven yourself wrong by your own words.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I doubt you&#39;ll understand, but I tried.</p>

<p>Good day to you.</p>

<p>Newspeak wasn&#39;t about &quot;misusing terms.&quot; The words that were created in newspeak were very precise and removed any sort of poetic or figurative use. It was about setting a strict definition of words to obstruct freedom of thought and then condemning people for misusing the old words. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been looking into banking, Freemasonry, Luciferianism, mythology, Communism and so on for the better part of a decade. I know the bigger picture. I have book shelves devoted to the bigger picture.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to make the point that I am an anarchist. </p>

<p>As such this word has meaning for me. I do not believe in &quot;chaos.&quot; I do not promote &quot;chaos.&quot; There are anarchists in this world and they would object, rightly, to being called &quot;chaosist&quot; by some lazy speaker.</p>

<p>I&#39;m of the opinion that the solution to much of the central control systems is anarchy. We don&#39;t need the self-appointed rulers. Whether you believe they&#39;re lizard people, Illuminati, Jews or whatever you care to call them. We don&#39;t need them. We don&#39;t need commanders commanding us to be good people. </p>

<p>[a] = without</p>

<p>[archon] = king</p>

<p>We don&#39;t need kings and we don&#39;t need their government.</p>

<p>That has nothing, at all, to do with chaos.</p>

<p>They are two different words and that is an important and worthy distinction.</p>
