    <div class="md"><p>Dr. Tracy,</p>

<p>Many of us know that the 2012 Batman film &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; includes a scene with a map which references Sandy Hook (with the relative location of Sandy Hook Elementary School circled in red pen). </p>

<p><a href="http://zazenlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/23045gotham-map.jpg">http://zazenlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/23045gotham-map.jpg</a></p>

<p>Edit: Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOR67DOM-ZQ">short video showing an overlay with Sandy Hook Elementary School in google earth.</a></p>

<p>This &quot;coincidence&quot; is all the more extreme when you consider the 2011 movie &quot;Dream House&quot; also has a prop which references Sandy Hook.</p>

<p><a href="http://illuminatiwatcher.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IlluminatiWatcherDotCom-Dream-House-Sandy-Hook1.jpg">http://illuminatiwatcher.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IlluminatiWatcherDotCom-Dream-House-Sandy-Hook1.jpg</a></p>

<p>This is a screenshot of one of the film&#39;s characters&#39; business card, a Dr. <strong>Greeley</strong>, who works in Sandy Hook, CT with the same zip code as the Elementary school (CT 06482). Even more disturbing is the fact that GREELEY is a town in Colorado which saw one of the worst school disasters in US history in 1961 - an incident in which 20 children were killed (the same number as Sandy Hook) on 14 December (same date as Sandy Hook).</p>

<p>So my question assumes the premise that these film props are signposts to a contrived, pre-planned school shooting event that was to take place in December 14, 2012 in Sandy Hook. However, they are not specific enough to constitute a warning, so what might the purpose of these messages be?</p>

<p>EDIT: In terms of &quot;signposts&quot;, I could have included the media references to the &quot;Sandy Hook hoax&quot; in which a boat was reported lost with 20 people in the water off the coast of New Jersey in June 2012.</p>

<p>EDIT 2: Talking about &quot;signposts&quot;, there is a very interesting geographic signpost which I discovered in Google Earth, which clearly suggests that Sandy Hook was planned many years in advance by an element of the US elite (freemasons and politicians). I have posted the details here:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Might be a little far-fetched, but maybe subliminal messaging to make the attacks more impactful? I mean if some random guy died, you wouldn&#39;t care that much. But if you saw that guy somewhere else before, you automatically &quot;connect&quot; to that person and thus care more about it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes indeed, this is certainly one of the key reasons, in my view. I was hoping James Tracy would say something on these lines, but sadly my question wasn&#39;t answered.</p>

<p>The subliminal effect of being pre-exposed to the name &quot;Sandy Hook&quot; helps anchor it in the subconscious - like a meme. Then when the actual Sandy Hook incident hits the news, it already feels &quot;real&quot; and significant because it is linking with something that has been stored away in your subconscious.</p>

<p>If you recall, there was a destructive meteorological event on the East Coast in (just before Sandy Hook in 2012) called &quot;Hurricane Sandy&quot;. This is perhaps more likely a coincidence, but at this point I don&#39;t rule anything out.</p>

<p>The Sandy Hook boat hoax is slightly different, because I believe this was partly organised to get the the search term &quot;Sandy Hook hoax&quot; plenty of hits in google, to sidetrack anybody looking for evidence that the school shooting was a hoax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great breakdown. I think you are right on the money with your analysis. One thing to consider is that a lot of this stuff could simply be red herrings thrown out there to confuse and sidetrack people. Think of the amount of time and energy wasted trying to figure all of this stuff out. In the end, it doesn&#39;t matter why it was put into the movie or by whom because in the end it has no direct connection to the event. It distracts valuable energy from what&#39;s important, which is the actual crime itself. There are too many people in this &quot;movement&quot; who are far too obsessed with these things. It is counterproductive and does nothing to help the situation. Many of the people who obsess over these things are into this movement more as a hobby than anything else. It&#39;s like a mystery-themed video game or something to them. They gather and endlessly ponder all of these useless tidbits of info that seem to connect with an event but which accomplish absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>My contention is that Sandy Hook was a simulated event planned many years in advance. These film pointers are evidence of prior knowledge, so it does matter who put these props in those movies, because the individuals responsible should be investigated (assuming they are still alive).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should be thinking more in terms of balance of probabilities - and the Sandy Hook references in those movies were very specific - the circle on the map clearly marking the location of the school, and the zip code of the school (with a reference on the same prop to another traumatic event which occurred on 14th December where 20 children died). </p>

<p>Analysis of a false-flag event can broken down into three separate categories.</p>

<ul>
<li>Evidence of prior knowledge</li>
<li>Evidence during the incident that contradicts the official narrative</li>
<li>Evidence of an official cover-up after the incident</li>
</ul>

<p>Of these, a single provable incident of prior knowledge completely destroys the official narrative (of a crazed teenager acting alone) more effectively than the other categories. Since the authorities had total control of the crime scene (SHES), it is much harder to contradict their account with firm evidence. As for cover-ups - clearly there was one at Sandy Hook but there are different reasons for cover-ups, and they don&#39;t prove a false flag.</p>

<p>I am not saying that these film references, or the Sandy Hook boat hoax etc are proof on their own, but collectively they strongly suggest that Sandy Hook was an event planned for a long time, and ratified at the highest levels of the US establishment.</p>

In order to sneak a map into the prop departments of these movies you would need more conspirators and that just makes it riskier.

<p>Witness Corbin Dates told Hardball with Chris Matthews that there was a second shooter, <strong>a man with a goatee</strong> (Holmes did not have a goatee), who was lingering near the emergency exit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gun ownership is actually on the decline, unless that&#39;s changed drastically in the last 5 years. Last time I read up on it, only about 35% of US citizens own guns. In the 70s, it was in the 50% area. I think that the number of guns has increased because the 35% of people that own guns are building their &quot;collections&quot;, but the number of people that own a gun isn&#39;t very high. Especially when you consider that the biggest cities, therefore the highest concentration of population, have all voluntarily surrendered their guns. It&#39;s either illegal or very expensive/impractical to have a handgun for self-defense in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington D.C., New York City, and Baltimore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was basing that number on a Washington Times article and what I remembered when Illinois first passed their CCW law, and the cost was in the realm of $650 at that time. Probably due to no competition for training classes.</p>

<p>$300 is still a lot of money for some people, and nothing you&#39;ve said has any bearing on the fact that many of the biggest cities in the USA make it prohibitively expensive or impractical to carry a handgun for self-defense.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Actually, it&#39;s a right. And that right is protected by the United States Constitution.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you cant afford a gun or the training required to carry one, you shouldnt have one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree that nobody without proper training should be carrying, or handling, firearms. But the state doesn&#39;t need to make it prohibitively expensive.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You inflated the price of CCL training in Chicago by over 200%, and I addressed that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I used outdated information. At one point, less than 2 years ago, that number was correct. I haven&#39;t kept up on the costs of training to obtain a CCW in a state I&#39;ve never even been to. Sorry. The point that laws have made it prohibitively expensive to carry a handgun still stands.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If one looks at the features of JFK Jr.&#39;s demise it&#39;s difficult not to be suspicious, because he was an experienced pilot who seemed poised to handle any such situation. The authorities were unusually slow to embark on rescue procedures once it became apparent that the plane went down. In addition, Jr. would be a politically viable and potentially dangerous figure as long as he remained alive. He was becoming salient through his journalistic endeavors as well. It&#39;s important to keep in mind that a majority of the US public still thinks there was a conspiracy behind the JFK assassination. The population abroad is even more skeptical as a whole. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have any insights on Keating specifically. However, the OKCB is a key event in the invisible government&#39;s war of terror against the public. Very much worthy of study, and far less complex than 9/11.</p>

<p>Certain media and literature more broadly have a greater chance to escape the censorial practices of what Hans Enzensberger called &quot;the consciousness industry.&quot; This &quot;industry&quot; or process is part economic, part political, and part ideological. A good deal of the so-called &quot;alternative media&quot; are also part of this industry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve not delved in to the JFK Jr. death to provide much more than what I&#39;ve suggested above.</p>

<p>RFK Jr.&#39;s stance on vaccination is admirable. He&#39;s dancing with the devil every time he opens his mouth on any issue, and that&#39;s something I&#39;m sure he&#39;s acutely aware of. The only way he could become a seriously viable political force would be if America defeated its own severe case of psychological denial and historical amnesia, and recognize that his father and uncle were assassinated by coordinated efforts of US intelligence and military forces. They were America&#39;s last hope against what authors David Wise and Thomas Ross termed &quot;the invisible government&quot; in their 1964 book of the same name. </p>

<p>Are you aware of the connection between SSRI antidepressant drugs and mass murders?</p>

<p><a href="http://ssristories.wpengine.com/old/index1.php">http://ssristories.wpengine.com/old/index1.php</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26e5PqrCePk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26e5PqrCePk</a></p>

<p>Studies have already nonchalantly confirmed &quot;anti&quot;depresant drugs numb all emotions including good ones like love and empathy.  And that they&#39;ve been shown to be able to make even health non-depressed people suicidal.  Yet it seems not many talk about why that&#39;s a problem.  Is it any wonder why people exposed to these drugs are so depressed?</p>

<p>Yes, although there are too few voices raising concern over antidepressants and similar substances. &quot;Depression&quot; itself is construct of the psychiatric-pharmaceutical industry that was devised in the 1980s as the necessary precursor to the introduction of antidepressants as the new series of &quot;blockbuster&quot; drugs.</p>

<p>The pharmaceutical industry took their show on the road to Japan in the late 1990s early 2000s, where through a massive PR-advertising blitz they introduced the notion of &quot;depression&quot; as &quot;the soul catching a cold,&quot; to sell an entire generation of Japanese on SSRIs.  </p>

<p>Further many antidepressants and antipsychotics are fluorinated. </p>

Im sorry you identify with the term clinical depression. I have few people in my life who have similar issues and it really all boils down to being manipulated by this system so they can tell you how to fix your problems instead of working on fixing them yourself. The medical and pharmaceutical industry is a complete sham. People were healing themselves way before modern science came into the picture.

    <div class="md"><p>I have always been interested in the relationship between politics, public opinion, and social movements. When I was an undergraduate I was fascinated by the political assassinations of the 1960s, in part because my family were such huge Kennedy supporters. (This was a cultural thing as well, as we were Irish Catholics.) Yet what&#39;s amazing is that there were no undergrad courses where I could learn about these things--where, for example, I might be assigned Jim Garrison&#39;s Heritage of Stone. </p>

<p>Thirty years later that&#39;s still the case--almost. I taught a university class on political conspiracies and the media in 2014 where we read sections of that magnificent book. Garrison is not only a talented writer; he would also be a hero if our history and journalism were honest. </p>

<p>I began to peel the first layers off the onion by reading Malcolm X&#39;s Autobiography later as an undergrad, then researching his assassination for a term paper. It was clear that he was set up. At the time I didn&#39;t understand the complexity of the event and broader politics. </p>

<p>Also, I had a number of very capable professors at San Jose State, where I finished my undergrad while in my late 20s. Among these was George Vasquez, who exposed me to the injustices of cold war US foreign policy in Latin America, the US overthrow of Allende and other popular governments, films like The Panama Deception. These approaches to history are acceptable, yet the dictates of American exceptionalism (and the Warren Commission) are that similar events DO NOT take place in US institutions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find both Haslam and Baker&#39;s work to be fascinating. I am presently working with a colleague on an edited volume for TrineDay (the publisher of their works), which we hope will be published in 2016. The book will feature chapters by several notable scholars and journalists addressing the topic of false flags.</p>

<p>At the same time a notable JFK assassination researcher remarked to me that none of the people they&#39;ve ever interviewed concerning Oswald had ever heard of Baker or recollect her from 1963.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a physicist so I am not inclined to chime in on Wood or specifically how the World Trade Center was demolished. The topic (and not necessarily Wood) serves as a tremendous source of divisiveness in the 9/11 Truth community which is unfortunate. It&#39;s safe to conclude that the event was pulled off with the probable active involvement of the US government and Western intelligence community. Thus far, it&#39;s the crime of the century, the basis for the phony &quot;war on terror&quot; (war of terror), and the bread and butter of the military-academic-intelligence-media complex. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dr Tracy, </p>

<p>Excellent <a href="http://memoryholeblog.com/2015/01/14/ocean-acidification-science-omits-crucial-data/">article</a> depicting the state of research on climate change behind the headlines. With the Pope and big oil now pushing for a global carbon pricing solution, a global enforcing and carbon-tax funded body seems inevitable. </p>

<p>I try to point out existing solutions, like the thorium plant which India has had on hold <a href="http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Country-Profiles/Countries-G-N/India/">due to:</a></p>

<p>&quot;In October 2013 BARC said that premature deployment of thorium would lead to sub-optimal use of indigenous energy resources&quot;, </p>

<p>are readily ignored by climate scientist. To me, their lack of interest in promoting methods of resolving what they describe as a serious thing, suggests they are more focused on securing a carbon tax than pursuing what that tax is supposed to be used for.</p>

<p>What&#39;s been your most successful strategy for getting people to look beyond the smoke and mirrors posing as science that is the &quot;consensus&quot;?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. However, I should point out that the article you&#39;ve linked to was not authored by me. I attempt to post pieces to MHB that I think are worthwhile, substantive, and haven&#39;t received much exposure elsewhere. </p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it fitting that the pontiff has come out in support of climate change? After all, &quot;climate change&quot; or the &quot;denial&quot; thereof has all of the characteristics of a religion--initially for secularists, but now for those with religious inclinations. Most professional academics and journalists I come in contact with are sold on the idea, failing to see the huge amount of cash that flows in to and props up the &quot;Green movement&quot; by those interests that will benefit handsomely through carbon credit trading and an abundance of new taxes. It&#39;s also about deindustrialization and thus probably depopulation.</p>

<p>One tactic that I think may be helpful in getting the greenies back to earth is to simply stick to and emphasize the basic science. 2 + 2 = 4. Along these lines, CO2 is a trace element in our atmosphere and solar radiation is the principal factor in global warming or cooling.  </p>

<p>Secular progressivism is the memetic descendent of Puritan Calvinism. Blasphemy, inquisition, indoctrination, and brainwashing still occur from the perspective of the progressive religion. Therefore, progressive culture is referred to as <a href="http://atavisionary.com/the-cathedral-compilation-page/">“the Cathedral”.</a> The Cathedral consists of influential people in politics, journalism, academia and education acting in an uncoordinated manner to advance progressive principles in society; often deceptively.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not that I&#39;m aware of, but as an acquaintance once remarked to me, the ones you can see and keep an eye on are not the ones you have to worry about. </p>

<p>In January 2013 when the media frenzy ensued over the &quot;conspiracy theory professor&quot; I did become somewhat paranoid for several days after receiving a number of unusual comments on the blog, email communications, and phone calls, some of which were simply attributable to cranks. </p>

<p>With others I can&#39;t be so sure. I received a call from a seemingly friendly man in early January who expounded at length on his bona fides, then told me that I should be especially careful if I should discover that my residence is broken into, or if I am abruptly pulled over by police. He further remarked that if I have a gun I should know how to use effectively it because the employment of a victim&#39;s gun to lend the appearance of a &quot;suicide&quot; is a prevalent murder technique by hit men. Now, in my view it&#39;s difficult to determine whether this man&#39;s remarks to me were &quot;advice&quot; or a warning. The notes I took on our conversation, along with several other documents, disappeared from my home shortly thereafter.</p>

<p>The harassment by CNN and Cooper seeking to pressure my employer to fire me was right out of an intelligence playbook. I discuss this in the aforementioned Uscinski volume.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had disagreements with my colleagues at Project Censored concerning Jones and Infowars. Although they have given Jones awards for reporting &quot;censored&quot; stories years ago during the Bush administration when Jones&#39; politics and anti-war stances were perceived as &quot;correct,&quot; they won&#39;t consider Infowars stories today, even though many of the Infowars writers produce good work. When PC attacked Jones I disagreed with their premise and wrote the following commentary.</p>

<p><a href="http://memoryholeblog.com/2013/10/03/with-disinfo-wars-project-censored-abandons-principles/">http://memoryholeblog.com/2013/10/03/with-disinfo-wars-project-censored-abandons-principles/</a></p>

<p>Although I remain on good terms with PC and have students partake in researching under-reported &quot;censored&quot; stories, , I have been essentially disinvited from contributing to their volumes, after having essays in two consecutive Censored yearbooks. I&#39;ve been Censored by Censored.</p>

<p>In my view, the schism between the two organizations is ideological, revolving around the ascendance of Obama alongside &quot;hot button&quot; issues like immigration, abortion, and gun control, where the left and right are diametrically opposed and see each other through an almost paranoid lens. I can also see the merit of PC&#39;s concerns. Jones is a self-proclaimed &quot;Father of 9/11 Truth.&quot; Yet his tenacious and prominent stances on such issues, vis-a-vis is often bizarre behavior, alienates many of those &quot;on the left,&quot; who might otherwise be allies.</p>

<p>If you want the lowdown on Jones you should probably attempt to find one of his former Infowars employees who&#39;s willing to violate the very formidable confidentiality agreement they&#39;ve signed. My understanding is that Aaron Dykes and Melissa Melton have undergone considerable harassment after leaving Infowars.</p>

<p>Effective propaganda today is roughly 95% truth and 5% disinformation. Max Kaiser, for example, has a great many thoughtful observations on the economy, but then throws a curve ball with his promotion of &quot;anthropogenic global warming.&quot; Other alternative media outlets have danced around the Sandy Hook event and Boston Marathon bombing, either with a &quot;wait and see&quot; approach, or a general embrace of the official narrative. </p>

<p>I have always been suspicious of Duff. He&#39;s not consistent in his remarks, often contradicting himself. There are those who express reservations about Fetzer, but I think Jim is simply an incredibly intelligent individual, and intelligent people are also frequently cantankerous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re welcome. Thank you. </p>

<p>I would have to say &quot;No,&quot; at least as far as I&#39;m concerned. I work at a university alongside film scholars who will probably disagree. In our building we have an art cinema with several screens that&#39;s open seven days a week. (Lots of senior citizen clientele in South Florida.) Each day I walk by the marquee and posters of present and future screenings, and periodically stop to read the films&#39; synopses. There&#39;s almost nothing that piques my interest.  I find many more worthwhile things on YouTube made by people who are probably amateurs and are simply running on their own curiosity and and creativity.</p>

<p>Further, there&#39;s a whole economy involved in movie making where films that really challenge the status quo or global elites will be stymied. In the early 1950s Eustace Mullins sought to have his book on the Federal Reserve published. He was amazed to find that no publisher would touch it. One publisher finally confided that if they did take it on their notes/loans would be called in by the banks and they&#39;d be out of business. Whether we&#39;re talking about book publishing, television or film production, with media consolidation that dynamic is even stronger today.   </p>

<p>A few filmmakers seeking to develop major productions out of Daniel Estulin&#39;s work and the Franklin scandal have experienced similar financial problems, as TrineDay publisher Kris Millegan discussed in an interview with me last December. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are incentives at my employer to teach online courses that I&#39;ve never availed myself of. This is mainly a personal preference for teaching in person. Most courses are also restricted to matriculated students who are majors. </p>

<p>BTW, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll ever be allowed to teach a course that overtly addresses political conspiracies again, even though they&#39;re now a focus of my research and lived experience. The paperwork for a course I proposed on conspiracies back in 2012 was mysteriously &quot;lost&quot; by the undergraduate curriculum committee after the media frenzy ensued in January 2013 on my Sandy Hook analyses and commentary. Shortly thereafter, in April 2013 after I remarked publicly on how the Boston Marathon bombing looked like a drill, I had classes outright cancelled and rescheduled by my chairperson and dean. These were more-than-subtle acts of retribution after I contested formal disciplinary measures. </p>

<p>Because my tenure and the faculty bargaining agreement I have a formal legal agreement with my academic employer that I will not use the name of my institution or any academic title that may suggest affiliation with that institution. I&#39;ve never been accused by my employer that what I&#39;ve publicly stated wasn&#39;t true, and have stood by my constitutional right to express my views as I see fit. In the eyes of &quot;developers&quot; and &quot;donors&quot; I had committed blasphemy. Like a for-profit corporation, they are far more concerned with public relations and the preservation of their &quot;brand&quot;, than they are with the pursuit of truth, particularly if such a pursuit is &quot;controversial&quot; (i.e. focused on and amplified by corporate media.). </p>

<p>I write about this entire affair in a chapter for a forthcoming book, &quot;Conspiracy Theories and the People Who Believe Them,&quot; edited by Prof. Joe Uscinski. </p>

<p>I&#39;m very sorry to hear this.  Please know that your courage is absolutely contagious.  Your willingness to call it like you see it,  regardless of how politically incorrect or inconvenient it may be, is such an inspiration to me,  and no doubt to many others here.

    <div class="md"><p>I was under the impression that I responded to this previously, by directing you to the response to bukvich above, but that post seems to have disappeared. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a very bit set of questions. I would say that my parents probably had the greatest impact on me. Both were the products of late 19th century era parents. My mother was strongly Catholic but my father abandoned Catholicism in the early 1960s because of the Church&#39;s liberalization. Through stories in particular my father was able to relate values from that era that I would otherwise never have any way of understanding. Thus rituals like storytelling, in addition to anti-tyranny/anti-imperialist, pro-(Irish) republican sentiments were deeply imbued. He was also the son of a highly-respected physician, so the notions of professional acumen, care and community service were emphasized, as well as an appreciation for higher education. While growing up I as well as many of those in immediate preceding generations sneered at these values and pretty much everything patriotic as short-sited and hypocritical. In hindsight, those sentiments were partly correct, but not for the reasons we&#39;d assumed.</p>

<p>I&#39;m inclined to think my uncle, William Tracy Jr., might have had an influence as well but I never knew him. He was also a physician and civic leader in Jamestown, New York, where the area municipal plaza bears his name after his premature passing of a heart attack at age 50 in 1970. The more mild-mannered Stan Lundine, a close friend and protege of my uncle&#39;s, went on to serve as Jamestown&#39;s mayor, a representative to the US House for six consecutive terms, and NY Lieutenant Governor under Mario Cuomo.</p>

<p>As far as the biggest event in history, for me it would have to be 9/11 for obvious reasons. Yet as a people we have been swayed and our energies channeled by a series of calamitous events that can be fairly unambiguously dated to at least WWI, that is if we look to the deeper causes of such world events and not the superficial &quot;timeline history&quot; causes we are routinely furnished with by our state educational and media institutions. If one looks to US history as one involving the struggle over national versus &quot;central&quot; banking such events become rather apparent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s certainly possible. Some Sandy Hook researchers, such as Sofia Smallstorm, are even more convinced after having visited the scene. </p>

<p>The phenomenon is likely far more common than the public is aware, in part because political power is built on compromised individuals. John DeCamp&#39;s work is perhaps the most significant in terms of identifying the link between child abuse/slavery rings and the US political system. Maury Terry&#39;s The Ultimate Evil and David McGowan&#39;s Programmed to Kill are also excellent, as are several of Dr. Colin Ross&#39; books.  </p>

<p>Let&#39;s take Terry&#39;s book on the &quot;Son of Sam&quot; killings, a well-researched work suggesting linkages between the US military, intelligence, and occult groups where a handful of journalists were doing what law enforcement should have been doing all along but failed to do because of narrow political aims. McGowan picks up this line of argument to observe that some of the many infamous serial killers often had ties to US military or intelligence, and once apprehended were often given unusually favorable treatment by prosecutors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you so much. On my last topic post I was literally attacked for just defending Putin. Sure, not all of his policies are acceptable, but why does the west criticise him (and China) but completely ignore Saudi Arabia or India? </p>

<p>Under Putin, from 2001 to 2007, the Russian economy grew at a rate of 7% per year. Russian Domestic Product (GDP) increased 6 times, climbing up from the 22nd to the 10th largest in the world. Average wages had almost increased tenfold. The percentage of people living in poverty was cut in half. Once totalling nearly 150% of GDP, nearly all foreign debt was paid off. Moscow also became home to the fastest growing group of millionaires. And everyone still thinks Putin is the &quot;bad&quot; guy. </p>

<p>There&#39;s the curious case of Michael Cravey/Thomas Brinkley, the &quot;conspiracy theorist gone mad&quot; story of last year which I think is worthy of deep study and analysis. Cravey was apparently killed on March 3, 2014 after allegedly attacking a couple with a knife and charging a police officer with a hatchet. Yet Cravey&#39;s friends say he was a smart, gentle guy who&#39;d never do such things. He complained of someone taking over his Twitter and IM in the weeks prior to the aforementioned date. Cravey&#39;s YouTube channel may be found here:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps we shouldn&#39;t be overly ambitious. The first thing one can do is to have the courage to take their own mind seriously and to think for themselves. This involves basic critical thinking that&#39;s not taught in most schools, universities, or the mass media--our conduits of &quot;continuing education (instruction/indoctrination).&quot; Such habits of thought begin in the home with the parents, and thus the family is the most significant educational unit. Home schooling is a potential extension of this for families fortunate enough not to have to rely on the state for child care/mandatory indoctrination. The recent surge in home schooling in the US is thus cause for optimism. </p>

<p>To date he has not taken me up on the offer.</p>

<p>BTW, many remark that Cooper has ties to the CIA because he spent a few summers while at Yale interning at the Agency. Yet were you aware that Cooper has ties to the CIA that go all the way back to the years of &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Donovan and the OSS?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve come across a potentially big video about an incoming financial crash. It seems like a concealed advertisement, yet has quite a bit of info to back it up. I&#39;ve yet to form a solid opinion on it. What about you? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Judging by the downvotes <em>someone</em> really doesn&#39;t want this seen. Come on, I thought censorship isn&#39;t cool here? </p>

<p>Question:</p>

<p>Why do you keep posting fabricated information and outright lies on your blog? </p>

<p>For example, this post from 2014: <a href="http://memoryholeblog.com/2014/01/10/top-ten-reasons-sandy-hook-was-an-elaborate-hoax/">&quot;Top Ten Reasons: Sandy Hook Was an Elaborate Hoax.&quot;</a></p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Proof of death has been suppressed</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you cite a single mass shooting in the past 10 years in which police have <em>officially</em> released gruesome autopsy photos of dead kids? </p>

<p>As for parents not seeing the bodies and having closed caskets, thats probably because <em>there was not much left of their kids to see.</em> Do you have any idea what a round fired from the rifle Lanza used does to a kid&#39;s skull? It explodes. You don&#39;t have an open casket of a kid missing half their head. </p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Emergency protocols were not followed</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you explain why an EMT or police officer would waste time tending to a kid with half of his head blown off and his brain matter all over the carpet? That&#39;s why you didn&#39;t see any &quot;frantic&quot; rushing kids to hospitals. They were all very dead and if you knew anything about emergency protocols you would know triage procedures call for classifying a person&#39;s chances of survival immediately to determine who gets urgent treatment. A kid with his brain exploded outside of his head isn&#39;t going to be rushed to a hospital. </p>

<p>Check out the police reports, officers and EMTs entered the school to conduct triage, but most of the people they encountered were so obviously dead they did not move them. </p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Drill protocols were followed instead</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Here you are misrepresenting the check-in setup that was established to control the crime scene with a drill check-in that is usually set up <em>hours before</em> the supposed drill. </p>

<p>You also falsely claim an emergency preparedness <em>drill</em> was running in Bridgeport, CT that morning. It was not a drill, it was a class, with people sitting at desks talking about stuff. Moreover there are at least 50 of those drills running at any given time across the country, chances are within 100 miles of your location right now. Does that make any shooting that happens within 100 miles of you a flase-flag? </p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>There was foreknowledge of the event </li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Here the article you cite returns a 404, but its from Veterans Today, another source infamous for publishing outright lies. The other article you cite, to prove Sandy Hook tweets and webpages were sent before the actual shooting, misrepresents the timezones the articles and tweets are being viewed as. Those tweets weren&#39;t sent before the event, the screencaps just show the tweet in a different timezone. Another lie you publish as fact. </p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>There were contradictory reports about the weapons</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Media reports are always changing and evolving. You can&#39;t just claim this as proof. People like talking out of their ass to the media. Reporters rushing to break news before anyone else reports that information. </p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Adam Lanza cannot have done the shooting</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Ah yes, the tired old &quot;nerd can&#39;t carry guns&quot; claim. Have you ever held a rifle before? They don&#39;t weigh 100 pounds you know. And the ammunition he was carrying would not have added as much weight as you falsely claim. </p>

<p>As for his marksmanship, he was shooting at kids from between 2-20 feet. You don&#39;t need to be an expert marksman to make those shots. </p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Key participants displayed inappropriate behavior</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Adrenaline, shock. I&#39;ve seen people laughing and having a good time right after their family members died. Do you have the qualifications necessary to deem their behavior &quot;inappropriate?&quot; Can I see your psychology degree showing you are qualified to make such claims? </p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Photos at scene and of victims look staged or fake</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;My own cognitive bias makes me think these photos look staged.&quot; </p>

<p>I see no proof of photoshopping in any of the pics you mention and I have been working in photography for over 10 years. </p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The crime scene was completely destroyed</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>If it wasn&#39;t destroyed, you think what, the town would let a bunch of conspiracy theorists in at any time to &quot;inspect&quot; the old crime scene?</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Deceased children sang at the Super Bowl</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>This is one of the most laughable claims I&#39;ve ever seen about Sandy Hook. Tons of kids look similar, the video relies on cognitive bias to fill in the blanks. While some basic facial features like noses look similar they are clearly different people. Can you even explain why the government would be smart enough to orchestrate such a massive conspiracy, with tens of thousands of participants, and then be dumb enough to risk blowing the cover by parading dead kids on national TV? </p>

<p>This particular post is not an outlier: I frequently see similar articles posted on your site which rely heavy on cognitive biases and faulty logic to arrive at the conclusions you use to further your agenda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find both Haslam and Baker&#39;s work to be fascinating. I am presently working with a colleague on an edited volume for TrineDay (the publisher of their works), which we hope will be published in 2016. The book will feature chapters by several notable scholars and journalists addressing the topic of false flags.</p>

<p>At the same time a notable JFK assassination researcher remarked to me that none of the people they&#39;ve ever interviewed concerning Oswald had ever heard of Baker or recollect her from 1963.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a physicist so I am not inclined to chime in on Wood or specifically how the World Trade Center was demolished. The topic (and not necessarily Wood) serves as a tremendous source of divisiveness in the 9/11 Truth community which is unfortunate. It&#39;s safe to conclude that the event was pulled off with the probable active involvement of the US government and Western intelligence community. Thus far, it&#39;s the crime of the century, the basis for the phony &quot;war on terror&quot; (war of terror), and the bread and butter of the military-academic-intelligence-media complex. </p>

<p>But slowly and constantly plant the idea that assault rifles are bad (but pay no attention to the tanks your local SWAT has - that&#39;s for <em>their protection</em>), and you&#39;ll get what you want.</p>
