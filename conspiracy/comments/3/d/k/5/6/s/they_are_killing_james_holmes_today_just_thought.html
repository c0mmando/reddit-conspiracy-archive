    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s worth mentioning, the Police Chief of Aurora, Colorado during the Aurora Theater Massacre, Dan Oates, is presently the Police Chief of <strong>Miami Beach, Florida</strong>.</p>

<p>This story just broke a few days ago:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/3cu7jv/florida_cops_laundered_millions_for_drug_cartels/">[Miami] Florida Cops Laundered Millions For Drug Cartels, Failed To Make A Single Arrest: &quot;After laundering the cash, police would skim a three percent commission fee, ultimately generating $2.4 million for themselves.&quot;</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And I think we&#39;re savvy enough here to understand the US&#39;s role in drug trafficking:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/US+Coast+Guard/@25.8139542,-80.1443065,12z/data=!4m5!1m2!2m1!1scoast+guard+miami+beach!3m1!1s0x88d9b458d25048a3:0x9e12ba9315436476">US Coast Guard port, Miami Beach</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Nice little criminal operation there.</p>

<p>And by an <em>amazing</em> coincidence, he was also the Intelligence Chief of NYC <em>just prior</em> to 9/11:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3byjpq/exploring_the_career_of_miami_beach_police_chief/">Exploring the career of Miami Beach Police Chief, Dan Oates -- formerly Aurora Police Chief during the Aurora Massacre <strong>and</strong> NYPD Intelligence Chief just prior to 9/11</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I would advise viewing the police account of events in this case with a high degree of skepticism.</p>

</ul>

<hr/>

<p>Although James Holmes is the sole suspect in the Aurora shooting, currently on trial, initial reports spoke of multiple shooters:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://willyloman.wordpress.com/2012/08/06/aurora-massacre-abc-reports-multiple-shooters/">Aurora Massacre: ABC Reports Multiple Shooters</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Throughout the investigation, there has been speculation that James Holmes either had assistance or was entirely framed. This speculation is bolstered by the presence of a second gasmask:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://willyloman.wordpress.com/2013/01/08/american-gladio-second-gas-mask-becomes-huge-issue-in-new-aurora-narrative/">American Gladio: Second Gas Mask Becomes Huge Issue in New Aurora Narrative</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Witness Corbin Dates told Hardball with Chris Matthews that there was a second shooter, <strong>a man with a goatee</strong> (Holmes did not have a goatee), who was lingering near the emergency exit.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/D4Gv3PGtsHg">Corbin Dates appears on Hardball to describe &quot;Man with Goatee&quot; - Possible Accomplice </a></li>
</ul>

<p>A &quot;man with a goatee&quot;. A goatee. Like Alex Milano, a noted gun-control advocate, who just happened to be present at the shooting and coincidentally interviewed on local news:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHVQOMxzrqI&amp;amp;t=1m10s">Aurora Theater Shooting Eyewitness Alex Milano Interview</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Alex Milano appeared in the gun control advocacy movie, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_3MFZYni6Y&amp;amp;t=9m5s"><em>Bowling for Columbine</em>, as &quot;DJ&quot;</a>, although <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0310793/fullcredits">he&#39;s been scrubbed from the IMDB credits</a> for some reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to his LinkedIn profile, James Holmes’ father, Dr. Robert Holmes, who received a PhD in Statistics in 1981 from the University of California at Berkeley, worked for San Diego-based HNC Software, Inc. from 2000 to 2002. HNC, known as a “neural network” company, and DARPA, beginning in 1998, have worked on developing “cortronic neural networks,” which would allow machines to interpret aural and visual stimuli to think like humans.</p>

<p>The cortronic concept was developed by HNC Software’s chief scientist and co-founder, Robert Hecht-Nielsen. HNC merged with the Minneapolis-based Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO), a computer analysis and decision-making company. Robert Holmes continues to work at FICO.</p>

<p>Robert Holmes brief bio at linked in states the following: “My educational background is in Mathematics and Statistics. My experience over the last 10 years at HNC and FICO has been in developing predictive models for financial services; credit &amp; fraud risk models, first and third party application fraud models and internet/online banking fraud models.”</p>

<p>Management Experience: I am currently managing a team building Falcon Fraud Manager Credit card fraud models. I have also managed teams in the Telco and Identity Theft fraud areas.”
How interesting and coincidental is it that in the film The Dark Knight Rises Bane gets his hands on Software that is used to expose the fraud in Wall Street and literally guts the rich?</p>

<p>Robert Holmes is said to have developed computer algorithms that demonstrate predictive models for financial services; credit and fraud risk models, first and third party application fraud models and internet/online banking fraud models.</p>

<p>It is just too coincidental to not be eerily synchronistic. This software has been said to be able trace the Trillions of Dollars that have just vaporized into thin air. All of the spending in theory could be traced to the exact bank accounts of the elite thugs who have stolen it.</p>

<p>Now these Software insiders who may have information to nail corrupt officials have always wound up being fingered by intelligence agencies and many have died mysteriously.</p>

<p>Several years ago a system of software was developed called PROMIS, by a company called INSLAW. This was criminal tracking software that was used by the Defense Dept. and other agencies after they stole it from the maker and forced him into Bankruptcy and Jail, where he remains today.</p>

<p>Danny Cassalero was murdered investigating this case shortly after he came up with an “Octopus” conspiracy theory of how things operated in the highest circles. This software has been slightly modified by the CIA and secretly “slipped” into banking software that was exported out of our country for use by foreign and offshore banks.</p>

<p>The software was modified to track banking transactions instead and the information about the flow of finances throughout the world was now being monitored by the CIA or at least a few agents who wanted to find out where the money was going.</p>

<p>After this rogue CIA group got a hold of the information they then photocopied it and had it hand delivered to each particular congressman, senator or politician along with a note explaining to them that they no longer had their bribe fund and they had 24 hours to turn in their resignation or face public scandal, humiliation and possible criminal charges if they refused.</p>

<p>Just prior to the shooting in Aurora Colorado, where James Holmes the son of Robert Holmes the software developer allegedly killed 12 and injured over 50 others a scandalous report was issued in the United kingdom about the LIBOR scandal where it has been discovered that much of the wealth held by the so called 99 percent is being held in offshore accounts far away from the taxman and that there is software that is now being used to track and expose those who are abusing the system.</p>

<p>Makes you wonder if this is part of the PROMIS/INSLAW software or a modified version that is far more accurate and that the future is the exposure of criminal activity that would send the world into global civil unrest. Could it be that Robert Holmes was involved with the creation of such software models and that his son was programmed to kill in order to create a distraction from the fraud scandal that would rock the world?</p>

<p>According to Salon.com Mitt Romney arrived in London July 24th, 2012. He will be attending the the Olympic Games and hold fundraisers, including two with bankers and lobbyists involved in the expanding Libor rate-fixing scandal. London-based bank Barclays paid a $450 million fine earlier this month for manipulating the Libor, a rate that determines trillions of dollars of loans around the globe.</p>

<p>The company’s ex-CEO resigned both his post at the company and his hosting duties of a Romney fundraiser, but Barclays lobbyist Patrick Durkin remains a co-chair of the Romney fundraisers, and there are others with ties to the scandal as well. Some involved in the scandal could face jail time in the future.</p>

<p>Once again the chilling Predictive programming does not escape those who are watching the movie “The Dark Knight Rises.” Bane the leader of the fictional anarchist mob decides to plant bombs in the Gotham Underground. The final target is a stadium where the Mayor of Gotham attends a sports event. A young boy sings the national anthem that eerily sounds as if it is sung with a British accent. Bane pauses to listen to the distinct voice. He then says “Let the Games begin.” The stadium is then bombed and the mayor is killed as his reserved viewing box is bombed.</p>

<p>Is this a strange revelation of the method where the scene in the movie is supposed to be some pretext for what may happen at the London Olympics? According to a blurb posted on Media Monarchy a scenario has already been put forward demonstrating that the motive of any attack on the 2012 Olympics would be to cover up the LIBOR scandal and destroy all the bank records. An attack on the Olympics would be a quick fix to exit the elite’s present dilemma.</p>

<p>According to Media Monarchy a retired general sent a chilling memo to Author Steve Quayle connecting the attacks in Cinema number 9 at the Century 16 theaters in Aurora to the LIBOR scandal, Robert Holmes software exposing the elites and how their quick fix would be the bombing of the London Olympics.</p>

<p>The general says that the attacks would be the impetus for the construction of the “New Jerusalem”:
“London Olympic Opening Ceremony Artistic Director Danny Boyle labeled the ceremony a reflection of “our green and pleasant land”—a reference to the song ‘Jerusalem’ —-famously sung in the movies Chariots of Fire and also sung at Prince William’s wedding. The song uses the words of William Blake’s poem, which suggests the new Jerusalem would be in England….”</p>

<p>Why? For &quot;the masses&quot; it was just a freak who killed some people. Stuff like that happens almost everyday and I don&#39;t think anyone is &quot;controlled&quot; by this.</p>

<p>Also this stuff about this mysterious software sounds <em>really</em> far fetched. In order to find all the hidden money it needs access to all banking informations of all accounts. And if the bank does not provide access to this data then the software is helpless. It can not magically hack into any bank server and get the data on its own.</p>

<p>I ackknowledge that there is a lot of shady stuff going on in the world but in this specific example it really feels like the conspiracy theorists are try way to hard to find a good story.</p>

<p>an excerpt:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>. A dear and highly-respected friend of mine recently told me about her chemtrail concerns.</p>

<p>Wow, I&#39;ve had something like that occurring for a while now. <strong>Been seeing an old friend go down the rabbit hole in regards to &quot;the secret powers who control our lives&quot;, and at this point he&#39;s really become quite the drag to talk to - in fact, apparently his wife has asked him to shut up about his obsession when in larger groups of people, as he really tends to suck the life out any spirited discussion.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>But this past weekend, he went further out while the two of us were BBQ&#39;ing in the back yard, and started talking about chemtrails.</strong> Normally, out of friendship, I half-listen to his gloom and doom, making a counterpoint now and again. But after hearing him start talking about chemtrails, I couldn&#39;t help but inform him he was talking a whole crock of sh**. <strong>I asked him to think of it this way - he&#39;s thinking about moving into a five-story apartment building, and the chemtrail people occupy the topmost apartment. The basement apartment is occupied by the Sandy Hook Twoofers.</strong> </p>

<p>Although he did backtrack to safer conversational ground, I doubt he&#39;s dropped the chemtrails crunk altogether. I did ask him, for the sake of friendship, to please research the subject further by reading up on chemtrail debunking, and yes, I did mention Metabunk as a possible source.</p>

Sorcha Faal, according to the majority of ATS regulars, is a notorious disinformation agent, along the same lines as using beforeitsnews.com as a source. The speculation about Robert Holmes being a key witness in the LIBOR scandal, and the links between the LIBOR scandal and the Aurora shootings, are coming from Faal as the original source. The fact that Faal&#39;s article is making the rounds around the blogosphere is scary. It&#39;s important to note that this Robert Holmes-LIBOR information has not been verified by anyone credible. This is the kind of disinfo that is very dangerous if it&#39;s not verified. </p>

You can take some known events, 9/11, Sandy Hook, Ukraine, or whatever you&#39;ve figured out and feel very confident about..

</blockquote>

<p>This is bad history. </p>

<p>A lot of people knew about it, but the US government suppressed some information about it and did not let in refugees. A decent amount of political figures did want to go to war because of this but needed the public&#39;s support. </p>

<p>Their allies were under attack by Germany who had broken their post WW1agreements and was taking over all of europe.</p>

<p>Then the US was attacked by Japan, which provided a pretty good reason to get involved on both fronts.</p>

<p>There were more motivations as well, out of all of the wars the US has been involved in WW2 was probably one of the most justified.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to his LinkedIn profile, James Holmes’ father, Dr. Robert Holmes, who received a PhD in Statistics in 1981 from the University of California at Berkeley, worked for San Diego-based HNC Software, Inc. from 2000 to 2002. HNC, known as a “neural network” company, and DARPA, beginning in 1998, have worked on developing “cortronic neural networks,” which would allow machines to interpret aural and visual stimuli to think like humans.</p>

<p>The cortronic concept was developed by HNC Software’s chief scientist and co-founder, Robert Hecht-Nielsen. HNC merged with the Minneapolis-based Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO), a computer analysis and decision-making company. Robert Holmes continues to work at FICO.</p>

<p>Robert Holmes brief bio at linked in states the following: “My educational background is in Mathematics and Statistics. My experience over the last 10 years at HNC and FICO has been in developing predictive models for financial services; credit &amp; fraud risk models, first and third party application fraud models and internet/online banking fraud models.”</p>

<p>Management Experience: I am currently managing a team building Falcon Fraud Manager Credit card fraud models. I have also managed teams in the Telco and Identity Theft fraud areas.”
How interesting and coincidental is it that in the film The Dark Knight Rises Bane gets his hands on Software that is used to expose the fraud in Wall Street and literally guts the rich?</p>

<p>Robert Holmes is said to have developed computer algorithms that demonstrate predictive models for financial services; credit and fraud risk models, first and third party application fraud models and internet/online banking fraud models.</p>

<p>It is just too coincidental to not be eerily synchronistic. This software has been said to be able trace the Trillions of Dollars that have just vaporized into thin air. All of the spending in theory could be traced to the exact bank accounts of the elite thugs who have stolen it.</p>

<p>Now these Software insiders who may have information to nail corrupt officials have always wound up being fingered by intelligence agencies and many have died mysteriously.</p>

<p>Several years ago a system of software was developed called PROMIS, by a company called INSLAW. This was criminal tracking software that was used by the Defense Dept. and other agencies after they stole it from the maker and forced him into Bankruptcy and Jail, where he remains today.</p>

<p>Danny Cassalero was murdered investigating this case shortly after he came up with an “Octopus” conspiracy theory of how things operated in the highest circles. This software has been slightly modified by the CIA and secretly “slipped” into banking software that was exported out of our country for use by foreign and offshore banks.</p>

<p>The software was modified to track banking transactions instead and the information about the flow of finances throughout the world was now being monitored by the CIA or at least a few agents who wanted to find out where the money was going.</p>

<p>After this rogue CIA group got a hold of the information they then photocopied it and had it hand delivered to each particular congressman, senator or politician along with a note explaining to them that they no longer had their bribe fund and they had 24 hours to turn in their resignation or face public scandal, humiliation and possible criminal charges if they refused.</p>

<p>Just prior to the shooting in Aurora Colorado, where James Holmes the son of Robert Holmes the software developer allegedly killed 12 and injured over 50 others a scandalous report was issued in the United kingdom about the LIBOR scandal where it has been discovered that much of the wealth held by the so called 99 percent is being held in offshore accounts far away from the taxman and that there is software that is now being used to track and expose those who are abusing the system.</p>

<p>Makes you wonder if this is part of the PROMIS/INSLAW software or a modified version that is far more accurate and that the future is the exposure of criminal activity that would send the world into global civil unrest. Could it be that Robert Holmes was involved with the creation of such software models and that his son was programmed to kill in order to create a distraction from the fraud scandal that would rock the world?</p>

<p>According to Salon.com Mitt Romney arrived in London July 24th, 2012. He will be attending the the Olympic Games and hold fundraisers, including two with bankers and lobbyists involved in the expanding Libor rate-fixing scandal. London-based bank Barclays paid a $450 million fine earlier this month for manipulating the Libor, a rate that determines trillions of dollars of loans around the globe.</p>

<p>The company’s ex-CEO resigned both his post at the company and his hosting duties of a Romney fundraiser, but Barclays lobbyist Patrick Durkin remains a co-chair of the Romney fundraisers, and there are others with ties to the scandal as well. Some involved in the scandal could face jail time in the future.</p>

<p>Once again the chilling Predictive programming does not escape those who are watching the movie “The Dark Knight Rises.” Bane the leader of the fictional anarchist mob decides to plant bombs in the Gotham Underground. The final target is a stadium where the Mayor of Gotham attends a sports event. A young boy sings the national anthem that eerily sounds as if it is sung with a British accent. Bane pauses to listen to the distinct voice. He then says “Let the Games begin.” The stadium is then bombed and the mayor is killed as his reserved viewing box is bombed.</p>

<p>Is this a strange revelation of the method where the scene in the movie is supposed to be some pretext for what may happen at the London Olympics? According to a blurb posted on Media Monarchy a scenario has already been put forward demonstrating that the motive of any attack on the 2012 Olympics would be to cover up the LIBOR scandal and destroy all the bank records. An attack on the Olympics would be a quick fix to exit the elite’s present dilemma.</p>

<p>According to Media Monarchy a retired general sent a chilling memo to Author Steve Quayle connecting the attacks in Cinema number 9 at the Century 16 theaters in Aurora to the LIBOR scandal, Robert Holmes software exposing the elites and how their quick fix would be the bombing of the London Olympics.</p>

<p>The general says that the attacks would be the impetus for the construction of the “New Jerusalem”:
“London Olympic Opening Ceremony Artistic Director Danny Boyle labeled the ceremony a reflection of “our green and pleasant land”—a reference to the song ‘Jerusalem’ —-famously sung in the movies Chariots of Fire and also sung at Prince William’s wedding. The song uses the words of William Blake’s poem, which suggests the new Jerusalem would be in England….”</p>
