        Just this week, /u/davidreiss666 spoke out against an open reddit platform and against subreddits that he deemed hateful and was heavily downvoted for it after redditors went after him and exposed his past history as a biased and corrupt moderator of dozens of subreddits. The guy clearly has an agenda and it is why he removed the post from /r/bestof because he disagreed with everyone upvoting it.

       I like how this guy put r/KotakuInAction in the same category as CoonTown. Thats some real biased shit. He's probably a far left ("progressive") creep.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw that Whisper post earlier today on BestOf and it was seriously eye opening. It completely changed the way I think of censorship when it comes to bad words on TV, ignorant online comments, etc. The fact that such a profound post would be censored is 1) amazing irony, and 2) proof that people who consider themselves "progressive" and "liberal" are just as capable of being regressive and repressive creeps.

       is textbook subreddit cancer and should himself be put into the same category as coon town.  He was already shadowbanned once last year for manipulating/brigading but sucked enough admin dick to get his account back.

       I partly agree withou but  then  I think we need to be contructing a lot more monuments to our defeated British leaders from the revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       And south carolina needs to be hoistng the british flag over their state house because its our history.

      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think anything will change?   This mod will remain a mod and remain doing what he is doing with no censure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Way more then half the time I think these posts outing mods are simply lip service to make people believe something ANYTHING is being done to curb this bullshit when its simply business as usual.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has been proven that nothing changes unless the public outcry reaches every news organization in the world and reddit fears losing money.

       There's a simple work-around to this problem. Use (or create) another sub to post link from. Make the announcement here so everyone will know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's face it, this is the equivalent of shadowbanning an entire subreddit. So the solution is the same. Make an alt and keep right on going.

       " &amp;gt;? This isn't any change in policy: we've always banned hate speech, and we always will. It's not up for debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just watch me.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing you can do to stop me debating it is ban me, too. Then you can ban all the people who object to banning me. And so forth.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;gt;You can bitch and moan all you like, but me and my team aren't going to be responsible for encouraging behaviors that lead to hate.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's exactly what
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       doing to when you take it upon yourselves to allow this opinion and not that one.
      </p>
      <p>
       A man is only responsible for that which he controls. No control, no responsibility. You did not make him say what he said.
      </p>
      <p>
       You were not responsible for it. I say
       <em>
        were not
       </em>
       . Now you are. Because you took it upon yourself to arbitrate. To impose control. Now you have made yourselves responsible for anything that gets said here. Because you could have stopped it.
      </p>
      <p>
       We always want to compromise our principles when we stand to get hurt, or when we stand to profit, or when those principles protect something we find distasteful. But once you compromise a principle, it's not a principle any longer. It's window dressing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who wish to impose control on what others may think or say always have some excuse that sounds reasonable. They're protecting you from the racists. Or the communists. Or the captialist-imperialist warmongers. Or the pedophiles. Or the witches.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's always just that, an excuse. There's no actual danger that they wish to prevent. They simply wish to stop others from saying that which they find distasteful.
      </p>
      <p>
       For what is the real danger in allowing a man to say "nigger"? Is that word so persuasive that people are going to see things his way? Are small, narrow, petty ideologies really that much stronger than open, free, and progressive ones? Are all your users children, who cannot be trusted to reject dangerous and stupid ideas, who therefore can only be exposed to safe, pre-screened ones?
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, you're obviously a young person, and can therefore be excused for reacting emotionally rather than thinking, but you've made a serious mistake. People who subvert democratic processes, whether it's a political election or just the orange and blues arrows, always think they are doing the right thing. They always think they are serving the greater good.
      </p>
      <p>
       But they fail to see that their notion of what the greater good is is not privileged over anyone else's.
      </p>
      <p>
       You found what he said distasteful. Fine. Probably so would I.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there is an appropriate response to that.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have an account.

       When i was a mod of a medium sized subreddit that was exactly how I viewed it. Over time I decided we'd remove comments but I knew as soon as we did that we were essentially taking over responsibility for what was said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually, and it took a while, I started to remove comments that looked
       <em>
        to me
       </em>
       like consistent and concentrated POV-pushing. If i recognized a name and that person was consistently pushing an unpopular POV in the subreddit I'd ask him to go elsewhere. Then I'd just start quietly removing those comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure a lot of people would think that makes me literally Hitler but I saw it as being an editor. The subreddit had a direction that I wanted it to go and I could not do that without exterminating a few persistent and clever splinters in the plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       I eventually resigned because the admins irritated me too many times. However, the subreddit is still on track to where I would have liked it to go. My only regret is not putting it out explicitly so that people knew we were doing it.

       I am curious about these new "mod tools" and how much access reddit is going to give to our personal information.  For instance, if mods are able to ban by IP, does that mean they will have access to my IP address?
      </p>

       If I have a reddit account with PII, will they be able to link that to my alts by IP?  Do i need to use Tor just to criticize israel on this site?

      </p>
      <p>
       Free Speech rights don't extend to privately owned platforms. None of us has a right that exceeds the ownership prerogative of reddit's controlling interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       That results in ugly shit being done to users, of course. And I far from condone that. But there are other avenues we can use to address this. Calling it a violation of our 'rights' as American citizens makes resistance to the censorship sound petty, uninformed, and frankly childish.

       And that's exactly what those behind the censorship want: for our position to sound unreasonable.

       Posts in such subreddits do not, to my knowledge, ever get frontpaged or show up in places like
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       .  You're really not going to see any of that shit unless you willingly expose yourself to it.
      </p>

       On the other hand, I am vehemently anti-pornography.  You want to talk destructive?  Talk to an older person who has been a long-time consumer of porn and ask them how it has affected their personal relationships, marriages, and life.  And this website is flooded up to it's tits in porn; it is almost inescapable.  Do I complain about it or rally to shut down subs?  No.  I just don't click the porn links that show up on the frontpage or in
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       , or go to the porn subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't like a sub?  Don't go to that sub.  It's that simple.

       You're kidding right, just because you ignore a bad subreddit, its OK for it to be there? Also, hatred speech towards a certain race is very destructive, look at history.

       Sorry, but expressing hatred towards certain people is not the same as
       <em>
        inciting violence
       </em>
       towards said people.  People have a right to their own opinions and a right to like or dislike whomever the fuck they choose.

      <p>
       Cry all you want about "destructive" subreddits (as if it's somehow your call to determine which are "good" and which are "bad"), its still your own fault if you purposely visit them and get your feelers hurt.

       I'm tired of the whole issue. It seems the main people pushing for "free speech" on reddit are those who support hate speech. Limited hate speech protection is an unfortunate side effect of freedom of speech, not the main or only reason for it.

       He makes a good point regarding Reddit and becoming a forum for racism or white supremacy.  Rather, the media or Reddit competitors attaching that stigma to Reddit causing Reddit to lose money in the end.   It is a slippery slope but restricting racist hate speech seems logical.

       There is no such thing as free speech when it comes to boards such as reddit or any board for that matter. The servers are privately owned you are given permission to use the service per the T&amp;C. If a mod wished to delete all cat post because they hate cats, then they have the right to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       So again, the myth that you have free speech on a message board is just that. A myth. If you had your own subreddit and wished to delete post that would be your right. If that were so, then you would also be accused of stifling free speech.

       The lose of one mod doesn't mean that the next mod will be any different. Sure get one fired and the next one that comes in could be even worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes you are right about the mods not owning the subreddits, but they are charge of them and they are for the most part, allowed to remove post if they so choose so. Remember that reddit doesn't make the subreddits. It's the user base that makes them and unless reddit goes all gestapo and takes control of one, the mods edit post as the see fit.
      </p>
      <p>
       So are you willing to see reddit go gestapo and possibly be even worse?

       when people reference reddit free speech they dont refer to a legal right to it, but to a users privilege that has weight because without it, reddit wouldnt have become what it has.

       the power struggle is thus between management and the users. The users create the content and they do it under free speech rules since a bunch of years.

       There are people conflating the removal of racist, malignant content, with the censorship of free speech. I don't see banning racist content as a bad thing, and I think it is a separate issue from outside special interests vote brigading, and/or influencing moderation favorable to themselves. I think it's a mistake to conflate the two and make it into one issue of free speech and end up defending racists in the process.

       I think the problem is that some progressive liberals claim "that's rascist!" towards anything they don't necessarily like. So who gets to decide what's actually racist and what's not. Bc to liberals, if you even try to examine the black community to see where a problem might exist, that's rascist! So who gets to decide what's actually racist and what's not? It's a slippery slope when dealing with so called "hate speech".

       What bullshit, link to to anywhere that genuine discussion about problems that face the black community are met with cries of racism? No, what typically happens is some stormfronter posts "fbi statistics' (which have a number of faults to begin with) and concludes that 'black people are savages and inherently criminal, send them back to Africa' which is rightfully called out for the racist bullshit that it is.

       No one is being influenced to run off and join the KKK. It's downvoted and we move on. People who habitually spam, troll or destroy organic content and participation are the issue, not radical content. If people want to see it, they'll upvote, If not it ends up on the bottom. The primary issue is consolidation of subreddit power and meta brigades and reddit cross linking.

       People would be much more surprised by some of the NSFW subreddits that exist that are very distasteful to most people. But a lot of it has been there since the beginning, NSFW was one of the original subreddits. Now there are untold terabytes of content spanning years.
      </p>
      <p>
       DR666 also mods 143 subreddits. That's not a mistake, 143. That's quite a consolidation of power and trends with and obvious agenda.
