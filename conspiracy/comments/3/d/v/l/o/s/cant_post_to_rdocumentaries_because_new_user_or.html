       So what?  Yoav Shamir is a highly acclaimed documentarian.  Are they seriously saying that because you came from here that it is not a valid submission?  If someone posted "Grizzly Man" and came from
       <a href="/r/fuckingwithnature">
        /r/fuckingwithnature
       </a>
       , does that make it an invalid submission also?
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems to me like they are just making things up so that they can censor people.

       Yes, the mod was one known for censorship: diggdejected. But what can be done?

       Dude, this is normal for those of us that don't verify our accounts. There is really only one way that I know of to get past it and that's to post something that gains thousands in Karma. That's pretty much the value of Karma. If you post things (Link Karma) that do well then you are able to post more things until a mod says otherwise for their sub. It's supposed to reduce spam posts by requiring you to wait for the next submission. Multiple submissions of the same posts don't help you look like any less of a spammer. Also, coordinating with others to literally spam a post to a specific subreddit won't help your cause any either. All you can really do is be patient and attempt to post content that provokes discussion among Reddit's main user base without giving the mods any excuse to remove your submission.

       Oh?  When the admins actually enforce the concerted coordination to discredit this sub and attack individuals who post here, then I will give a shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The SRD/tard/topminds crowd literally do this and have been caught doing this.  What did the admins do about it?  That's right... nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rules for thee but not for me?  Sounds like it.  Rules like that should only be respected when they are equally enforced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, what about that documentary actually goes against the rules of it being posted?  It isn't hateful and is actually very informative and people would be better off having seen it.  So tell me, then, what is the harm in having it posted there regardless of the source?

       Okay, back up and take a breath. I'm not a mod or an admin. I'm not defending nor apologizing. I'm just letting you know how you may put yourself in a position to post without that annoying tag about submissions not doing well and verifying your account. I went through the same thing. For those of us that don't verify with an email, we will get this message often in an attempt to makes us want to verify our accounts. You don't have to, you just need a good post. Rules for us and them are obviously different. SRD/TMoR/Conspiritard, I don't care about them. However, for mods and admins, their enforcement is as subjective as they want it to be. We, the user base of r/conspiracy, are not looked on in good favor with the majority of these people. Spamming only makes it worse and gives them ammo to use against the sub as a whole even if it's just you and two other people. I've never seen the documentary, so I can't say what is so wrong with it. I'm willing to watch it, but as a fair warning: you would do better if you were not so combative/defensive when talking to users who are attempting to help. You have a cause you believe is worthy of discussion with facts and varying opinions; I can respect that. But there is a way to do it here and it's not by bitching about something that is normal, like not being able to post multiple times on a brand new account. That's the way it is. You can attempt to start a one user Reddit revolution if you want. I was just letting you know that with a little patience and at least one good post, you could be posting frequently.
