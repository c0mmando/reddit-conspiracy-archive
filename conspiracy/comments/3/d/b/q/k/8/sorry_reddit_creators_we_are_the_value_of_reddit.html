       This the problem. These idiots don't seem to understand that without the user base there is no reddit. The admins are not creators of content or maintainers of subs. They believe themselves to be responsible for the site's success and yet they are wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it wasn't for Digg falling (after missteps of its admins) reddit would never have risen to its current level.

       I think you're assuming that the majority of reddit is highly invested in the recent drama and care enough to leave. People have left and will continue to do so but it won't be noticeable. This site has gotten too big and the drama has been a great advertising opportunity for reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have been on reddit in the last 2 years, you'd notice the massive amount of free advertising reddit "gives away" (hit
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       and count how many photos have a brand name perfectly framed, how many TIL and AMA have some form of advertising, etc. How many times has reddit been a force of change, raising money and awareness for tons of various reasons). My thoughts are that Conde Nast wants to take full advantage of this and everyone at reddit wants a piece of the pie as well.

       I completely understand how PR groups are working in reddit (not with reddit) from shills, astroturfers, PR-reps. Apparently reddit itself has been unable to monetize off these groups, or if they do it's certainly not enough vis-a-vis recent changes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conde Nast has virtually no influence on reddit itself, the admins recently got funded through venture capitalists in 2014 raising $50 million (valuing the company at $500 million) and this is what brought the admin's attention. It became clear that after this reddit gained a new "business oriented" momentum.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the user base, we need to remember that 70% of page views are not from content creators or even active redditors, but lurkers, people arriving after trends, memes, AMAs. And if not for the content creators (and mods) there would be no trends, memes, basically no reddit. And these same "content creators" are the ones most vocal against the latest changes, and if they go, reddit dies.

       While not required, you are requested to use the NP domain of reddit when crossposting. This helps to protect both your account, and the accounts of other users, from administrative shadowbans. The NP domain can be accessed by prefacing your reddit link with np.reddit.com.

       You are certainly correct, but I feel we are missing a vital piece to this.

      <p>
       Sure, there was a
       <em>
        massive Digg exodus
       </em>
       , but if you were a proud Redditor at the time you probably didn't notice the preceding
       <em>
        Digg Trickle
       </em>
       that I posit occured.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you know what? Before the
       <em>
        Great Reddit Exodus
       </em>
       commences (which will incluse all the cat GIF and AMA
       <strong>
        consumers
       </strong>
       , there will be a
       <em>
        Reddit Trickle
       </em>
       , which will be
