      <p>
       I saw a post earlier about Libya being heaven before the revolution. I would like to expose some misleading "facts" in that post. Let's start from the beginning:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Libya had 0% interest on loans."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not due to the government itself. This is due to the population being 100% Muslim (after all the Jews fled to Italy fearing Gaddafi). Muslims don't do loans with interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Libya had free electricity."
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not 100% sure about this. But I certainly do remember 2 employees from the electric company asking us to pay. Whether it's a one-time payment or not, I don't remember.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Newlyweds recieved ~50,000$ and an apartment."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a straight out lie. I've had many aunts and uncles who got married a few years back and none of them recieved anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Education and Medical Treatments were free."
      </p>
      <p>
       True, but misleading. Education was equivalent to a 10-week pile of shit. Libyans have bad spelling in both English and Arabic. They learn the Alphabet in 4th grade, and even when they are in high school (like my cousin right now), they are still learning the basics of English (how to introduce yourself, comprehension, etc.). In university, they start learning grammar (pronouns, verbs, etc.). Even the universities themselves are corrupt. Employees usually demand bribes and people who have a popular relative get to enter medicine even if their grades are shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The medical care is shit as well. Even Libyans themselves don't trust their hospitals in anything more serious than a flu or a cold. They usually fly/drive to Tunisia for surgery and more serious problems. My grandma went into a hospital to treat a foggy eye, she came out completely blind.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Free farming land and tools."
      </p>
      <p>
       The farming land isn't really "free". It's just that the government doesn't impose taxes on lands. The lands are bought and sold between the civilians themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       And even the tax-free lands aren't a privilege. Libyans usually have lots of land but little salaries. If the government imposed a tax on lands the civilians would go bankrupt.
      </p>
      <p>
       The farming tools aren't free as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's your choice on how to deal with this post. If you want to stop my post from going to the hot page, then you are basically trying to propogate an idea and block the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: The post is talking about Libya before the revolution. I'm not talking about the Golden age for Libya which was at the 1980s. I'm talking about modern Libya, something between 2000-nowadays.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I am not saying that Libya is now better than it was under Gaddafi. I'm just exposing some lies.

       Exactly. Just because he's Libyan doesn't mean he doesn't have any bias himself. Check this out:

       My point is that Libya is far worse now.

      <p>
       You can't compare Libya to Singapore or the US.  But if compare Libya to its neighboring states with similar resources and access, it was doing pretty damn good.

       None of the neighboring states had what you would call "similar resources." Libya has one of the largest oil reserves with the oil having only 5% lead.

       that other post certainly sounded too nice to be true, on the other hand you don't provide proof of what you say.
      </p>
      <p>
       anyway, from your point of view, was Libya better under Gaddafi or is it in better hands now?
      </p>
      <p>
       also could you by any chance enlighten us on the Libyan "golden age"? what was it's causes? who did it affect? why did it decline? (I'm guessing western sanctions probably had something to do here, then again I might be mistaken)

       You can't prove it because of the way the media works. Talking about how the conditions really were in Libya isn't juicy. I know this because I am Libyan and I have lived in Libya for a while. Other than that, I can't empirically prove anything. The closest I can give to proof was this: If Gaddafi wasn't bad, then why did almost the whole country go against him?

       He's completely neglecting to inform us of the fact that Libya under the rule of citizen's councils in the east (Misrata, Benghazi, etc) versus the policies in Tripoli is vastly different due to the regional/tribal differences and the decentralized nature of government.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Eastern parts of Libya are controlled by backwards Salafists while the area of Tripoli was more secular and embraced Socialist policies.

       No. The oil didn't directly benefit the population. However, there is one interesting fact about the oil (since you brought it up).
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know that the U.S gets 51% of the oil that we dig up without actually paying anything? When they first discovered oil in our country and starting digging it up, they used to take 95% of the oil. The terms have changed after some years and they started taking 51% of the oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure how ALL the wealth went. But I know that at least some of it was taken as a bounty by rebels.

       I honestly don't need to see a picture.  I'll take you at your word.

      <p>
       It just seems that other people have doubts about your story.  I honestly think Libya was better off with Gaddafi because it was somewhat stable. With regime change there are always a class of people who benefit and a class of people who lose out.  I don't doubt that your family benefited from Gaddafi being murdered in the streets by Islamic rebels who sodomized him with the business end of an ak47, I do however doubt that the country as a whole benefited.

       My family didn't benefit from shit. We're immigrants, not militia members. You also seem to be under propoganda yourself. There is no "Islamist movement" in Libya. Every known Islamist group is unarmed and only seeks to give people advice.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, the ex-CIA agent Khalifa Haftar always talks about the imaginary Islamist rebels he is fighting (which are most probably civilian opposers of his regime) so he can establish Libya as a U.S puppet state and secure their oil interests.

       Somebody should post Moammar Gadhafi speech at the Arabic Council in which he openly called to attack Western nations who possessed WMD's.  I know he was only exposing our hypocrisy but you can't make speeches like that lol.

       That's not the one but I have seen that one as well. The one I am talking about the anti Israel rant to the Arabian council with Assad and  the Saudis in attendance where they both laughed at ghadaffi during his hitleresque speech where he also called to attack specific nations who possess WMD's.   Although I believe that call for an attack was said tongue in cheek.

       Nah not really derogatory, meant it more as very passionate and articulate but just a little bit of crazy. If you notice the elite don't really like military men as leaders of a country they always seem to fall eventually.

       Your argument is a fucking joke. Not only does it have no evidence whatsoever. It's flat out false.
