    <div class="md"><p>Absofuckinglutely. I started this sub to make people aware, please contribute <a href="/r/spacefraud">/r/spacefraud</a>.</p>

<p>Why? Because deception. Governments can control fools better. And they needed to siphon money into their pockets via NASA. Think about it, we have no way of independently verifying their claims, more so in 1960s than now. Now it is going to be increasingly difficult for them to keep fooling us because of advancement of technology hence they won&#39;t dare go to the moon in the near future and will blame it on funding. So elaborate.</p>

<p>They wont send another manned mission to the moon because they dont have to. Why risk human lives when a rover will do? There&#39;s a rover there right now. There&#39;s also 3 orbiters. </p>

<p>You&#39;re right. That&#39;s because getting yourself into orbit isn&#39;t something that most people are capable of doing. </p>

<p>A few others have though.... </p>

<p>Oh I see.  You just got done saying that he couldn&#39;t see them because he had a visor on - the &quot;sunglasses&quot; in your example.  But then it turns out he doesn&#39;t have his visor on so you change your tune.</p>

<p>No he wouldn&#39;t.  I can walk out of my brightly lit house right now and look up to see the stars in a matter of seconds.</p>

<p>Right, because looking at the stars would be of no interest to an astronaut whatsoever.  Its not like they navigate using them or anything.  </p>

<p>Its just a fact that you would see stars on the moon.  It wouldn&#39;t be difficult to do, and had astronauts been there they would be able to tell us in very precise detail under which conditions they could and could not be seen, this is because stars would be one of the priority things astronauts would want to study since among other things they navigate using them.  </p>

<p>But hey, don&#39;t take my word for it.  Here is Neil Degrasse Tyson explaining why you would see stars on the moon surface.  Starting around 17:15:    </p>

<p>Second? The way that light works, the way that camera exposure works has no bearing on if there&#39;s an atmosphere or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Air will cause distortion, yes. Something like a hot air/cold air/cold water inversion will cause all kinds of optical illusions and distortions (one of the reasons - they believe - that the Titanic didnt see the iceberg until it was too late). However the lack of air - taking pictures outside of the atmosphere - doesn&#39;t cause issues with the light photons striking the film.</p>

<p>Why you don&#39;t see stars in photos on the moon? Because they were not exposing for the stars - they were shooting in daylight and properly exposing the foreground. Atmosphere, or lack thereof, has nothing to do with the stars showing up. That is a simple, basic photography principal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you don&#39;t even see stars when they are shooting the moon... I personally think that saying &quot;what they chose to expose for&quot; is a simpllification.  </p>

<p>I looked and evaluated the Apollo 16 SS images, because you can see some stars in there.  Oddly, some stars go from points of light to rectangles from one shot to the next.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything from NASA, starting with their phallic rockets and space balls, is a hoax. The trajectories of their rocket launches are visible parabolas and thus wouldn&#39;t actually reach &#39;low earth-orbit&#39;, a place that does not exist. The higher in altitude we can reach, the lower the density of the air, and the less effective any jet propulsion system becomes. &#39;Low-earth orbit&#39; fantasy videos such as the ISS hoax are done with a combination of green-screens and &#39;zero-g&#39; parabolic flights. Outside shots of astronoughts in spacesuits are done inside of a swimming pool, with bubbles often visible. The Apollo missions were Stanley Kubrick&#39;s masterpiece, the culmination of his research into special effects in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Unfortunately the very best special effects of the 1960s and 1970s look ridiculous today, and NASA has gone to a lot of effort to prevent anyone from seeing original copies. The CGI planets that NASA releases nowadays as proof of their probes are merely proof that no one actually looks at evidence with their own judgment.</p>
