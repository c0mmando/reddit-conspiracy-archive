       Putin has figured out the empire’s vulnerabilities and he’s going straight for the
       <strong>
        jugular
       </strong>
       .  He’s saying: "We’re going to issue our own debt, we’re going to run our own system, we’re going to fund our own projects, and we’re going to do it all in our own currency. Kaboom. The only thing you’re going to be doing, is managing your own accelerating economic decline. Have a good day."
      </p>
      <p>
       Washington has essentially alienated the fastest growing countries in the world. Putin and the BRICS organisation want to connect continents with high-speed rail, lift living standards globally and transform themselves into manufacturing dynamos. And what do American leaders dream about? Drone warfare? Balancing the budget? Banning the confederate flag? Toppling democratically elected governments who refuse to bow down to American/European Imperialism? Fighting terroists in the backwaters of our planet? Funding and financing proxy wars then invading those very same countries under the false pretence of "democracy"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Listen up Fellas! The dollar is toast. The IMF is toast. The US debt market (US Treasuries) is toast.  The institutions that support US power are crumbling before our very eyes. The BRICS have had enough, scratch that,
       <em>
        THE WORLD HAS HAD ENOUGH
       </em>
       ; enough war, enough Wall Street, enough meddling and hypocrisy and austerity and lecturing. They're already amassing mass ground forces on the borders of Russia and confronting the Chinese Navy
       <strong>
        in international waters
       </strong>
       . Guys, this is it. It's over. This is farewell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enjoy the decline.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit; hey guys. I've noticed a lot of Putin hate here going. Remember how Gadaffi was touted as an evil repressive dictatorship? But look how Libya turned out, lol! Putin is not the evil man we think him to be, don't let the media dictate to you on who and what is bad. Gather the
       <strong>
        facts
       </strong>
       and then make your own respective conclusion on the matter. Here's what, I'll give everyone here a book titled The war on Putin which is 10$ on Amazon. If anyone wants my pdf version - which I bought - for free then here's the link;

       Fuck russia, fuck putin, I could care less what some asshole on the otherside of the planet wants to do, or what he thinks of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       All we need to do, is TAKE back what belongs to us.
      </p>
      <p>
       WE need to start setting the tempo around here, WE need to decide what debt we are willing to pay, and what we HAVE to pay.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let the dollar crash, learn from our mistakes, let the system burn, and build a new one. And when some one proposes privet banks, we tell them to fuck off.
      </p>
      <p>
       We let wallstreet hit the floor, big corporations will fall, who fucking cares, make new ones, with a new system, with new people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get rid of the "Elected officials" Hang them if you must. Make it known if you're going to play fuck around games, it won't fly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Revert to socialism, let it happen, then from the ashes, rebuild democracy if you MUST have it, but learn from our mistakes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fixing this all for our generation is not an option anymore, we have to fix it for our future children, like our fore fathers.

       It all depends on the concept by which the rest of the countries go by. 
The U.S. lives from the labor of others, while other have more or less some stuff to provide for themselves. But anyway, i think if the U.S. would have some1 like Putin, the U.S. would not be anything of what it is today. First and most important, Putin would never send his soldiers to die for corporate interests

       For anyone who thinks Putin or Xi is gonna be any better as a leader, wake up. This has been the plan all along. The United States IS the bad guy. They're bad guys too, but we have been cleverly positioned as the scapegoat in this WWIII scenario; which might not even have to happen, if Americans just "welcome their russian czar". The point of all these proxies is that the big dogs don't WANT to fight. They would rather bite the bullet, work together, and keep the rest of us nipping at their heels.

       Wrong! Putin is defying the new world order. He stopped the U.S and it's allies from bombing Syria back into the Stone Age. The west is
       <strong>
        solely
       </strong>
       responsible for the travesty in Libya. Also, the U.S would never ally itself with the Russians because the pentagon has already stated that for the world to be "safe", every country must be contained. ie conquered.
      </p>

       The war on Putin is a great read. It's only 10$ on Amazon. But if you want my pdf version - which I bought - for free then here's the link;

       Saudi Arabia is a vassal state that supplies the U.S with its vast oil reserves. In confessions of an economic hit man, it detailed the deal that was struck between the house of Saud (royal family) and the United States which was to build its cities and infrastructure (Dubai) and the guarantee to remain in power in their respective country.

       I live in Thailand and can confirm that new 'State of the Art' stations have been built, most of the tracks have been laid and all work is running ahead of schedule.  If this Thai/Laos connection to China is anything to go by then I'd imagine the Russian connection (it is already connected by a slow rail track) is well underway.  So, yup, this is an actual thing.

       Most certainly the conditionalities of their lending won't be as devestating as what the IMF &amp; World Bank have had attached to their lending.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most certainly may become a part of the destabalzation of the dollar. But shit, hasn't that been the point of forced globalism from the start? The death of the dollar is NECESSARY to enter the next stage, for the global structure to come up, unchallenged by the dollar.
      </p>
      <p>
       By no doubt, the dollar wrecking havoc across the world Does need to be stopped, but this isn't the answer. The Chinese 'elite' have connections with the same Western 'elite' that control the IMF, World Bank, Fed.

       BRICS appears as the East Asia Pacific counterpart to the Wests IMF, Don't play the Globalist game.

       At least the Russians didn't reduce Libya, a country which had more women attending university than men and providing free electricity to the catastrophic state that it is in right now. And all of this is thanks to the Western Coalition and its "democratic" institutions.

       I really do understand the anger with the United States.  What I don't understand is the idea that Russia is somehow better.  You pick apart the US at every chance you get, and then turn a blind eye to the very same, or worse, policies by Russia.

       You mean like pussy riot? How the media continuously lied about these "innocents" who were "protesting" by having sex in museums? By vandalising public and state property? And causing public outcry?

       Look, the Russian Federations crimes pale in comparison to what the U.S has done to Humanity. I'm not saying that Russia is a perfect country, by all means I disagree with many of Putins policies. But at least Putin doesn't force his ideals on other nations and build military bases literally in every continent on earth.

       Except in this case, there really are outside forces trying to subvert and destroy the state. There really are terrorist elements.

       Okay, I'm going to address your point. If a party feels they want to protest against their government for legitimate reasons, then they have
       <strong>
        EVERY
       </strong>
       right to voice them.
      </p>

       <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2015/06/24/putins-approval-ratings-hit-89-percent-the-highest-theyve-ever-been/">
        On a second point though, Putin approval rating is very high. Even higher than Western leaders.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       While I do understand your point, you come off as if everyone in Russia wants Putin gone. Even
       <strong>
        IF
       </strong>
       Putin did allow government dissenters to voice their opinion, it really wouldn't make that much of a difference. That's democracy right there for you my friend. The majority rules. I'm not saying what he's doing is right, just saying it wouldn't make that much of a difference.

       There is a difference between organic, home-brewed, revolution and the farce that you saw happen in Ukraine.  You can always find people that are unhappy in any country... the US and its friends in "security" foment these false revolutions to gain control of a given country's resources.  It is not about humanitarianism... it never has been.

       Of course gold will always work as a currency. Do you think you can't weigh things if the power is out..? Gold is incredibly pliable, you think we'd be unable to divide it with no power..? There are many ways to confirm gold's properties, one being with a simple magnifying glass.

       Look, everyone knows gold is great in the long term, but you tell me how you're going to bust off a 0.001 oz piece from a gold block and trade it with someone if you are hungry one night? Do you have a scale and enough counterweights for all of the denominations you will need? Will the person you're trading with be able to verify that? What about purity?
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that you can easily barter with gold in a situation so bad that we don't even have power is just not realistic.
People aren't going to give a shit about your shiny rock and what it might be worth in ten years when they can't even get food or water.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither gold or bitcoin is going to work well as a medium of exchange or store of value in that bad of a situation. But I think if there is power and people can access the network bitcoin works infinitely better for day to day situations than gold.

       Yeah, I'm not debating that metals don't work as currency. I'm just saying that in a true shit hits the fan scenario they are going to have their drawbacks, some which having bitcoin mitigates.

       It really depends on how things go down. If it's bad enough no one's going to care about bitcoin or metals, they are going to want things that can keep them alive for the rest of the day. Food, shelter, ammo/guns/weapons will be the number one resources.

       NONE of which BTC mitigates.  Unless it's in your hands, it's as good as worthless.  Of you're seeking to spend gold dust, you're probably not gonna have a good time.  Fiat in hand will beat BTC, even though both are fist.  95% of the world isn't using BTC.  That likely means 95% of the world won't be dealing in BTC.

       A huge portion of normal people don't use PMs either and the barriers to entry with BTC are a lot less.
Anyone with access to the internet can own BTC and control it 100%. If you own metals you need to be able to weigh them, secure them, divide them, test their quality etc. Not a lot of people can do that in an economic collapse situation. A lot of people can jump online and open a wallet.

       Hence carrying fiat, if you feel that will work better.  BTC has zero benefit or usefulness over its competing stores of wealth.  It has far too many downsides, the largest being IT HAS ZERO INHERENT VALUE.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to PMs, possing durable, tradeable goods is a great option to hedge your bets.  A few bytes on a blockchain, again, isn't going to do shit.

       This is not true at all. It would also require control of 51% of the nodes or greater in order to propegate the change without it being rejected. Maybe you're not familiar with the technology we're discussing? What max value are you talking about? There is no such thing in bitcoin. It sounds like you're just making stuff up now.

       I know BTC quite well.  Max value as in the preconfigured maximum (theoretical) number of coins that will be in existence ultimately.  21M is that currently configured maximum value.  As you stated, this can be changed easily on or after that number is approached.  With the instanely large amount of coins that it's "creator" still holds, outside of normal trade, this practically worthless fiat can far too easily be manipulated.
      </p>
      <p>
       During the bubble, much of which is still ongoing, the price it was trading for was ENTIRELY unrealistic for what it was worth.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I agree some benefits are there, this one is nowhere near worth wasting your life savings on.  It can be fun to dabble, but as an inherent long term store of wealth?  You will likely have a more successful time speculating on tulips or Beanie Babies.

      <p>
       Do you not science?  Au has a specific weight.  It also has a specific mass.  Mass displaces water.  Measure how much water is displaced you have mass.  You can calculate weight from mass.  Gold is also pliable and can be e.g. shaved or otherwise reduced into smaller amounts.  Last I checked, we still know how to make fire and can do crazy things like melt and shape gold. You do realize there were gold coins en masse during the e.g. Roman Empire, Shang Dynasty, etc

       unless you physically hold all your money in your house (which VERY few people if any do) then this argument can be used for any currency...  less than 5% of all money exists in physical form.   How is it a knock on bitcoin that instead of holding placeholders for banknotes you now hold placeholders for encrypted numbers?

       Its still being used mostly for jewelry. The major reason gold is valuable is because there is a large, mature, and modern, market in India (and china! heck, worldwide tbh, but still mostly for jewelry) buying gold to support their jewelry demand. In my current experience, Goldbugs (in terms of SHTF types, not commodity brokers) never seem to realize that when their scenario plays out (SHTF), their access to the gold market will be very limited. If we're both starving, and you were to offer me a 400OZT gold bar for my last loaf of bread, I'd be a fool to take it. I would not be able to trade it for anything useful in the foreseeable future.
      </p>
      <p>
       If, however, you were not positing the end of the world as we know it, and were instead hoping to transport your currency out of a failing economy, and you still maintained that there will be access to modern amenities while en route, then digital currencies are the smart bet. Bitcoin wallet on a secured/encrypted memory card going to be a lot more pleasant to keister than aforementioned 400OZT gold bar. Cross the border to somewhere sane, sell off bitcoins in local currency, eat that capital controls.

       Preach on brother! The only reason I can tell that BitCoin is so maligned in the conspiracy realm is due to it being an empowering technology. As a consequence, peer-to-peer and blockchain based technologies are dismissed in favor of regressive idealization of gold markets. Its like a modern romantic movement in conspiracy.

       It does. It upsets me how stupid white people are, believing mainstream media. And labeling Mike Brown a thug when none of the "white people's side of the story" held up. But their racial bias just wont penetrate their conscious. They'll believe whatever protects their white privilege.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like the video in the gas station of Brown shoving the clerk, it wasnt even the right date or time, lol. The multiple witnesses that said Brown was never a threat and that the cop was out of line - like the two white guys by their work vehicle yelling at the cop from across the street about the excessive force, and that Brown didn't do anything. All the evidence is on youtube.

       It solves nothing, it's just baby steps towards reprimanding Freedom of Speech. I don't give a shit about the Confederate flag, being white from MS, but my entire life I've never heard it associated with slavery or racism. I've always heard southern pride and opposition of Big Government. Now it's racist??? Because it was photoshopped into a "serial racist killer's" hands....... And people are blindly giving up their freedoms for protection (giving up a flag to protect themselves from racism, I know what a joke).
      </p>
      <p>
       Taking down that flag doesn't destroy a mindset. What's ironic is, our "leaders" are the real racists, while most Joe Shmoes aren't, but they're convincing us to become racist to keep us divided.

       I disagree with you on one part. I think most people are racist. It's natural. But it's possible to live together and work together for the betterment of humanity. TPTB don't want that, thats why they take advantage of these natural human tendencies

       In other words, things will be very different. You don't get it do you? China is out. India and Russia are out. The BRICS nations represent 2/5th of the human population. Not to mention that European countries including Australia/New Zealand are joining much to the chagrin and dismay of the U.S. Why do you think Obama enacted the "Pivot to Asia" Protocole?

       The U.S is losing strategic influence of Eurasia and due to this, we just might be in the cusp of World War 3. NATO is already positioning troops along Russian borders and enacting war games. Also, the U.S is aiming to bolster its fleet in Asia in accordance with the "Pivot to Asia" Protocol which will cause tension between the two superpowers.

       This is true what do you think is happening in Ukraine...behind closed doors you'll find the USA. Same with China we got soldiers in Japan, China. The USA is trying to close in on both and get as many foot holds as possible whether it be for war or the future prospect of war it's definitely not in the interest of the American people.

       My $.02 -- If anything it would not be replaced but rather there would be a handful of different "reserve" currencies representing various geopolitical realities all fulfilling this role, to some extent, within their spheres of influence.  Probably the Yuan, the Yen, maybe the Ruble: but definitely a sovereign fiat currency issued by a government with unlimited currency-creating capacity -- this rules out the Euro for the most part.

       Possible.  I don't see ANY chance the ruble will be a serious reserve currency, given Russia's horrible problems (with government, justice system, demographics, health, life-expectancy, ethnic strife, etc).

       Interesting; I haven't heard that one in a while.  But Japan has had stagnation for a couple of decades now, hasn't it ?  Is there even enough total value of the yen (money supply) to support the demand ?  M2 for US dollar is about $10 trillion, according to
       <a href="http://money.howstuffworks.com/how-much-money-is-in-the-world.htm">

       </a>

      <p>
       Edit: M2 for Yen is about $7 trillion by my calculations, so maybe there is enough.

       Well, that's not really a currency, it's a basket of currencies, probably with a large fraction being US dollars.  The fraction that is USD could shrink.

       I don't mind if the self-appointed rulers eat themselves alive
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the population realizes that the ruling class is superfluous we can make our own, more efficient, systems. I, personally, think a dissolution of the U.S. Federal government is the best thing that could possibly happen. Everyone gets al bent out of shape about it, but they don't see that it's just discarding an ancient shell that needs to be tossed like the carcass it is.

       You've got to read your brzezinski, but first read your Anthony C Sutton.
      </p>
      <p>
       The central banks have always funded the far east.  Here's a quote on Sutton according to Brzezinski:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        For impressive evidence of Western participation in the early phase of Soviet economic growth, see Antony C. Sutton's Western Technology and Soviet Economic Development: 1917–1930, which argues that 'Soviet economic development for 1917–1930 was essentially dependent on Western technological aid' (p.283), and that 'at least 95 per cent of the industrial structure received this assistance.'
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       A controlled BRICS was always part of the plan- it's the false east west dichotomy.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Sutton's next three major published books — Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution, Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler and Wall Street and FDR — detailed Wall Street's involvement in the Bolshevik Revolution (in order to destroy Russia as an economic competitor and turn it into "a captive market and a technical colony to be exploited by a few high-powered American financiers and the corporations under their control") as well as its decisive contributions to the rise of Adolf Hitler and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whose policies he assessed as being essentially the same, namely "corporate socialism" planned by the big corporations. Sutton concluded that this was all part of the economic power elites' "long-range program of nurturing collectivism" and fostering "corporate socialism" in order to ensure "monopoly acquisition of wealth", because it "would fade away if it were exposed to the activity of a free market".
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Sutton's magnum opus, of course, written over 30 years ago, was: 
America's Secret Establishment: An Introduction to the Order of Skull and Bones

       Delusional.  If  you're an investor, where better to put your money than in the USA, or US govt debt, or US dollar ?  What are you going to trust more ?  The stability, the govts, the justice systems of China ?  Of Russia ?  Of Brazil ?  Of India ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Investors everywhere vote with their feet, and the low interest rates on US govt debt show that they're voting to invest in USA.

       Ha! The U.S needs war to ensure the running of the empire. While Russia , China and BRICS a organisation want to cooperate and trade, the United States and its allies want to establish every country in the world as a vassal state. The U.S has 400+ bases in the world and that my friend is just fact. The United States and its allies are the true terroists of this world.

       I don't see it.  Russia is an authoritarian state, dependent on oil exports, with severe health and life-expectancy problems, ethnic strife from several provinces.  China bids fair to compete well with USA, but suffers from centralized control, which brings corruption and some inflexibility.  USA still has dominant or world-class industries in entertainment, software, finance, armaments, aerospace, education, energy, medicine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, USA has LOTS of problems.  Far too much military, too little investment in infrastructure, inequality, etc.

       I'm assuming most of you guys are young, probably in your 20s, maybe 30s, correct?  I'll be 65 in 2 years and then I'll retire and be on my merry way.  I guess if you're under 30, you'll be living in an interesting time.  You'll be seeing some strange things happening in the market.

       Boy, do you have a lot of reading up to catch up on. Interfered? You do realise the west literally overthrew the democratically elected Ukrainian government early this year then installed Poroshenko as a puppet president who literally ordered the ethnic cleansing of Russians in Donbas?
