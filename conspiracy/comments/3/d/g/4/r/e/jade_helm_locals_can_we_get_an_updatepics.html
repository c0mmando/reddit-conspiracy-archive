    <div class="md"><p>Utah resident here, the only thing I noticed was around 12:30AM this morning, a black chopper was flying rather low with a red/blue blinking light by where the door would be, and a bright white spotlight on the front.  I heard of no crimes in the area so I assumed it was part of the drill, especially since it is supposed to take place around that time each night/morning.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t have my phone on me at the time (I&#39;m not as &quot;connected&quot; as I once was, or the average citizen seems to be.  I just have an old slider phone that I often misplace) as I just ran out for a quick smoke, but I&#39;ll make sure to take it with me tonight.</p>

<p>I also drove by the National Guard during the day, but nothing seemed out of the ordinary.  All the vehicles were still there as far as I could tell.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll make a post if I notice anything alarming, complete with potato quality picture/video.</p>

<p>How? In scope and location, it&#39;s the <strong>first</strong> of it&#39;s kind. Have you even looked into what JH15 is? I see nothing wrong with people being worried about it, because I&#39;ve actually looked into it and so have others and with the shit going on in the world, it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if this is in preparation for something. I&#39;m not saying something will happen, I&#39;m saying people need to keep a close eye on it. People like you say, don&#39;t worry, nothing is going to happen, why even pay attention. This is a dangerous mentality. Do you lock your doors at night?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not like Jade Helm was ever a secret.  It was a publicly announced operation that has been known about for years.  There are over a dozen large military bases in Texas and thousands of members of the armed forces from Texas.</p>

<p>Regarding my media sources, it&#39;s funny because I always hear conspiracy types accusing other people of being &quot;closed minded&quot; when in reality they are the ones who disregard most media and only read closed loop systems with unreliable data.  For what it&#39;s worth, I actually don&#39;t have cable (haven&#39;t for years) and get my news from a variety of sources (probably what you would consider MSM, but again I read and don&#39;t watch TV).  I&#39;ve read about Jade Helm because I was curious to learn about it (why do you think I&#39;m posting on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>?) and every sign points to it being a totally normal operation.</p>

<p>I&#39;m interested in following radical right wing news and views, which is what prompted me to comment in the first place.  Every story it&#39;s the same fear that always turns out to be unfounded.  Don&#39;t forget your tinfoil hat!</p>

<p>Except that these types of operations aren&#39;t normal. Since when is bringing together every special forces branch in the military into one cross country drill normal? Never happened in the history of this country.</p>

<p>You say you&#39;ve read about Jade Helm, but if that were true then you would be worried like millions of other people are. 45% of Americans are afraid of their government and 19% are &quot;very concerned&quot; according to a <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/may_2015/voters_worry_military_exercises_may_lead_to_federal_control_of_states">Rasmussen poll</a>.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read all of your comments and I agree with you almost completely. Most of the conspiracy oriented reporting hasn&#39;t been able to even provide consistent information, which is funny when you consider they themselves often criticize mainstream media for inconsistent reporting. I read one article stating the operation involved a paltry 1,000 troops, which is less than I had in my unit in the military. 1,000 troops isn&#39;t enough to even contain a single city, but this operation is over multiple states. </p>

<p>And yeah, the government gona take our guns group is mostly retarded. It will never happen as forced seizure. If anything it will happen through laws.  For example california cannot acquire new model pistols because of bullshit reasoning. Within 10 years I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they revoke all currently approved handguns because they don&#39;t meet the new bullshit criteria. But this is just one state with its own interests in mind. I don&#39;t believe even 1/3 of states would be interested in these regulations.  The government won&#39;t take our guns away. And that&#39;s a certainty in my mind because there&#39;s no way they <em>could</em> take our guns away. Our military would be the first ones removing officials from office if they ever tried. The military, the only ones the federal government has control over, entirely supports responsible adults owning weapons. </p>

<p>This sub seems to barely comprehend that the military, at least the one I was a part of, swore to defend the constitution. That was honestly our greatest concern. I know 100% of the military who I worked with would sooner turn their weapons on the president if ever ordered to injure, or revoke the rights of, an American citizen who did nothing wrong. </p>
