       I developed a strong addiction to stimulant medication, Adderall in particular (prescribed 60mg/day), but that evolved into me buying and eating all Adderall I could get my hands on, smoking meth, and even ordering speed from overseas using the Silk Road. I didn't let on that I was doing that type of stuff but my behavior should have given it away. I went in as an anxious 18-year-old and  ended up going insane, losing all my friends, and being genuinely messed up on the drugs they gave me for 4+ years. The anti-depressants, anti-psychotics, this and that, etc, it all really screwed with me and I don't feel creative or anything like I did before they put me on all this junk. My therapist would just nod and tell me it'll all be fine, and the psychologist would keep writing prescriptions for whatever drug he thought I should be on. I eventually quit all the medication cold turkey. It was hard and the withdrawals were intense, but I'm much better off now. Normal even.

       I have seen a very similar video testimony from a devastated lady recently, i won't bother finding it because it was in fr but quite similar indeed, 10 years, and she was still hooked, the particular meds she was taking you can't cold turkey out of apparently, fucked up stuff, i'll never accept any meds of any kind, fuck this legal drugs noise

       The closest I came to pharma was being prescribed prozac because I hated public school. I'm so happy little 15 year old me knew enough to throw my pills down the sink.

       Ever seen the movie requiem for a dream? The old lady mixes her pills which.makes her psychotic, goes to the doctor and gets prescribed more medicine. She goes nuts and gets institutionalized where she gets.loaded up with drugs to the point of becoming a vegetable. And then she gets electroshock therapy.

       Happens all the time, especially in mental health. Not many people know that pharmaceutical reps go to our hospitals, and bribe doctors to push their meds. Doctors have incentive to push certain kinds of drugs.

       Know someone whose therapist had a doctor spouse who called in prescriptions she wasn't allowed to dispense. The side effects killed the patient. Still in litigation last I heard. So, yeah, probably a lot more common than people realize and doesn't seem like law enforcement gives a rat's ass (all suits are civil). Props to anyone who goes to the trouble and expense of suing because at least that's SOME deterrent for the criminality and irresponsibility.

       Man I went to a mental facility because I was homeless for a while. I was not crazy, but according to them I was. I decided to go with it so I could have 3 meals a day and a place to sleep. It was a fucking nightmare. They put me on 5-6 medications at once. I felt like all my organs were going to come out of my skin. It was a bad time. They gave me something that knocked me out for 2 days straight. I felt so fucked up after that. I told the doctor to get me off the stuff. It wasn't helping and he was sitting there texting on his phone the whole time. I threw my chair across the office and was screaming at them to let me out. I finally got out of there and threw all the medication away. That place was evil. They put us in the same area as the drug addicts. Fuck pills.
