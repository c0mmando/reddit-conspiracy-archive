       For example, we could include information pertaining to 9/11, the federal reserve, wealth distribution, GMOs, vaccines, the NWO, extraterrestrials, you name it! Only strong supporting evidence will be included, perhaps chosen by an agreed-upon percentage of readers here (80%? 90%?), determined by a yea or nay in the comments, ideally with a reasoning behind their choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like compiling such information and making it easily-accessible to new readers and veterans alike will foster a better informed community that will in turn generate more valuable discussions. And as an added bonus it will allow us to easily shut down shill arguments from the get-go with factual and thorough rebuttals. What do you guys think?
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S. For those voaters out there, I submitted a near identical post earlier on v/conspiracy with a different username and since it received a good response, I felt compelled to make this post here in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       to see if y'all might enjoy this feature too.

       The problem with doing this is that the information available to us is constantly changing due to new discoveries, changing narratives, and deletions of inflammatory content. Think about what the shills will say when we all start referring to one source for our facts. I believe they'd call it our "Bible," and to be honest, we'd look very suspicious and questionable if we all started sourcing from one place. This is why shills can and do frequently convince people that a fact is not a fact solely because it was posted on an independent website. Also, not everyone will agree with even the factual information because confirmation bias is a hell of a thing, so voting on which facts we will accept and include for topics ends up introducing bias and disagreement into the mix. Unfortunately, people have to suss out the truth for themselves through time-intensive research and discussion...it's simply a part of the process to seeking truth and "enlightenment." It's a personal journey, and it's not one that many can or should be led down. They must choose to seek it first. It takes time. Meanwhile, we
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       send people to places like
       <a href="/r/moosearchive">
        /r/moosearchive
       </a>
       . This place requires sifting through loads of information (ctrl-F is a friend here) but if one
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       wants an easily-accessible aggregation of facts about conspiracies, one can start there.
      </p>
      <p>
       "All the world's a stage," Shakespeare reminds us. If we, as the truth knowers we claim to be, present the world as we know it like a play where we've placed all the set pieces, props, and actors (in all their costumes combined) on stage at once, told the actors to recite all their lines at once, conducted the orchestra to play all of the overtures from the scenes at once...all of this solely because we believe our audience will never stick around to enjoy a much longer, more paced and logical play, we will find that the cacophony we've created drowns out the hall and drives away any who might have been interested in the original play. It also hides any truth in itself because the show has become a ridiculous, babbling mess of formerly-epic lines that are now buried under the mass of monologues. What kind of play is understood when all of the pieces and parts are displayed to the audience at once?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: This does not mean I do not believe we should work on gathering some of the most compelling information we can find together and presenting it in an organized way. I do think that is what we are
       <em>
        already doing
       </em>
       as a community over time, though. Perhaps some of the most well-known users in this sub, who we only know of due to their time-proven consistency in posts and comments and who do possess much of the information regarding the bigger topics (like 9/11, geoengineering, GMOs, and vaccines, etc.) could collaborate on a sticky post that would provide a diving board for the uninitiated, like you requested. However, I still believe referencing this one source that
       <em>
        we would create
       </em>
       (through voting on
       <em>
        what we accept
       </em>
       ) will present a gift-wrapped fallacy that disbelievers could use to discredit the actual evidence and facts lying beneath the surface of the actual post.

       I totally get where you're coming from, but I think you may be giving more weight to the drawbacks of a general information sticky than it deserves. Yes, some people will disagree (as they will with literally anything) with what ultimately ends up on the official post, but I'm confident that the majority readers of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       are informed and open minded enough to allow for a central information hub to thrive, and in turn give back to the community. If there is a group of people who disagree with a user's submission, then they are free to voice their opinion and engage in a discussion with the OP and other commentators to try to get to the bottom of the issue. I can't imagine this process going terribly awry unless the sub is suddenly overrun with shills, in which case it would be better for us to simply migrate over to voat.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to your second point that everyone's journey is unique and it is up to the individual to become "enlightened," you are absolutely correct. However, nothing wrong with helping people speed along the process ;) They will read what they need to, when they need to, at least as far as I'm concerned! We'll just act as one of the many catalysts out there for becoming awake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your third argument is that shills could point to the thread and dismiss any of it's contents bases solely on the community that put it together. I'm sure that
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       happen, but that's an unavoidable issue so long as you are posting "radical" information on a popular website. However, if you just link directly to a specific source that is listed on the thread, I doubt anyone will call you out for being a conspiracy theorist (like that's such a bad thing).
      </p>
      <p>
       If some of the main content creators / mods here are working on something like this, then awesome! I haven't been a part of this community for more than a month or so but I feel like this is a feature we sorely need. The specifics are of course up for debate, but I really feel like we should make this a subreddit priority.

       I've only been here a little over a month, as well, and my view differs from yours. I believe we, as a community of over 300,000 are already doing exactly what you stated you would like to see in your post, without the mass gathering together of it all and posting it all in one place. Yet, I would argue that we are
       <em>
        even doing that
       </em>
       , so let me put this in another light.
       <em>
        Reddit is the medium of information and
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        is the central information hub you seek
       </em>
       . We are already...
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         ...voting on each topic that appears in this subreddit by using the upvote and downvote feature. This determines the post's relevancy and popularity in today's environment to all those that see it. Granted, there are plenty of decent, valid posts that get downvoted every day by people who disagree or who desperately do not wish the post and its information to be seen. These posts die unjustly before they can be properly evaluated. This is canon with your statement,
        </p>
        <blockquote>

       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Let me ask you this: do you believe we are not already agreeing and disagreeing on every post that appears in the feed here in this subreddit? Do you believe we are not already attempting to, in so doing, give back to the community a logical and sensible debate that produces truth? Also, how do you propose, we, from all walks of life, come to an 80-90% consensus on
       <em>
        any one topic
       </em>
       in order to cement it into a sticky thread of which would probably detail hundreds of topics that will be laid out for the masses, when we are basically already trying to do that in our daily posts? I'm sure you're not the first to ask for something centralized like this, which, I believe, is probably why
       <a href="/r/moosearchive">
        /r/moosearchive
       </a>
       was created in the first place. Please go there and let me know how you believe we could attempt to consolidate
       <em>
        all of that information even more than it already is
       </em>
       and fashion it into an easily understood sticky post for newcomers and for reference. It is unknown if any of those thousands of links are inaccessible by now, so even if we started at
       <a href="/r/moosearchive">
        /r/moosearchive
       </a>
       and curated as we go, my inquiry still stands. Now, to continue, we are also already...
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        ...commenting on the validity of the topic in the comments section, all of which get upvoted or downvoted based on applicability and validity, and some of which get commented on and replied to based on the information held within the original comment. Yes, I know some people misuse the voting system to push a narrative and write absolutely irrelevant retorts filled with logical fallacies, but again, this fact then destroys the very idea that voting "as a community" on a general sticky thread will produce
        <em>
         any better results
        </em>
        than what we are already doing.
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         ...debating amongst our peers, including the shills, on each individual post to determine what is truly important among the vast mountains of knowledge documented in this subreddit. This addresses your statement,
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          If there is a group of people who disagree with a user's submission, then they are free to voice their opinion and engage in a discussion with the OP and other commentators to try to get to the bottom of the issue.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         If anything, centralizing all this information will make it harder for diverse content to come to the forefront and actually make it easier and more alluring to shills who wish to paint the sub as insane because we are declaring
         <em>
          one narrative
         </em>
         to be true.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I tend to think of information and knowledge as the currency of the Internet. Reddit is just one stock exchange, as Buzzfeed, Facebook, Twitter, Voat, etc. are all their own stock exchanges in that sense. If we centralize our wealth of knowledge, anyone who doesn't "buy in" to the central sticky thread's narrative will be ridiculed and thus, not be able to participate in the system of knowledge distribution due to community pressure. This is similar to what Ellen Pao did to Reddit by trying to make sure the only narrative seen and heard by users was one approved by her and entrusted to those in charge of the distribution of knowledge. Those who did not agree were ridiculed by the shills and sheep alike, their comments deleted, and their accounts shadowbanned or site-wide banned. This centralizing of information here on this subreddit would hopefully and most likely not produce a similar effect because, like you said, the community members here are fairly discerning and can usually think for themselves. If we use
       <a href="/r/moosearchive">
        /r/moosearchive
       </a>
       as an example, its seemingly fathomless and truthful nature by default, doesn't end up allowing a debate on any one topic in those threads. Even if a user comments in those posts (of which, there are only 4 from the past two years), that comment will end up at the bottom, and most likely not be seen except by a few.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall, I agree that helping people along the way to finding truth is admirable. However, forcing them along by attempting to neatly wrap up all that this subreddit does in its daily dissemination of critical voices, thoughts, and articles, isn't all that possible, in my view. If it were successful, it would also be successful at shutting out critical thinking. This sub represents and covers too many topics and too much history to just whittle it down to one set of narratives. That aims to create what I personally would consider to be a religion of conspiracy theories, where belief overrides fact.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Finally, I urge you to look around you and understand that this subreddit already has plenty of shills, yet many people are still here. What I've witnessed is that those voices who truly care about what this subreddit is will fight daily to ensure that the truth gets out, even over the extremely vocal and highly insulting voices. This isn't going to be aided by any sticky post that I can even imagine. Some of these conspiracies are just too damn big to be explained in one fell swoop.

       We all know it's needed! We do not see enough compiled evidence; everyone who does so properly will be washed away by comics, clickbait, circlejerk-articles and videos within 48h. And there have been many very high quality self posts, yet they remain hidden in a pile of less important matters.

       Have seen many discussions about this and even tried to start one myself. And I've seen nothing but distrust and derision in response. Hope this discussion can be productive.
