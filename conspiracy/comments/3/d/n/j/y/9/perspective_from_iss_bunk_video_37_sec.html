    <div class="md"><p>oh yes, it&#39;s supposedly an oblate sphere, and supposedly more pear shaped..... which is even more bizarre.  The earth would not have been distorted by that window, that&#39;s ridiculous.  The fact that there are multiple smaller windows that would each have different distortion shows that this is not the case.  They line up perfectly with a sphere.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No the shape of the wibdow itself is round. So it might appear that you are seeing the whole earth, but its misleading. Only a section of the earth is being shown. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m following your point correctly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what I mean, is that distortion comes from a curved window, not from a circular shaped window, it would need to be convex or concave to distort the view.  I also propose that the ISS windows are flat, because this would be structurally more secure.  Assumption here, but I would definitely like to find out the shape of this window - 3d shape, not 2d.  I personally believe that this window shows the majority of the Earth - but is faked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to disagree there. Clearly it was not meant to show the whole of the earth... because in the begining of your video you showed the top view of the ISS yet the globe earth wasn&#39;t visible there. I believe they are faking these videos, but they are careful not to make it too obvious....</p>

<p>Anyway, good luck. Expose these mofos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>why would they have a wide angle lens in front of a small window?  That&#39;s a ridiculous assumption.

    <div class="md"><p>A circle is a circle if you look straight on no matter what kind of lense you use. These are not opinions but known optical facts... A wide angle lense would be used in front of a small window like that in order to fit everything inside the image. If you used a lense that was not wide angle at the same distance as the one you show then you would not see &quot;globe&quot; earth and you probably wouldn&#39;t see all the windows either. Here is a shot from a camera that isnt using a wide angle lense and that is farther back from the window as well.. <a href="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2013/06/issphotospot.jpg">http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2013/06/issphotospot.jpg</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>what point are you trying to make?  That shows a full circle, and I am making the point that NASA fakes images.  Even with a wide angled lens, it would not show up as a circle at that altitude.  They are too close to the Earth, for it to look so far away.  The lens does not excuse this.  It&#39;s 400 KM close to a 6500 KM object, and it looks VERY far away.  Get over your lens argument....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I cannot get over my lens argument because I am right! If you look at every picture I have posted from within the Cupola module WITHOUT a wide angle lens the Earth looks close and takes up all of the background. With a wide angle lens are able to see all of the Earth that is possible from that PERSPECTIVE. Which is why you don&#39;t see whole continents. If the Earth really did look &quot;far away&quot; then you would be able to easily distinguish continents which you CANNOT </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes the Earth is SLIGHTLY oblate and even pear shaped. First of all the Earth is oblate because of the Earth&#39;s spin and this makes sense because of centrifugal forces... Polar ice causes even more compression at the south pole giving it the shape of a sphere. Notice how I said SLIGHTLY. These things are measurable not observable. The differences are too small to see in a picture showing the whole globe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there is no slightly when talking a sphere and geometry.  It either is or is not.  And no, if it was slightly, they would not call it pear shaped.  I completely disagree with you, and you seem to think that your opinion is fact.  Stating it again is not going to change my opinion, just like you saying slightly you expect to change the laws and definition of geometry.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude just because I say slightly does not mean I am saying that it is not oblate or pear shaped. I even stated in my comment that the Earth is oblate and pear shaped then gave you the reasons why. What I say is fact. These are not opinions they have been proven. I say slightly because the shape is very slight and not observable only measurable. Of course the Earth is not a sphere it has mountains and canyons all over but when you look at a picture of the Earth you do not see these. Because they are very SLIGHT compared to the big image!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mr. u/jackphillips0 is absolutely correct, and you couldn&#39;t be more wrong.  You really fail to understand perspective and optics in this situation.  And you fight for your stupidity tooth and nail?</p>

<p>And then, you create a YouTube channel so you can fly your stupid-flag and let the whole world know?  Is that your given name, as the channel name?  Really?</p>

<p>&quot;Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt.&quot; </p>

<p>Wow...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For this shot they are using an extremely wide angle lense. If you noticed in the video you can see multiple other parts of the space station through the cupola module that you wouldn&#39;t be able to see if you aren&#39;t using a wide angle lense... Please before you assume shit like this at least know how cameras and optics work... I&#39;m only 17 and youre making me look like a genius</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you&#39;re only 17 and you make these assumptions like you know everything.  You wouldn&#39;t need a wide angled lens to show anything outside the window, because everything is within the inner 70 degree field of view.  Wide angle is for angles larger than that.... but go ahead and insult us some more, it will just show your maturity and intelligence level again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what point are you trying to make?  That shows a full circle, and I am making the point that NASA fakes images.  Even with a wide angled lens, it would not show up as a circle at that altitude.  They are too close to the Earth, for it to look so far away.  The lens does not excuse this.  It&#39;s 400 KM close to a 6500 KM object, and it looks VERY far away.  Get over your lens argument....</p>
