        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is going on for sometime now.</p>

<p>There are a lot of people out there who have no real &quot;power&quot; in the society, who believe one can&#39;t freely speak since the feeling of various particulars groups need to be protected.</p>

<p>The people with &quot;power&quot;, will promote and implement laws that appear to protect said groups but what they actually do is creating legal instruments to deal with dissidents, with people who are trying to rebel against the oppression.</p>

<p>The sad thing is that many so called intellectuals and activist that should be able to see through this crap will accept these laws because: &quot;hey, those deaths in the holocaust need to be respected/that particular flag is an insult to black people/using a fucking kimono means you are stealing the culture of other people/playing a game where you can see girls with huge tits means you are disrespecting women/and on and on and fucking on&quot;</p>

<p>Once laws against this are made (and many are already here), the power will use it to crash any dissident even if that person never said something that the law was made for.</p>

<p>For example, one can start doubting the sanity of giving money from his pocket to israel on the other side of the world, instead of fixing the road in front of his house. Then when he gets a couple of people around him with the same crazy idea, guess what, &quot;hey this guy here, he disrespects the deaths at auschwitz, get him to fucking prison now!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;but m0q many of the examples above hurt the feelings of this and that!&quot;</p>

<p>well guess what, if you want to be a real man/woman grow the fuck up and don&#39;t get insulted by the opinions of others. you may get angry, you may want to take action and change things, all good/but bring arguments, fight for your opinion, do all this but fuck those laws.</p>

<p>one day they will create a law against what YOU are saying and there will be no one to be on your side then.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate the super sensitive culture we have become. Outrage at this or Outrage at that. I doubt many people are truly &quot;outraged&quot; as much as the media would like us all to believe so we can hop on the outrage bandwagons. I&#39;m outraged that people are outraged.  The invention of twitter and facebook just propagates these hurt feelings to the masses. I steer clear of it all myself.. Only reason i use reddit is because I don&#39;t have to register with my real name, ss, state ID, birth certificate, yidda yadda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Democracy is the masses (people with the most votes win).   In an environment where reason/logic/critical thinking is not taught in schools, and propaganda is slammed into people all over the place Democracy is a very dangerous thing.   You then have the masses voting based purely on emotion (often stirred up by propaganda).   It is still Democracy in such a case.    This is something I&#39;ve said for awhile Democracy &quot;seems&quot; like a great idea until it is applied to masses with poor education, and in situations they are easily manipulated.</p>

<p>In the U.S. we are Fascist (rule by Corporations), and possibly even an Oligarchy (rule by the few - specifically a Plutocracy (rich) those that have the most control of the largest Corporations).   We also have quite a bit of socialism in play.</p>

<p>The idea of Democracy also &quot;seems&quot; good until you realize that it is rule by the masses.   So, if the masses decide they don&#39;t like something you are doing, even when it is hurting no one, they can make a law to make what you are doing illegal.   If you decide you like Mohawks as a hairstyle, the masses can vote to make Mohawks illegal.   This is a major flaw in Democracy.   Though there are plenty of flaws in other forms of government as well.   At the moment though with unlimited funding allowed in voting we don&#39;t have a Democracy.   We have a Fascist state that is tending more and more toward socialism rather than capitalism on the financial side of things.   Though socialism and capitalism are very subjective terms.  So to clarify what I am referring to.   Socialism in my context is taking funds and redistributing as seen fit by the government supposedly to things like education, welfare, etc.   Capitalism in my context here refers to an environment where there is no redistribution and use of your money is voluntary, with free market.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It depends on how you define capitalism.   I&#39;ve seen a lot of different people define it a lot of different ways (socialism also has this subjective issue) which is why I referred to it as subjective and then went on to explain what I was referring to when I use the term capitalism.    In my particular case I am referring to Free Market.   To get where we are now with corporations ruling requires the government.   Once the government starts granting rights to corporations, suspending rights to other locations, etc you no longer have a free market.   The U.S. hasn&#39;t had a free market for a very long time.   In fact, the monopolies people do not like cannot survive for long in a free market, they can only survive if the government assists them by aiding them in blocking competition.   In that respect not all monopolies would be bad.   If everyone likes what the monopoly corporation/business is doing then there likely will be no one seeking to challenge them.   If they are however, treating their workers unfairly then that leaves opportunity for someone else to start a similar business and treat the workers fairly and steal them away.   The only way such opportunities can be blocked completely is with government assistance... example:  granting exclusive access to required resources.</p>

<p>There are corruption problems with every system.   This is equally true of socialism and communism (plenty of historical examples).   In concept many things seem good.    However, when we give our government too much power any of these systems will eventually be corrupted.</p>

<p>So, no... capitalism is NOT why corporations rule us now.   Corporations rule in places that are supposedly not capitalists too.   Corruption within governments, and over extended power is why they rule us.    If you want to look at some of the biggest contributors in the U.S.    Citizens United (Google it if you want to know more) is one of the main reasons.    It has a nice touchy feely name, but it actually granted corporations the same rights a person has.   So an entity that has one goal (to accumulate wealth), and does not die, and cannot be incarcerated, etc was given the rights you have.   Sure it is made up of people but, those people still had their own rights.   Citizens United actually gave the people in positions of power within Corporations extended rights that other people don&#39;t have.   That was one of the things that really launched the current situation.    Then more recently it was passed that corporations could donate unlimited funds towards political campaigns.    You and I can only donate a specific amount and be legal.   Corporations do not have any such problems.   Thus they are dumping huge sums of cash into politics and deciding who is in office, deciding which bills pass, etc.</p>

<p>When people point at Socialism or Capitalism (depending upon which you dislike) as the negative, they are actually missing the actual culprit.   The result is that things will eventually blow up and it will begin again as the real culprit will not have been identified.   The real culprit of the corruption is cronyism.   It infects most organizations even socialism, and communism.</p>

<p>EDIT: I thought another historical note about corporations.   Originally corporations could ONLY be created for a short period for a very specific project.    A corporation could be created to create a sports complex, and then when the complex was completed it was dissolved.   It has been sometime since this is the case.    There is a long documentary out there called &quot;The Corporation&quot; which goes over a little of that history, and the rest compares corporations to people using the same diagnosis tools that would be used on a person to find out if the person was Psychopathic.   The results were interesting in that the majority of the corporations would be considered &quot;Psychopathic&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a current example of exactly this kind of thing going on, <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/christie-blatchford-ruling-in-twitter-harassment-trial-could-have-enormous-fallout-for-free-speech">there is a guy in Canada, on trial and facing the prospect of 6 months in jail</a> simply for upsetting the feelings of a couple of feminists on Twitter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it’s not alleged he ever threatened either woman... or that he ever sexually harassed them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what constitutes harassment in this case?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Elliott’s chief sin appears to have been that he dared to disagree with the(m).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They had doxxed and hounded a computer game developer and the guy on trial refused to endorse them, claiming that their actions were just as viscious as the game they were initially angered by. And this disagreement hurt their feelings so much that <em>this guy ended up in court</em></p>

<p>If you fail to agree with the current popular agenda then you will be punished and dragged through the judicial system with your face all over the papers for all the world to see. And seeing that, how many people would be prepared to offer the slightest squeak of an individual thought in public if it meant the same happening to them?</p>

<p>It won&#39;t be much longer before phrases like <em>Let&#39;s just agree to disagree</em> or <em>Everyone&#39;s entitled to their own opinion</em> are classified as hate speech.</p>
