    <div class="md"><p>Please take another look at aliens.</p>

<p>There is a massive amount of material on aliens.  So much that the reason to believe it is magnitude of the conspiracy required to fake it.  But such a conspiracy does exist.  Rockefeller money is behind the disclosure project.  Hollywood and even the mainstream media push the aliens subject relentlessly.  It is a possibility that a fake alien invasion could be used to manipulate us into accepting a one world gov&#39;t/religion at some point in the future (See project Blue Beam: <a href="http://educate-yourself.org/cn/projectbluebeam25jul05.shtml">http://educate-yourself.org/cn/projectbluebeam25jul05.shtml</a>)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not about what they admit. It&#39;s about what their people believe in.</p>

<p>The idea of aliens &quot;invading our planet&quot; was always created by the media. Virtually all ufo evidence could be just as adequately explained by human technology that&#39;s secret and sufficiently advanced. Most could be explained by a plane or group with their lights on. If aliens were here, obviously they&#39;re more advanced than humans could possibly imagine at this point. If they were flying around with bright lights on a planet orbiting a star which emits visible light, why wouldn&#39;t they just be straightforward and reveal themselves? Why pretend to be secretive? The alien hypothesis is ridiculously convoluted crap, honestly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have read that site extensively, including the entire Law of One (Book of RA).  I have not come to this conclusion without looking at a lot of material.  There is some very convincing stuff.  Watching Phil Schneider presentations was incredibly interesting.</p>

<p>It is important to understand how much effort is put into leading the opposition.  This aliens narrative is there to catch people who are looking for something more.  Instead of just looking at the alien material available it is important to look deeper than that.  Look at the tactics used by the CIA (cointelpro, laurel canyon etc).  The CIA is far from the beginning of it though.  Understanding the methods used against us is crucial.  MKUltra is a deep subject.</p>

<p>If you want to look in this direction I recommend these two books:  </p>

<p>&#39;Propaganda&#39; by Bernays: <a href="http://whale.to/b/bernays.pdf">http://whale.to/b/bernays.pdf</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country.</p>

<p>We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized.&quot; - Edward Bernays</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People need to look closer into the conspiracy hole. It goes a LOT deeper than just the corrupt banking system and the greed for power, etc.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just the tip of the ice berg once you realize yourself and see that the alien influence is real and pervasive on this planet. This is not just a conspiracy focused on earth and exclusively human made. I hope more people expand their awareness past the Illuminati, bankers, and other surface scratching issues. We have much more intra and extra terrestrial players at the table.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, that is possible, but I don&#39;t think it is correct.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is just too much evidence to brush aliens off as fake. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not brushing off at all.  I spent a good deal of time down the aliens rabbit hole, read some extremely compelling material.  Newspaper articles from 100 years ago and speakers like Phil Schneider are very convincing.  I arrived at this conclusion after seeing that none of it is really that concrete, then looking at who was pushing that material.  I think that the subject is used of part of MKUltra, both as a way to discredit victims and to further spread the myths.  Also I think that UFOs are human tech, mostly unavailable to the public.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>What if the world was under one government similar to the USA, would that necessarily be a bad thing? Disbanding of violent religious sects?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not OP, but I&#39;ll chime in. </p>

<p>A couple things seem obvious to me. First, with one world government who is there to hold them in check should they suddenly decide to go off the deep end and do something like establish racial purity or decide a certain religion is the way to go after all? </p>

<p>You are assuming that one world government looks similar to what you know and support; what if it&#39;s the opposite? What hope is there then of change? One world means one way of doing things, total control. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t get rid of religious extremists without getting rid of religion. Some may say that&#39;s a good thing, but the result would be the same as an extremist gaining power; there would be open hostility and sanctions against what people choose to believe, which would effectively end any illusion of freedom. I&#39;d rather have a few nut jobs believing something loudly than anyone who believes anything at all having to do so silently. </p>

<p>Checks and balances are important. A one world system removes those. No one idea should be in absolute control. We&#39;ve seen what happens to areas where this is the case, such as when the RCC was at the height of power. The problem in your scenario is that there&#39;s no where left to run if you happen to see the world in a different way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Intelligence agencies are the main drug cartels in the US and abroad, they not only monopolize the drug industry but actively prop up cartels like the Zetas and the Triads. The anti-marijuana, anti-psychedelic propaganda works in two ways. First, it is a fear tactic that brands a large portion of the population as addicts/undesirables and denies the world a useful source of consciousness shifting experiences and physical medicine. Two, it allows the US government to create a self feeding drug war wherein the users are encouraged to use by being part of a counter culture (see: MKULTRA and the Hippy Movement) as well as a permanent source of public support for the police state and the prison system. The drug cartels are almost exclusively break away franchises and satellites of the larger State sponsored Cartel network based out of London, Mexico and China. The largest suppliers of heroin and hashish on earth are the Israeli mafia, hence the invasions of Afghanistan and the NATO presence in North Africa.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>(developing this off what you&#39;ve written..)</p>

<p>And to add to First:</p>

<p>Psychedelics increase neural-plasticity and help a person question their deeper programming -- essentially, their cultural upbringing. The oligarchs have spent a LOT of effort on that cultural upbringing, and they don&#39;t want us messin&#39; with it!</p>

<p>And to the Second:</p>

<p>It puts the opposition counter-culture in a vulnerable position of being jailed. So it&#39;s kind of a self-selector for anti-government people. And, as you imply, by criminalizing these drugs, it associates these drugs in the public mind with criminals. Neat, that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, it was and still is a way to mark social status and undesirability. People think we live in a free society with no restrictions of social upward mobility. We live in a quiet caste system. The slightest transgression against the hierarchy deems one as unfit, uncool, weird, autistic, paranoid, old fashioned, a luddite, anti-science or just a plain old dissident. We unconsciously are tagged with social indicators by the people around us that let them know what we can and cannot do/say/be. The best part is that this is all done by the citizenry and only occasionally needs external reinforcement. We are our own judges, jailers and executioners.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The radiation experiments were the tip of the iceberg. MKULTRA was a massive conspiracy involving Universities and tons of bigwigs.</p>

<p>On Donald Ewen Cameron, creator of the &quot;psychic driving&quot; concept:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra">His experiments were typically carried out on patients who had entered the institute for minor problems such as anxiety disorders and postpartum depression, many of whom suffered permanently from his actions.[43] His treatments resulted in victims&#39; incontinence, amnesia, forgetting how to talk, forgetting their parents, and thinking their interrogators were their parents.[44] His work was inspired and paralleled by the British psychiatrist William Sargant at St Thomas&#39; Hospital, London, and Belmont Hospital, Surrey, who was also involved in the Intelligence Services and who experimented extensively on his patients without their consent, causing similar long-term damage.[45] It was during this era that Cameron became known worldwide as the first chairman of the World Psychiatric Association as well as president of the American and Canadian psychiatric associations. Cameron had also been a member of the Nuremberg medical tribunal in 1946–47.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well. I mean it&#39;s my opinion, but I do believe this really is the biggest cover up. Alien life would absolutely destroy the separation we have created in society. All of the sudden you could care less about the boogeyman enemies our governments dream up and start thinking out there. Which I do believe TPTB are heavily invested in, if they can keep our minds here and keep us fighting amongst ourselves they win. But hey man...I&#39;m a realist, I know that claiming alien life gets you nowhere and I also understand how far fetched it is.

    <div class="md"><p>No need to get defensive, I&#39;m actually quite curious.</p>

<p>How do you pervert stone tablets, apart from the translation of their texts?  There are plenty of records depicting &quot;gods&quot; appearing from the sky.</p>

<p>If you are interested in my personal take, I take more of a probabilistic viewpoint where I&#39;m not certain of anything.  You are correct, our collective human history is shrouded with perversions so I can&#39;t be certain of either standpoint.  I must, however, entertain the possibility of both.</p>

<p>Do I believe we farm animals similar to the animals we farm?  Probably a decent chance - as above, so below.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People always ask the UFO question poorly.  They ask &quot;do you believe in UFOs?&quot;  That&#39;s a silly question.  What people mean to ask is &quot;are the UFOs aliens?&quot;  Carl Sagan said he was always struck by how people phrased that question.</p>

<p>An example I ran into every morning at an airport starbucks:  People would come up to our kiosk that has no lights on, that I&#39;m obviously prepping to open and ask &quot;are you open?&quot;.  They meant to ask what time do you open.  Took a while for that not to bug me.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Aliens are spiritual beings and not physical material creatures like humans or animals. I think the military is trying to take credit for the &quot;alien and ufo sightings&quot; to make them look more powerful and because they have run up against these spiritual beings in a military capacity and have zero idea what they are or how to control them...so they have engaged in a decades long campaign to seed the &quot;UFOs are real and Aliens are among us&quot; fear which they have in turn &quot;admitted&quot; to using this as a cover up for their military testing. A recent documentary about UFOS and the military confirmed this for me...can&#39;t remember the name of which doc it was but basically a couple or more retired military officers claimed that the sci-fi craze in the 40s and 50s was promoted and used to cover up their military activity...I can believe some of that but every single light in the sky is not from human technology...it is a spiritual event that us humans are not interpreting correctly at all due to our decadent scientific materialism.</p>

<p>As for the rest of your conclusions I mostly concur.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exception for what...being physical material sentient beings? </p>

<p>As soon as an alien is caught and displayed I will concede that I am wrong, but like the sasquatch, there is no physical proof so therefore, to explain the sighting that people have seen (not all of them can by lying or delusional) it has to be coming from inside of us and we are seeing it because of this change of consciousness and not because we just happened to look up into the sky at the right moment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Carl Jung wrote a book about UFOS... </p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flying-Saucers-Modern-Things-Skies/dp/0691018227">http://www.amazon.com/Flying-Saucers-Modern-Things-Skies/dp/0691018227</a></p>

<p>In this book he basically says that something is being seen but no one knows what. If I remember correctly he cites one source of a group of people seeing something in the sky at the same time as the radar operators nearby. So the idea that it is a &quot;group hallucination&quot; can be quashed as the radar wouldn&#39;t pick up a hallucination...but he didn&#39;t rule out that the group might be <em>creating</em> the entity in the sky through some sort of group tulpa creation...which is another interesting theory and would be related to my theory on the spiritual origins of UFOs.</p>

<p>And finally John Keel&#39;s Mothman Prophecies talks about an interaction he had between himself and lights in the sky. The UFOs actually responded to his thoughts while he was watching them on the ground. I am not convinced Keel&#39;s book is legit (my theory is that the book is an actual cover up for frequency weapon testing and mind control experiments secretly performed by some top level government organization and that the bridge collapse was actually a live test of the same weapons that took down the twin towers al a Dr. Judy Wood) but if it isn&#39;t a psyop then the documented interaction between UFOs and the minds of the witnesses definitely deserves some serious reflection.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And my take on it is that they are trying to claim that UFOs and aliens are a disinfo project to a) appear more powerful than they actually are, b) to cover up a phenomena that they cannot explain through science, and c) and this one is a little more far out, they don&#39;t want humanity raising their consciousness so there s a disinfo program that attempts to explain away soul/spiritual events, such as witnessing lights in the sky, as advanced technology and humanoid creatures that are in control of that advanced technology. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong...the public has seen military aircraft in the sky and mistakenly attributed the sighting to a UFO, but not every unexplained light in the sky is a US military experiment nor is it some sort of material craft piloted by humanoid creatures that we just haven&#39;t caught yet...there is spiritual activity at play and we are being conned into thinking that it is a physical object that we just haven&#39;t stuck in a bell jar yet. </p>

<p>My theory on the sasquatach is the same. Fear opens the door to higher worlds and the whatever spiritual being that resembles a sasquatch is seen by the person who is alone in the dark in the woods and afraid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not perhaps, we <em>are</em> acting too much like animals, and these beings are trying to reach out to us...but we have to raise our consciousness beyond physical material science to reach them...the human soul/spirit/body is the scientific observation tool that requires development of consciousness to be able to be used. The meditation practices of every religion are designed to do this but these practices are old and need to be updated to correspond to our current state of evolution...but in the degenerate times that we live in there are very few legit spiritual practitioners that know how to do this...my research has led me to anthroposophy as the most up to date, honest, and effective advice to achieve this goal.</p>

<p>Specifically the info in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmXU1XRhAB0">this documentary</a></p>

<p>If you don&#39;t have 75 minutes, watch</p>

<p>21:25 - 23:25</p>

<p>53:40 - 54:40</p>

<p>59:00 - 1:02:00</p>

<p>I believe these are alien messages delivered to us in a subtle way... left for us to perceive and decide for ourselves individually. In fact this is something that many alien theories I&#39;ve read allude to - that physical contact was attempted in the past but the beneficial insights/knowledge/technology that were brought to humans quickly fell into the wrong hands and were utilized for ill intent, so aliens had to settle for less direct forms of communication &amp; enlightenment.</p>

<p>Anyway, I found the above doc. quite compelling. Thoughts?</p>

Which is more likely - advanced aliens leaving drawings in fields that are sometimes never even found or a bunch of human jokers?

    <div class="md"><p>I think there is plenty of evidence. You say you are not into JFK stuff so you should probably check it out. There are provably faked photos, there is physical evidence, witness statements, and much more. There is motive, means and evidence pointing to people other than the alleged shooter. If there was one other person there aiming at Kennedy then there were multiple shooters. However, like any good conspiracy there is tons of disinfo, debunking, fake facts, manipulated data and evidence, etc... This is where opinion comes in, one must make their own mind up based on the available evidence. I have done so, hence my agreement with the idea.</p>

You are not willing to do any research into one of the most controversial conspiracies of our era but you want me to conclusively prove to you in a few words that which thousands of researchers have worked towards doing.

<p>Physical evidence since you said please: Zapruder film and many photos. Medical evidence (which was subsequently destroyed or lost, but not before some analysis was done). Lack of gunpowder on Oswald. Bullet hole in windshield of car. Many other things, but I get the feeling you are not going to accept any of them (and again I could not care less if you do since as I stated it is all about what you personally want to accept as evidence).</p>

<p>Douglas Horne&#39;s work is a compelling review of the official records of the JFK homicide. Essentially it finds the same thing that David Lifton found, the autopsy was altered to obscure the evidence of multiple shooters in multiple locatiosn. Everyone can say oh that&#39;s just crazy, but the circumstantial evidence surround the transportation of JFK&#39;s remains is just as batshit-crazy, but is a  corroborated account with no significant authenticated challenge, that matches the conclusions that experts have come to about the autopsy.</p>

<p>Basically, if your first principle here is the USG is run by fundamentally good people acting in the country&#39;s best interests, then no credible theory of a conspiracy to kill Kennedy will pass your threshold of belief. BUt, if not, then there is a documented timeline of events that can only describe a conspiracy to kill JFK and set Oswald up as the fall guy. J. Edgar Hoover knew it at the time, and hid it to further his own interests. LBJ knew it or became aware of it, ignored Hoover and finished off the cover-up, by forming the Warren Commission and lying to Earl Warren about why it was so necessary to pin everything on Oswald.</p>

<p>Howard Hunt <em>confessed</em> to it, not just on his deathbed, but by loudly threatening to reveal all when he was in jail for the Watergate burglraries. Nixon paid Hunt $2MM to shut up, and is on the record saying that the payoff was due to the chance that &quot;the whole Bay of Pigs thing&quot; could come out. Haldemann later wrote in his biography, that when Nixon referred to the &quot;whole Bay of Pigs thing&quot; that was understood amongst the staff to refer to JFK&#39; assassination.</p>

<p>Hunt was CIA. The CIA commanded the military op to kill JFK.</p>

<p>Bugliosi&#39;s book is a pile of crap. Almost no one read it because it&#39;s gigantic and it takes the same liberties with the evidence as any crackpot would, it examines every bit in isolation and conveniently discards any pieces that don&#39;t reflect his hot take on that aspect of the crime.</p>

<p>Posner has since been drummed out of the profession for serial plagiarism -- <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/press_box/2010/02/more_posner_plagiarism.html#p2">http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/press_box/2010/02/more_posner_plagiarism.html#p2</a>  since those kind of character flaws are more than enough to discredit any witness to the murder of JFK who has a story that challenges the Warren Commission&#39;s narrative, that should be enough to discredit Posner too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to hear one simple, solid fact that shows a conspiracy.  Did Hunt have anything to back up his statement, and was it really about JFK assassination ?  Lots of people say crazy stuff for various reasons; real, physical evidence trumps someone saying something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hunt&#39;s later statements are questioned, although, they seem a little more questioned out of the gate than I would normally expect. but when you weigh it against the very credible manner in which he had Nixon running scared during Watergate. Not because of his knowledge of Watergate but because of &quot;the Bay of Pigs&quot; -- Nixon wasn&#39;t even in government during the Bay of Pigs, why in the world would he care, what can of worms could be a problem for him about Kennedy&#39;s folly?</p>

<p>If you want a fact that shows a conspiracy, my advice would be to listen to Hoover and LBJ&#39;s call here. In this call Hoover tells LBJ that someone impersonated Oswald in Mexico City before the assassination. Is Hoover a credible voice?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/lbjlib/phone_calls/Nov_1963/html/LBJ-Nov-1963_0237a.htm">http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/lbjlib/phone_calls/Nov_1963/html/LBJ-Nov-1963_0237a.htm</a></p>

<p>Hoover absolutely knew that his CI Oswald was in New Orleans when the CIA claimed he was in Mexico CIty, before the assassination. What other possible interpretation is there but framing Oswald? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That seems a very tenuous inference, not rising to anywhere near the level of &quot;fact that shows a conspiracy&quot;.  Maybe Hoover was mistaken, maybe he was lying for any number of reasons, maybe this is true but there is some other reason.  Maybe FBI and CIA were feuding or had their wires crossed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The recorded statement of the FBI Director to the President of the United States does not rise to the level of fact? It is a distillation of facts that are well-documented. You have likely seen the photo that the CIA tried to pas off as Oswald, which looks more like Bruno Sammartino.  But, the actual tick-tock of the FBI&#39;s analysis of the CIA&#39;s intelligence product, and the CIA&#39;s reaction to pushback, which was to destroy the records and immediately shut their op down are also documented.</p>

<p>So you think it is just as likely that by a bizarre coincidence the CIA just happened to be trying to make Oswald look like a Soviet/Cuban asset for reasons completely unrelated to the assassination that occurred less than a month later? That&#39;s a large coincidence in a matter of extremely high stakes, I am quite suspicious of those kind of &quot;coincidences.&quot;</p>

<p>You also think that J. Edgar Hoover was definitely not being truthful in his conversation with the president? That&#39;s way easier for you to believe than he was telling his boss, again, the President of the United States, what he honestly knew and concluded?</p>

<p>See, that&#39;s the problem in regards to the JFK assassination. Proponents of the Warren Commission are quite willing to overlook the omissions, errors, lying and manipulation of the investigation, </p>

<p>If we know, and we do, that the CIA was trying to make Oswald look like a Soviet/Cuban spy. Then how can we conclude anything else but they were doing that to provide cover for whoever was behind the actual heinous crime that Oswald was about to be charged for.</p>

<p>I can make a specific charge, and provide a basis. You theorize it was quite possibly something else, but you have no basis for your skepticism.</p>

The benefit of faking these events is that that TPTB can generate the requisite level of public outrage, blame who they want, and do it all without actually killing anyone.

    <div class="md"><p>TPTB is The Powers That Be - the public elected/appointed individuals in positions of power in your country AND the unelected individuals/corporations/groups who control that &quot;visible&quot; elite.</p>

<p>A False Flag is a terrorist incident carried out by a certain group but made to look like the work of that group&#39;s enemy. The False Flag initiators then carry out retaliatory actions against the group they are blaming for the terrorist incident. It is one of the oldest military tactics in the book and Hitler famously used it against Poland in an action that would start World War 2. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>bgny basically gave you the first paragraph of the Wiki article as a definition of a False Flag, which is fine, however the larger article helps specify the term&#39;s usage a little better.   It has been used more loosely to describe a wider range of things lately.  I think it provides some examples too, which helps:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag</a></p>

<p>Over the last 31 months, this sub has seen numerous claims by people who &quot;knew&quot; victims (or who &quot;knew&quot; friends/family of victims) who supposedly died at Sandy Hook. Not one has been able to provide a convincing, credible account of their claim. How well did you know this person? Did you attend their funeral? Where did it take place and when?</p>

<p>Between you and me, I think &quot;Mary&quot; moved to Florida with her husband &quot;Bill&quot; and are living under different names on a large government pay-off and the proceeds of the fund that Bill set up after her &quot;vicious slaying&quot;.</p>

Quadaffi&#39;s planned transition to the gold dinar was a threat to the petrodollar system, and we removed him from power (and had him killed) as an example to other countries -- mostly in Africa -- who might switch. Iraq announced it would sell oil in non-us dollars in 2000, and W&#39;s administration began plotting a way to take him out at that point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s something I&#39;ve always found weird about the JFK assassination is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babushka_Lady">Babushka Lady</a>.</p>

<p>She appears to be filming the whole ordeal, and always appears calm.  I find it odd, a person of that age, would be using that sort of hand held equipment. </p>

<p>Think in today&#39;s perspective how often do we see the elderly using modern electronics comfortable? Now think ten years ago, now twenty, and we&#39;re still not back in the 60s, we&#39;re just back in 90s. It is more common in this age of ipads and smartphones, but I would argue traditionally aged persons using current technology is not the norm, even less so 50 years ago. </p>

<p>She&#39;s wearing a head scarf, dark glasses and a large jacket. This doesn&#39;t seem odd on its own, but in comparison to what people around her are wearing (most men are not wearing their blazers or coats and neither are most of the women), it seems off - and is what you&#39;d do to help conceal your identity without appearing out of place.</p>

<p>Why do I find it odd? Because JFK told Ben-Gurion <a href="http://www.sott.net/article/269311-JFK-told-Israel-If-you-want-US-aid-shut-down-your-nuclear-bomb-factory">in no uncertain terms</a> that he would not allow the development of nuclear weapons. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-B2J7tp8eg">Where else have we caught people recording events that are of historical importance</a>, that for all intensive purposes should have had no prior knowledge of? </p>

<p>Lastly, for the period directly after the assignation it seems Americans were falling over themselves to be and to be seen as patriotic in this time - yet, she&#39;s never come forward - someone surely would have known her if she belonged to that community. No one&#39;s ever come forward saying they knew who this person was.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sure does! This lust for power and control is blatantly obvious... I am starting to see that living in a house in a city of a country is basically just a really nice jail. It feels like I&#39;m free but I am surely not. The system that has been built over the past 200 years or so has continually made the common man completely dependent on the need for money to survive. If you do not play the game of acquiring money, you get no basic life necessities and are left to die in the streets.</p>

<p>The Powers That Be have absolutely rigged the money game throughout the entire world now with only a tiny amount of places left in the world that are trying to be their own... and we see those places either demonized or straight up invaded and dismantled.</p>

<p>I, for one, am slowly but surely working my way out of this money game by getting out of debt and out of the city to do my best to be a free and independent human being that does not need the system to survive.</p>

<p>After the war, many secret deals were made by the United States government to let Japanese war criminals, especially the top criminal, the emperor, and the royal family, off the hook. In exchange, much of the stolen gold, silver, gems, antiquities etc was secretly taken by U.S. government insiders, particularly the Office of Strategic Services (OSS)/Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and various generals in the military. This is where the secret agency got its first big financing—under the table of course. This secret dealing was itself one of the greatest crimes of the 20th century.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you at least attempted to fathom the unfathomable size of the universe? Or the odds that there are not other civilizations, millions of years older than ours? Does the missing link in our evolution not suggest a tampering of the DNA of the most evolved species at the time? Maybe the dolphins were more evolved, but they weren&#39;t the race chosen to help the Annunaki in their time of need. You see, their atmosphere was weakening, much like the Earth&#39;s is now, and they needed more gold, to reflect some of the radiation from their star. But they needed to find another planet that was untouched / unmined, and could provide such a large amount of gold. Only a small group of Annunaki was tasked with the retrieval of the gold, so they decided to create a workforce made up of the beings that already existed here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to Sitchin, while the Anunnaki production of gold was increased by mining in South Africa, so was the physical effort to extract it.</p>

<p>After continuous day and night gold mining for a period of 150,000 years (450,000-300,000BC), the South African Anunnaki mine workers revolted. The mutiny was resolved through the intercession of the brother/sister gods of the Anunnaki named Enki and Ninharsag by genetically engineering an African ape-woman to create a replacement laborer.</p>

<p>After considerable trial and error, according to the Sumerian story, a suitable hybrid worker was developed. Capable of gene manipulation technology, the Anunnaki implanted the ape-woman&#39;s egg into surrogate Anunnaki maidens. This early hybrid could not sexually reproduce, but at a later time, some of these hybrids (referred to as black heads in Sumerian tablets) were moved from Africa to a place the Sumerians called E.DIN in Mesopotamia and further engineered to be able to sexually reproduce.</p>

<p>Some considerable time later, some of the Anunnaki (including royalty) began to mate with human females.</p>

<p>Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ah, my favorite line.</p>

<p>Very young children play with shapes. They try to learn shapes by fitting a block of a certain shape, e.g. a star, into a slot of the same shape. Not every baby that tries this will understand right away, for various reasons. However, eventually they will learn, and use their observations to fit every block into its own correctly matched slot. Star into star slot, cube into square slot, cylinder into circle slot. </p>

<p>After a while, this becomes trivial for the growing person. We all grow up. You and I now could both solve this simple puzzle without hesitation. How is this relevant you ask? I&#39;m glad you asked.</p>

<p>The block puzzle had three shape&#39;s earlier:</p>

<ul>
<li>star</li>
<li>square</li>
<li>circle</li>
</ul>

<p>If we we&#39;re shown the puzzle, and asked to decide what the 3 blocks that fit into the puzzle looked like, the shapes of the slots would be our evidence. It would be just as reasonable to assume that one of the blocks is a cube, as it would be to assume one is a rectangular prism. Both would fit into the square slot, no?</p>

<p>Now suppose instead, we&#39;re give three blocks:</p>

<ul>
<li>star</li>
<li>cube</li>
<li>cylinder</li>
</ul>

<p>Then we&#39;re told there is a box with slots into which these blocks will fit. We&#39;re asked to determine the shape of all the slots on the box, with the given information. Easy, right? </p>

<p>Obviously the answer is:</p>

<ul>
<li>star</li>
<li>square</li>
<li>circle</li>
</ul>

<p>We both could easily solve this, but then some fucking asshat comes along next and says:</p>

<ul>
<li>star</li>
<li>square</li>
<li>circle</li>
<li>velociraptor</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, the fourth shape is a fucking velociraptor, according to our friend, the asshat.</p>

<p>&quot;But no one said there were four slots!&quot; You might say in protestation. &quot;There&#39;s absolutely no reason to suspect that there is a fourth slot, nor any evidence to suggest that it is shaped like a velociraptor.&quot;</p>

<p>Our asshat friend replies, &quot;Ahh, but absence of evidence is not evidence of absence!&quot;</p>

<p>This is why that line should not be used when talking about aliens, or maybe ever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay. Let me clarify things a bit.  I do believe that there can be aliens out there. I believe the likelihood that there are other sentient beings in the universe is very high.  I however can&#39;t believe that &quot;they are among us&quot;.   People want so badly to believe that they&#39;re real that they&#39;ll see things where there is nothing. Most of the other cases here are things that have been done or are being done but have been hidden
  It&#39;s far easier to believe that humans do bad shit and hide it than it is to believe that aliens are loving amongst us in secrecy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are bits of evidence to support each case. Just not enough to dig them out of the realm of conspiracy theories.    I actually don&#39;t think I really believe the Sandy hook one. But others like the Afghanistan and Iraq ones have decent amount of credible information behind them.  Why else would armed forces be protecting massive poppy fields.  We know there were no WMD&#39;s so why else invade.   It&#39;s just that these &#39;human conspiracies&#39; are more believable with actual tangible evidence.  Plus, especially in America it&#39;s easier to believe these things can be real since many former &quot;theories&quot; have since been proven. I.e. mk ultra , Tuskegee etc.   Maybe it&#39;s just me, but aliens among us just has absolutely zero evidence supporting it. </p>

<p>Opium production in Afghanistan under the Taliban was almost entirely eliminated in the year leading up to 9/11.  9/11 happens, the US invades, and within the year Afghanistan is once again producing over 95% of the world&#39;s illegal opium.  In the years since this number has continued to rise, in fact Afghanistan set the annual record a year or two ago.</p>

<p>You could also try, ya know, looking for some evidence on your own instead of assuming none exists.  <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=us+guards+opium+fields+in+afghanistan&amp;amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS518US518&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;biw=1680&amp;amp;bih=925&amp;amp;site=webhp&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAWoVChMI6IfVh7rixgIVyW4-Ch1cMwEq">Five seconds on google would&#39;ve answered your own question.</a></p>

<p>The data on production tell me that our supposed buddies the Northern Alliance are drug producers.  That doesn&#39;t mean American troops are protecting fields.</p>

<p>Explain to me how the US is unable to prevent 95%+ of the planet&#39;s illegal opium from being grown there?  The Taliban totally eliminated production within 1 single year.  You&#39;re saying that the US isn&#39;t able to do the same after over a decade?</p>

<p>As far as your reference to the Northern Alliance, are you talking about the Northern Alliance that was disbanded in 2001 and re-branded in 2011?  How then do you account for all of the opium produced in between?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Patrolling through&quot; somewhere means you go through for an hour looking for bad guys.  &quot;Guarding&quot; means you stay there 24/7 making sure no one steals the poppies.  See the difference ?</p>

<p>Yeah, the USA can&#39;t prevent something if it doesn&#39;t know the local language and population, is mostly staying bases instead of living among the people 24/7, etc.</p>

<p>Northern Alliance is a handy label for tribes and warlords that are outside the Taliban, mostly to the north.  Those people didn&#39;t evaporate for 10 years, whatever the label did in that time.</p>

The universe is immense but that obviously works both ways to prove that they exist and also to give them a lesser chance of ever contacting us. Overall a very impressive job.

<p>The first is because it is possible that life originated on the Earth and that we are the most advanced life in the universe. Its not unreasonable to think it may have been extremely difficult and time consuming for life to originate abiotically.</p>

<p>The second is because if they did exist and could travel to earth they would have absolutely no use for the earth itself or any of the resources here. By that point they would have moved on to harvesting entire stars for power</p>

<p>Aliens I feel do exist. I&#39;ve always had that sort of feeling from being young but alot of videos on things such as YouTube etc are just easy ways to secure small amounts of money fast just for a click of a button.</p>

<p>Jobs will end up being orientated around pressing 1 button on a machine... Then the next person presses the next button.. And so forth. We are being dumbed down to a point were we are facing a huge intellectual battle.</p>

<p>Aliens could exist as a species that is maybe more or less intelligent then us.. How do we know other world&#39;s could be roughly around the same point in their timeline and fighting to disclose the biggest secrets. We don&#39;t know for sure... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here are mine:</p>

<p>JFK Assassination</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Multiple shooters assassinated JFK, not Lee Harvey Oswald</p></li>
<li><p>Lee Harvey Oswald was a Patsy originally intended to kill Edwin Walker, and George de Mohrenshield was his unwitting handler</p></li>
<li><p>It was orchestrated by a Cabal within the CIA (Yalees from Skull and Bones and Scroll and Key) and carried out by the Watergate burglars</p></li>
</ul>

<p>9/11</p>

<ul>
<li><p>3 WTC buildings were brought down in a controlled demolition fashion</p></li>
<li><p>Flight 93 was probably shot down </p></li>
<li><p>It was orchestrated by the same Cabal as the JFK assassination, with the aid of the Saudis with whom they have a significant relationship..</p></li>
<li><p>Al Quaeda did not exist beyond a loosely connected network of militias and mercenary groups.  Osama Bin Laden was a pariah.</p></li>
<li><p>A false flag attack to get full justification for endless war and further control</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Afghanistan</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Geostrategic key to eurasian supremacy.</p></li>
<li><p>Disrupts gas transportation and trade from russia to India
allows justification of military bases next to china and in the “stan” region</p></li>
<li><p>Took control of the land to seize the poppy opiate/heroin industry</p></li>
<li><p>Took control of the land for it&#39;s rare metals &amp; minerals</p></li>
<li><p>Perfect place to start the War on Terror to work it&#39;s way around Iran- Path to Persia</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Iraq, Libya, Syria</p>

<ul>
<li><p>All a part of the War on Terror lie</p></li>
<li><p>Fueling the Military-Industrial Complex</p></li>
<li><p>DISRUPTING energy resources in a key trade region between europe and the East</p></li>
<li><p>Creating a real Islamic extremist threat which will be used on the Path to Persia, but ultimately to threaten the Soviet bloc region.
Lebanon and even Turkey are on his list, too</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Sandy Hook</p>

<ul>
<li>No idea</li>
</ul>

<p>Boston Bombing</p>

<ul>
<li>Very likely part of a black op orchestrated by members of the intelligence community</li>
</ul>

<p>US Police Militarization</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Natural course as technology increases and the standard of living for the poor does not</p></li>
<li><p>Enables greater power and control over any public outcry or protest</p></li>
<li><p>Adds to the fear of standing up to authority</p></li>
<li><p>Allows for more abuse of power in any interaction
Police protect SOCIETY and the rule of law, not individual citizens</p></li>
</ul>

<p>War on Drugs</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Targets those who are seen as a not contributing to society
Justifies large budgets for law enforcement and the justice system</p></li>
<li><p>Is ultimately racist and classist</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Illuminati/NWO </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Shifting the “Mandate from Heaven” from the church/God to Science/Economics/Technocracy</p></li>
<li><p>Those in power have studied power for a long time
Economics and Capital are currently used to control society.  Soon it will be technology and values</p></li>
<li><p>Likely controlled by jesuits, based on a jesuit hierarchical system which works through families, organizations, corporations, think tanks, secret societies, and committees</p></li>
<li><p>Plays the east against the west</p></li>
<li><p>Many competing interests working for similar goals</p></li>
<li><p>Final goal is a World Government and dissolution of property for the masses.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Aliens (I know this one is pushing logic and reason)</p>

<ul>
<li>I don&#39;t know</li>
</ul>

<p>Chemtrails/HAARP</p>

<ul>
<li>They spray all kinds of chemicals for multiple reasons, mainly weather modification. The goal is to be able to control, modify, and create weather patterns</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>I have some crazy conspiracies involving 9/11 that lead to other things.  I have reasons to believe that 9/11 was a giant human sacrifice. The energy was routed through the obelisk in Central Park into the Pentagon, that acts as a giant capacitor, which blew, as the energy was too much, and to the Washington Monument. The Washington Monument acts as a mega phone that shoots energy to the obelisk in the Vatican.  They used this energy to reign in the current pope.  </p>

<p>On a side note, with respects to JFK, MLK, and Lincoln.  They, the illuminati, are always on the search for the antichrist. It says that the antichrist will get shot in the head and not die.  So any time they come across someone fitting the description of the antichrist they shoot them in the head to see if they come back to life in 3 days.  </p>

<p>Note that these are all ideas that myself and a few friends kick around. I don&#39;t 100% believe in these ideas but there they are</p>

The goal is to destabilize the mid-east to advance the Zionist agenda. Most if not all wars in the mid-east are for the preservation and ultimate expansion of Israel. They will burn the entire planet before they allow their agenda to be thwarted. They have the resources and global influence to do so.</p>

<p>edit: some of the things you say are pretty obvious and non-controversial: Iraq, Libya, Syria Fueling the Military-Industrial Complex, US Police Militarization Enables greater power and control over any public outcry or protest and Adds to the fear of standing up to authority and Allows for more abuse of power in any interaction, War on Drugs Gives a large percentage of police something to do.</p>

<p>edit2: I think you have the definition of Chemtrails conspiracy theories wrong: they&#39;re supposed to be about population mind control or something, not weather control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>exxxactly.  In a world where everyone has cellphones, and everyone&#39;s itching to record anything abnormal that happens to them throughout the day, all of a sudden we no longer have as many &quot;documented abductions&quot; or UFO sightings? Sure, crop circles are still a thing, but it was clearly a passing fad for human artists, proven millions of times over.  You&#39;d think there would be a huge up-tick in UFO sightings thanks to all these extra camera&#39;s in people&#39;s hands... but nope... </p>

<p>&quot;but, but, but, its because they have super crazy fancy cloaking abilities we just don&#39;t know about&quot;....    ugh.. nah, bruh, nah...     If they slipped through the cracks at ALL before everyone had cellphones camera&#39;s, I just don&#39;t believe they have suddenly gotten better at hiding themselves just as we all started getting cellphone cameras...   If Aliens were able to reach earth, it would be as big of a deal for them as it was for us, I don&#39;t care what anyone says about &#39;how much more advanced they would be&#39; somehow making a difference in that... it would still be a big deal... they would make their presence known.   They wouldn&#39;t allow the government to cover it up... what power would they have to do that anyways?  If these aliens are advanced enough to get here, they aren&#39;t going to take any shit from our world governments.   Why bother coming here at all if you&#39;re just going to hide?  If they&#39;re &quot;that advanced&quot; they could observe us and know everything they needed to about us from far far away, so why come here to just hide among us?  Does not compute in my brain.   </p>

<p>Conspiracies like the ones OPs listed are the fun things you read about, and get overly obsessed with around age 17-21, right as you&#39;re starting college, and are hungry for knowledge with a rebellious anti-authority streak in you.   You get high off of how clever some of the tales people have weaved around coincidental things that you start to convince yourself its true.. I&#39;ve been there... I&#39;ve seen many of my friends go there...  For most people its just a phase.  A really really fun one.  But it sucks, but we all grow up eventually, and reality hits us pretty hard up side the head. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying don&#39;t pursue conspiracies.  Hell, thats why I&#39;m still subscribed here.  I&#39;m not trying to belittle anyone, or insult anyone.   But to list that many conspiracies, and declare you believe them all, based on &quot;research&quot; (reading the internet) you&#39;ve done...  Somebody&#39;s getting a lil too high on their own supply of crazy. </p>

I dont really believe any of it, im usually the one debunkong a lot of my friends. just may not have worded it well earlier, its more of a passing interest for me. Thanks for this write up.

    <div class="md"><p>Sandy hook, aurora and boston bombing were not a false flag. There is ZERO evidence to make that claim. Martial law is not going to happen and nobody is coming for our guns. The only conspiracy there is the conspiracy theory itself. Fear theories to sell more guns and survival gear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess my evidence would be all of the crazy people in the world and their capacity for evil. I see mass shooters in the same light as i see serial killers and terrorists. They are disturbed individuals who lack empathy and want attention. I dont find it hard to believe that a crazy person would massacre kids or movie goers or bomb a race. Especially with the Boston bombing, radicalism of any kind scares the hell out of me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, given billions of people, surely some will commit insane acts. However, <a href="http://deepinsidetherabbithole.com/The_Boston_Bombing_Hoax.html">there is plenty of evidence showing Boston bombing to be a hoax</a>. Usually people try to point out these &#39;false flags&#39; so that the government will not pass undesirable legislation or lead us into war again for the wrong reasons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry but that site is crazy to me, its talking about how the guy who lost his legs could not have survived even though i have met combat veterans with similar injuries who survived with amputations. And from losing all the blood of course his face is gonna be in shock and not showing emotion. I can go on for days on this but its way too late. Its insulting to say that no one died in the bombing. It is insulting to the families, friends, and the people who died there. The amount of cognitive  disonance and confirmation bias needed to believe that facebook spam website amazes me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you saying there are American forces protecting poppy fields in Afghanistan ?  I&#39;ve heard that some fields were off-limits for eradication because they belonged to some mayor or elder that the Afghan forces didn&#39;t want to cross, so they&#39;d steer the eradication teams from those fields to other fields.  But what&#39;s the evidence that American forces are protecting massive poppy fields ?</p>
