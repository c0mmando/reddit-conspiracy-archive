       Full body armor on at least one shooter. Multiple shooters reported. 4 marines allegedly shot. One officer shot. Seems awfully convenient. Especially considering that troops have been amassing in Knoxville for a couple months.

       Thank god all those troops came to Knoxville recently though!

       Edit 2:
Shooter is dead
      </p>
      <p>
       White male. Full body armor. Mid 30s. 5 injured (?) None of the injured have died.
      </p>
      <p>
       Opened fire at recruiting center. Led police on chase to naval operation center (?) Shot cop. Cop expected to recover.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second shooter reported by multiple civilians. Female accomplice seen fleeing by some.
      </p>
      <p>
       Police deny second shooter without hesitation. Directly contradicting multiple citizens
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 3: downvoting direct facts is ridiculous. Even if you don't think JH is anything special, at least stop fuckin denying facts. All of these updates are official live news reports. Not my fucking opinions.

       That's interesting that they were headed to a Naval ops center. The Navy sure has had a lot of active shooter situations lately.

       some clarification, shooter is

        not
       </strong>
       a white male. It's a 24yr old male of Kuwaiti origin. Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez. Unknown if he's a citizen of the U.S. or of Kuwait.

       Being of Kuwaiti origin is not incompatible with being a white male - and I'm pretty sure the shooter is a US citizen.

       I agree with you, but I do think something weird is happening with the media. The 2009 Fort Hood shooting doesn't get any attention for some reason, despite 13 dead and 32 wounded.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-fort-hood-shooter-islamic-state-20140830-story.html">
         Nidal Malik Hasan addressed a handwritten letter to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr Baghdadi, requesting citizenship with the group, according to Fox News, which obtained a copy of the letter this week.
        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You'd think such a fact would be used to scare the hell out of everybody. Even weirder, here's this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Days after the shooting, reports in the media revealed that a Joint Terrorism Task Force had been aware of a series of e-mails between Hasan and the Yemen-based imam Anwar al-Awlaki, who had been monitored by the NSA as a security threat, and that Hasan's colleagues had been aware of his increasing radicalization for several years. The failure to prevent the shootings led the Defense Department and the FBI to commission investigations, and Congress to hold hearings.
       </p>
       <p>
        The U.S. government declined requests from survivors and family members of the slain to categorize the Fort Hood shooting as an act of terrorism, or motivated by militant Islamic religious convictions.[14]
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The media did do some scant reporting on this, but nothing compared to the constant stories on Sandy Hook and Aurora. Another metric we can use is simply searching youtube for Nidal Malik Hasan. Then compare the views with phrases like "Sandy hook" or "Aurora shooting." You would think there would be more interest in a successful terrorist attack on US soil.

       Nah. Bullshit gets reported by witnesses, who aren't reliable. Media reports it because they want to be the first to report it. Actual facts get released, and it looks like the "official" story changes.

       This happens with essentially every disaster or shooting, so I figure people would be used to that by now. Initial media reports are extremely unreliable because information is sketchy or uncertain. (Personally I think it's telling that conspiracy theories often rely on witness reports during ongoing events and sketchy tv reporting - there is a rather large margin of error introduced just by virtue of inherent bias and doubt.)

       The fact alone that Jade Helm is happening is alarming. To say that absolutely nothing is happening is displaying blind trust to the world's most notorious liars. It's the first exercise of its kind and so by definition it is not normal. I think we're fortunate not everyone is docile and some people are actually questioning the government's motives.

       I don't expect martial law, or anything extreme. I've got no evidence to support those theories.

       I think it's just weird that anytime our nation tries to protect us with drills / operations, something backfires and there's a big shit storm.

       Just a quick question. When inevitably nothing happens with this jade helm nonsense, will you even reflect on it? You are the one blindly following this theory and I fear that when it finally goes out of fashion you won't even remember how convinced of it you were.

       Here's the thing.. It doesn't matter if anything happens. JH is not something they are using to just cover up operations on native soil. It's all about conditioning people.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, when nothing happens your belief structure will be reinforced. You will continue with your crusade to verbally brow beat people you believe are wrong. You are part of the army of people unknowingly covering up the wrong doings of your government through disbelief and ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another aspect of JH is the strategy of tension. Regardless if anything happens the majority of the population will have experienced some emotion that coincides with fear of the unknown. Why? Because every time JH is mentiioned in the news it's coupled with the mission objective of the individuals training. It's designed to remind the general population that we are at war with an invisible force.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, something doesn't have to happen in order for JH to be a success. It already is.

       It's "Officially" only happening in a tiny corner of the U.S. but up to 30 states have been seeing increased military presence. I was driving through Chattanooga  literally 2 weeks ago and even took a few pictures of an insanely long military convoy near the VW plant.  Very weird for such generally harmless/ quiet part of the nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:I'm gonna go look for source on the 30 states claim. It came from one of the famous YouTube conspiracists.

       Man. This shit is way too grimy. It's legitimately worrying. Check out my update, homeland security came from Knoxville and ordered extra security at various points around the state. "Security" from homeland security is probably military. Not beat cops...

      <p>
       And the military presence has been increased in knoxville. How convenient

       Hmm...just did an alt media search and msm search and only found the reports from the local news already reported below.  Nothing about Jade Helm.  I suspect (and this is just me reading between the lines), some conspiratard right wing Alex Jones Infoliars looney went off his rocker and decided to take out the govmint before they took him out.
