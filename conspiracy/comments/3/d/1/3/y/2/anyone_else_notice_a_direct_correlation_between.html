<p>Staples, to include wheat and other high-use grains, from forty years ago simply didn&#39;t elicit the allergic reaction that is becoming more and more prominent.</p>

<p>And if this allergy is not somehow genetically induced by the modified foodstuffs, then what IS triggering what can only be considered a mini-epidemic of allergic reactions to gluten?</p>

<p>Yes, mini-epidemic. We now have the CDC proclaiming that an outbreak of TWO cases of whooping cough or measles is an epidemic so I&#39;m pretty sure a growing percentage of the population could somehow qualify as a &quot;problem&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glyphosate (heavily sprayed on crops, especially bt crops) or synthetic enrichment - it ain&#39;t gluten for most people. My reactions started in 1998, right when they started wholesale enriching with folic acid, so I&#39;ve always thought that had something to do with it as I can eat organic grains without a problem and don&#39;t have a problem eating grains in other countries that don&#39;t have an enrichment program or GMOs.</p>

<p>On the fat thing you posted earlier, gut bacteria is very very highly correlated to weight - there was an experiment where they had two fat mice, one had a gastric bypass, one did not. After the bypass, they implanted fecal matter from the GB mouse to the unsurgified mouse - they both lost weight at the same rate. There&#39;s also a story out there about a mother with Crohn&#39;s who had the same procedure, using her daughter&#39;s fecal matter. Her Crohn&#39;s was healed, but she blew up like a balloon, got fat an improbable rate (the daughter was overweight, the mother was thin).</p>

<p>Glyphosate and antibiotics both disrupt gut bacteria. Farmers give animals antibiotics to fatten them up...why wouldn&#39;t the same reaction happen in humans? It&#39;s hilarious that we have a medication marketed for fattening up livestock and then we not only give the same thing to humans but also feed the humans this fattened-up livestock and have the gall to ask, &quot;Why are people getting fatter?&quot;</p>

<p>In a study published 22 August in Nature, researchers mimicked what farmers have been doing for decades to fatten up their livestock: they fed young mice a steady low dose of antibiotics. The antibiotics altered the composition of bacteria in the guts of the mice and also changed how the bacteria broke down nutrients. The bacteria in treated mice activated more genes that turn carbohydrates into short-chain fatty acids, and they turned on genes related to lipid conversion in the liver. Presumably, these shifts in molecular pathway enable fat build-up. Just as farm animals get fat, the antibiotic-fed mice put on weight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a gross oversimplification. Different foods affect metabolism significantly, and different types of exercise affect post-workout metabolism differently. High Intensity Interval Training is a good example. </p>

<p>Calories in/calories out implies that all people need to do to lose weight is to eat less and exercise more. This is terrible advice because insulin spikes caused by consuming carbohydrate will increase hunger shortly after a meal, causing the consumption of more carbohydrate. At the population scale, it is ignorant to promote this oversimplified &quot;fact.&quot; If more people are hungry from over-consumption of carbs, more people will consume more carbs. </p>

<p>Yeah, eating nothing but carbs is never a good idea.  And my point still stands that if you eat too much you will get fat.  You even said it yourself that &quot;eating carbs will increase hunger after a meal&quot;.  Simple, don&#39;t eat again even if you are hungry.  Just because you are hungry doesn&#39;t mean your body requires more food.  Especially if you are overweight.  It really comes in to calories in/calories out.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>With all due respect, my argument was not that you were technically wrong, but that you were oversimplifying a problem. </p>

<p>Maybe an analogy will do the trick so that you can better understand my point. There are many ways to avoid pregnancy. You could use birth control, use condoms, consume toxins which increase sterility, remain abstinent, or pull out. Person A says &quot;the reason we have overpoulation is that too many people are having sex.&quot; Person A is not technically wrong, but his statement is a gross oversimplification of a complex problem and his advice will do very little to actually solve that problem. People are going to have sex. </p>

<p>In the same way, people (on average) are going to consume more calories and not lose weight if they are ignorant of how different types of food affect their bodies. Obesity is a population problem, so population-scale advice needs to be disseminated. I suppose any one individual may have the willpower to lose weight by simply eating less calories, but that is not going to solve the obesity epidemic because that advice is only relevant to people who actually have the willpower to resist unnecessarily intense feelings of hunger. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our friendly devil&#39;s advocates here normally attempt to claim that crops are <em>not</em> drenched in glyphosate immediately before harvest, so here&#39;s proof that they are:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3945755/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3945755/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this paper, we have systematically shown how <strong>all of these features of celiac disease can be explained by glyphosate&#39;s known properties...</strong>The common practice of desiccation and/or ripening with glyphosate right before the harvest ensures that glyphosate residues are present in our food supply.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s farmers talking about using roundup on crops just prior to harvest: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAEfbznelWs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAEfbznelWs</a> </p>

<p>Here&#39;s another one: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNBo4C96Ju0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNBo4C96Ju0</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.ithaka-journal.net/herbizide-im-urin?lang=en">And here&#39;s a German study on glyphosate as a desiccant:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Spraying crops to death”, as desiccation should be more aptly called, means that herbicides are being sprayed directly on the crops shortly before they are to be harvested to facilitate the harvest by uniformly killing off all living plants (including the crops) on the field. If crops can not fully mature due to excessive rain, as was the case in the summer of 2011, herbicides are used to bring the crops to maturity by means of a “death-spray”. The method facilitates the drying of the crops as well as removing all weeds for the next sowing period, and has become common for the harvest of potatoes, cereals, canola and pulses. For potatoes, spraying herbicides on the field immediately before harvest (2.5 l / ha), hardens the skin and reduces its susceptibility to late blight and germination, which improved the potatoes shelf life. Active compounds of the herbicide directly enter the potato through the leaves; however, decomposition of the poison takes place in the body of the consumer. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, glyphosate levels aren&#39;t tested for in crops by the USDA. <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/20/us-food-agriculture-glyphosate-idUSKBN0NB1N020150420">In 2013, the USDA tested for about 400 different pesticides on a variety of foods as well as in groundwater and drinking water. Only in one year, 2011, did the agency conduct testing for glyphosate and it was only done on soybeans.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are the glyphosates being used to &quot;kill&quot; the seeds in the... (whatever, peppers, squash, wheat...) so that the seeds can&#39;t be used by the consumer to plant and grow their own food?</p>

<p>Is this the stuff that causes the black &quot;rot&quot; inside of, say, bell peppers?</p>

<p>If so, it&#39;s real predominant on Hawaii - almost every vegetable has like a black... something (rot?) happening inside when you open them up in preparation to cook/eat them. In Hawaii it&#39;s REAL easy to grow just about anything, and honestly, everything costs so much there that it&#39;s not out of the question to grow bell peppers or jalapenos, or corn, or whatever, to try and save some money by just planting the seeds and keeping the chickens from eating them (wild chickens EVER-FUCKING-WHERE... free range my ass).</p>

<p>As for the black seeds, this is common in homegrown peppers as well. A likely cause is calcium deficiency, so steal the eggs of the wild chickens, crush up the shells, and add that to your garden. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is bullshit. Absolute bullshit. I worked on a custom harvesting crew and cut wheat from Texas to South Dakota. I&#39;ve seen wheat fields that were 2 square miles. </p>

<p>There is no valid reason to spray roundup on wheat. That is just stupid. When wheat gets mature, it dies and dries up. If it is not mature enough, the straw is too tough to cut and will not flow properly through the combine. Evening dew is infact what we used to determine when to quit for the night. As the dew got heavy, the straw wouldn&#39;t cut well and you&#39;d just end up throwing wheat out the back end with the chaff. We had to wait until mid morning to start, for the same reason. </p>

<p>I&#39;m all about getting rid of roundup, but this article is factually just bullshit, to the point that I wonder if it is &quot;controlled opposition&quot; to make people think all anti-roundup sentiment is just as stupid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is pretty basic knowledge.  Monsanto specifically markets and sells glyophosphate to be used to dessicate crops just prior to distribution.  If this doesn&#39;t throw off red flags left and right, you&#39;re pretty foolish.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad you worked on one wheat farm that didn&#39;t do this.  Good for them.  But speaking for other wheat farmers you know nothing about is not only dishonest, but it also makes your story incredibly unbelievable in its own right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t work for one farm, we worked for a crew that only harvested wheat. We contracted work, working for dozens of farms in each state we were in, following the ripening wheat, starting in northern Texas, then two places in Oklahoma, three places in Kansas, two in Nebraska, and one big farm in South Dakota. And we were just one small crew of many, my cousin worked for a crew with 10 combines in the U.S. and half a dozen in South Africa, that cut half the year in the northern hemisphere and the other half in the southern.</p>

<p>Not to mention that my grandfather farmed for 75+ years in Illinois. </p>

<p>But good for you, you found some more bullshit on the Internet. What a sleuth you are. I&#39;m not doubting that Monsanto markets roundup for this and I&#39;m sure they want farmers to believe this is common practice but that just isn&#39;t the case. It&#39;s just unnecessary expense that accomplishes very little.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a fad. I haven&#39;t been able to eat bread or enriched rice/grits/oats since the late 90s without massive fucking heartburn. It&#39;s not the gluten, though.</p>

<p>I really think it&#39;s the folic acid; it&#39;s synthetic and a lot of people can&#39;t process it (maybe the <del>MTHMR</del> MTHFR gene mutation? I also think that if researchers bothered to dig more here, they&#39;d find the answer to autism - grain enrichment in the US and the rise of autism map perfectly), so it just circulates in the bloodstream. If I go on a couple days fast, I can go back to eating regular normal people food for about a month before it starts back up again, so whatever the reaction is, it&#39;s accumulative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not true. I have had to eat Gluten free for 6 years. I hate having to do it. I don&#39;t buy specialty products, but rather, cook rice and corn. When I do eat out, and there&#39;s cross contamination, I get back aches, terrible ones that lasted for days or weeks, without fail. I know people who get migraines, rashes, some who bleed. If you start asking people about it, you find many people who have had to give up foods they love because <em>something</em> was destroying their digestive systems, and one way or another, they tried an elimination diet and figured out it was gluten containing foods. The marketing push in the last few years is the answer to a problem afflicting a large sub-group of the American public. Why in god&#39;s name would you pay $7 four four muffins? because a single regular muffin will make you limp for a week or cause a flare up of colitis that lasts weeks. You may hear from a vocal group of people who want to do it to lose weight, or because they think it will make them healthy, but don&#39;t be dismissive of the many people who are compelled to this diet. It is tremendously inconvenient, but its better than the alternative.</p>

<p>In a study published 22 August in Nature, researchers mimicked what farmers have been doing for decades to fatten up their livestock: they fed young mice a steady low dose of antibiotics. The antibiotics altered the composition of bacteria in the guts of the mice and also changed how the bacteria broke down nutrients. The bacteria in treated mice activated more genes that turn carbohydrates into short-chain fatty acids, and they turned on genes related to lipid conversion in the liver. Presumably, these shifts in molecular pathway enable fat build-up. Just as farm animals get fat, the antibiotic-fed mice put on weight.</p>
