    <div class="md"><p>the wife and i had this conversation a few weeks back. what can you do?the majority is clueless, in a time of obvious treason and corruption, how can you not see what is going on. the gov is working against the people and no one cares. as a citizen you have no power to do anything about it. join a group and it will be demonized or co-opted, talk about the wrong people ,well we all remember the &quot;don&#39;t taze me bro&quot; incident. 
could we take back the country? as citizens, id like to think we could ,but what may come out of a civil war could be worse than now. the loss of life would be tremendous . the possibility of the u.n. intervening and these united states would cease to exist. and the majority would cheer it all on because we interrupted their social media and t.v. programming. 
could we petition for a constitutional convention and restart the republic. well the c.o.g. program would kick in and marshal law and that whole thing would go  south. and even if it did get somewhere,how do you trust the new guys ? 
 it wont be long and we will have fully automated battle units run by ai that will not refuse orders and have no remorse for taking human life. so if we are ever going to do something. we need to get started now or just go ahead and admit its over,  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with the average joe is that he is average. Most people could actually figure this out if they spent the time on it, but they don&#39;t, because of the problems I mentioned. There is a degree of bootstrapping unfortunately, and it&#39;s not &quot;fun&quot; or &quot;comfortable&quot;. So people cede their agency to leaders, and sociopaths are all too happy to tell other people how to live their lives, and here we are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought about starting a protest where we all basically don&#39;t show up for 1 day. If everyone in the bottom 99% didn&#39;t go to work then they would be forced to give us whatever we wanted. </p>

<p>There would be obvious exceptions to this, like if you have a job where someones life depends on you being there in a legitimate way then you should go to work. Perhaps you could fund someone who couldn&#39;t afford to leave their job so that they might have the chance in your place.</p>

<p>It would affect people worse the closer that they got to the 1% as it would raise the stakes exponentially as the base is pulled out from under them. If you stay home then they can&#39;t come and get all of us and they can tear gas a mob of people all in their own respective homes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The better option would be to group together and start using our resources (time,money and energy) to take over parts of our state and make commons or co-operatives out of our important areas of infrastructure.

    <div class="md"><p>I think that would bring some awareness to the problem. Maybe that would be a good start and then transition into something more sustainable.
People need to do something constructive to make long lasting changes in addition to awareness campaigns.</p>

<p>I am a private entrepreneur I run my own business under common law jurisdiction and do not pay taxes into that system any longer. So it wouldn&#39;t serve me to stay at home obviously lol. But im sure it would serve people still connected to that system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What we need is something along the lines of the Vox Populi from BioShock Infinite. Now I know I&#39;m using an example from a video game but that game is so beautiful and complex I see it more as art or literature, something to learn from. Like all insurgent movements, the Vox Populi had a leader who wasn&#39;t afraid to speak up and who was educated enough about the establishment&#39;s corrupt ways that she could articulate her anger in such a way that people were up in arms at her side, ready to take back what was rightfully theirs. All it takes is one person, one domino to fall over and the rest will fall with it. It can start with anything really, it just needs to be approached carefully or people will label you as crazy.</p>
