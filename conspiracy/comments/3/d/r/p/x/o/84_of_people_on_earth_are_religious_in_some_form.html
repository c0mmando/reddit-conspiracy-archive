       84% I've just found that number online, where I'm walking i still have to find one that doesn't believe in some form of supernatural imaginary crap. maybe is 99% then.

       Your religion is science? That religion for you is accepting whatever science tells you is right? How many experiments have you done personally, how many times have you tested things told to you as fact,  and finally how many times has your own science proved your own science wrong? There are constant contradictions and evolving theories on what is real and what isn't in science. You accept what is real and what is fake based off what you are told and believe, you have faith that it is right, you have not independently verified anything. Anyone can look around them and understand reality and things that actually occur time and time again, repeated experiments that do not vary, but most of what you consider science is actually just the best explanation we have at this singular point in time. Organized religion is a form of control. The only thing you need to find God is the new testament in the king james bible. You don't need someone telling you what do believe, you just need to go understand it for yourself, then you can start making your own view on what is real and not, what is right and what is wrong.

       I don't think it is necessary to choose between an organized religion and being a person who accepts everything that official science dictates at face value.  I would say both are forms of cults.  Freedom is independence from both and the ability to use reason and rational thought to approach issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       You state that organized religion is a form of control, which is certainly something I agree with, but why do you think that the new testament in the king james bible is truthful?  I must confess, I have never read it myself, so perhaps the words themselves are extremely profound.  But the origin of the book would be a problem for me.  How can you trust the intentions of the source absolutely?

       I believe it is the best english translation we have. The words are meaningless in themselves, it is the teachings of the book that make it truly profound, it has taught me an amazing amount of great of a person jesus was. I never knew how much people pervert the teachings of Jesus to their own means. The basic teaching is love your neighbor like yourself and everything else will fall into place. It has so many more things to teach you though. If you pray and spend time to not read but understand the gospels you will be truly amazed at how God will impact your day to day life. I can't ever trust the intentions of the source absolutely because it was written by men, but I know all the teachings are truly great. I think it's very important to read each book of the new testament front to cover and understanding his teachings in context and full meaning, rather than your own preconceived notions. I am still well on my way to fully understanding it and am only 2months into my journey. I wish you the best of luck in whatever path you choose, but know that God is waiting for YOU with open arms. I am here if you ever want to talk or discuss anything! If it's about the bible or just daily life. God Bless You

       Broke away from organised religion because they seem to twist and turn the original teachings of the great masters, and do the exact opposite of what they are meant to preach. People seem to have a way of ruining whatever they get their hands on, be it religion, science, money etc.

       Actually the number of religious people is falling. Churches and other places of worship are losing members all the time. The younger generation is no longer adhering to the Establishment that is religion. Many young people are either atheist or spiritual (deist, agnostic, etc etc). Which is a good thing, because you are right, religion is the mother of all conspiracies. It was created to control the masses, why do you think they say the shepherd and the flock.

       Biblical scripture even states Jesus and the apostles condemned churches, the Romans/Constantine were the masterminds behind sheepling people in following the church in a nasty occult like fashion. Before that, people devoted their faith and belief to God and he was their shepherd. They did gods willing, and as you could imagine the issues came when governments/states controlled churches and the occult is had and used it for its own political/geopolitical gain at that time. The Romans also used man tactics to get people to fear and believe in their church of lies, one of those ways was the inquisition. There is nothing wrong with belief and religion until a government or state, dynasty, royal family come and pollute the messages for their own benefit. The last thing you would want to see is the dissolving of the diverse world religions/beliefs/cultures because that would make it much easier for individuals to conquer all through let's say a New World Order.

       So if we were a bunch of atheists, does that stop $? Does that do anything to change our relationship with energy use? Does it mean we start protecting nature and using natural resources benevolently and protect natural systems? Does it mean we watch less TV and eat less sugar and remove fluoride from the water? If not, it isn't the top problem in the world.

       I wonder if there's a religion that treats all people equal regardless of skin color, race, socioeconomic status, and position in life. Better yet, a religion that holds people accountable for all their actions, words, behavior, and thoughts towards others and themselves as long as they have the mental capacity to and are still alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to prevent lawlessness, poverty, and deterioration of society this religion has a set of logical rules for everyone to follow. A way of life that reminds you of your eventual death and impermanence.  Also, a system of welfare built into the religion would be a plus.

       That is a religion/belief just as much as anything else is. Most people will just refute that and say no but it is true. That is all we have in this 3Dimensional reality.

       Most people are insane in one way or another. If you observe what they do you can clearly see traces of schizophrenic behaviour and a whole spectre of different mental disorders. 
Take my parents for example. They're around 50 yrs old and poor as fuck. They had 50 years to work out a strategy to make enough money together but they didnt use it. I, on the other hand, have managed to accomplish 100 times more in only a few years, because I was actually doing something instead of complaining and being all negative about life.
      </p>
      <p>
       From my perspective it's clear that about 90% of the human population are batshit insane, depressive and destructive. It's pretty obvious that people love to suffer and teach their kids to do the same. Most people are weak, pathetic and honestly I think they don't deserve anything but to die.

       Wait...maybe you do...but it has to be real data gathered from people who can observe the currents of Energy as it flows trough the Universe, not some idiotic schizophrenic crap about reincarnations, prison planets, karma and other crap like that.
