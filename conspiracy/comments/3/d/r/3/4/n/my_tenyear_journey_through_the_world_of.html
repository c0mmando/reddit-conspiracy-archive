        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have come to the decision that my ten-year journey through the world of conspiracies is over. In the end, what do I leave with? That this was an unsatisfying intellectual exercise that left me only feeling more powerless. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve decided to commit myself to an inner revolution. I understand that the only way the world can ever change is if every individual has a inner revolution that dissolves greed and the urge to have power over others (the source of all these conspiracies). Since I have no control over the other 8 billion people on earth, it comes down to me and my own consciousness. It&#39;s me that has to change.</p>

<p>I will now end this journey. Good luck and thanks, everyone. Love and be kind to others, especially those whom you perceive to be weaker than you.</p>

<p>EDIT: Thanks for all these amazing replies. I&#39;m going to spend a little time replying before heading off to the dream world for some R+R.</p>

<p>EDIT 2: Off to the land of dreams. Thanks for this nice send off. It&#39;s all quite anonymous and we have no attachments to each other, but I have enjoyed it here in this sub in all my different incarnations. For those of you who think I&#39;m some kind of weird-ass shill (perhaps working for Scientology, the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi&#39;s org, or ultimately attempting to make you members of my cult), all I have to say is &quot;stop bogarting that joint, and please pass the Little Debbie&#39;s.&quot; Over and out! Journey done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>nice try dude.</p>

<p>now we should ignore everything because we can&#39;t apparently change it.</p>

<p>more and more people are wakeing up. fucking people in the ass is getting harder and harder.</p>

<p>take greece for example, they may had been hit to the ground by the criminals in power but they don&#39;t forget, it will be a crazy summer, fall and winter and this is because people start to see through the shit out there.</p>

<p>And they fucking react.</p>

<p>So fuck this &quot;Ive done all, learned everything, now I&#39;m going to relax and ignore&quot; this is not an option anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Massive political activism has the potential to change the restrictions that govern us.  But the collective organization you&#39;re imagining as the result of that activism will always be subject to the whims of the individual self: to the greed, or apathy, or violence, or fear that shapes who we are in the world.  That inner revolution the OP speaks of only stinks of bs because it will lead you to question the urgency of materialism, a form of self-centeredness that we as a culture celebrate for the same reason we buy islands for shiny beads and pebbles of glass.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>just fyi too you guys answering this saying that no change can happen without an &#39;inner revolution&quot;-bs type ideology, the abolition of slavery didn&#39;t happen with an inner revolution, the great society wasnt built and forced upon the ruling class with an inner revolution, the space program wasnt created by some bullshit inner revolution of some guy on his own sitting under a blossom tree...</p>

<p>these were all political acts, forced upon a section of the population that was extremely recalcitrant to progress and social programs benefiting the masses.</p>

<p>whether you like it or not, the great achievements of history remain mass political or mass protest acts (gandhi).</p>

<p>that is NOT to say that the material world is the be all and end all, far from it.
But if you guys had any notions of philosophy or political philosophy, you would KNOW that NO SPIRITUAL ENLIGHTENMENT or CULTURAL ENLIGHTENMENT CAN HAPPEN WITHOUT A PHYSICAL BASIS.
What does that mean? It means that someone dying of hunger on the street will NOT spontaneously develop an inner revolution, he needs food, a home, a job, people to love before he can think about that sort of stuff.</p>

<p>This is the only reason I and many call this sort of new age bullshit ideology &quot;bullshit&quot;, because either you get your priorities mixed up, or you simply isolate yourself. either way it is a dead end as you, on your own, will never change the world, you need other human beings to do that with you. and these sort of ideas give false hope of an automatic phenomena of inner revolution that would save the world&#39;s population without you having to leave the safety of your room. But simply think for one damn second,  if that shit was true, why hasn&#39;t someone in power had a magical &quot;inner revolution&quot;? that would fix everything right? you get my point?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like you found philosophy. This is a natural transition. I did and feel the same. Jiddu Krishnamurti&#39;s book &#39;Freedom from the Unknown&#39; changed my life back in 2008.</p>

<p>I like the old Zen teachings most though, and enjoy listening to Alan Watts lectures on Zen coupled with epic music.</p>

<p>There is another step after one attains philosophical understanding, and in my opinion it involves Pythagoras&#39;s Quadrivium. Some may not choose or need to go this far, but I do and really enjoy it. Good luck on your journey!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you call yourself an Indian or a Muslim or a Christian or a European, or anything else, you are being violent. Do you see why it is violent? It is because you are separating yourself from the rest of mankind. When you separate yourself by belief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds violence. So a man who is seeking to understand violence does not belong to any country, to any religion, to any political party or partial system; he is concerned with the total understanding of mankind. ~ J. Krishnamurti</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry my friend, but setting out to change the world is futile, and in the end, will create the vary thing you are seeking to escape.</p>

<p>To change the world in a good way, or the feeling to impact change is a great expectation of the self.  But you see a lot of enlightened people believe this is what they should be doing, and dictators feel the same. ~José Davēd</p>

<p>The true path is to see through life&#39;s tragedies, indifferences, and imbalances. One must see through the human emotional drama acted out on the grand stage as a mirage, and walk right through it.</p>

<p>True change begins and ends with the individual self, choosing your own path will influence those who are in your sphere of influence, which should consist of open minds and hearts seeking ultimate truth and understanding. </p>

<p>The &#39;Ultimate Truth&#39; is always undecided and can change at any moment, and does not take on any shape, form, or law, but is always open to the expression.</p>

<p>Bodhisattva walks to the mountain top, realizes the path of nature, and walks back down into the world, only to help those with open minds willing to visualize change, but he also realizes that he may never see or enforce the change he seeks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recently came into my own awakening. When you look up into the skies and see the spraying and think to yourself &quot;How is this even possible? At this scale?&quot; It&#39;s insane to think about; even in light of the facts of 9/11 being such a blatant lie.</p>

<p>Nationalism is powerful, consumerism is corrupting and belief systems keep people in a world of safety oblivious (often intentionally so) to a world that has always been and will always be on the brink of collapse. </p>

<p>The US, Australia, EU et. al. are at no less of losing their empires than the Sumerians and the Babylonians. But people don&#39;t realize this is so. We live in an age where we think <em>this</em> will go on forever.</p>

<p>I have to agree with you OP. Look at what happened to Michael Rupert. He fought so hard to die with so little. </p>

<p>Do what you can. But live. It is not worth your soul to give in to this world.</p>

<p>There really is so little we can do, and I fear the idea of brining children into this world that is on the continual brink of extinction. But if you live, and love...love those around you and treasure the time you have on this Earth; all the other things become of little consequence. </p>

<p>Be here now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could be your own Henry David Thoreau ... or Ralph Waldo Emerson. </p>

<p>I&#39;d honestly go the other route. Sometimes I just want a TV again; torrent all my shows without ads, have cookouts, parties, and give politics and other things the fuck all. I know that seems like giving into the Brave New World, but the thing about Huxley&#39;s novel is that his world wasn&#39;t that bad. There was no war, no loneliness. It&#39;s the ultimate polyamory paradise. But there are trade-offs always. A world without war, but without art or conflict. If only our reality was that benign. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been backpacking for the past four months. I recently met up with a friend I haven&#39;t seen in years who moved to the heart of Europe and is teaching English. I myself have gotten into spoken word poetry and do shows all over the place now. I&#39;ve fallen in love with a girl.</p>

<p>I look up in the skies and still see the chem trails. They are so blatant here. But all I can do is keep going. Love can make life worthwhile. In the words of Daniel Johnston, &quot;Love will find you in the end.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree with your philosophy, but from personal experience I expect that you&#39;ll still pay some attention to conspiracy theories.  It&#39;s hard to deny that they affect our lives and that we cannot ignore them and expect the collective situation to improve sufficiently.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right that this desire for power over others is the root of the conspiracies.  It is the darkness of man behind so much of the self-serving behavior at the expense of others in the world.  Essentially, it is seeking to force others to serve you, slavery.  It is a choice to embrace fear and competition over love and cooperation.  </p>

<p>We can all fall for it if we believe certain things about reality.  We believe what we believe because of the experiences we&#39;ve had.  Many &quot;evil&quot; people have suffered awful experiences that make them believe in life as competition and fear.  In seeking to survive they embrace unscrupulousness and start to see love and cooperation as weakness on the path of getting others to serve themselves. </p>

Hes even predicted the explosions in drones, police state, elitists meetings, destruction of u.s. middle class, and many more that he&#39;s been hollering since 2000</p>

Sorry but it&#39;s easy to tell that you still live within the artificial construct or are constrained by it, and still seeing the world as isolated abstract parts rather than a single interconnected entity. Also the quest for truth and the quest for enlightenment and inner peace go hand in hand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s okay to leave, because standing here staring into the abyss doesn&#39;t really help that much in the end except to power your resolve for change. If it&#39;s not doing that, it&#39;s just an addiction to rage (which I can attest to being something of a catharsis when the circumstances of one&#39;s life are more painful to think about).</p>

<p>However, if your intention is just to go back to Morpheus&#39;s land of loveliness, to simply capitulate to tptb, or &quot;if you can&#39;t beat &#39;em, join &#39;em!&quot; (I was of the latter mindset in my teens), then that&#39;s the wrong thing to do.</p>

<p>My fight against the establishment is to learn about and promote decentralizing technologies and ideas, to fight against the social divisions that politicians and the media foment, and use my power of my literary persuasiveness to disempower and invalidate the establishment in people&#39;s minds while championing the individual, the local community, and the power of real interpersonal connection.</p>

<p>So, I hope you can find a great way to personally avoid the <em>details</em> of why the world is so fucked (you know it is, already) and use your peace of mind to empower you in your new, charitable existence.</p>
