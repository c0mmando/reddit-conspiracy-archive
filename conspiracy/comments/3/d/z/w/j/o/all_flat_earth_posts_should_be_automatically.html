       I hate the flat earth stuff and wish it would go away, but I don't want to see in censored away. I don't believe it, think it's ridiculous.  Maybe best to just ignore and vote down down down?

       well said...it amazes me how on the only sub where questioning everything is encouraged, how some topics can be just taboo... nothing brings out the hate and superior intellect like saying "Flat Earth".....it's funny how people can totally believe in 1 conspiracy but consider others stupid and ridiculous.

       I don't think it is so much taboo as an annoying waste of time.  If you ask these people who have been flooding this sub with flat earth shit to prove it they just call you names but never actually back up their claims.  I have yet to see one give more evidence than "I found a YouTube video and it's totally fake, you are a shill moron if you disagree".  Until they are willing to have rational discussion they are best ignored.  But I agree that censoring might be a bit much unless it is from a proven shill account

       well i agree......personally...i don't believe the earth is flat, logical thinking and a lifetime of conditioning is my basis for that....as far as this sub, it gets flooded with bs daily....flat earth is just been more of a recent development imo....this sub is meant for free thinking, questioning,discussion and truth seeking....censoring peoples theories no matter how ridiculous you think it is takes away from what this sub's purpose is....i honestly never questioned the earths shape until this sub opened my eyes to the possibilities....which is exactly why i came here in the first place, for every angle for every question.

       The reason I think they're trolls is because they use say exactly the kind of arguments that a legitimate "conspiracy buff" would be making for plausibility and consensus.

       It's probably because the two or three Flat Earthers only engage in ad hominem attacks and spam copypasta and pretend that counts as conversation. Nothing of value has been produced besides a debunking of their claims, yet they persist.

       i definitely agree with the same few guys posting like crazy about it....though i don't think their claims have been debunked as much as belittled....as far as value, if it wasn't for what we are fed from NASA...there would be relative similar value for each side of the argument.....personally i don't buy the flat earth or really care....i believe NASA misleads and lies to the public...so questioning should be important no matter how far fetched, not dismissed.

       We questioned the material and arrived at an answer. The problem is the Flat Earthers who wave away evidence of their misunderstandings and keeping spewing their ideology all over the place.

       No.  People assume it is round,  but the proof you put 100% of your faith in could never be verified until someone went high enough in space.
      </p>
      <p>
       Education has indoctrinated the masses into such a state of conformist that anyone daring to question
       <em>
        science
       </em>
       is tarred and feathered by the masses.  I call bullshit on this religious zeal and yeah,  I looked into a lot of NASA-s stuff and find myself very stupid for ever having trusted them at all.

       we concluded it was round exactly when? what other space agencies regularly feed images to the public?which ones aren't in bed with NASA? certainly not the russians or chinese....and ive watched a number of vids from youtubers and their go pro's....most fluctuate from round to flat to concave due to from what i gather,the lens.....

       Those are the Flat Earthers. They admit over and over that they don't have any college degrees of which to speak of, that they've put a minimal amount of research into it, that they can't explain why gravity is wrong, just that it
       <em>

       wrong, and on and on it goes.

       Not only that, but it's being equated with "uneducated" and "gullible" because not enough people show up (or just get shouted down) when trolls start abusing places like here. We've tried being civil, but it doesn't stop them. What works best is ignoring, but every now and then they pop up again.

       No, you can't really compare a theory that almost 100% of us disagree with with ones that most of us agree with, like 9/11.  One is based off of nothing, the others are backed by science and rational thinking.

       Thing is, we can use
       <em>
        math
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        physics
       </em>
       to prove that the Earth is round and orbits the sun - we
       <em>
        cannot
       </em>
       use math and physics to verify 9/11, Sandy Hook, etc. Those are a whole different ballgame! But you can't doubt science, because you can perform it yourself and prove that it works, which just isn't possible with theories about
       <em>
        events
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the math, I mean college-level physics. Start with Newton's Laws, those alone are enough to understand that the Earth is spherical because of gravity, and you can do the math and perform the experiments to prove it at home!
      </p>

       If a theory can be disproved as easily as taking a simple plane ride and using your eyes, it's not a good theory and is clogging the discussion.  Obvious idiot or troll, neither of which contribute to the discussion.  I oppose censorship as well but this really isnt a case of it.  Hell I'd rather debate the moon landing for the 100th time over seeing another flat earth shitpost.  I prefer mods keep a hands off approach for the most part, however, I consider removing shitposts to be good moderation that improves the quality of the subreddit.

       I am not in disagreement with this, in theory. I do feel like a round planet is pretty easily proven and has been proven to the point of empirical obviousness.

       I will keep an open mind. If we put this to a vote of the community, I would welcome the debate.

       Exactly. On this sub people talk about space fakery, crisis actors at events like the Boston Bombings, New World Order control of national governments, etc etc. To think that this sub doesn't ALREADY seem 'crazy' to the average sheeple seems to me to be naivety in the extreme.
      </p>

       If this sub were trying to seem 'normal' to the sheeple, it would have to limit itself to talking about Miley Cyrus, reality tv, and the dangers of ISIS.

       Thanks for the link I have been looking into heliocentrism vs. Geocentrism and it has been an amazing eyeopener. I have discovered that heliocentrism is accepted for philosophical reasons and cannot be proven just as geocentrism can not be disproved.

       No worries. Having spent much of the past five months studying heliocentrism and geocentrism, the biggest lesson I have learned is just how little most people - even 'awake' people - know about the 'universe' they exist in. Ask somebody to explain to you why they believe we live on a spinning ball. In most cases they will rehash easily-debunked 'evidence' like 'water down the drain', 'ships disappear over the curve', or 'sticks and shadows'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether one chooses to believe in ball earth or flat earth, the research is truly eye-opening.

       You can learn the
       <a href="https://www.easycalculation.com/physics/classical-physics/newtons-law.php">
        gravitational equation
       </a>
       , aka Newton's Law of Gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you read into the Law of Gravity you'll discover that gravity causes things above a certain mass to become round! How neat!
      </p>
      <p>
       Now combine this knowledge with an understanding of
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlTVIMOix3I">
        why gravity makes things fall
       </a>
       , and you will begin to understand how bleedingly obvious it is that the Earth is round, and orbits the Sun (according to the frame of reference that includes Earth and the Sun).
      </p>
      <p>
       Ooops, did I say
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference">
        frame of reference
       </a>
       ? Now we're getting into general relativity, that might be going a bit too far! :)
      </p>
      <p>
       If you've like to verify for yourself the gravitational equation, you can!!! In fact,
       <a href="http://www.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.mfe.lp_gravity/gravity-and-falling-objects/">
        grade school children can do simple measurements that proves the Law of Gravity
       </a>
       ! You can get a
       <a href="http://www.pstcc.edu/departments/natural_behavioral_sciences/Web%20Physics/Experiment%2004web.htm">
        bit more complicated
       </a>
       and learn to use a pendulum to measure 'g' directly, if you want a college-level understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope this helps!

       Would it blow your mind if I told you that all revolution is relative, and that there is no single discernible point of orientation for the general rotation of objects in space?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not that heliocentrism "cannot be proven", it's that it is a phenomenally convenient model that makes the physics really easy to understand. When you're on earth, you use geocentrism, because the math is easy. When you leave earth, you use heliocentrism, because the math is easy. When you leave the solar system... well, we haven't gotten there yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not that either view is "more correct", it's just that each view is
       <em>
        more convenient

       in certain circumstances.

These Flat Earth goons troll here for the sole purpose of undermining those attempting to expose real injustices through a guilt by association tactic.

       That is one thing I have learned about conspiracies.....most of them are true and all of them are false in one way or another.  Every story has a hunk of the truth and and pile crap sitting in it somewhere.

       I consider everything and weed out the bullshit.  It is a longer process but it allows you to view a story from many angles.

       so this sub should have parameters of questioning? if it's something you don't buy into, it should be banned instead of you just ignoring it?  personally, the more i see people against it even being a discussion just makes it more interesting....though i'm not sold on a flat earth...i think there's valid questions for both sides of the argument....and what makes one conspiracy more legit than the next?..... keep in mind...if you buy into ANY conspiracy you're already considered by most as a nut, so why judge? this sub is for all conspiracies.....from corrupt governments to the Zeta talking lizard people....find what interests you and ignore the rest.

       not if it has an "inspected by NASA" sticker on it......i get your point....but i can hold an orange in my hand, not the Earth....both sides of the argument have valid questions....if someone had an interesting not easily explained theory why an orange is flat, i'd let it stand...questioning everything is important...otherwise i might as well log out , turn on fox news and eat my solient green.

       Why do you keep going back to NASA? Mathematicians have been doing experiments to prove the earth is round for hundreds of years. Very simple trig experiments that can't be possible if the earth was flat. It also wouldn't make since with how we view the sun.

       How so? Give me your suggested internal volume and I'll show you how dense the remainder of the earth's core would have to be. Or you could just look up the radar signals that shows shells of increasing density as we go towards the center. You can't both increase density

       lol i never said i believe the theory, it's just amusing since it works mathmatically.  You can't prove that the rest of the universe is outside of the earth though, cause you can't prove

       I can prove that anything I drop will be attracted to the ground, and that is all I need to prove that the universe is

       You can demonstrate dropping shoe.  That doesn't prove anything. Science by definition cannot prove anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a concave hollow earth gravity doesn't pull, it's a push.  The math has been inverted, it works.  Like said I don't beleive the theory, but it's amusing because it is mathmatically sound, you're not going to disredit it by dropping a shoe, you'll only defeat your own misconception of what the theory is.

       No, it isn't; and no, it doesn't. You only think it works because of your ignorance. This "theory" completely undoes atomic nucleation,

       Did you not see the point? A shoe can drop but not be induced by gravity "something as yet not explained by mathematics" as in we don't know as in it would be a mystery. I did not make a claim all i did was point out that it is short sighted to think that because something falls it must be gravity. Because gravity is just a consensus agreement on how to describe phenomena it itself does not exist regardless of the description being used. I personally don't believe in the theory of gravity that does not mean the eggs i crack won't fall into the pan when i let them drop. You can believe in falling without explaining how it happens.

       As for fake satellites, the idea is so absurd it is hard to even refute. How do you argue against something which literally makes no sense? I work in the space sector along with many millions of people worldwide, what the hell are we doing if satellites are fake? 99% of satellites are not built by governments but private companies.

       I find the Challenger story intriguing . Do I know for sure? No. But that link is pretty weird.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for satellites, again I don't have all the answers. I am open to possibilities. Could there be "satellites" in the "sky" that operate similar to the stars? Stars are up there somehow.... and they move...

       I can't explain most things on a "ball earth" either. Most of what I know is what I have been told.  The whole "flat earth" idea is relatively new to me. A year ago I couldn't have allowed my mind to go there.

       I work for a company which designs and builds CCD detectors for the aerospace industry, mainly for space-based science missions. The images that you are seeing from Pluto in the last week were taken with a detector built by the company I work for, the same with anything taken by the hubble space telescope. There are many more but these are two well known examples and in any given mission there will be hundreds of private companies with a stake.

       Flat earth theories are sprouted for one reason only, and that is to make us 'Conspiracy Theorists' look like nutters.
After all even if we did catch onto something true, 'they' can then refer back to us as tinfoil-hats and flat earth supporters and the rest of the uninformed will giggle and believe the MSM.
It's all deliberate.

       This is what downvotes are for. If you think the flat-earth stuff is some kind of astroturfing, look at the users' previous posts and find some proof, then post that. Just because you think something is too stupid to believe does not mean that someone else out there won't fall for it, or that you're right.

       Actually, some of us have a clue what's going on because we can separate plausible from fiction.  That's why so many of us buy into the 9/11 inside job conspiracy.  You have to have your critical thinking completely turned off to accept flat earth theory.  The evidence for the earth being round is all around you.  People need to think.

       3000 thousand years ago a guy with two sticks proved that the earth was round. today with direct pictures to prove it and all the time in the world to replicate the experiments, stupid kids would rather believe a youtube conspiracy video about the earth being flat simply because they distrust authority. this theory can be disproven simply by flying in a plane, or by using 2 sticks and some brains.

       the universe is expanding forever.  The does not mean it is flat, just that it is infinitely expanding and we cannot loop around to the other side, as if it was round...because we will continue in our chosen direction forever.  In no way is the infinite expansion of the universe only limited to the x-axis.

       Stars in galaxies are pulled by gravity into a disc shape generally, but they are in no way flat - galaxies have depth. Galaxies are not only on one plane, they are all around in 3 dimensional space.

        Thus the universe was known to be flat to within about 15% accuracy prior to the WMAP results. WMAP has confirmed this result with very high accuracy and precision. We now know (as of 2013) that the universe is flat with only a 0.4% margin of error.

       So space is 3 dimensional because space is 3 dimensional? That's great logic Sherlock.

       First of all, it is a serious topic whether you think it is or not.  Just because you dismiss it from the outset because it is too far from your world view does not mean there is nothing to it.  There is a huge amount of information on the topic, perhaps you should look.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, and most importantly, if you start censoring topics outright, who is the arbiter or truth who decides what is a "legitimate conspiracy"?  What if you were told that boston and sandy hook couldn't possibly have differed from the official story, all posters involved must be insincere, and these posts will be deleted?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many many posts on here that are sourced from controlled opposition.  I would say the majority in fact.

       If the earth is a disk there must be an edge to it. How is it a red herring? .
      </p>
      <p>
       What about people sttempting to get into restricted airspace. Dont tell me no one has tried. People try everything. Remember thatbguy who ran into the White house across the lawn?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: as for altitude? Its measured as the distance above sea level... which doesnt really change. Maintaining a steady altitude will be fine. You will  not fly out of the atmosphere. Also, a plane does not posess the power to break out of earths gravitational pull. It will stall when it gets too high for the engines to operate,  then come crashing back down. Planes rely on principles of air to give them lift, sfter a certain altitude the air will not be thick enough for most planes, except ones specifically designed for flight at that level. Please... go to a class and learn a little bit of physics and general science before you start making outrageous claims. You are making yourself look not insane, but completely ignorant and unwilling to accept fact.

       How do you even live?  The floor isn't real, man.  The food isn't either.  Better stay put an starve to death over trusting evidence of what the universe actually is backed by years of living in it and understanding it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, just because a fact exists does not mean you need to go ham trying to disprove it.  Do your research, but really keep an open mind.   If the evidence doesn't support your theory, that doesn't mean the evidence is wrong.

       Lmao, a link from the flat earth society. You didn't even read the real account, apparently. But, ok:
      </p>
      <p>
       "In 1870, a Flat-Earth proponent named John Hampden offered a £500 wager (equivalent to about £43000 in present-day terms[147]) in a magazine advertisement to anyone who could demonstrate a convex curvature in a body of water such as a river, canal, or lake. Wallace, intrigued by the challenge and short of money at the time, designed an experiment in which he set up two objects along a six-mile (10 km) stretch of canal. Both objects were at the same height above the water, and he mounted a telescope on a bridge at the same height above the water as well. When seen through the telescope, one object appeared higher than the other, showing the curvature of the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The judge for the wager, the editor of Field magazine, declared Wallace the winner, but Hampden refused to accept the result. He sued Wallace and launched a campaign, which persisted for several years, of writing letters to various publications and to organisations of which Wallace was a member denouncing him as a swindler and a thief. Wallace won multiple libel suits against Hampden, but the resulting litigation cost Wallace more than the amount of the wager and the controversy frustrated him for years."
      </p>
      <p>
       Another one, more detailed:
      </p>
      <p>
       "There were doubtless many scientists around who could have pointed out that Rowbotham's results are comfortably explained by the refraction of light close to a warm surface, the basis of many desert mirages. But no one seemed to have the stomach for more experimenting until Alfred Russel Wallace, noted for espousing the new theory of evolution and hence used to the impolite cut and thrust involved, set up a rather more elaborate experiment. In part, this was because one John Hampden of Swindon had underwritten a wager of some £500 [£1,000?] that a new experiment would establish the flatness of the earth for all time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Three barges were used, on each of which was erected a straight rod, all the same height. The barges were moored two miles from each other along the same stretch of water. The tops of the rods were thus all the same distance above the surface of the earth. Using a theodolite, Wallace sighted from the top of the first rod to the top of the third. If the earth was flat, the top of the middle rod would lie on the same line.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, because the earth was curved, the third rod was lower than the second: the second marker was a clear 32 inches above the line from the first to the third (sometimes reported to be five feet -- doubtless to emphasise the clear victory for the Globularists).
      </p>
      <p>
       This makes the diameter of the earth 7920 miles -- pretty good for 1870, as we now believe that the earth's equatorial diameter is 7926 miles (the earth isn't a perfect sphere, and has different diameters at different places). Unfortunately for Wallace, but fortunately for those of us who are enjoying the story, the Zetetics (also known as the 'planists', by the way) looked at the same results and somehow managed to convince themselves that a trick of perspective was involved and that this did, after all, prove that the earth was flat! John Hampden refused to pay up, and the matter went to court some six years later. In a wonderful instance of jurisprudential cunning, the presiding judge declined to rule on what might be deduced from the experiments and contented himself with adjudging that such wagers were not legally binding! Hampden responded badly to a verdict that had, after all, saved him £500. He became obsessed and conducted a campaign of vilification against Wallace for the rest of his life, which led to several prosecutions for libel and accompanying prison sentences."
      </p>
      <p>
       It was more like "YOU PROVED ME WRONG?! YOU MUST HAVE CHEATED!"

       I work for a company which designs and builds CCD detectors for the aerospace industry, mainly for space-based science missions. The images that you are seeing from Pluto in the last week were taken with a detector built by the company I work for, the same with anything taken by the hubble space telescope. There are many more but these are two well known examples and in any given mission there will be hundreds of private companies with a stake.
