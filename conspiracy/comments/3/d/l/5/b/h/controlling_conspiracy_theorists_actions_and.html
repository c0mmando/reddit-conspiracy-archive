        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have had this theory for awhile now, and have even posted about it from time to time, when I&#39;ve seen it exercised on a massive or popular scale.</p>

<p>Many of us are aware that one way to control a group of &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; is to give them someone they can rally behind who they believe is one of them. He (or she) makes speeches and posts, about hot topics, and they are saying what many already believe.</p>

<p>But what they are also doing, is controlling the direction that these conspiracy theorists and possible revolutionaries will take in the future. It&#39;s like how we say we have a choice when it comes to buying our food and giving money to one company and not to another, and then we see if we go far enough up, that the money all ends up in the same pocket.</p>

<p>In addition to controlling the options/choices, of theories that fringe groups believe in, another interesting psychological effect is happening. Some of you may have read, how the simple act of telling someone that you are planning to (for example) lose weight, actually makes it easier for you to fail. Something about sharing this information, makes the brain react as if you are already doing the action, and you feel this sense of fulfillment, and end up NOT doing what you intended to do. Not completing your goal. My theory is, what if, another way to exploit this human behavior, this &#39;brain bug&#39;, is to produce a movie or TV show, that has within it, actions that &#39;conspiracy theorists&#39; and &#39;revolutionaries&#39; would like to take, or would like to have happen. In Mr. Robot, the weekly show has actions that result in the end game of bringing down the corrupt mega company, that controls everything. An evil corporation. Who wouldn&#39;t want to see the banksters getting their asses handed to them, or the execs of Walmart being made to live off of food stamps.</p>

<p>What if, by watching these TV shows (and movies), our brains are given the same excitement and fulfillment, as if we had successfully accomplished these missions and tasks on our own, or in a group. And by doing so, you create a more pacified opposition.</p>

<p>This is just a theory of mine, and I&#39;d love to have people discuss it with me, and either destroy/disband it, or strengthen it. But what I do know, is that &#39;the powers that be&#39; are strong enough to control the majority of daily news (and even CREATE news events), so it wouldn&#39;t be above their abilities, to create TV shows and movies that the public would enjoy watching (might as well profit off it), and squelch those voices who oppose their actions.</p>

<p>Stay vigilant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post/theory, and I agree 100%. This was kind of an &quot;ah-ha&quot; moment for me. Really thought provoking OP, thanks. I&#39;ve experienced this in my life many times, whether it be one goal or another. As soon as I let it slip that I am working on project A or B, for some reason I never accomplish it, but the projects that I work on for myself, without telling anyone, I come through. Whoa...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am glad you&#39;ve figured it out for yourself, I just wish I had figured it out for myself sooner.</p>

<p>What about the other part of the post, the one about us seeing a tv show or movie thats roughly about justice against those that &#39;control behind the scenes&#39;, and making us lose our motivation?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re post makes 100% sense. I was working on a web development project, I was so excited, but determined, my business partner knows me, and said don&#39;t tell me. I told him and that project is now on the back burner. It&#39;s a weird psychological thing. I expressed it out, and it was never done. We are given movies and media of the good guys win, change the world. IDK, it was like &quot;ah-ha&quot; to me. I&#39;ve experienced it in my life, and I can see where your theory fits in.</p>

<p>Everyone wants to change the world, we all have ideas, but most of us do not have it in us. So we are fed imagery of us changing shit. We get this changing the world subconsciously. We will never do it, but we see others do it and it&#39;s gratifying. Why are super heroes so famous and loved, because men cannot do shit, but we see it in an alt reality and we are fulfilled. That is the point. You are on to more than what you think and you are smarter than you think. You&#39;re theory is spot on, cheers! I&#39;ve been around and haven&#39;t heard a better/more rational theory as this in a long time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right on the money here.  They do this with documentaries now. When you pitch one not only do you have to have a three act structure and hero, you have to have a happy ending.  This makes people feel like &#39;at least something is being done about this serious problem&#39; in addition to defining the &#39;walls&#39; of the issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.  Reality tv production model is a plague on modern media. Dumbing it all down, cheaper and more effective propaganda.  That&#39;s not to say don&#39;t watch documentaries, plenty of good info to glean depending on the source.  Just do additional research as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that TV and movies are used to control and dumb down the population, but what I&#39;m talking about is a bit more specific. It&#39;s about targeting a specific group of people and trying to destroy their motivation and their will to change the correct version of society and to correct the mistakes that we live with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have had this thought too. Create short film of what the world would be like if say, tomorrow CNN BBC are all reporting that 9/11 was an inside job and the bush, clintons, Larry silversteins of this world are up for trial, some of them are even absconding. That will really put these hot topics into our mind space... And after all its just a movie, so it need not have any legal ramifications. People will watch it for like you said, that feel good factor, but it will really rally and direct the masses in a different direction than what they have planned. Such films need not even be direct, something more subtle for example the matrix etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, I&#39;m with you on Mr. Robot. I watched the first episode and it sort of puts a &#39;face&#39; to the possibilities of cyber-terrorism. Plus, there was a big promotional push for it....I saw a brand-new account make a post in this sub talking about how great it was. We know the CIA  worked with Bigelow (either she was complicit or they played her like a simp) on Zero Dark Thirty to push the idea that torture was neccessary in order to find Bin Laden (even though we know now torture never accomplished any of the aims it was supposed to achieve), so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s out of the realm of possibility that a series like Mr. Robot could be propaganda. Advertising has been using psychology to trick people into buying things for decades; it&#39;s possible keeping ideas in the national unconscious can change people&#39;s behavior. If anyone&#39;s interested in reading more about how &#39;telling someone of your intent effects your behavior&#39;, here&#39;s the paper:

<p>I see a flip side of this, where there&#39;s so much paranoia that the conspiracy community can never come together in a meaningful way. We NEED someone to rally around, but everytime someone gets a larger following, the paranoid-nature of the community starts fomenting the seeds of distrust and saying this person&#39;s a shill, &#39;limited hangout&#39;, etc. There&#39;s sane skeptics here, but there&#39;s also paranoid-schizophrenics, and it makes discourse difficult sometimes. How can we talk about the military industrial complex and lizard aliens in the same breath and not look ridiculous? It&#39;s important to be critical and skeptical, but if there&#39;s also something to be said for getting behind a voice that can speak to the mainsteam in a way more people can get behind. More James Corbitt, less ZetaTalk, u giuz.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a problem we have in the conspiracy movement is that sometimes we spin our wheels becuase our MO is to suspect/theorize everything and sometimes we don&#39;t know how to identify truth and then act on it after all that suspicion/theory. The point of our movement isn&#39;t to isolate oneself in a conspiracy hole and commiserate with other conspiracy theory elites about how hopeless everything is. The point of our movement is gain and spread the knowledge that will lead to a better society. The fact that something can be questioned doesn&#39;t necessarily make it untrue. We need to be careful that we aren&#39;t blind followers, but we also need to be able to take action and get results. Sometimes with our question everything mentality we throw the baby out with the bathwater and become paralyzed when we need to take action.</p>
