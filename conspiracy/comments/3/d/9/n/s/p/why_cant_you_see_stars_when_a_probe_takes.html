    <div class="md"><p>Exposure times, light metering and how cameras work.</p>

<p>If you were wearing all black or even grey and standing in front of a dark forest or hill while wearing a single white star on the center of your chest, I could take a picture of you where the only thing that didn&#39;t turn out jet black was the star on your chest.  In that picture we would be able to see the details on the star such as the surface grain or the weave of the material the star was made out of.</p>

<p>On the other hand I could take a secondary picture where your black clothes looked light grey and the forest behind you looked very well lighted.  Unfortunately in this 2nd picture the details of the star would be lost.  It would be a solid white star with fuzzy edges and no surface details.</p>

<p>We could absolutely take a picture of Pluto where the stars are visible behind it but the amount of light reflecting from Pluto would turn the whole image a bright grey and wash out the &quot;empty space&quot; to where the stars were just slightly brighter than the bright grey wash.</p>

<p>This is why we build observatories on mountains and away from big cities.  The city lights reflecting off of clouds would reduce the contrast between stars and empty skies.  Also higher elevation equals less water vapor/clouds/smoke between the telescopes and the stars.  Orbiting imagers like Hubble are ideal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, the human eye is very sensitive and is able to pick up stars when we look for them. </p>

<p>The cameras used by space missions are indeed fantastically sensitive and able to pick up a lot of detail. However the aperture is only open for a fraction of a second and therefore there is less light hitting the film / sensor.</p>

<p>Now, as most spacecraft are moving a very high speeds, a longer exposure time can lead to the image being blurred, as demonstrated in the image I linked previously.</p>

<p>To answer your question about the Lunar picture. The reflected light from the Lunar surface drowns out the weak light from distant stars. In order to photograph the Earth from the Moon and include the stars a longer exposure would have been required. Why this wasn&#39;t done, I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>I would like to state that I am neither a scientist or a photographer and these are assumptions I am making with my layman&#39;s knowledge and quick research.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok thanks for explaining it to me. I posted here because I want the best explanation for things. I&#39;ve found to get the best explanation is to question things and try and disprove things and someone will come along and try to explain why something is the way it is. Some things still don&#39;t make sense and I still question it, but I appreciate you explaining the reason why stars wouldn&#39;t be pictured. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The exposure of the camera plays a part but that is because it is set for what they want to see.</p>

<p>Stand in Manhatten at 2:00 AM and look up, you&#39;re going to have a hard time seeing stars because of light pollution and your eyes are adjusted for the amount of light on the street.</p>

<p>Landing on the moon and setting the camera for the exposure necessary to capture the stars in the middle of the day is going to severely wash out the surface of the planet.</p>

<p>It would be neat to see someone replicate the moon landing camera settings on Earth at night to see how the sky looks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exposure isn&#39;t &quot;bullshit&quot;, it&#39;s the basis of photography: if you balance it around a sunlit object any star will be invisible. You can easly reproduce it here on earth: try and take a picture of the stars keeping a full moon in the scene. You&#39;ll either get a overexposed moon or (more likely) a balanced moon and solid black sky.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, point your camera up on a clear night and marvel at all of the stars you see.  Do the exact same thing standing on the surface of the Moon, where the stars would necessarily be <strong>many times brighter</strong> than they are on Earth, and you apparently will get no stars in any of your pictures.  I mean, just look at all of the ones taken during the Apollo missions - not a single star in any of them.  But no, &quot;exposure time&quot; is clearly the culprit..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can take pictures of stars sure. But you can&#39;t take a picture that includes stars on the background and a very bright object in the foreground in the same shot.</p>

<p>Your choices are 1. Stars showing and bright object is an overexposed white blob, or 2. No stars showing and bright object is properly exposed. </p>

<p>Or a third choice, shoot the same shot multiple times with multiple exposures and combine them. Photographers do this all the time when shooting shots of vastly different light levels. There is no mystery here.</p>

<p>There is a setting on most DSLR cameras for this exact purpose. It shoots 3 shots in a quick burst at low, normal and high exposures. So the shots can be combined later in Photoshop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, playing along here. I <em>think</em> I understand why we see no stars. But, i think the question is not why the pictures that we do have have 0 stars - but why not provide some space shots that do provide views with stars...as well? Send different cameras with different settings maybe? It seems like even 10 years ago if you sent a probe to Pluto you would want detailed pics of its atmosphere and the space around it wouldn&#39;t you?</p>

<p>Asking because I honestly don&#39;t know. Why just the one type of pic? The &quot;Nasa no-star&quot; space pic. Why not more types of photos taken with their settings in mind to provide some more detail?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>According to NASA they deliberately used many different settings and many different exposures, to the point that they even claim to have &quot;pre-computed&quot; some of the exposures beforehand.  They also claim that some of the settings for certain photos didn&#39;t work properly, meaning that there were even more different combinations of settings/exposures used accidentally.  And yet none of these combinations show even a hint of a star in the sky.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Each of those stars, by themselves, don&#39;t give the camera much light but Pluto gives off a ton of light.</p>

<p>The scientists running New Horizons don&#39;t care about getting pictures of the stars because that is not what they are trying to do.  They are trying to get a picture of Pluto so they set their cameras up with appropriate settings to capture Pluto which means the stars are not seen.</p>

<p>It would be really easy to test this out for yourself.  Go to a dark area on a clear night with no moon.  Take a grey ball with you and a flashlight.  Hold the ball against the sky and shine the flashlight on it and take a picture that lets you see as much detail as possible on the ball.  When you look at the picture, you won&#39;t see any stars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would imagine the light reflecting off of the object in focus (planet, dwarf planet, asteroid, what have you) would cause the stars to not be visible. Same reason we can&#39;t see stars in daytime, and at night when there&#39;s lots of light pollution from a city. </p>

<p>For a demonstration, try going outside at night when the stars are bright, laying on your back and having someone hold a mirror above you. Then, point a flashlight at it so it reflects in your eyes (you can do it, or have someone else do it). Then try to see stars. Or just try to see stars around the moon. I predict you won&#39;t be able to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The very first video in no way proves the astronaut is on Earth. To me, it seems like he&#39;s referring to the fact his small town is across the U.S. from where the questioner is located. 
Even if it was him saying he was on Earth, from what I can gather, he&#39;s a human, and, from my experience, we humans sometimes mess up what we say. Especially someone who has spent their entire life living on Earth, and is now in space for a short time.
(Also, that &quot;squirm&quot; looks more like he&#39;s handing off the microphone. And even if it was a &quot;squirm&quot;, I get embarrassed when I tell someone I&#39;m a year younger than I am on accident. I can&#39;t imagine how embarrassed I&#39;d be if I did it in front of a camera.)</p>

<p>Calling out a conspiracy and citing others who share that same view on the conspiracy isn&#39;t exactly a preponderance of evidence. Especially if your argument is that &quot;humans lie&quot;. So... what about those valid points? None of them are liars? I like it.</p>

<p>Really?  video/information and scientific research that proves we went to the moon and that the ISS isn&#39;t a giant hoax ?  </p>

<p>Is that why Neil DeGrasse Shillson - in a moment when he could drop his most airtight, scientifically-based, irrefutable knowledge BOMB - chose to argue:  </p>

<p>&quot;Look at the gas, if you calculate the gas, you know the rocket went to the moon and back.&quot;  Ta-da!  </p>

<p>You can&#39;t prove a lie.<br/>
And humans aren&#39;t perfect.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s why there&#39;s ZERO proof NASA is legit, 
and TONS of evidence that it&#39;s a giant FRAUD.  </p>

<p>Anyway, I think you ARE collecting a paycheck to defraud americans so the video isn&#39;t for you.  </p>

<ol>
<li>Why didn&#39;t the soviets talk. </li>
<li>There are sooo many photographs... They can&#39;t <em>ALL</em> be fake.<br/></li>
<li>But there are rocks that aren&#39;t from earth...<br/></li>
<li>But too many people were involved - someone would have talked<br/></li>
<li>They went back a bunch of times - they would&#39;ve stopped after 1<br/></li>
</ol>

<p>That was great. Those assertions have all been answered and none of the major discrepancies were addressed. This is my point - it&#39;s like when I first decided to study the topic of Israel-Palestine: after searching for awhile and listening to both sides present their best cases, the evidence starts to pile up in favor of one side.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ll refute these and be done for good - you&#39;ve helped prove my case.   </p>

<ol>
<li>The soviets lied to their people too - exposing us would expose them.<br/></li>
<li>The plethora of faked photos speak for themselves. When there&#39;s a stack of them - the legitimacy of all are in question.<br/></li>
<li>Meteors hit the earth. Excursions were made to their sites around the time of the moon landing hoax. Google it.<br/></li>
<li>It&#39;s called compartmentalization: you only know your small part. And more people were involved in the Manhattan Project - which was also kept quiet.<br/></li>
<li>Going once doesn&#39;t prove domination - superiority - legitimizing NASA and the billions in taxpayer dollars they&#39;ve collected since the first hoax.  9-11; Sandy Hook; Boston Bombing; Aurora Colorado batman Movie Theater; The Gulf of Tonkin Incident -- Hoaxes All -- when a corrupt thief gets away with it once - he doesn&#39;t stop.  And like the FBI even said: we need these terror plots - they keep fear alive and justify our budget.<br/></li>

    <div class="md"><p>The classic argument is &quot;exposure time&quot;.</p>

<p>If you point your camera up on a clear night with very little exposure time you&#39;ll see a plethora of stars.  But if you do the same thing on the Moon, where the stars would necessarily be <strong>many, many times brighter</strong> than on the surface of the Earth, you see no stars?  Haha.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most obvious clue of fuckery is the simple fact that at no point in any of the Apollo missions did anyone think to capture what would have had to be among the most brilliant visual displays any human being had ever seen.  Hundreds if not thousands of photos and not a single star?  Not even one picture?  But anyway I&#39;ll bite.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not denying that it&#39;s possible to take a picture where no stars are visible, I&#39;m saying that this explanation isn&#39;t sufficient when looking at the Apollo missions.</p>

<p>NASA has stated that a lot of the pictures were improperly exposed and thus would have had to use different exposure settings.  NASA has also publicly stated that they used many different exposure times deliberately, even going so far as to say that they &quot;pre-calculated&quot; the necessary exposure times before the missions, again meaning that many different exposure settings would have been used.  And yet none of these different exposure times show a hint of a star anywhere.  How short do you imagine an exposure would need to be to <em>not</em> pick up on the thousands of stars burning brighter than any stars have ever burned on earth (where most cameras will pick up stars in a clear sky within seconds tops)?</p>

<p>There are quite a few Apollo photos which are clearly not well-lit, like <a href="http://imgur.com/r4C6Okp">this one</a> or <a href="http://imgur.com/SJYyWVT">this one.</a>  These would have required longer exposures.  The stars on the Moon&#39;s surface would have to be spectacularly bright, as NASA has also publicly stated, and would clearly have been the brightest objects in the frame for both of these pictures - and yet not even a hint of one anywhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read that &quot;debunking&quot; too.</p>

<p>Did you even look at either of the pictures in the comment you&#39;re responding to?  Either one would have been sufficient to show you that the moon was not &quot;blazingly bright&quot; nor was everything &quot;brighter than high noon&quot;.  You can clearly see in both of those pictures many shadows, dark spots, and entire areas of the photos which blatantly aren&#39;t exposed to very much light at all.  We can also notice the obvious, which is that the astronaut in the first picture is by far the brightest thing in the photo, meaning that his suit is reflecting much more light than the surface is.</p>

<p>And in both cases the stars would have been the brightest objects in the camera&#39;s field of view (especially when you consider that an entire cosmos full of stars un-occluded by atmosphere of any kind would certainly be much brighter than a spacesuit).</p>

<p>You&#39;re thinking about exposure backwards.  Look for drastically over exposed pictures, not under exposed like the two you linked.  Also the brightest light source in those pictures would be the light from Sol reflecting off the surface of the moon after travelling a few minutes as opposed to the light from distant stars travelling for years and years.</p>

<p>If those pictures had been overexposed to the point where the moon and astronaut were whitewashed then you might start to see the stars in the background.</p>

<p>You can do a simple experiment to see this effect with a camera or just your eyes.  Next time the stars are clearly visible, look up at them and then hold a piece of white paper in front of you blocking half your view, shine a flashlight on the paper and your eyes/camera will adjust and the stars will disappear.</p>

<p>Aperture + time + film sensitivity = exposure.</p>

<p>No I&#39;m not, I think you&#39;re just misunderstanding what I was saying a bit.  Those pictures are both clearly not well-lit, thus they would require more exposure relative to a photo that was well-lit.  I was using them to demonstrate the point that many different exposure settings were used in the thousands of pictures taken during the Apollo missions and apparently not one of these settings showed even a single star in the sky.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also the brightest light source in those pictures would be the light from Sol reflecting off the surface of the moon</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So thousands of stars sitting there directly in the field of view, totally unobscured, are somehow being completely washed out by the reflection of the Sun bouncing off the dirt that isn&#39;t even in view?  In the one photo I linked with the astronaut, look at how dark the entire right side of the photograph is.  Far darker than an entire sky full of the brightest stars any human has ever laid eyes on.</p>

<p>And like I said, NASA has admitted that many different exposure settings were used in the thousands of pictures they took.  You would think one of them would&#39;ve had this white-washing effect you&#39;re speaking of, or that one of these settings would have allowed for at least a few of the stars to be visible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aperture + time + film sensitivity = exposure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know how exposure works.  Again, I&#39;m not denying that it&#39;s possible to take a picture where the stars are occluded, I&#39;m denying that this is a valid explanation for every single one of the hundreds or thousands of Apollo photographs.</p>

<p>Well yes and no.</p>

<p>Yes the surface of the moon is the reason that the stars aren&#39;t visible.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s assume for the sake of clarity that the same setting are being used except for exposure time.  So we want to take a picture while standing on the moon, one picture of the horizon (half night sky and half surface). We meter the light being reflected by the surface and adjusted for our film sensitivity ISO and aperture stop the meter tells us we need on 1/1000th of a second exposure time to have a properly exposed surface.  Now we look up into the stars and meter the light from the stars independently and theeter tells us that we need a 2 second exposure time.  At this point we have a choice of properly exposing the surface or the stars.  If we split the difference between 1/1000th of a second and 2 whole seconds then we would end up with both a white washed surface with no discernable details and a black sky with no discernable stars.  </p>

<p>Its much more common to meter light off of something you can actually see, like the surface than a distant star because trying to meter off of an actual light source like a star instead of a reflected source like the surface is well known to be a bad idea.  Its unconventional and considered &quot;trick/stunt photography&quot;. </p>

<p>This sort of demonstrates the point I was making that even slightly different settings produce drastically different photos.  NASA has confirmed that they used lots of different camera settings deliberately and that the settings for a lot of their pictures didn&#39;t work properly meaning that many other different camera settings were used unintentionally as well.  The problem I have is that not one of these groups of settings showed any stars.</p>

<p>This tends to suggest that all pictures were taken using the same (or <em>very</em> similar) settings.  So it seems that either NASA is lying about using a bunch of different settings or some of the pictures have major issues.</p>

The trajectories of their rocket launches are visible parabolas and thus wouldn&#39;t actually reach &#39;low earth-orbit&#39;, a place that does not exist.

<p>This is (partially) true for airplanes. However, rockets use rocket engines, which usually become more &quot;effective&quot; (efficient would be a better term) the lower the pressure is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s pretty easy actually if you accept Newton&#39;s laws of motion, expecially the third: the conservation of momentum. A rocket engine burns propellants and accelerates a flux of mass out of a nozzle. The force it generates can be calculated using said law of motion:</p>

<p>F=dq/dt=d(m•v)/dt=v*dm/dt</p>

<p>Where F is the force generated by the engine, v is the speed of the exhausts, and dm/dt the flow of mass of said exhausts. Now, assuming constant throttle, the flux of exhausts is constant because, for the conservation of mass, it&#39;s equal to the flux of propellant pumped into the engine. Assuming a well designed output nozzle, the speed of the exhausts depends basically on the pressure differential between the inside of the combustion chamber and the outside world: the less the external pressure, the more easily the exhaust fumes can exit the nozzle, so they increase the output speed and, for the above formula, the specific thrust (impulse).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s what I found:  </p>

<p>A rocket obtains thrust by the principle of action and reaction (Newton&#39;s third law). <strong>As the rocket propellant ignites, it experiences a very large acceleration and exits the back of the rocket (as exhaust)</strong> at a very high velocity. <strong>This backwards acceleration of the exhaust exerts a &quot;push&quot; force on the rocket in the opposite direction, causing the rocket to accelerate forward.</strong> This is the essential principle behind the physics of rockets, and how rockets work.  </p>

<p>Now here&#39;s the problem that even your description did not answer:  </p>

<p>When there is no air to push against, it doesn&#39;t matter if the exhaust is enormous or &quot;easily exiting the nozzle&quot; -- <strong>it has NOTHING to push against in a vacuum</strong> so &quot;backward acceleration of exhaust&quot; CANNOT &quot;create a push force on the rocket in the opposite direction.&quot;  </p>

<p>Did you try to hide a non-answer in your reply ?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no need to &quot;push against&quot; anything to create thrust. Or better yet, the rocket is pushing against his own exhaust gas, accelerating them on the opposite direction he&#39;s going. The very definition you pasted doesn&#39;t mention anything about requiring a medium to push against.</p>

<p>Imagine to fire a gun: you get recoil, right? Now imagine firing a gun in space: you still get recoil, because by the conservation of momentum accelerating a bullet creates a force on the opposite direction of the acceleration, air has nothing to do with it. A rocket engine &quot;fires&quot; a continuous stream of mass backward, and this pushes the rocket forward, no need of anything else really.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>sorry, you&#39;re the only person to describe a rocket like a bullet exiting a gun.  Backward exhaust creating and equal and opposite push force REQUIRES something to push AGAINST, namely an atmosphere with air.  </p>

<p>If a rocket worked as a chemical explosion in a chamber, as a gun works, then the explanation for how a rocket works would not include: &quot;Backward exhaust (exiting the rocket) creates an opposite PUSH on the rocket.&quot;  </p>

<p>Read up on Newton&#39;s Third Law, the sole fact that exhaust is leaving rocket suffices that there is &#39;movement&#39; in the opposite direction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mass is projected backwards, force is created forward. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s the obvious meaning of the definition you just wrote, external medium is not mentioned at all. I can&#39;t see what makes you think otherwise, you keep writing definitions that do NOT support what you&#39;re saying.</p>

<p>Want to experiment it yourself? Take two toy rockets and fly them at different altitudes, measuring the flight time and/or altitude reached. You&#39;ll notice that the higher you go, the longer and higher the rocket goes. Or create a big void chamber and measure the force generated by the rockets at different pressures, you&#39;ll see that the lower the pressure, the higher the thrust.</p>

<p>You call foul while you&#39;re not bringing even a bit of support to your claims? Please back your claim that the action-reaction principle needs an external medium to work, or you&#39;re the one disinforming here.</p>

<p>No it doesn&#39;t you fool. It works because of the conservation of momentum. The mass of fuel exits the nozzle with a velocity and the momentum of the fuel is conserved by pushing the rocket with equal and opposite momentum. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most obvious clue of fuckery is the simple fact that at no point in any of the Apollo missions did anyone think to capture what would have had to be among the most brilliant visual displays any human being had ever seen.  Hundreds if not thousands of photos and not a single star?  Not even one picture?  But anyway I&#39;ll bite.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not denying that it&#39;s possible to take a picture where no stars are visible, I&#39;m saying that this explanation isn&#39;t sufficient when looking at the Apollo missions.</p>

<p>NASA has stated that a lot of the pictures were improperly exposed and thus would have had to use different exposure settings.  NASA has also publicly stated that they used many different exposure times deliberately, even going so far as to say that they &quot;pre-calculated&quot; the necessary exposure times before the missions, again meaning that many different exposure settings would have been used.  And yet none of these different exposure times show a hint of a star anywhere.  How short do you imagine an exposure would need to be to <em>not</em> pick up on the thousands of stars burning brighter than any stars have ever burned on earth (where most cameras will pick up stars in a clear sky within seconds tops)?</p>

<p>There are quite a few Apollo photos which are clearly not well-lit, like <a href="http://imgur.com/r4C6Okp">this one</a> or <a href="http://imgur.com/SJYyWVT">this one.</a>  These would have required longer exposures.  The stars on the Moon&#39;s surface would have to be spectacularly bright, as NASA has also publicly stated, and would clearly have been the brightest objects in the frame for both of these pictures - and yet not even a hint of one anywhere.</p>
