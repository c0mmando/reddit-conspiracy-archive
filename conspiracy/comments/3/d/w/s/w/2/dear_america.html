    <div class="md"><p>I met a former helicopter pilot who was living in China. He had been born to folks stationed on a US military base in Germany. </p>

<p>He says his job was mainly picking up heroin and delivering it. The would make big shows of destroying small amounts of it, where the bulk went he didn&#39;t know. He didn&#39;t mind this too much, but after flying a chopper so that people could shoot at kids, he said fuck it. Used his German passport and went AWOL. He was arrested on arrival in Germany and spent six months in jail while the Germans decided whether or not to hand him over to the US. One day, they brought him to the airport and he bought a ticket to China.</p>

<p>How true is hard to say, but he definitely had a German passport and he flew helicopters from Hong Kong to Macau while I knew him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>suicided</strong>. A verb. A term used in the conspiracy community to make light of the idea that some prominent members of thr conspiracy community or other communities who have evidence, or speak out against poowerful people and institutions, &#39;allegedly&#39; committ suicide or die in strange accidents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get that, but Pat Tillman&#39;s death was caused by &quot;friendly fire&quot;. The circumstances leading up to his death are strange enough, but as far as I know, suiciding someone involves making it look like the victim either intentionally killed themself or caused their own death. It&#39;s quite clear he was killed by someone else, so the next step further would be outright murder. The proven conspiracy here is how they attempted to cover up the way he died so they could continue to use him as a recruiting tool. Maybe I&#39;m not as up to date with the latest terminology, but it doesn&#39;t sound right (to me) to say <em>suicided</em> in this case. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Suicided sounds right. He was exposing the situation he was in through letters home and expressed his wish to further expose it upon return. </p>

<p>He gets put into a position that ensures his death and its reported as a heroic act that ended with him killed by the enemy. They attempted to &quot;suicide&quot; him in print. Only later revelations make it clear that it was murder.</p>

<p>This is no different than other suicided figures, except that it was exposed. Saying he wasn&#39;t suicided disconnects his case with similar unexposed cases. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. It makes more sense if you look at it as the preconceived attempt to spin his death.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at Jawenko, the demolition expert who validated the controlled demolition of WTC 7. He crashed on his way home from church into a tree and died. </p>

<p>Was he suicided? There&#39;s no way I can say. But it doesn&#39;t fit the typical car accident. I assume he wasn&#39;t intoxicated, he knew the road well, it wasn&#39;t high speed, it was in the middle of the day. On the other hand, if I say he was suicided, I sound like a fool. I sound like the people who believe OBL did 9/11 without any evidence.</p>

<p>Had Tillman been an average soldier, then we most likely would have believed he died in a heroic effort in the heat of battle. But Tillman was well-known, had resources and his parents went hard with his letters home. </p>

<p>What this allows us to do is compare the official story with the true story. In comparison, we can see he was made to die in a way that could be excused. </p>

<p>If Jawenko could be proven to have been &quot;suicided&quot; rather than accidentally killed, we would call it murder or assisination. It doesn&#39;t change the fact that, were his death helped along, that it was meant to appear as an accidental death.</p>

I just let my hardwired notion of what I&#39;ve been taught to believe suicide is, the selfish act of taking ones own life, get in the way of seeing that the initial narrative of him sacrificing his life to save his troops was the suicide by claiming he intentionally let himself be killed for the cause.

<p>WW2 wasn&#39;t good guys vs bad guys... it was a power struggle amongst several socialist/fascist regimes-- FDR, Hitler, Churchill, Stalin, Mussolini.  One of the most notable features of socialism is war, and an inability to get along with others.</p>

<p>It happens every time, and you&#39;re seeing it happen again right now-- China, Iran, USA, Russia.  None of these countries are free market, they&#39;re all one flavor or another of socialism, and all of them want to be the last man even if it means they only rule over a nuclear wasteland.</p>

<p>Lots of other countries and people like us in many ways.  Many of them would be worse off if USA didn&#39;t exist, or didn&#39;t have the power it does.  I meet people all the time who would like to immigrate to USA.  Investors everywhere consider USA safest place to invest, consider US govt debt a safe investment (as shown by the low interest rates on it).</p>

<p>USA has many problems.  For such a rich, lucky country, we should be doing much better.  Our military is ENORMOUSLY overgrown, and bad for us.  We should go to universal single-payer healthcare.  Our tax and campaign finance systems are far too tilted toward the rich.  We have huge problems with religion and ideology.  We murder each other at rates 2x to 6x those of other major Western countries, yet refuse to do anything about it.</p>

<p>Oh you mean like how your government dumps tonnes and tonnes of super addictive substances into impoverished communities and extracts cash from them to fund their paramilitary activities abroad? Or do you mean the massive social victory of being allowed to smoke a plant that grows naturally on this planet by our benevolent masters.</p>

<p>Drugs are in the top 5 markets of the world and with their supply being monopolised by corrupt entities who dictate global policies regarding them.</p>

<p>Now they reap the benefit of controlling the market, use them as a weapon for targeting minorities, use them as a divisive tool for society, restrict the dialogue on consciousness and generally maintain the system of domination and control. </p>

<p>Then a bunch of middle class white kids get to come online from their portable electronic devices and endorse the current system because of how well it benefits them. </p>

<p>Things don&#39;t need to be fixed, they need to be completely rebuilt so that there is never any authoritarian figures whom dictate how you can live your life. </p>

<p>In many respects much of the developing world has this down better than the pinnacle of western democracy the USA. Most people there are happier than those in the USA, despite their apparent lacking of material possessions. Which measure are you using to support you assertion that the average US citizen has a better life? Looks like there&#39;s a lot more debt slaves in America to me.</p>

It&#39;s disgusting that we can&#39;t smoke weed freely and it&#39;s disturbing to find out how our system exploits low income low socio economic populations. I agree 100% with you. Let me as you how old are you and do you vote? I am a millennial, 26.my generation is the largest voting eligible generation by population, yet something like 10% or some ridiculously low percent actually vote. We need to come together as a generation and vote out the politician in office that have been bought and paid for. Only way stuff you want will happen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just weed though. It&#39;s a complete lock down on the exploration of consciousness. It&#39;s all designed to keep us in limited consciousness, and create separateness and then to agitate us until we consume to satiate our artificial desires. </p>

<p>I&#39;m 29 and from Australia so we have a different set up with respect to voting. We have compulsory voting and I think that&#39;s actually a problem. Too many apathetic people are shuffled into the voting box and simply rely upon their media brainwashing as the heuristic for determining who to vote for. Last time I voted for a minority party who was focused on issues of privacy, drug law reform, environment and some other issues but I&#39;m under no delusions that my vote counts in any way. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a fool&#39;s game to think that voting matters. If the votes don&#39;t put in the right person they just rig the votes to make it so a la Bush in Florida. </p>

<p>The only real way to get what you want to happen is direct action. Create communities, create decentralised technologies that can make government redundant, create art and culture which inspires people and makes them open their eyes or create themselves, do your own science, grow your own food or participate in networks who do, gift where possible, shun money and much more. </p>

<p>We most definitely are not going to get the change we deserve from voting. The very notion of representative democracy is a sham. We need to move towards direct/participatory democracy where through technology we can all have a voice in policy development and invert the model from one in which they can tax us and then we are forced to trust them to act in our best interest with the revenue collected. We need to transition to a crowd sourcing model where initiatives are floated, funded from the community and then implemented with ultimate transparency and accountability. </p>

<p>But I don&#39;t think USA is &quot;imperialist&quot;.  We don&#39;t want to take over other countries or make them dependent.

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone is the bad guys. I am a member of the active duty military, a Navy Corpsman. The reason why people kill themselves isn&#39;t because America is secretly evil, it is because taking someone&#39;s life in any context fucks up people&#39;s heads. Supporting the troops doesn&#39;t mean supporting their military campaigns, it means supporting the individual men and women.</p>

<p>Get your head out of your ass. Pull off the anonimoos mask. America is just one of many countries doing the same fucked up things as all the major countries, such as China, the UK,and Russia do. Soldiers killing themselves is not related to politics, it is that they cannot look at a piece of trash on the road without thinking that it may be a possible IED. It is related to the fact that they ended someone&#39;s existance on the earth, someone who had a family and hopes and aspirations. </p>

<p>The reason the majority of our soldiers are killing themselves is because the VA is pumping them full of &quot;anti&quot; depressant drug cocktails.  The same drugs that have been shown to be able to make even healthy people suicidal.  <a href="http://abc7chicago.com/news/with-22-suicides-per-day-va-hit-with-scathing-evaluation-/777211/">Even the US government itself recently did a VA study and confirmed that the VA needed to be more cautious when prescribing these drugs.</a>.  That article even shows that a 29 year old Marine sniper was prescribed a combination of 20 antidepressant drugs before he killed himself.  And that type of treatment was found to be not that uncommon.  Its crazy.  The pharmaceutical companies have taken over the VA system.</p>

<p>Nope.  Why on earth should we support individuals who choose to join the military and fight for the rich and powerful so they can become more rich and powerful?  The average person is not the one who benefits from these endeavours... but you get your money and GI bills... etc, right?</p>

<p>At this point, there is enough information out there to understand exactly what it is you are doing when you are in the military.  So now that person is either just that dumb, willfully ignorant, or simply does not care.  Then, the rest of us are forced to pay for them through taxation that does nothing to create any wealth or make things better for the world.  Are we supposed to give everyone a pass for committing evils because &quot;they gotta eat too!&quot;?  Most people don&#39;t make a living out of supporting corrupt and imperialistic governments.

It&#39;s time to rebuild from the GROUND UP. First launch sattelites and get free communications and internet WORLDWIDE. Then, we build systems that create a transparent government that is controlled by the people for the people on the internet. No more secrets. They proven that national security is just a cover for shady deals and to keep everyone in the dark about important matters like 9/11. We don&#39;t need anyone being the middle man for us anymore.</p>

<p>We live in an age where people are educated enough and we have the technological ability to create an infrastructure so that we decide what is important and we decided how we will fix it OURSELVES. </p>

<p>Well said.  I&#39;m more and more convinced though that this is not possible while having a coercive government at the top.  Voluntarism is the only way forward IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. Nobody can buy out Donald Trump.  He&#39;s already made his money BEFORE going to Washington DC (oops, is that now a racist epithet? ), and can&#39;t be bought and paid for. </p>

<p>I&#39;m less convinced that all elections aren&#39;t completely rigged and fraudulent though.  It&#39;s looking like the ruling elite have chosen Jeb Bush or Hillary Clinton already.  Sigh.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s very refreshing to hear someone of his statue be so politically incorrect on such a large platform.  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3dwzr0/obama_cant_take_the_truth/">Watch</a> Ben Carson talk about PC and see how uncomfortable Obama gets.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just weed though. It&#39;s a complete lock down on the exploration of consciousness. It&#39;s all designed to keep us in limited consciousness, and create separateness and then to agitate us until we consume to satiate our artificial desires. </p>

<p>I&#39;m 29 and from Australia so we have a different set up with respect to voting. We have compulsory voting and I think that&#39;s actually a problem. Too many apathetic people are shuffled into the voting box and simply rely upon their media brainwashing as the heuristic for determining who to vote for. Last time I voted for a minority party who was focused on issues of privacy, drug law reform, environment and some other issues but I&#39;m under no delusions that my vote counts in any way. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a fool&#39;s game to think that voting matters. If the votes don&#39;t put in the right person they just rig the votes to make it so a la Bush in Florida. </p>

<p>The only real way to get what you want to happen is direct action. Create communities, create decentralised technologies that can make government redundant, create art and culture which inspires people and makes them open their eyes or create themselves, do your own science, grow your own food or participate in networks who do, gift where possible, shun money and much more. </p>

<p>We most definitely are not going to get the change we deserve from voting. The very notion of representative democracy is a sham. We need to move towards direct/participatory democracy where through technology we can all have a voice in policy development and invert the model from one in which they can tax us and then we are forced to trust them to act in our best interest with the revenue collected. We need to transition to a crowd sourcing model where initiatives are floated, funded from the community and then implemented with ultimate transparency and accountability. </p>
