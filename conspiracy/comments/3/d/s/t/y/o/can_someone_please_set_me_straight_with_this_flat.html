       I've been seeing a lot of posts about it but haven't had the time, phone data nor stomach to sit thru a YouTube video about it. Is there any grounding to this conspiracy? I respect this sub to have the most intelligent people on it but this is just crazy to me. Is it legit? WW2 has taught me that the two front war would only be possible if it was round. Soooo that right there should be enough...rigghhht???

       You don't need anyone to help you get it straight. Ignore it. I have no problem with people who want to believe that, but seriously, this is not something worth exploring for most of us. And that's the charitable way to put it.

       Very true! I suppose my brain is so tired of the same old Israel is bad, jade helm, ISIS is US sponsored type of conspiracy that are obviously true and really needs no more discussion because the facts are out in the open but the world narrative dosnt care. This was just something new that somehow had multiple online support for some strange reason. Perhaps I'm trying to distract myself because I'm so angry the obvious conspiracy theories are still hard for the general public to grasp.

       My ex boyfriend and I watched some flat earth videos for a laugh. It was basically full of footage of the horizon of an ocean and the video's creator drawing lines across said horizon and saying, in so many words, "See?! It's straight! The earth is flat." It was...interesting.

       You can approach the issue without letting religion come into it.  The topic is about a physical property of the world around you.  Consider the concrete arguments about physical properties and ignore the religious crap.
      </p>
      <p>
       To the OP, I don't recommend this approach to any topic.  If you ask for people to tell you what to think, then you just know what you are told.  This subreddit isn't one unified voice.  People are here for various reasons and hold a range of views on various topics.  If you allow the weighted average of the comment section or voting to decide your opinion on something then you are susceptible to being misled by programs like JTRIG:

        https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/
       </a>
       This is a topic that almost without a doubt has controlled agents involved in leading it.  Don't look for leaders to follow.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is more work to go through the process of looking for yourself for sure.  From your question about ww2 and two front war it is clear you haven't even seen the basics of how the standard flat earth model is laid out.  I don't think the standard flat earth model works completely, but neither does the official spinning globe.  Keep in mind that disproving one is not direct proof of the other.  A lot of the arguments for flat earth are really just contradictions in the official spinning globe model.   It may be a false choice to reduce the discussion to those two options.

       Prove it.  I'm not being a douche, I'm just lazy. I trust no one.  Everything is a lie.  Amuse me. I'm bored with 9/11 and geo engineering truths

       Learn some physics. The most uniform energy distribution of a (strong) gravitational well is a sphere. You don't need him to prove it, you can prove it yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Roughly speaking,
The sun's a sphere, the moon's a sphere, mercury is a sphere, venus is a sphere, mars is a sphere, jupiter is ?? a sphere. Saturn happens to be a sphere with concentric asteroids in orbits; Uranus, a sphere. Neptune is a sphere, and most recently, Pluto is a sphere. Don't forget Charon and the countless other spheres of circular spheriness.

       You say you trust no one, why? Maybe you would trust in math and deductive reasoning? At least that's what I do every time I power my laptop.

       I'll spare you the burden of proof, for a moment, and just point out that your 'argument' has nothing substantial to it. Well other than blah x6, well said.

       I don't know what to tell you, this information is out there, I'm not gonna find it for you... My first and last piece of advice: keep an open mind and use your abilities of discernment to find what is true. Good luck.
