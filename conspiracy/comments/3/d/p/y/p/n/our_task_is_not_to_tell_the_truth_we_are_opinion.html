<p>Seriously, watching the news reminds me of Harrison Bergeron. It&#39;s like network execs go out of their way to find the dumbest, most vapid, pretty pieces of meat to read off their cue cards. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, maybe now, but Walter Cronkite was not dumb or vapid. He may definitely have been a tool of the establishment, or maybe not. One of the key turning points in the Vietnam war was when Cronkite told America how shitty things were going. </p>

<p>But the people we have now are terrifying. I don&#39;t watch any television news, but I see the lowlights of Don Lemon and Wolf Blitzer and all the clowns at FOX. Crazy.</p>

Clowns are harmless. Today&#39;s journalists are tools of the owner-class. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it&#39;s in the extra features of Oliver Stone&#39;s <em>JFK</em>, Walter Cronkite was interviewed and asked why he never suspected or entertained the notion that JFK was killed as the result of a conspiracy.  I nearly fell out of my chair when Cronkite replied: &quot;That&#39;s too Machiavellian for our people.&quot;  That&#39;s one of the most irresponsible things I&#39;ve ever heard -- alongside Peter Jennings on the morning of 9/11, trying to fill time before the collapses and wondering aloud if the planes that slammed into the WTC buildings were flown by two nutjobs who had no connection to each other -- that the crashes WERE NOT connected.  I heard it with my own ears.  It was as though he were trying to lay an early foundation for 9/11&#39;s version of the Warren Commission Report.  I&#39;ve had no use for mainstream news and its &quot;journalists&quot; since before 9/11.</p>
