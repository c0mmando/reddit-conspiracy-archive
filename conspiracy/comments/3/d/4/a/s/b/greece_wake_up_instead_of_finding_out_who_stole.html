    <div class="md"><p>I assume the point was for greece to get scared and vote for EU requests. <strong>the government would had been forced to do &quot;what the country want&quot;</strong> even if they officially didn&#39;t like it.</p>

<p>clues on this are provided by the fact that there were no greece proposals for a few days after the vote and that their finance minister got away with some stupid excuse off &quot;eu doesn&#39;t like me so I go to the beach&quot; which make no fucking sense whatsoever. they had no plan for &quot;hey we won the referendum&quot;</p>

<p>yet after a few days they get back with the same proposals eu sent to them and the referendum voted upon.</p>

<p>also this is not the first time tsipras gets greece into more debt to save from debt</p>

<p>all is not lost as is very likely that the government will split in the next hours/few days and when this happens, the people will get into the streets. we will see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it valid to say the money was &quot;stolen&quot; ?  I&#39;m sure there was plenty of corruption, but didn&#39;t most of the money go into govt services and govt employment, while people weren&#39;t paying enough taxes to support those things ?  Ultimately, Greeks were having a big chunk of their government paid for with borrowed money, so the taxpayers are the ones who &quot;stole&quot; the money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, no. Go check up your own sources, there&#39;s plenty available (Google).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>all of the money goes through banks, one way or another</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is a moronic statement. Similar to all the water we drink has had somebody pissing in it at some point. </p>

<p>The fact is that 50% of the money  (I think, maybe more) went directly to banks to ensure that <strong>they couldn&#39;t fail</strong>. . Again, the mighty Google could be your friend here (or try Bing, w/e). Come back with sources to say it definitely wasn&#39;t sent directly to the banks. <strong>I&#39;d be interested</strong> to see them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, I guess you don&#39;t have a source handy ?</p>

<p>If money &quot;goes to a bank to keep it from failing&quot;, is that good for depositors and loan-holders ?  Normal people and businesses, in other words ?  They get to keep their savings, keep their jobs, keep their businesses alive ?</p>
