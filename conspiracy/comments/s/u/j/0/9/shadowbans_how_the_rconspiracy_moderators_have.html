<p>OLD VERSION (no longer used, because people aren&#39;t getting it)</p>

<hr/>

<p>You have been shadowbanned by an admin. Therefore, until you resolve this matter, you have been banned from this subreddit.</p>

<p>This is NOT a disciplinary ban.</p>

<p>NEW VERSION (trying to encourage people to understand more clearly)</p>

<p>Your comment got caught in the filter. Here is why that happened.</p>

<p>You have been shadowbanned by an admin (I am not an admin. I am a lowly subreddit moderator. I have no idea why this happened).</p>

<p>Nonetheless, until you resolve this matter, you have been banned from this subreddit.</p>

<p>This is NOT a disciplinary ban.</p>

<p>For a fuller explanation of the differences between admin and moderator, and between shadowban and ban, see this post: <a href="http://redd.it/suj09">http://redd.it/suj09</a></p>

<p>EXPLANATION</p>

<hr/>

<p>The purpose of this post is to explain this clearly both for our subscribers and for use as a linkable reference to avoid future explanations.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>What is a shadowban?</strong></p>

<p>A shadowban (or &quot;ninja ban&quot;) is an administrative action available only to the &quot;admins&quot; (i.e., the reddit, inc. employees). Only the admins can ever explain why they use it. </p>

<p>The net result is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the user in question cannot tell that they&#39;ve been banned - they can still login, post, comment, vote, etc. - i.e., everything &quot;appears normal&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>if anyone else (or anyone not logged in) looks at their overview, the account does not exist. (if you suspect you might be shadowbanned, simply go to your overview page while not logged in. that will usually answer your question definitively)</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>And, most relevant to this message ...</em></p>

<ul>
<li>all of the submissions and comments of a shadowbanned account are immediately filtered and placed into the modqueue for adjudication. <del>And, even if approved, they&#39;re not visible to the general viewing public unless a direct link to the comment is provided.</del> (qhyg2 corrected me, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/suj09/shadowbans_how_the_rconspiracy_moderators_have/c4h3n8s">below</a>, but didn&#39;t change the relevant portion to this problem - we have to deal with this for <em>every</em> shadowbanned user, not just the ones we think would be &quot;safe&quot; in our subreddit)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>AND</em></p>

<ul>
<li>it is not easy to contact a shadowbanned account because they can&#39;t be PM&#39;d. However, they can see responses to self-posts and comments (all of which are filtered, see above).</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Our agreement among the Moderators</strong></p>

<p>Our solution to this conundrum in r/conspiracy is to simply ban the username from our subreddit, which accomplishes two primary goals.</p>

<p>1) It ends the flow of stuff from that account in our modqueue (without making them an approved submitter, possibly turning a spammer loose in our subreddit), and...</p>

<p>2) It notifies the user in question of their status, definitively (as in: we, <em>the moderators of this subreddit</em>, cannot fix this).</p>

<p><strong>This is NOT a disciplinary ban</strong>. This is a practical solution to a problem that we, the moderators, cannot fix.</p>

<p>There are two options available to the user at this point:</p>

<p>1) Appeal to the admins - the reddit, inc. employees who run the website (I have no idea how to do that, don&#39;t ask me.), or...</p>

<p>2) Simply make a new account. (Unless you have some sentimental attachment to the banned username, this is probably the route to go. Pretty much guaranteed to solve the immediate problem, if you aren&#39;t bordering on an IP ban as well.)</p>

<hr/>

<p>FOOTNOTE: The admins probably don&#39;t appreciate us doing this, just like they probably don&#39;t appreciate us publishing all of our post removals in <a href="/r/uncensorship">/r/uncensorship</a>. But this is how we roll here, and we don&#39;t feel we should be obligated to act as never-ending &quot;default cover-up accomplices&quot; to these forms of &quot;hiding stuff&quot;.</p>

<p>As a user who was previously shadow-banned and discovered this while asking a mod in another subreddit to approve a post I had thought was spam-filtered, I can tell you that if a subreddit approves a shadow-banned user&#39;s comments or submissions, they <em>will</em> show up in that subreddit.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>their stuff still comes through the filter thereafter (you can&#39;t train the filter to stop filtering shadowbanned users).</p></li>
<li><p>they need to be notified that the mods don&#39;t like dealing with it every time they post or comment, and that the mods can&#39;t undo the shadowban. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>tl;dr: the mods can only <em>compensate</em> for it (and we&#39;d have to do that compensation for every post/comment), we can&#39;t <em>fix</em> it ... except this method of notification.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Potentially counter-intuitive if the person actually did something to earn the shadowban in the first place (e.g., if they&#39;re blog spamming from time to time, we don&#39;t want to make them an approved submitter - we want to give them a &quot;wake up call&quot;).</p>

<p>Formalizing the ban in our subreddit may not be ideal for every situation. But it is equal, fair, and places the responsibility where it needs to be: on the user (we can&#39;t undo the shadowban - the admins don&#39;t even respond to our PMs if we request assistance ... we&#39;re no more powerful or important than the average user).</p>

<p>Right now this subreddit only has a handful of approved submitters and, as near as I can tell from glancing, they&#39;re all long-term members of this community in good standing. Adding random shadowbanned people to this list probably isn&#39;t the best approach.</p>

<p>EDIT: Thank you for raising these points. This latter point was discussed, by the way, but we didn&#39;t think it was wise. I&#39;ve made some edits to the post above to reference these matters. Again, thanks for bringing them up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I waited until well after this post had drifted off the front page of this subreddit before responding, because I didn&#39;t want to be seen as an instigator of controversy. But, I do have a few serious questions for you about this.</p>

<p>First, I have no idea if you are an alt of qghy2, the moderator account present in many (half or more?) of the default subreddits (the &quot;biggies&quot;, so to speak - million plus users). But, let&#39;s pretend, just for the sake of discussion that you are that person. </p>

<p>Is this really how you would deal with shadowbans in such highly trafficked subreddits? Individually evaluate every shadowban to see if you &quot;want that person&quot; in your subreddit and <em>make them an approved submitter</em>, and then leave them shadowbanned throughout the rest of reddit <em>without informing them of the shadowban</em>? </p>

<p>Also, would you make that evaluation every time a shadowbanned submission/comment comes through your modqueue? Or only if you thought the comment was particularly clever or insightful (thus increasing the popularity of the subreddit)?</p>

<p>The reason I ask is that I know enough about the frequency of shadowbans to know that it would be a tremendous amount of work to do what you suggest in a larger subreddit. It also seems a little callous to only do it for people you think &quot;deserve it&quot; based on one or two comments. I saw a shadowban just recently that had 1 link karma, 0 comment karma, and was a user for 1400+ days (meaning they&#39;d been shadowbanned for 4 years without anyone telling them). Don&#39;t you think everyone who&#39;s been shadowbanned deserves the opportunity to know that and to try to adjust their behavior to avoid it in the future?</p>

<p>Just trying to figure out the rationale you have for justifying selectively approving shadowbanned users in a subreddit, but not informing them of their ban. That seems almost as creepy as the shadowban itself, in my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is highly effective for fighting bots and a great many of the amateur clone spammers (who are just clueless idiots). </p>

<p>But, it&#39;s kind of a slap in the face for an actual user who thinks they&#39;re participating (I saw a post many months ago from a guy who discovered - on his own - that he&#39;d been ninja banned for an entire year without realizing it. &lt;-- this just seems cruel.)</p>

<p>So,  yeah. We agree. This removes the &quot;sneakiness&quot; part and washes our hands of it (in two senses: we&#39;re not being sneaky, and it never was our problem anyway).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so I&#39;ve got a couple of questions about this after seeing this pop up in a thread.</p>

<p>First, I get the concept.  I am totally on-board with letting users know they&#39;ve been banned, rather than relying on shadowbanning.  It makes perfect sense, and sounds like a good system.</p>

<p>What I don&#39;t understand is:</p>

<p>(1)  How is this not disciplinary?  Isn&#39;t the point of a ban (any ban) to discipline the user?  Is there something I&#39;m missing?</p>

<p>(2)  I saw a user get banned <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/syb5l/rfk_assassination_witness_there_was_a_second/c4iel33">in this thread</a>, and found a ban to be a bit much for the comment.  (just my opinion).  Personally I think bans should be reserved for spam, threats, and other more egregious violations.  I guess it&#39;s good that we now know that the user was banned, instead of them just disappearing, but do we really want to let people never post again for comments that are typically found in a conspiracy forum?  Just asking for some feedback.  </p>

<p>Thanks for being open about the process though, it is definitely a step forward.</p>

<p>I saw a user get banned in this thread, and found a ban to be a bit much for the comment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are making a connection that doesn&#39;t exist. The ban was not for the content of the comment. I explained this to you in that thread.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Personally I think bans should be reserved for [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The moderators agreed to this by a substantial majority. (Three abstained, all others agreed [and, at the time, we had an additional mod who also agreed]. So, it was like 7 in favor, 0 objection, 3 abstained [two of whom have interjected when they feel it is necessary, and one that is in an extended state of inactivity]). So, I guess we think that the tools that are available to us are ours to use as we see appropriate and productively useful. As a result of our more liberal philosophy, many shadowbanned users are now being granted a second chance at life throughout reddit, not just r/conspiracy.</p>

<p>The problem with approving the individual comments is that it doesn&#39;t motivate the individual to correct the situation (which is outside of our control). Making a new username isn&#39;t that difficult. Avoiding having it shadowbanned, well... that all depends on the individual, but it&#39;s still not our problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, I was so confused.  </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t understand that the admins were doing the banning.  </p>

<p>I realize it says that in the post (which I read several times), but when you read it, and then the end result is that you (the moderators) are the ones doing the banning, the first part got lost in translation for me, and somehow I assumed that all of the actions were the result of the moderators of the subreddit.</p>

<p>Thanks for clearing that up, I think I won&#39;t be the last person to be confused, but it&#39;s a sticky problem to deal with, and I&#39;m glad to see something being actively done about this.</p>

<p>Thanks for your time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;(1) How is this not disciplinary? Isn&#39;t the point of a ban (any ban) to discipline the user? Is there something I&#39;m missing?&quot; I agree. This seems to suggest that its a personal grudge. Or a set of rules that are not given to the general public.</p>

<p>Either way its a land mine, and the path is open to corruption of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you might mis-understand (like I did originally)</p>

<p>The ban is done by the admins (or their spam-filtering system).</p>

<p>The users don&#39;t know that no-one can see their post, so the moderators here are informing these users that they&#39;ve been banned so they can at least try and figure out why, or create a new account or something.</p>

<p>Otherwise they&#39;d just keep posting forever, but their posts would be invisible to everyone else.</p>
