        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The samurai must maintain his faith in his beliefs, even as the social or political climate shifts and alters. He must be patient, must act in a manner that may at times seem irrational or illogical, must resist the temptations of instant gratification, and must work towards fulfilling what may seem to be an impossible idea.</p>

<p>As a result, the samurai is often something of an outsider, a rebellious figure because he refuses to conform to the habits of the day.</p>

<p>(Takahiro Kitamura) </p>

<p>We are the modern day samurai. Ride your horse along the edge of the sword. Hide yourself in the middle of the flames. Blossoms of the fruit tree will bloom in the fire. The sun rises in the evening.</p>

<p>The thing you are talking about here in the code of Bushido is one of seven/ten ideas of the code, loyalty!</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>&quot;Recent scholarship in both Japan and abroad has focused on differences between the samurai class and the bushidō theories that developed in modern Japan. Bushidō in the prewar period was often emperor-centered and placed much greater value on the virtues of loyalty and self-sacrifice than did many Tokugawa-era interpretations.[10] <strong>Bushidō was used as a propaganda tool by the government and military, who doctored it to suit their needs.[11] Scholars of Japanese history agree that the bushidō that spread throughout modern Japan was not simply a continuation of earlier traditions.</strong>&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a good set of virtues that can be used for a bad purpose. Its all in the way you use it. If you use it with the evolution of humanity as your main loyalty, only good can come out of it, regardless of people who have used it as a propaganda tool. It was used widely for terrible purposes, because when following the code of Bushido, people got shit DONE. When you apply it to a good purpose, you still get shit done =)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.koryu.com/library/kfriday2.html">http://www.koryu.com/library/kfriday2.html</a>   I highly suggest reading this whole article. </p>

<p>The &quot;code of Bushido&quot; did not exist in feudal japan, but after the samurai were outlawed, it was how some came to categorize the elite warriors from the dishonorable. </p>

<p>edit: &quot;Bushidō expanded and formalized the earlier code of the samurai&quot; also on the wiki. Thought it was a neat sentence to add =)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, I know I&#39;m joining this conversation somewhat late.  You don&#39;t need words of encouragement from me, I know this but have seen some of your comments recently and would like to offer some positive words for you.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t write like most other people, and many people seem unable to appreciate why.  I shared some videos from Adampants (it would seem nobody else on this subreddit had watched them before I shared them, and even after sharing them, not many saw them but that&#39;s ok).  Oceanlols gave an analogy which I will quote.  I&#39;ll share metaphor from one of Adampants&#39; videos.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I agree with all these things, but what does that have to do with being able to communicate those treasures in an effective way so as to share them easily with others? Its like trying to shove a cd into a USB port. You must first convert it for it to be understood by most people, and on the other hand, some people have both a cd player AND a USB port.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think a better analogy for your speech style is like a broadband connection trying to upload to a 56k modem.  I found a youtube link, I think you might like it :).  He gives the analogy at 2m 28s into the video.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKRK5BDVXlI&amp;amp;feature=results_video&amp;amp;playnext=1&amp;amp;list=PL073C217A7B348155&amp;amp;t=1m50s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKRK5BDVXlI&amp;amp;feature=results_video&amp;amp;playnext=1&amp;amp;list=PL073C217A7B348155&amp;amp;t=1m50s</a></p>

<p>At another time in this video series (&quot;Knowledge&quot;), he gave an analogy of one &quot;in the know&quot; practically needing many mouths talking at the same time in order to tell others &quot;the truth&quot; (with all the detail, meaning, and wisdom still intact).  The alternative is metaphor, which condenses the truth but isn&#39;t easily decoded by everyone.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l367fxRrOIc&amp;amp;feature=autoplay&amp;amp;list=PL073C217A7B348155&amp;amp;playnext=2&amp;amp;t=7m17s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l367fxRrOIc&amp;amp;feature=autoplay&amp;amp;list=PL073C217A7B348155&amp;amp;playnext=2&amp;amp;t=7m17s</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>To tell you what I know, I would need 500 mouths and have to be able to speak 500 different sentences simultaneously to express what I know, and you would need to be able to interpret 500 sentences simultaneously</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps like the sages of all age, we have unbridled capacity to organize a true virtuous  mind, expand a generous heart and calibrate our bodies. In this time, as in times prior, the walls of tyranny intrap the mind-body-spirit of many and they will perish without purpose. Under duress we must harmonize with the resonances of nature, which sing the same songs of transformation.  We will act keenly to remove each struggle. Time is only now, forever; the light of each sun brings perfect judgment. 
Must we wander with will for unity? We may only be masters of one.</p>
