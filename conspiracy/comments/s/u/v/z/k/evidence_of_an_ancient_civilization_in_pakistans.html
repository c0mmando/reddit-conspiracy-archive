       I found out about this on Ancient Aliens. So apparently there was an ancient civilization in what is now Pakistan built around 2600 BC. The strange thing about this civilization is that it is apparently highly irradiated and blocked off from the public. From there it just gets stranger.
      </p>
      <p>
       The area in Rajasthan, India, is covered with a layer of radioactive ash. There are historical accounts of an incredible battle occurring in India in the Mahabharata. These speak of
       <em>
        aircraft
       </em>
       launching weapons that destroyed the cities of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa reminiscent of an eyewitness report of a nuclear bomb. They described the brightness of the blast, the column of rising smoke and fire, the fallout, intensive shock waves and heat waves, the appearance of the victims, and the effects of radiation poisoning.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the city of Mohenjo-daro, the lower strata remains have more advanced art and architecture than the upper levels; this civilization started out technologically advanced and only went downhill, even in terms of the quality of their pots and bricks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll link the article I found this on at the end (as well as other articles) but I'll mention a few other strange anomalies. First of all, the skeletons found there are also extremely radioactive. Apparently, "in Mohenjo-daro, in an epicentre 150 feet wide, everything was crystallized, fused or melted; 180 feet from the centre the bricks are melted on one side, indicated a blast". It's even said that a glass-encased skeleton was found; these civilizations were apparently being melted then crystallized.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of this is mentioned on Wikipedia.
      </p>

       From what I've been able to gather about earths history, there has been many advanced civilizations that have come and gone. The oldest ones I'm familiar with are around 75,000 years old. IMO, aliens create a race on earth, give them roughly 2,000 years to get it right, and if they don't- apocalypse...
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of these civilizations haven't had to live by these rules, as they were either the overseers themselves, or other extremely advanced races. We could very well be at the end of our allotted time.
      </p>
      <p>
       (I don't watch Ancient Aliens (though it's a great show), I like reading ancient texts)

       I think it could definitely be a possibility.  Either that, or we are the result of a genetic mutation, or albinos.

       I've often thought the same thing, especially ones with blue eyes, which can all be traced back to a single common ancestor. Though, we do share 99.9% of our DNA, and that can not be a coincidence. It's really one of the most intriguing mysteries on earth, as we couldn't have evolved from Africans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though, as far as rhythm go's, I am white with blue eye's, and I play an African djembe quite well :)

      <p>
       My family has been in America since the 1600's, and though we look about as white as a Caucasian can get, we have black, and indigenous American in our family. Perhaps that accounts for my rhythm.

       Not saying we don't have to take it with a grain of salt - but we have to look at ancient texts and there might be some truth to it. Written testimony is one of the biggest pilars of the historical process so it shouldn't be discarded like you seem to do.

       I believe they found similar evidence with sodom and gomorrah. Very interesting, although Ancient Aliens has gone really down hill this last season. (bigfoot, cowboys and aliens, etc)

       Well honestly some of the assertions they make provoke some interesting thoughts. Some assertions they don't give enough credit toward ancient civilizations to do on their own i.e... Rapa Nui Moai. The more sophisticated underground sonar and the more we dig will unlock many more answers and many more puzzles.

       Excerpt from Philip Coppens' website (although you find this text copy-pasted all over the web):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So, let us examine what might be the best evidence. The first question is whether the named archaeologist Francis Taylor existed. Alas, no-one has ever been able to identify him. There is a Francis Taylor, an American museum director, who died in 1957. He was, however, not an archaeologist. There is a “Franciscio Taylor”, but he is not the above quoted Francis Taylor.
Hence, not a good start.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I can't for the life of me find the origin of this idea. Everywhere it's "Francis Taylor stated..." or "Francis Taylor wrote..." - quite typical of today's media (corporate or not).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Sceptics have also wondered whether the ancient atomic warfare is not a modern invention, to deflect attention away from a serious – modern – atomic contamination. In 1998, it was reported that some Indian power stations had major problems. One had an incident in which 2000 workers became exposed to excess radiation, 300 of which had to be hospitalised.
       </p>
       <p>
        Surendra Gadekar (anti-nuclear physicist) investigated the conditions of villagers at Rawatbhatta in Rajasthan and confirmed there were indeed gross radiation-related deformities. We note that Rawatbhatta is in the same region as the discovery of the “ancient warfare” site. But Gadekar did not find evidence of ancient warfare, but did find evidence of modern negligence: wood that had been used in the power plant, had then “somehow” made its way into the local community, where it was subsequently used as wood for a fire. This in itself was a minor incident, but could there have been more serious incidents, whereby a decision was made to create an “ancient enigma”? Though a possibility, there is no evidence to back up this conclusion at present.
       </p>
       <p>
        Regrettably, we also find that there are no newspapers that carried the story of the discovery. The Indian archaeological authorities are not aware of the story. And as there is a government laboratory in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, the question is whether something might have gone wrong there.

       Well, I'm glad someone came here to mention the obvious likelihood that the radiation contamination is recent, rather than 4600 years old, by which time it would be a fraction of some implausibly large alleged figure, depending on the radioactive source supposed to exist.

       I read someplace that it happened around 9,500 BC; it would have been the war between
       <em>
        the gods
       </em>
       the Sumerians also wrote about well before 2600 BC. Those skeletons are
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       hotter than those in Hiroshima days afterward.

       You know what's funny and probably true, I recalled watching the 1958 movie Teenage Caveman on Mystery Science Theater 3000.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if this world already was advanced at one point, and after a war, we decided to start all over?
      </p>
      <p>
       Teenage Caveman is corny, but the story makes you wonder if something like this, along with this article, happened to us in the past.

       I think a lot of ancient history is buried within the Earth and the more wars we have the more we destroy of what we know.
      </p>
      <p>
       I heard that the Romans invaded Alexandria's museum/library (a old history teacher was telling me about it) and apparently it contained a lot of useful artifacts and key historical elements. It's sad to see amazing things like that destroyed due to ignorance of man.
