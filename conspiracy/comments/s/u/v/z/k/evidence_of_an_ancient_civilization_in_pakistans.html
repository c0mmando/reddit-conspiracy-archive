        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I found out about this on Ancient Aliens. So apparently there was an ancient civilization in what is now Pakistan built around 2600 BC. The strange thing about this civilization is that it is apparently highly irradiated and blocked off from the public. From there it just gets stranger.</p>

<p>The area in Rajasthan, India, is covered with a layer of radioactive ash. There are historical accounts of an incredible battle occurring in India in the Mahabharata. These speak of <em>aircraft</em> launching weapons that destroyed the cities of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa reminiscent of an eyewitness report of a nuclear bomb. They described the brightness of the blast, the column of rising smoke and fire, the fallout, intensive shock waves and heat waves, the appearance of the victims, and the effects of radiation poisoning. </p>

<p>In the city of Mohenjo-daro, the lower strata remains have more advanced art and architecture than the upper levels; this civilization started out technologically advanced and only went downhill, even in terms of the quality of their pots and bricks. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll link the article I found this on at the end (as well as other articles) but I&#39;ll mention a few other strange anomalies. First of all, the skeletons found there are also extremely radioactive. Apparently, &quot;in Mohenjo-daro, in an epicentre 150 feet wide, everything was crystallized, fused or melted; 180 feet from the centre the bricks are melted on one side, indicated a blast&quot;. It&#39;s even said that a glass-encased skeleton was found; these civilizations were apparently being melted then crystallized. </p>

<p>None of this is mentioned on Wikipedia. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s some links:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I&#39;ve been able to gather about earths history, there has been many advanced civilizations that have come and gone. The oldest ones I&#39;m familiar with are around 75,000 years old. IMO, aliens create a race on earth, give them roughly 2,000 years to get it right, and if they don&#39;t- apocalypse...</p>

<p>Some of these civilizations haven&#39;t had to live by these rules, as they were either the overseers themselves, or other extremely advanced races. We could very well be at the end of our allotted time.</p>

<p>(I don&#39;t watch Ancient Aliens (though it&#39;s a great show), I like reading ancient texts)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve often thought the same thing, especially ones with blue eyes, which can all be traced back to a single common ancestor. Though, we do share 99.9% of our DNA, and that can not be a coincidence. It&#39;s really one of the most intriguing mysteries on earth, as we couldn&#39;t have evolved from Africans.</p>

<p>Though, as far as rhythm go&#39;s, I am white with blue eye&#39;s, and I play an African djembe quite well :)</p>

<p>My family has been in America since the 1600&#39;s, and though we look about as white as a Caucasian can get, we have black, and indigenous American in our family. Perhaps that accounts for my rhythm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excerpt from Philip Coppens&#39; website (although you find this text copy-pasted all over the web):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, let us examine what might be the best evidence. The first question is whether the named archaeologist Francis Taylor existed. Alas, no-one has ever been able to identify him. There is a Francis Taylor, an American museum director, who died in 1957. He was, however, not an archaeologist. There is a “Franciscio Taylor”, but he is not the above quoted Francis Taylor.
Hence, not a good start. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can&#39;t for the life of me find the origin of this idea. Everywhere it&#39;s &quot;Francis Taylor stated...&quot; or &quot;Francis Taylor wrote...&quot; - quite typical of today&#39;s media (corporate or not). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sceptics have also wondered whether the ancient atomic warfare is not a modern invention, to deflect attention away from a serious – modern – atomic contamination. In 1998, it was reported that some Indian power stations had major problems. One had an incident in which 2000 workers became exposed to excess radiation, 300 of which had to be hospitalised.</p>

<p>Surendra Gadekar (anti-nuclear physicist) investigated the conditions of villagers at Rawatbhatta in Rajasthan and confirmed there were indeed gross radiation-related deformities. We note that Rawatbhatta is in the same region as the discovery of the “ancient warfare” site. But Gadekar did not find evidence of ancient warfare, but did find evidence of modern negligence: wood that had been used in the power plant, had then “somehow” made its way into the local community, where it was subsequently used as wood for a fire. This in itself was a minor incident, but could there have been more serious incidents, whereby a decision was made to create an “ancient enigma”? Though a possibility, there is no evidence to back up this conclusion at present.</p>

<p>Regrettably, we also find that there are no newspapers that carried the story of the discovery. The Indian archaeological authorities are not aware of the story. And as there is a government laboratory in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, the question is whether something might have gone wrong there. </p>

<p>Not saying <em>this</em> is gospel, just presenting a different side here. </p>

<p>edit: Another interesting subject is the &#39;Adam&#39;s bridge&#39; which connects Sri Lanka to India. Some say it&#39;s natural, others say it&#39;s man-made. It&#39;s too bad that most of the time neither side can be trusted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I&#39;m glad someone came here to mention the obvious likelihood that the radiation contamination is recent, rather than 4600 years old, by which time it would be a fraction of some implausibly large alleged figure, depending on the radioactive source supposed to exist.</p>
