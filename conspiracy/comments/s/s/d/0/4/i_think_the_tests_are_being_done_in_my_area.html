       Hi, I am 26 years old and I live in Lansing MI. This all started this summer when I would see military helicopters flying back and forth over my house but only at night. I didn't think it was a big deal or anything, but just recently every time they fly above my house my phone gets interrupted, TV goes out, also my wifi gets disturbances. They fly over at around 2 am every night now. This might sound crazy but earlier this summer I was cleaning my yard and I saw a metal object very high up just not moving at all, I saw a circular shape but it was really high it could have been a new high flying helicopter but the odd part is how fast it flew away. I know that helicopters can go pretty fast, but I have always assumed planes were faster, and this object went from 0 to plane speed instantly. It freaked me out, I tried recording but the zoom on my iPhone is terrible... I thought I would share this to see if anyone is experiencing things like this too.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I forgot to mention the crazy about of Contrails I see around here, i'm not too sure what they are but I have heard the Government (I know I sound ignorant saying the Government) sprays these things to try and achieve goals, I heard they were testing weather changing ones on Japan right before the Tsunami.

       I don't like this post. This is exactly what the 'fake social media accounts' post would look like, and would try to spread. Stupid disinformation.

       Either this is a troll making it up, or its a fake account by the gov.

       It just seems fishy.

       This might make sense, if they used this technology they could easily take over a whole neighborhood without any issues. This is like turning communication off but on a smaller scale. I know my neighbors have experienced it too, I don't tell them I think its the government or they'd think i'm a nut.

        Scrambler

      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        In telecommunications, a scrambler is a device that transposes or inverts signals or otherwise encodes a message at the transmitter to make the message unintelligible at a receiver not equipped with an appropriately set descrambling device. Whereas encryption usually refers to operations carried out in the digital domain, scrambling usually refers to operations carried out in the analog domain. Scrambling is accomplished by the addition of components to the original signal or the changing of some important component of the original signal in order to make extraction of the original signal difficult.

       Dude, last week my friend and I were at the bay, and I shit you not, we witnessed over 25 planes flying at all different altitudes, and all looked to be military jumbo planes.  The other day, a military plane was flying overhead for quite some time, I witnessed it driving home from work, and then again two hours later playing some frisbee outside with my friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: also, all of these planes had chemtrails, several them had the most outlandish looking chemtrails, none like I've ever seen before.  It was a very thick, smokey-white, squiggly chemtrail.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have also noticed much more loud, low-flying air traffic over my house, mostly at night as well.  Now, another strange thing, my girlfriend and I saw some kind of low-flying aircraft, very low actually, but it looked too small to  be a plane, definitely wasn't a helicopter.  This was also at the bay, down the road from the aforementioned one.  It actually looked like a drone, and took off pretty quickly when I aimed my phone camera at it, but unfortunately was unable to get anything clear.

       I live out on the South-Eastern end of Long Island, New York.  Nothing was on the news about this, nothing about any military drills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing was on the news either about the HAARP-like noises I heard several months ago, either.  When are people just going to realize, we waited too long, and it's probably too late at this point?

       Also, heres a comment I found on YouTube, it's not exactly reliable but it's scary to think people can just control the weather.
      </p>
      <p>
       This shit is exactly what I heard about a minute before and during our 5.8 earthquake in VA on August 23, 2011. Listen to these words , this is the realest comment I have ever made on youtube: If you ever hear this shit get the fuck out your house or were things can fall on you , because an earthquake might be immanent. Also we had strange auroras before and after this. not to mention Hurricane Irene﻿ hit us a few days after

       Never heard of HAARP?  Pretty scary shit.  It was of course an idea conceived to help areas suffering from extreme droughts; but of course, our military (I believe it's the US Army and Airforce) took the whole thing over, and have been using it for several decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I don't really know what to believe about it, I am just going by what I have read and watched.  Jesse Ventura's Conspiracy Theory has an episode on it, it's interesting, until the end (when they say it can be used as a mind control weapon).
