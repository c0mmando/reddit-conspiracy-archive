        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">26</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2012-04-27 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../user/[deleted].html">[deleted]</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Without getting into CISPA specifics, an important bill passed congress today unexpectedly. Further, additional changes were made to the bill no one expected. It is a remarkable turn of events well worthy of notice in the media, as this regards public matters of governance.  </p>

<p>Yet, if one were to look at the voting patterns for the two major reddit submissions regarding this bill, a surprising contradiction becomes apparent. </p>

<p>In the Technology subreddit:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/suchf/insanity_cispa_just_got_way_worse_and_then_passed/">http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/suchf/insanity_cispa_just_got_way_worse_and_then_passed/</a></p>

<p>take a look at the voting numbers. Currently the submission has: </p>

<p><strong>21,823 up votes 18,120 down votes with a tally of 3,703 points (54% like it)</strong></p>

<p>Conversely, in the politics subreddit, a similar story regarding the same issue shows this voting pattern:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/subow/us_house_passes_cispa_248_to_168/">http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/subow/us_house_passes_cispa_248_to_168/</a></p>

<p><strong>18,937 up votes 15,612 down votes with a tally of 3,325 points (54% like it)</strong></p>

<p>OK. Fine. Why not, right? 46% of the people just don&#39;t care about this story. But if that&#39;s the case, why in both comment forums is there no one defending this legislation?</p>

<p>One would think that with such vehement opposition to promoting news stories of passage of this bill, that at least <em>some</em> of the 18,120 and 15,612 voting redditors would defend their reddit votes by expressing an opinion on either why the bill is good, or why this story isn&#39;t newsworthy. </p>

<p>Nope. Chirp. Chirp. Chirp. Nobody. </p>

<p>But within those forums are lots of very pissed off people voicing anger at their representatives. </p>

<p>I wonder what&#39;s going on here...</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why this is the case, but no matter what story on Reddit in all of its existence nothing has had more than 60% likes.</p>

<p>One would thing by the nature of things its impossible to come even close to 100%, but its well within the realm of possibility to have something liked by more than 90% of the people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought I&#39;ve had it explained a little different. They don&#39;t just automatically downvote, they upvote as well, keeping the difference between downvotes and upvotes as close to legitimate as possible. So assuming something gets 1000 upvotes and zero downvotes, reddit&#39;s script might automatically add 500 downvotes, but they&#39;ll always add an equal number of upvotes, bringing the totals to 1,500 up and 500 down.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not necessarily tens of thousands of votes, as there&#39;s no easy way to determine how many people have voted on a submission. For posts with particularly high karma the reddit algorithm tends to level out a post to around a 50% balance. So even if nobody downvoted a post, it could appear that way to most users.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This may be a bit off topic but it is about CISPA...of it gets passed through the Senate as well, Obama will veto it. I know most will not agree but hear me out. There is another bill that is essentially the same as CISPA but puts the DHS at the helm of controlling and regulating the functions of the Internet. Plus, it is an election year and now there has been some mention of it in the mainstream, though not as much as with SOPA. The Senate bill is currently being stalled, so I believe that CISPA will be passed and vetoed, giving Obama a huge increase in the minds of the young and tech-savvy members of society only to have a Senate bill come into legislation after the election and without and opposition.  If anyone can find the time to find out the name of that bill that would really help in preparing for the future if these events come to pass.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re right. Obama can pick up a mountain of votes in the election and then quietly pass the Senate version in November. That is the sneaky Obama style. Its kind of like a drone strike on Internet freedom</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But there is a bill in the Senate that is even MORE nefarious than CISPA, sort of what CISPA is to SOPA.  Additionally, it puts the DHS in charge of monitoring and controlling the internet.  Killing multiple birds with one police state stone.  Especially now that there is some buzz going around, even in r/politics about CISPA and how bad it is, it would look terrible for him not to veto it.  I won&#39;t be surprised if he doesn&#39;t veto the bill and allows its passage, I&#39;m just looking at all of the options and seeing what ulterior motives would be behind such an action, because we can all agree on they do not have our best interests in mind.</p>
