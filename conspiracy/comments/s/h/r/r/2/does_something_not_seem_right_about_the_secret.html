<p>Mentions that perhaps the scandal is a way to divert attention from the outspokenness of many world leaders against the drug war.  Obama was in Colombia primarily to discuss the global &quot;war on drugs&quot; with them.  Many of them would like to see it ended.  Obama et al obviously do not want this. They also don&#39;t want to make it seem like other countries do, so they had to create this distraction.</p>

<p>The hosts of No Agenda explain it much better - highly recommend checking it out.</p>

<p>The question is &quot;for whom?&quot;  Is it meant for the eyes of the voters?  Is it meant for the eyes of the intelligence community?  Is it meant for the eyes of future mourners, to divert attention from another inside-job culprit in Obama&#39;s upcoming &quot;heart attack&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>My theory would be that perhaps there is a removal of the agents that will not toe the line.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nine of the agents from Kennedy’s White House Detail drank alcohol the night before the assassination in Fort Worth (at the Fort Worth Press Club and, presumably, The Cellar “Coffee House”), including four who had critical duties in the follow-up car directly behind his limousine: Bennett, Landis, Hill, and Ready. (Interestingly, they were all from Shift Leader Emory Roberts’ particular shift.
Significantly, None of the agents from the V.P. LBJ detail were involved in the drinking incident.)  </p>

<p>The owner of the Cellar, Pat Kirkwood, said: “About 3:30 in the morning, these Secret Service men were sitting around giggling about how the firemen were guarding the president over at the Hotel Texas … Jack Ruby used to come over Friday nights and steal my [stripper] girls … Lee Harvey Oswald washed glasses for two nights at the San Antonio Cellar … We didn’t say anything, but those guys were bombed. They were drinking pure Everclear [alcohol].”  </p>

<p>Likewise, reporter Jack Moseley stated “The … Secret Service activity of which I had knowledge was the large amount of alcohol consumed by members of the Secret Service at the Fort Worth Press Club, where the bar did not close at the regular time that night.” </p>

<p>Although this flagrant violation of Secret Service regulations was grounds for dismissal from the service, none of the men were punished in any way whatsoever by Chief Rowley, who did not want to stigmatize the agents and their families.  In addition, although all the agents had to report for duty at 8:00 a.m., several stayed out until between 1:30 a.m. and 3:00 a.m. One—Landis—stayed out until 5:00 a.m. </p>

<p>Sleep deprivation can wreak havoc on even the best trained reflexes. DNC advance man Jerry Bruno told the HSCA: “Asked to comment about drinking after hours, he said: ‘They were not “one beer” drinkers. They could really put it away,’ he said. He related an incident on the Naples trip where an agent, whom he did not identify, pulled his gun on a hotelkeeper who would not open a bar late at night to serve them. This trip was in [July] 1963 prior to the Texas one.&quot;</p>

<p>So, in addition to admitted alcohol consumption and little (if any) sleep, these trained men were assigned to protect President Kennedy in Dallas, stationed a mere five feet or so behind the limousine. Incredibly, the majority of the agents, like the majority of untrained Dealey Plaza spectators, thought the first shot was either a firecracker or a motorcycle backfire; one even said he thought a tire had blown out. Only a select few, including Roberts, who did nothing to protect JFK, knew the first shot was a rifle shot.  As for their collective reflexes, they were non-existent. Driver Greer shoulders perhaps the heaviest burden for his particular lack of action. Coupled with Roberts’ actions and inactions and Boring’s ‘instructions’, the alcohol and lack of proper sleep could all spell the reasons for the agents’ inactions. Senator Ralph Yarborough, seated in LBJ’s car, summed up the situation best: “All of the Secret Service men seemed to me to respond very slowly … I am amazed at the lack of instantaneous response by the Secret Service, when the rifle fire began.”  </p>

<p>As former JFK Secret Service Chief U. E. Baughman wrote in 1962: “Every one of [the agents] must be ready to place his own body between the President and any danger to him … The individual bodies of the White House Detail are, in the last analysis, the final defense the Secret Service has against an attack on the person of the President. They are human shields. The men of the White House Detail have never failed to perform their duty when called upon to do so.” </p>

<p>Author James Hepburn said that JFK’s Secret Service White House Detail “worked like a troop of boy scouts … they had lost their reflexes.”  With regard to November 22, 1963, perhaps Secret Service Officer John Norris summed it up best: “Except for George Hickey and Clint Hill, everybody else just basically sat there with their thumbs up their butts while the president was gunned down in front of them.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think about it. </p>

<p>So many people getting prostitutes, going to clubs, etc. This OBVIOUSLY wasn&#39;t the first time and yet it all gets exposed due to a rookie mistake like bickering over 4o some odd bucks with a Colombian hooker!? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think so. </p>

<p>Just like Eliot Spitzer and the IMF dude, this was a long standing pattern that suddenly was not okay any more with the real PTB. (I&#39;m guessing bankers because they seem to be mixed up in the other two big sex scandals as well.) They were looking to make someone look bad or lose their job. But who?</p>

<p>The Secret Service is expected to conduct polygraph examinations with the agents involved in the scandal, which also allegedly involves 10 members of the U.S. military who were working on the trip to Colombia in a support role.</p>

<p>And this will accomplish... what? (polygraphing people who are heavily trained to be able to fool polygraphs)</p>
