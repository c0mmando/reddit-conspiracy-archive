    <div class="md"><p>Could just be the msm pointing out fact that has been pretty much ignored. Makes sense considering how nuclear proliferation is kind of a buzz topic at the moment because of iran and NK. It is a interesting correlation but I don&#39;t think there is any clear causation if you see what I mean. Simply put, as long as China and India are at odds then the US will for the most part be at India&#39;s back so to speak. This will only increase as China increases ties with pakistan (though a us &quot;ally&quot; technically), seeing as how india is not really friends with pakistan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, India and Chinese relations have been tense in recent years due to the fact that Pakistan has made strides to improve it&#39;s once hopeless relationship with India, moving security focus in India away from Pakistan and towards their large, disputed border with China that is a main point of discussion in diplomacy. Not to mention their economic rivalry as the tops of the BRIC group of countries. </p>

<p>The fact that India has now tested it&#39;s first ICBM, one capable of reaching Beijing, <em>is</em> an interesting development for the balance of power between the two. Especially in 2012, where many diplomatic endeavors have been taken on both sides.</p>

<p>A similar story broke into the mainstream circuit when India bought billions of dollars of fighter jets from France last year. </p>

<p>Also, international reaction has been slow or nonexistent, no one with anything to gain or lose politically cares about saying anything right now.</p>

<p><em>Also,</em> take into account the size of India and it&#39;s rapid pace of development (They single-handedly caused a paradigm shift how companies buy industrial plastics last decade), it shouldn&#39;t surprise anyone that India buys a lot of oil, along with many other commodities. </p>
