       Well, India has a few things going on that could lead us to something with them.

       I recall India thumbed their noses at big pharma recently with allowing generic versions of drugs being produced at a cheaper discount.

       That's one more piece to the puzzle.

       I am not at liberty to tell you. But someone like you should know there is more hidden information out there than all of the conspiracies combined (regardless they are true conspiracy or not). Fact is whether you know it or not, what has been going on for so long has progressed so much that there is no stopping it. You just can't, and even those who think they are not fools, only if they knew themselves how far down the rabbit hole they too are actually in.

       No Nuclear weapon fired from India will ever reach Europe. It will get shot out of the sky before it gets anyway close. The whole notion that a country poses a risk of a Nuclear attack because they have Nuclear weapons is absurd. The US or Russia on the other hand would definitely be successful because of the sheer volume of Missiles they would fire in an all out Nuclear strike.

       They did test a long range delivery system on the 19/4/2012, but the range does not extend so far as Europe. I would, however, agree that this is a likely explanation for the media coverage, as opposed to something more clandestine. It is significant in terms of Asian politics.

       India is a democracy, a haven for right-wing corporatism, a haven for corporate outsourcing, a U.S. ally, a recipient of U.S. civilian nuclear power technology, and all but a member of NATO (if only the right-wingers could say that India is near the Atlantic Ocean).

       India isn't attacking the West anytime soon, and the West isn't attacking India.

       Could just be the msm pointing out fact that has been pretty much ignored. Makes sense considering how nuclear proliferation is kind of a buzz topic at the moment because of iran and NK. It is a interesting correlation but I don't think there is any clear causation if you see what I mean. Simply put, as long as China and India are at odds then the US will for the most part be at India's back so to speak. This will only increase as China increases ties with pakistan (though a us "ally" technically), seeing as how india is not really friends with pakistan.

       Well, India and Chinese relations have been tense in recent years due to the fact that Pakistan has made strides to improve it's once hopeless relationship with India, moving security focus in India away from Pakistan and towards their large, disputed border with China that is a main point of discussion in diplomacy. Not to mention their economic rivalry as the tops of the BRIC group of countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that India has now tested it's first ICBM, one capable of reaching Beijing,
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       an interesting development for the balance of power between the two. Especially in 2012, where many diplomatic endeavors have been taken on both sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       A similar story broke into the mainstream circuit when India bought billions of dollars of fighter jets from France last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, international reaction has been slow or nonexistent, no one with anything to gain or lose politically cares about saying anything right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Also,
       </em>
       take into account the size of India and it's rapid pace of development (They single-handedly caused a paradigm shift how companies buy industrial plastics last decade), it shouldn't surprise anyone that India buys a lot of oil, along with many other commodities.

       I am not at liberty to tell you. But someone like you should know there is more hidden information out there than all of the conspiracies combined (regardless they are true conspiracy or not). Fact is whether you know it or not, what has been going on for so long has progressed so much that there is no stopping it. You just can't, and even those who think they are not fools, only if they knew themselves how far down the rabbit hole they too are actually in.
