Do you think &quot;we&quot; now are trying to use all the lessons that we learned abroad to make our own similar regime? We have massive propaganda/indoctrination, widespread misinformation, scare tactics on dissidents (all those intimidating NSA letters which you can&#39;t tell anyone you received), population monitoring, an &quot;evil&quot; to fight against... We also have the historical excuse for the formation of such regime: Security. As far as I remember, for every single authoritarian ruling class that was the justification. Do you think the similarities that have been building up over the years with the regimes we helped install over third world countries is just coincidence or I am being paranoid?</p>

<p>No one will &quot;give up&quot; anything. The internet will be new, improved, faster, more reliable, and with better ability to connect to your friends and view your favorite programs! All with the Securtron(tm) National-ID login integrated security!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the changes have been going on without notice for 70 years (for the majority of population, at least), what makes you believe that internet will not go down the same way, like every other mean of mass communication (TV, radio, printed paper)? It is not like the american people are really doing an effort to stop. And once the internet is seized (they only need a law, the infrastructure is already set, according to <a href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/323379">William Binney</a>, former NSA official), I hardly think there will be any resistance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Put simply everyone has the means to transmit and receive, and using relatively open protocols. Television and all other forms of mass media are receive only. You can take away the broadcast towers with television, the best you could do to internet communication is take away the corporate pipes. It&#39;s just TCP/IP communication... and there are other ways as every computer is a computer.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t be bothered going any further than that, the rest should be obvious by deduction... can&#39;t control how people use an open protocol on a device they control. They&#39;re going to have to go after the devices in a much more iron fisted way before it will have any effect, monitoring only goes so far.</p>

<p>Hence all the analogies of the internet giving people a voice; now they can transmit back!</p>
