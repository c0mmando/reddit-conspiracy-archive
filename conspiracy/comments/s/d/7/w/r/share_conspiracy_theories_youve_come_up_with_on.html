       I'm a shameless conspiracy theorist.  I tell people I like conspiracy theories, and I love being that guy who brings in an alternate view point into conversations.  That said, I don't necessarily believe or disbelieve many, if not most, popular conspiracy theories.  I like to keep up with the subjects because I think they're an interesting and fun mixture of truth and modern day myth or lore.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, always reading this subreddit and other sites regarding conspiracy theories, my brain likes to make connections within that context--everything is not what it seems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I'm curious to know if you all have made strange conspiratorial connections.  I don't care if they're plausible.  Like I said, I just like the mythos and the allure of "conspiracies."  With that said:
      </p>
      <p>
       Today I was listening to the new Maps and Atlases cd.  For the uninitiated, this is just some semi-obscure hipster math rock band that I enjoy, but the lyrics to a song off their new album got my conspiracy gears turning:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USNLuSPSSkk">
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USNLuSPSSkk
       </a>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        in the beginning of the old ash, that helmet night of many openings
       </li>
       <li>
        you wore your sharpened pistol mask, I don't know why you wore that useless thing
       </li>
       <li>
        I didn't know you let them call you that, the crudest terms are all encompassing, but I know why you didn't fight back:
       </li>
       <li>
        we're both afraid of public things
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         just because all the rocks are overturned and the worms are all baking doesn't mean all the animals are gone there's a new breed in the making
        </strong>
        .
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Yeah, it's just a song, but the last line is very strange if you subscribe to the NWO morlocks and eloi type theory of the human race being split.  The rocks are the old institutions being turned over to expose the worms to the light, which will bake them.  Of course, he assures us that it doesn't mean the animals are all gone, it's just a new breed in the making.
      </p>
      <p>
       This alone means nothing.  It's just dumb hipster song lyrics that I thought were a little creepy.  Then randomly, I click on this youtube video of an older live Maps and Atlases performance:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ez1UMfnS3OI">
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ez1UMfnS3OI
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       First thing they do is thank Invisible Children (this was in 2011) which is a pretty obvious conspiracy either by governmental forces or financial forces.  I just rolled my eyes at the Invisible Children connection until I got to this part in the same video:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ez1UMfnS3OI&amp;t=34s">
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ez1UMfnS3OI&amp;t=34s
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       His guitar is covered in signatures and a freemason symbol is pretty prominently displayed.  So we have 1. song about a weird mask, hating public things, and a new breed, 2. a public performance sponsored by a group funded by JP Morgan to start a mineral grab in Africa, and 3. a freemason symbol on his guitar.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's probably nothing at all here but coincidences fueled by a very biased brain, but share your own!  It's at least fun, and at most potentially enlightening.

       After working at a federal installation for just four months, I came to the conclusion that almost all federal jobs are really a welfare program where people at least pretend to work.

       Think that's bad, try working for a state or local government.

      <p>
       It is fucking
       <em>
        incredible
       </em>
       how many people simply just do not do their jobs.  And I don't mean half-assing it, I mean flat out do not doing anything.  Come in, sit at desk, fuck around playing farmville, go home.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rinse, repeat.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that A) regulations make it difficult to fire government employees, and B) its not like citizens can just go to another provider for a lot of these services.  Whether government employees do their jobs or not, people HAVE to come to them for a good amount of things.

       You don't have to tell me, man.  When I was there for a few weeks, I noticed one of the guys just sat and literally read the newspaper all day.  I asked what he did. "Oh, he's just waiting for retirement."  Thinking he had weeks, I said "When's that?"  "Oh, I think it's just two years, now."
      </p>
      <p>
       And, there was another guy who had been at the government for 17 years.  NOT ONE of the programs he had ever worked on had ever been implemented.  Think about that.  17 years, and he'd contributed NOTHING.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was another guy who spent two or three weeks trying (in vain) to get "Page X of Y" printed on the top of each page in a report.

       The universe is one living organism and the human race is essentially just brain-cells. We are literally simply the universe becoming aware of itself. Religion is a tool to keep people from realizing their potential or realizing how totally fucked up our society and government is; we would identify the Rothchild-crown covenant as literal brain cancer and would rejoice to amputate it just like a malignant tumor.  Religion is literally a disease on the face of this planet and is most akin to aids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Jesus never even existed and is loosely based on some deluded rabbi named Yeshua who was probably not even crucified or said a single thing the bible claims Jesus did. The bible was carefully crafted by occult geniuses to be as a tool of oppression, a means to trick the masses into self-enslavement and accepting a partial lobotomy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also occultism/witchcraft is real, and it all boils down to some strange seemingly supernatural but natural property of the universe where thoughts become things. Like attracts like even on the level of thoughts. "The Secret" might as well be called "Occultism for Dummies". I'm 24 and essentially retired, no one can convince me that there is not something seemingly supernatural about the power of our thoughts. This also ties into how religion is a tool of oppression as people are able to write their own story, yet christbots have been robbed of this and are not even the main character in their own story, let alone the ones writing it.

       Google, NASA and the NSA are all tightly woven together as a massive spy network accomplishing the ultimate end goal of having absolutely 100% surveillance on everything, everyone does in the world. A little, albeit circumstantial evidence is google and NASA Ames research center are literally right next to each other in mountain view, ca. And the google founders have unique(as in they're the only ones) access to moffet field runways whenever they need them. Also the recent hiring of an NSA director by google.

       It seems silly to trust power meters to relay your power usage wirelessly in a meshnet. What better way to create an adhoc network of spy devices. Every house has a power meter and you're required to have it, or be forced to pay close to $20 a month to opt out.

       We've proven in lab created animals that we can slice and dice DNA to improve and alter behavior within animals. Who's not to say we have bees that can only be attracted to GMO crops? It would be the ultimate monopoly on food. If you control food, you control the world. Same thought process on oil exploration and exploitation. Governments and private industry can't control food so why not control what makes foods pollinate and reproduce?

       If I recall on reddit, I read an article here in r/conspiracy or r/TIL, that tesla had a method of unlimited power using the earth's magnetic field, and was substantially denied his invitation to be the opening ceremonies MC (something along those lines) to that year's Worlds Fair. It had something to do with the power industry getting involved. He had the ability to produce free electricity and kill the current power monopoly.
      </p>
      <p>
       The diesel engine had another purpose of using oil from vegetables and vegetable waste to power the car. Diesel engines were to be a universal acceptor of fuel source. Sadly he killed himself on a boat cruise across the Atlantic. Keep in mind that oil conglomerates were around at the time and those powers were wanting to keep a hold on their new found cash cow. I've been to Germany and surrounding nations. I saw biodiesel readily available at Shell stations in Germany. Why is it so hard (aside from politics) to get that availability here in the states? Germany has quality standards on biodiesel, the US doesn't. Why?

       UFOs seem to be the ultimate fighter weapon. Imagine being able to bend the laws of physics? You'd control the skies militarily and keep enemies from launching death from above attacks. I recall on here reading the UFO technology was an interesting topic that Nazi's wanted to get working to thwart US attacks. Which reminds of another conspiracy I believe in. WW2 was a cover to get Israel back for the Jews. All the lives that were sacrificed, just to get back a piece of sacred land.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like we're being corralled in one direction. We need to live in harmony and piece and not think freely. We need to contribute to society and be the same. No differences. No nothing. Just greasing the gears for a complex weapon to stop some external force.

       You just blew my mind with the bees.  I just read an article about how pesticides were killing bees.  And how all the scientist seemed perplexed by this obvious outcome.  I just figured they would kill the bees, then make all seeds the terminator variety.  No bees, no pollination. But GMO bees!?  That's even more sinister.  They could even intentionally corrupt your own heirloom crops.

       I find everything you said to be very interesting, apart from the UFO's and WWII being a conspiracy. The UFO's mostly because you didn't give any info that makes me want to believe that that actually happened. And if it had I'm sure they would have tried to implement it in the war. WWII: definitely not a conspiracy, I'm sorry. Too large and requiring much too much in the form of resources, time, and lives for something we didn't even feel guilty for yet. Why give the Jews anything when we haven't ignored their extermination yet?

       Another one of mine:  The tiny town I grew up in had only about 10,000 people, but at one time, 4 Chinese restaurants.  There are just way too many Chinese restaurants, which led me to believe they are actually Chinese sleeper cells and/or a deployment vehicle for some bio-weapon when the Chinese finally decide to invade.

       The earth is 4 billion years old, humans existed for roughly 500,000 years.  I think that "humans" have existed before, have destroyed themselves, have left the planet, you name it, numerous times in the past.  The natural geology of earth is basically just a giant recycling process, its not hard for all evidence to be destroyed with the initial building blocks to continue to survive and re-spawn the next generation of "humans."

       I'm playing around with an hypothesis that at the top of the pyramid of power, the ultimate authorities are not human beings.
      </p>
      <p>
       I start off with the observation that no one seems to know who is running the drive to implement the so-called New World Order that has so fucked up the Western world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, its upper management is composed of an elite ruling class, many of whom are wealthy Jews, but I don't believe they are the ultimate directing authority. They merely implement the program, they do not originate the program.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect this to be so because nobody has been able to pin down the specific individual human beings who are directing the New World Order program. Many people say that they are few in number, that they could sit around a single conference table, but their names are not forthcoming. Those who are named from time to time don't seem to me to be the ones calling the shots. They are like the Ring Wraiths, to use an analogy from Tolkien, whereas the true ruler, or rulers, is like Sauron, who is never seen directly in the flesh.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe that the New World Order is being pushed by reptilians, but reptilians are a useful metaphor for whomever is pushing the program. They suggest that the true leadership is not human, but something alien.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I had to get particular, I'd guess that the true leader, or leaders, of the descent into slavery, poverty and war we are presently seeing must be non-physical ... or perhaps trans-dimensional. There must be a reason why their guiding hand is so clearly felt and observed by its effects, yet never seen or identified directly.

      <p>
       I've often wondered about why people believe the reptilian theory, but if you subscribe to a New World Order orchestrated consciously by a particular group of people, then they are either natural intelligence outliers, or have to be of some form above the average human.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've also been considering the "Jewish" conspiracies as well.  I definitely don't think Jews are inherently bad, but it is odd that a seemingly disproportionate amount of Jews are in positions of power compared to their overall population.  My naturalistic theory is simply they're the oldest group or society of people (still alive) on the planet.  They've seen more history than any other single group of people, therefore, they are in the pole position to pass down their wealth and knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another theory I have regarding the Jewish power structure has been derived from the book "The Awful Truth" by Patrick Conway and discusses that the Jews had the Ark of the Covenant which was actually some sort of connection between humans and the gods (aliens).  When Jesus came to save the world from the old gods of evil or "Satan", the Jews split and humans inherited the earth when the temple was destroyed by the Romans and the ark vanished.  Perhaps the "true Jews" that remain have some sort of secret knowledge of humanity that has been passed down which has allowed them to dominate as a people.  It almost seems as if most of the conflict we see today stems from that moment where the Jews split and the temple destroyed in 70 AD.  Then just a little time later, the Cult of Christ was adopted by the Roman Empire and the thus the real battles began.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've just considered all of this, I don't necessarily believe this narrative to be true.

       I believe that since the 30's world leaders have been well aware that in 2012 we will have contact with alien life. They will reveal themselves to the world at large. We have are being mentally conditioned for this since the advent of radio. It is a slow process to get a whole planet to be open to what could be the single most profound discovery in humankind.  Over time thru the media, our grandparents then our parents and now us and our children have been exposed and on an almost unconscious level, conditioned so that we don't completly lose our minds when it happens.  This is why little by little we see movies, tv shows,book etc...about aliens and ufo's and now we are more mentally ready to accept them as real.

       (1) Humans are separated into at least three, but very likely many distinct species.  The one that we are familiar with, that
       <em>
        appears
       </em>
       to control the surface of the earth is the youngest and weakest of the group.
      </p>
      <p>
       (1.a) At least one of the separate human-like species is a radically advanced group that lives underground, underwater and in space and this group farms us for genetic material, hormones and enzymes that they no longer produce, and for pharmaceutical purposes.  This would be the common "grey" alien, not alien at all - but as closely related to us as a chimp.
      </p>
      <p>
       (1.b) Surface humans have co-evolved with these subterranean homonids for eons and that relationship sometimes slips out into the media in works such as the Time Machine, with Eloi and Morlocks.  Another famous work of fiction that is influenced by this, from the point of view of those who left and occasionally return is the Planet of the Apes (we are the apes).
      </p>
      <p>
       (1.c) As surface humans develop advanced technology, they become difficult for the greys to manage and pogroms are put forth to trim the herd and bring the surface population back to the stone age.  We are in the midst of one of those pogroms now, and forces on all sides are posturing for confrontation.  This time, it appears that surface humans have a chance to fight back.
      </p>
      <p>
       (1.d) All secret societies and most human religions deal with the relationship between this parasitic species and our own, as well as more advanced human species that previously escaped.  Angles and Demons indeed.
      </p>
      <p>
       (2) None of (1) matters, because this is a computer simulation.

       The strong nuclear force, among the others, has been changing and along with that, everything that was before, is expanding like balloons. Dinosaurs weren't big, they just lived at a different time with different universal constants. They were mostly birds.

       Yes i typed that a three in the morning and typed the wrong thing. The mechanism is still the same. The moon is getting further away from earth causing the earth to wobble on its axis more, causing more of earth's surface to be exposed to the sun longer. Like moving a marshmallow around in the campfire. Keep in mind the point of the question was to post your most outlandish consperasy theory.

       Speaking from a physics standpoint, based on the size and mass of the moon, there's no way that it should even be in orbit around Earth to begin with. It's just to big to be physically possible, unless the moon is hollow.

       This follows the Aliens having altered our DNA and playing a part in our history. The way we've been bred and the changes that have been made are imperfect.. I feel the human requires a 'mother' type figure in their life, macro and microscopically. I think that is and has been changing as we're coming more self reliant, it's very similar to training a pet..
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe we've being watched - of course - throughout this and the different ET races have different ideas on how to do that or at least did have different ideas during the process. I don't think they're omniscient though, I think they are much better than us, but also a lot more simpler than us. I think our complexity confuses them, being more complex and being unreadable - we have something over them, if you want to look at it like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we're an outlet for their curiosity. While they may logically assume and deduce a 100 things, we would live out and test the 100 things.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest problems right now is our accelerated rate of change is very high. But these are a long term patient slowed-pace organisation. For these reasons it's hard to do much of anything - which could help to explain no official contact.

       NBA Finals last year. Mark Cuban paid off Lebron and Wade a very high amount of money (their salary or even double it) so they could flop and lose the championship. Notice how both players gave it their ALL during the games then when a forth quarter comes, they slack offensively and defensively, HARD. Bosh wasn't in on it, hence he cried at the end. It was a strategic move financially for the two heat players because they knew they'll be back to the finals. Dallas on the other hand was on their last hope, and Dirks getting old.

       I don't know.  Some people on here probably accept without question, but I'd venture to say they're a minority.  The majority though are just "accepting" of potentially crazy theories.  However, I'd say this subreddit does a good job of mostly staying away from the truly insane ones (I haven't seen much David Icke getting voted to the top), and most topics seem about more grounded conspiracies revolving corruption, economics and war which I believe everyone should be open-minded to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:  For the record, I also enjoying reading about the insane conspiracy theories of Icke, etc.  I don't particularly believe them, but I don't totally discount what they say as long as they have some compelling circumstantial evidence, or "connections."

       I wouldn't throw David Icke out with the bathwater, either. I think he is wrong to think that the leaders of the elite are actual reptilian aliens from other space, but I don't think he actually believes that any longer anyway. He's come to recognize that these alien leaders, if they exist, must be more than mere space aliens, and can't be just ordinary physical beings.

       I'm a contractor who works at a state government facility and at least half the jobs here are absolutely exactly as you've described.

       Think that's bad, try working for a state or local government.

       It is fucking
       <em>
        incredible
       </em>
       how many people simply just do not do their jobs.  And I don't mean half-assing it, I mean flat out do not doing anything.  Come in, sit at desk, fuck around playing farmville, go home.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rinse, repeat.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that A) regulations make it difficult to fire government employees, and B) its not like citizens can just go to another provider for a lot of these services.  Whether government employees do their jobs or not, people HAVE to come to them for a good amount of things.
