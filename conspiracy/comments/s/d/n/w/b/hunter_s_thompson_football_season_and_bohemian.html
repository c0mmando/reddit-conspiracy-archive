       I was following up on the recent post regarding "alex jones confronts presidential advisor David Gergen..." and started doing some searches regarding "Bohemian Grove."
      </p>
      <p>
       I was surprised to find conspiracy theories regarding Hunter S. Thompson's death and seedy Bohemian Grove activities.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you make of this?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “Autumn is always a time of Fear and Greed and Hoarding for the winter coming on. Debt collectors are active on old people and fleece the weak and helpless. They want to lay in enough cash to weather the known horrors of January and February.
        <strong>
         There is always a rash of kidnapping and abductions of schoolchildren in the football months. Preteens of both sexes are traditionally seized and grabbed off the streets by gangs of organized perverts who traditionally give them as Christmas gifts to each other to be personal sex slaves and playthings.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Most of these things are obviously Wrong and Evil and Ugly — but at least they are Traditional. They will happen. Your driveway will ice over, your furnace will blow up, and you will be rammed in traffic by an uninsured driver in a stolen car.
       </p>
       <p>
        But what the hell? That's why we have Insurance, eh? And the Inevitability of these nightmares is what makes them so reassuring. Life will go on, for good or ill. But some things are forever, right? The structure may be a little Crooked, but the foundations are still strong and unshakable.”
       </p>

       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       In connection with Hunter S Thompson's "suicide note" -
       <strong>
        "Football Season is Over"
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        I do not know the context of the first quote.
       </li>
       <li>
        I do not know the strength of any connection between HST and 
Bohemian Grove activities.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       having said that,
       <strong>
        wouldn't the words "Football Season is Over" be the kind of NWO message they would leave if HST was assassinated (to send a message - perhaps occult in nature) notably in connection with the first quote above?

       Honestly, in the first section he mentions the horror in the power structure but tries to rationalize it. Sounds to me he killed himself because perhaps he couldn't rationalize it anymore. Football season is over. I like your theory and it is definitely possible, but if the elite are perverts then wouldn't they love football season?

       Hunter's suicide had little to do with anything conspiracy related. The man was basically crippled and had to rely on someone for almost everything. He was tired and no longer wanted to be a burden on those he loved. He always considered himself weak if he was not able to take his own life, much the way one of his heros, Hemingway did.

       I think he burned out his brain on drugs, and couldn't write very well any longer. That's why he killed himself.

       thanks for the comment - I agree there might appear to be some discrepancy between with Football season being "over" but in spite of this apparent inconsistency, it still manages to "work" as a chilling effect when reading it the way I suggest...
