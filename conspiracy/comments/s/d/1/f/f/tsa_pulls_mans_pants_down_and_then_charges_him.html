        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">139</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2012-04-16 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../user/joe5955.html">joe5955</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>On June 19, 2011, after the Transportation Security Agency pulled my pants down, I was arrested at BNA for refusing to pick up my pants until I was informed as to whether the search was complete. I never got the answer to my request, &quot;Is the search over?&quot; The resolution search that I agreed to after my 3&quot;x4&quot; microfiber cloth had been picked up as an anomaly in the millimeter wave scanner, is the same search that Senator Rand Paul (KY) refused. I am a frequent flyer, having A-list status with Southwest and flying through Nashville 3 dozen times in the past 2 years. I now opt out of the millimeter wave scanner and maintain an informal record of the search procedures of the TSA. The grab and pull of my pant legs seen in this video was not necessary as all the TSA searches I have received before and after the incident have proven.</p>

<p>I am looking for a lawyer to sue the TSA. The charges of Disorderly Conduct and Public Indecency are unjust. One officer, Robbie Keeler, was heard stating, &quot;I think we&#39;re stretchin&#39; it on the Public Indecency, but what the hell?! Have him tell it to the commissioner. I would like to charge the all officers involved, Officer Hardini Carter and Officer Robert Merritt, round up the pack. TSA agents Seth James and Lee (badge# 74020) are also liable. The first thing Agent Lee said upon standing up after pulling down my pants was, &quot;Pick up your pants.&quot; When I asked, &quot;Is the search over?&quot;, his response was, &quot;Pick up your pants, sir!&quot; His supervisor Seth James, could only offer snide remarks and the same &quot;Pick up your pants!&quot; command. I explained, &quot;Is the search over? Because if the search is over, I will pull up my pants and grab my stuff.&quot; The TSA Agents and the Police Officers had no intention of respecting my right to know whether the search was complete.</p>

<p>This video was obtained by requesting it from Bob Watson and Terri Barnhart. The TSA records at double time. 714p_thru_725p_11-01025_061911.mpg</p>

<p>As you are watching the video remember these questions:</p>

<p>As American citizens, have we or have we not, the right to know whether a search we voluntarily submit for is complete or if it shall continue indefinitely?</p>

<p>Is it TSA policy to submit American citizens to submission by dehumanization?</p>

<p>Am I prepared with the phone number of a friend or relative with a land line telephone, in the event that I attempt to keep my dignity at the airport?</p>

<p>Are the police liable for false arrest when they themselves reviewed the surveillance video and thought the charge of Public Indecency to be a stretch?</p>

<p>Watch out Americans. There are government agencies that do not respect your rights, nor your dignity.</p>

<p>I am looking for a lawyer who believes in justice for American citizens. It has taken me nearly 8 months to even post this video on youtube and start to solicit the lawyer help, because the psychological toll this incident has taken can be unruly at times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This whole TSA thing is a farce which America tolerates. It&#39;s unbelievable how much people are willing to accept before they have had enough. It&#39;s a waste of money, time, resources, and peoples dignity. It has been proven not to work, and yet it still goes on. America, the &quot;terrorists&quot; are laughing at you. Literally, the whole world is clutching their sides in laughter as the American people are &quot;saved&quot; one by one.</p>

<p>If you thought this was good, like us on Facebook, Twitter, and G+.</p>

<p>ಠ_ಠ</p>

<p>TLDR: Lolz, you think you are going to change things without support of our peers who couldn&#39;t care less about this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>also           THE TSA&#39;S GREATEST HITS: A HISTORY OF BIZARRE BEHAVIOUR</p>

<pre><code>Last month, a YouTube clip showed a terrified eight-year-old boy confined to a wheelchair, trembling with fear as he was subjected to an invasive TSA pat-down as he cries to his dad.
Also last month, new mom Amy Strand was forced to show security her freshly pumped breast milk before she could board a plane with a breast pump.
In February, Ellen Terrell claimed she was subjected to repeated body scans after being told by agency employees that she &#39;had a cute figure&#39;.
In January, two TSA agents were out of the the job and jailed after they admitted to stealing $40,000 from a checked bag at JFK Airport in New York.
That same month, the agency was forced to apologise after two grandmothers in their 80s were subjected to mortifying strip searches.
Joe Maltese told MailOnline in December that cake in his luggage on a recent flight had a slice missing, allegedly taken by hungry bag-checkers.
Also in December, Indiana rapper Freddie Gibbs got away with smuggling some pot on a flight, but not without a handwritten TSA message: &#39;C&#39;mon son&#39;.
Jenni &#39;J-Woww&#39; Farley is known for brawls with her Jersey Shore castmates, but she took on the TSA in November when she complained on her Twitter account that she was &#39;treated like a criminal&#39; when patted down during a trip to South Dakota.
In October, a TSA agent was dismissed from the job after leaving writer Jill Filipovic a similar handwritten note saying &#39;Get your freak on girl&#39; in a bag that also contained a vibrator.
In August 2011, the agency was accused of racism after targeting the hair of two black women at airports in Seattle and San Antonio.
In May 2011, a photo made the rounds on the internet that showed - of all people - an infant being frisked by a thorough TSA agent.

<p>I hope this is taken to court and OP is found guilty of public indecency for the REFUSAL to pull up his pants. Sure, the public has a right to know if a search is complete, but when someone acts like a total cockwad just to exercise their &quot;rights&quot;, the bar isn&#39;t being pushed in the right direction; it&#39;s being pushed back.</p>
