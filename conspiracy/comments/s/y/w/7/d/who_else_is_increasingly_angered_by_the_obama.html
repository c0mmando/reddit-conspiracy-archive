    <div class="md"><p>Wellllll, I agree to an extent. Government shouldn&#39;t have a monopoly on healthcare, but the people in this country deserve it. The way it is currently set up, most people cannot afford either health insurance or to see a doctor regularly without it. The government here, as far fetched as it may be these days, is supposed to impose the will of the people in its laws. This is obviously not what is happening when a simple hour long surgery costs more than 30% + of the population makes in a year. So no government shouldn&#39;t have a monopoly on healthcare, but neither should greedy insurance corporations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wikipedia sez: &quot;In the United States, a REIT is a company that owns, and in most cases operates, income-producing real estate. Some REITs finance real estate.

<p>I feel the need to reply a little more directly to this. The use of a REIT isn&#39;t &quot;abstracting&quot;, it&#39;s actually directly matching the economic need with the appropriate economic model. </p>

<p><em>Government funding</em> is itself the abstraction. It&#39;s &quot;hey throw your cash in a bucket we&#39;ll figure out what goes where later&quot;. </p>

<p>Because the government doesn&#39;t do a good job. REITs incentive structure is directly aligned with the needs met by the roadway.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Caused by government interference in the real estate market aka easy credit? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why not the government directly to hire the contractor who get the job done?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Because governments don&#39;t do a good job!</em> Because the government doesn&#39;t have to <strong><em>AND DO NOT</em></strong> act economically, and favor what&#39;s cheapest up front over what&#39;s least expensive across the service life. The contractor doesn&#39;t give a fuck because they&#39;d rather do it now, and next year, and next year, and next year, instead of doing it now, and in 50 years. </p>

<p><em>Governments don&#39;t do a good job and aren&#39;t economic because their income is by fiat - they claim it - instead of mutual transactions for exchange of goods and services.</em> </p>

<p>This is entirely because of the AMA&#39;s monopoly on doctor licensing, and the health insurance company&#39;s monopoly on provision of care. Without these market distortions, American healthcare would be far cheaper than single payer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I live in the UK, your UK farmers fact is completely wrong. I have enjoyed an awesome healthcare system for my whole life costing me less than private healthcare would for a full service that can&#39;t deny me care for any reason. My sister was born with a serious birth defect and she had excellent care for years and my mother is just recovering from cancer thanks to some absolutely excellent treatment. Not so much as a form to fill, no speaking to administrators, no bargaining to see which parts of your long term care will and wont be covered, no worrying that your policy might be altered or cancelled if you get seriously ill.</p>

<p>Like I said, it&#39;s a shame so many people misunderstand what universal healthcare actually means and actively fight to keep a system where they make private companies billions and still don&#39;t get full care unless they&#39;re willing to pay through the nose.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What the fuck is it with r/conspiracy supporting a government monopoly on healthcare!? Why this ONE ISSUE suddenly the government can do no wrong?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because some people live in countries where healthcare is freely available for all and realize how great a system it is when run properly and hate to see idiot Americans blindly arguing against it because of misinformation. In addition the American solution of privatizing everything is gradually creeping across the world and turning perfectly good public services into cash cows for PLCs and we&#39;re pretty irate about it.</p>

<p>So I live in a country where I can cite examples of how excellent our health service is but you&#39;re convinced that it must be bad because in your experience you don&#39;t think the government can get things right?

<p>Private healthcare is only more expensive when the government doesn&#39;t let the market operate. Did the United States have a healthcare expense problem in the 1950s? In the 1980s? Funny how the problem only existed after the government implemented healthcare regulations recognizing HMOS and giving existing insurance companies a monopoly on the market.

I&#39;ve even told you how to prove it, and pointed out that you also need to show that you also need to show how you will solve any identified fiscal problems by making health care more expensive for society.</p>

<p>Instead of doing the hard work of proving a point, you&#39;ve fallen back on the ideological whacking off salted with parading of ignorance. Wonderful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly think the issue is that most people are idiots.  They depend on someone else to take care of them, to better their situation and give them a chance to live that fancy &quot;American Dream&quot; they&#39;ve all been unable to obtain.  They have absolutely no idea what really goes on in this world, and get all of their information spoon fed to them from the MSM.  The same people that don&#39;t even know what Fukushima is and have no idea what is in the food they eat.  These poor slobs think that Obama is for the little guy because, exactly as you put it, they have no ability to think critically, they buy what is sold to them, the cult of personality, even though it is rotting the very roots of this country, which was already quite well &quot;clear cut&quot; above the ground once the corporate oligarchy and the private Federal Reserve had decades to sheer the middle class without respite.  Up next: martial law, police state, basically 1984.</p>

They will kill the internet when they need to also.  Yeah, I know a lot of techies on reddit will say this isn&#39;t possible.  Well, we&#39;ll wait and see.

    <div class="md"><p>I hear this argument most often from my room mate. Sure, just overlook all the unconstitutional inverted-totalitarianism legislation, the massive dig in and build up of armaments (gov&#39;t prepping), the &quot;assassination&quot; decree, the huge investment with lockheed martin for thousands of drones to be built and operated immediately with no plans to update the current overhead surveillance laws which date back to no later than the 80&#39;s, and say that &quot;wardog&quot; McCain would have been worse? I still don&#39;t see how this means it&#39;s in any way &quot;ok&quot; to overlook and cheerily support reelection. </p>

<p>Personally, I think it&#39;s fucking terrifying to watch rational people vehemently defend this administration. These, who voted for &#39;change&#39; FROM defense industry madness and corporate cronyism, happily overlook our further ingress into it all, and can&#39;t wait to get back into the box. my room mate is wearing his fucking lapel pins already. </p>

<p>edit: typos. always typos.</p>

<p>Because the republicans aren&#39;t letting him do anything! Trust me, his second term will be SO MUCH BETTER than his first!</p>

<p>(/ending sarcasm)</p>

<p>This guy went out of his way to start droning American citizens (and their children). His administration has stepped up the war on drugs, and has aggressively prosecuted whistleblowers. These are things the administration is already doing, and they will continue down this path with a second term.</p>

<p>I find nothing agreeable about Romney or the rest of the &quot;opposition&quot;, but I wish people would stop deceiving themselves about Obama.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Mind control.</strong></p>

<p>There were several Reddit posts to a website showing how easy it is to mind control people and that even when told the truth, people still take the lie they&#39;ve been fed into deep consideration, basically becoming a part of their life. </p>

<p>In fact the study itself said that its questionable if such studies are ethical, because the people tested on go home with a belief based on a lie that they can&#39;t shake off.</p>

<p>And I wouldn&#39;t be surprised that the elites are using all sorts of mind control techniques from sounds to images to even text to mind control us.</p>

<p>If someone has the link to the study I mentioned please reply to this and post it. Much appreciated, thanks.</p>

(I&#39;m not trying to be extremely snarky, just saying that there are tremendous financial and political barriers to changing the status quo.

<p>Obama and the democrats are <em>actually</em> working to protect the poor, while Romney and the other conservatives court the ultra-rich, all the while pretending that their &#39;tax cuts&#39; and reduction in &#39;entitlements&#39; won&#39;t harm the working class.  They&#39;re waging a class war, and <em>you&#39;re</em> the one who&#39;s bought into the propaganda that they&#39;re <em>not</em>.  </p>

<p>Paul is, for the poor, the <em>worst</em> candidate - he&#39;s not bought like Romney, he&#39;s just not smart enough to know any better.  He&#39;s a damn <em>creationist.</em>  This is a view that generally correlates with a low IQ.  Just sayin&#39;.  </p>

<p>This is called &#39;begging the question&#39;, where you assume that medicare would be <em>cheaper</em> under a less-regulated market.  You haven&#39;t proved this premise, so I don&#39;t see why I should bother responding to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In short by being in bed with the pharma and insurance companies. Starting back in the 40&#39;s with the stabilization act, the government limited the amount employers could pay an individual. Instead they encouraged employers to offer health insurance benefits due to it being now illegal to pay them more. This is how health insurance became tied to employment. </p>

<p>Suddenly, nobody is paying for their own insurance which causes the prices to go up, because who cares I&#39;m not fitting the bill. The trend continued with medicare medicade.  Also, eliminating competition by not allowing insurance to be sold over state lines, eliminating competition by giving pharma companies the sole right to sell a drug. These are just a few examples, off the top of my head I&#39;m sure I could research more. </p>

<p>The more the government interferes with the free market the higher costs get. </p>

<p>No, it&#39;s also the opinion of the vast majority of economists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The enemy of your enemy isn&#39;t always your friend.  Sometimes, he&#39;s just another enemy.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason no system like the one Ron Paul advocates exists anywhere in the world.  That kind of nearly-nonexistant government just isn&#39;t viable in a modern world.  If you&#39;re voting for him because you think he&#39;d be a good president, you&#39;re making a poor choice.</p>

<p>However, if you&#39;re voting for him with full knowledge that he can&#39;t win, and you want to send a message of dissent, that seems fine.  That said, if the government is nearly as corrupt as you think...don&#39;t you think a Ron Paul vote is like painting a target on your back in their alleged databases?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wellllll, I agree to an extent. Government shouldn&#39;t have a monopoly on healthcare, but the people in this country deserve it. The way it is currently set up, most people cannot afford either health insurance or to see a doctor regularly without it. The government here, as far fetched as it may be these days, is supposed to impose the will of the people in its laws. This is obviously not what is happening when a simple hour long surgery costs more than 30% + of the population makes in a year. So no government shouldn&#39;t have a monopoly on healthcare, but neither should greedy insurance corporations.</p>
