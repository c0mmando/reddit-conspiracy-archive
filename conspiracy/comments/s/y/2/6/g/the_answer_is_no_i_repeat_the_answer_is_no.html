<p>So, no. Jay-Z is not a member of the Illuminati. Nor is Madonna or whoever else you want to include in these absolutely ludicrous suggestions.</p>

<p>Even in its broadest definition, &quot;The Illuminati&quot; simply refers to the ruling elite (not the polticians, elected officials, etc. - No. I&#39;m talking about the real rulers... the ones who give their stamp/nod of approval to their puppets - the owners of everything).</p>

<p>At best (or worst?) entertainers are puppet idiots who have sold out and are allowing the illuminati to script their fame (no different than most politicians - sellouts to the highest bidder) - property of the Illuminati, maybe... but not members.</p>

<p>The only possible reason I can imagine for suggesting that &quot;Illuminati = Pop Culture&quot; is that of further discrediting conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>And, I find it truly disappointing that this subreddit doesn&#39;t bury that shit mercilessly and make examples of anyone who posts it.. The fact that any such post even receives one upvote in this subreddit sickens me. </p>

<p>Looking a bit deeper,...</p>

<p>I also realize that a great many of these posts are made by extremely new accounts (less than 30 days old). However, these new accounts are not new reddit users. They aren&#39;t fumbling their way around wondering where to post. No... they&#39;re coming directly here to this subreddit to deposit these shit bombs in our midst to make us look <strong>that stupid</strong>.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my opinion of these &quot;Is &lt;pop icon loser of the week&gt; a member of the Illuminati?&quot; questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just relax.  Anger impairs one&#39;s judgment.  Just continue to point out the crudity of such people who would look to obfuscate the truth.</p>

<p>Now, if YOU were a disinformation agent, attempting to influence people to react angrily, and reinforcing your credibility by voraciously attacking what in essence is your actual cause, that would be believable to me.  Why would the most well-funded and intelligent of people who wanted to exert influence attempt things in such a clumsy manner as the actions you&#39;ve pointed out?  I would much more readily believe that people who know psychology and how to game crowds would be well equipped to employ a dualistic and therefore more subtle approach.</p>

<p>Personally I try to live in good faith, as naive and childlike as that might make me, to avoid being a monster I have to act as if you are who you say you are, in which case I reiterate my counsel to you to use your intellect and not anger to pursue truth.  You speak of being discredited, this will happen fastest to people who do not appear cogent and well-thought.  Library up, lawyer up, and gym up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, like that zenmoon dude keeps saying... the real battle is within, not without.</p>

<p>Personally I think things are more sophisticated than that.  I believe that there are battles to fight within AND without, but you surely cannot improve external conditions past the level that you have sorted them within yourself.</p>

<p>There are intercranial and intracranial memetics.  There are your beliefs and inner processes, and there are also political and other views in books, and other non-human containers that can impress upon your inner workings.  So there is sorting to do in ourselves and in the world.  But I think it&#39;s clear that if a person is dysfunctional with anger or any other condition, they&#39;re not going to improve too many things outside of themselves until they get their own problems sorted.</p>

<p>This is the strength of a subtle class-warfare or dualistic psychological attack on a person or a populace.  If you can provoke the poor or politically unrepresented into appearing or behaving crazy or uncivilized, then it becomes much easier to justify having to control or eradicate them.</p>

<p>If I understand the essence of your position rightly, I agree.  I believe that there are probably ways to subtly psychologically demoralize persons and to make them prone to aggitation, perhaps even disease.  For all that I disagree with their claims regarding knowledge of the supernatural in traditional religions, they got one thing right: we ought to guard the &quot;gates&quot; of our senses against what I would call disruptive, contrary forms (this does not mean contrary opinions, necessarily, but something more subtle).</p>

<p>Q:  What lies on the ground, 1000 feet in the air?</p>

<p>A:  A dead millipede.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t hate someone just because they are a part of a particular group (political or genetic)... I try to see what people are like one at a time.  We are all born into situations that we had no control over, it&#39;s what we do with our own choices that show what we really are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are individuals, but groupmind is a very real phenomenon, and groups sometimes have specific philosophies and goals contrary to what I think to be just or benevolent.</p>

<p>So while, like you, I will not condemn someone merely for belonging to a group I happen to be averse to, because I am also a mere human, I may sometimes be, justly or unjustly, wary of them, or dismissive towards them, or frightened by them, or sometime, even hateful towards them, depending on their associations.</p>

<p>Also, thank you for the joke.</p>

<p>If I replace the punch line with &quot;a millipede that&#39;s playing dead&quot;, I do not think that the joke will suffer too much, and it would better suit me like that, seeing as I <em>like centipedes and millipedes</em>.  乂◠‿◠乂</p>
