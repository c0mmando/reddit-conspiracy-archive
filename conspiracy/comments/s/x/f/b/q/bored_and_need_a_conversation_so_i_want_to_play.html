    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not how this works.</p>

<p>Building 7 was not hit by any plane. NIST says it collapsed (symetrically, at freefall speed for 90% of its fall, into its own footprint) due to damage caused by a fire... which had already been extinguished.</p>

<p>Larry Silverstein consulted with some folks and gave the order to &quot;pull it&quot;. &quot;Pull it&quot; when referencing a building is common terminology in the demolition sector for demolishing a building (especially one already evacuated of personnel, only occupied by emergency responders). No where, ever, in the history of emergency response has &quot;pull it&quot; been common parlance for &quot;evacuate it&quot;. In his own statement he said [paraphrase]: So that&#39;s what they did. They gave the order to &quot;pull it&quot; and a few minutes we watched the building come down. (Notice, he didn&#39;t say &quot;and thankfully we gave that order just in time to save all those emergency responders&quot; - no... it was &quot;and a few minutes later we watched it come down&quot;).</p>

<p>I have no belief. I only have facts punching me in the face, keeping me awake at night.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am guessing your belief is that it looked a lot like a controlled demolition no?  With only a few fires and broken windows, it doesn&#39;t look like it could fall on those circumstances does it?  What many conspiracy theorists fail to notice however, is that building 7 was built over an electricity substation and a subway.  This means that instead of stable ground, this building was built on top of a hollow dome.  When the twin towers collapsed you have to understand that it had the approximate force of a 5.5 earthquake.  This could have easily broken the unstable structure underneath the building.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the biggest anomalies on 9/11 for me was NORAD and the Pentagon running a drill on September the 11th called Operation Vigilant Guardian. The scenario was terrorists attacks with planes involved being hijacked and flying in to buildings. My belief is this caused confusion when the real attack happened. </p>

<p>They sent the planes out towards the sea and I know this was standard procedure but surely the location of the hijacked planes could have be conveyed. They also moved fighter jets to other air bases which were out of range to intercept the planes in time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a reason why it is called a &quot;conspiracy&quot;, there is no hard evidence on anything the theorists say, all due respect.  There is hard evidence that there was a plane crash such as all of the plane debris.  We do not give the terrorists enough credit (not supporting them in any way).  Osama Bin ladin stayed hidden from our high tech satillites, soldiers, and anonymous tips.  It is not unlikely that they could have received information about the drill that the pentagon was running and used that against us.  This way, they would have no worries about being shot down by U.S forces.  Also, people are human, contrary to popular belief, we like to gossip.  There is no way a job this big could be kept secret for even a millisecond.  When the president was told about the attacks, many nano expressionists explained that Bush had a genuine look of surprise and fear.  If there is no hard evidence on your part, there is no point of arguing.</p>

<p>Oh, so very true. And the conspiracy theorists came out of the woodwork on September 12, 2001... and a few days later, as expected,  President Bush said, in a televised statement: Don&#39;t believe the conspiracy theorists.</p>

<li><p>The Manhattan Project was kept secret for years with thousands of people involved so a conspiracy on a grand scale can be kept secret.</p></li>
<li><p>Bush received the info on the attack while he was visiting a classroom. He let the class continue for 15 minutes after the initial information was given. A facial expression can be faked very easily.</p></li>
<li><p>There was only very small parts at the Pentagon, with no tail section or wings being present. This could have been from a type of cruise missile which have jet engines similar to a plane.</p></li>

<p>Oh, so very true. And the conspiracy theorists came out of the woodwork on September 12, 2001... and a few days later, as expected,  President Bush said, in a televised statement: Don&#39;t believe the conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>Establishing pre-emptive discredit for anyone who questions what the government eventually says about this.</p>

<p>Question for you: I tend to talk in my sleep from time to time. When I was younger, I would even walk in my sleep (outgrew that before high school). But, one thing I&#39;ve never done is participate in internet forums in my sleep. What&#39;s that like, anyway?</p>
