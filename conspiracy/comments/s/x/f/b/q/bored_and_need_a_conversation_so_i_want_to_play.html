       That's not how this works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Building 7 was not hit by any plane. NIST says it collapsed (symetrically, at freefall speed for 90% of its fall, into its own footprint) due to damage caused by a fire... which had already been extinguished.
      </p>
      <p>
       Larry Silverstein consulted with some folks and gave the order to "pull it". "Pull it" when referencing a building is common terminology in the demolition sector for demolishing a building (especially one already evacuated of personnel, only occupied by emergency responders). No where, ever, in the history of emergency response has "pull it" been common parlance for "evacuate it". In his own statement he said [paraphrase]: So that's what they did. They gave the order to "pull it" and a few minutes we watched the building come down. (Notice, he didn't say "and thankfully we gave that order just in time to save all those emergency responders" - no... it was "and a few minutes later we watched it come down").

       I am guessing your belief is that it looked a lot like a controlled demolition no?  With only a few fires and broken windows, it doesn't look like it could fall on those circumstances does it?  What many conspiracy theorists fail to notice however, is that building 7 was built over an electricity substation and a subway.  This means that instead of stable ground, this building was built on top of a hollow dome.  When the twin towers collapsed you have to understand that it had the approximate force of a 5.5 earthquake.  This could have easily broken the unstable structure underneath the building.

       And all of that just magically happened within minutes after Silverstein gave the order to pull it. Right? Just magical coincidence.

       One of the biggest anomalies on 9/11 for me was NORAD and the Pentagon running a drill on September the 11th called Operation Vigilant Guardian. The scenario was terrorists attacks with planes involved being hijacked and flying in to buildings. My belief is this caused confusion when the real attack happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       They sent the planes out towards the sea and I know this was standard procedure but surely the location of the hijacked planes could have be conveyed. They also moved fighter jets to other air bases which were out of range to intercept the planes in time.

       There is a reason why it is called a "conspiracy", there is no hard evidence on anything the theorists say, all due respect.  There is hard evidence that there was a plane crash such as all of the plane debris.  We do not give the terrorists enough credit (not supporting them in any way).  Osama Bin ladin stayed hidden from our high tech satillites, soldiers, and anonymous tips.  It is not unlikely that they could have received information about the drill that the pentagon was running and used that against us.  This way, they would have no worries about being shot down by U.S forces.  Also, people are human, contrary to popular belief, we like to gossip.  There is no way a job this big could be kept secret for even a millisecond.  When the president was told about the attacks, many nano expressionists explained that Bush had a genuine look of surprise and fear.  If there is no hard evidence on your part, there is no point of arguing.

       That's not how this works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Building 7 was not hit by any plane. NIST says it collapsed (symetrically, at freefall speed for 90% of its fall, into its own footprint) due to damage caused by a fire... which had already been extinguished.
      </p>
      <p>
       Larry Silverstein consulted with some folks and gave the order to "pull it". "Pull it" when referencing a building is common terminology in the demolition sector for demolishing a building (especially one already evacuated of personnel, only occupied by emergency responders). No where, ever, in the history of emergency response has "pull it" been common parlance for "evacuate it". In his own statement he said [paraphrase]: So that's what they did. They gave the order to "pull it" and a few minutes we watched the building come down. (Notice, he didn't say "and thankfully we gave that order just in time to save all those emergency responders" - no... it was "and a few minutes later we watched it come down").
