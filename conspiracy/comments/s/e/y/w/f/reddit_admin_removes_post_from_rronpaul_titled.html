       Someone notices it (and two similar posts) have been removed and makes a post
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ronpaul/comments/senrd/why_were_these_posts_deleted_from_rronpaul/">
        asking why

       steps in and

        says

        As for why, well, to copy-paste my response from the main thread:
       </p>
       <p>
        If you're going to donate, please just donate (and feel free to make posts that say "I donated $X!"). This sort of post is a hair away from paying for upvotes, which isn't ok.
       </p>
       <p>
        This isn't about the karma. It's about keeping the stuff on the "hot" list of subreddits sorted by what's interesting, not by "who's got the biggest wallet"

       The partisan censorship activities of the admins and mods insures that I will never pay for a Gold membership and that I will always run an ad blocker when using reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Taking money out of reddit's pocket is the only language the reddit "powers that be" might understand, however it is more likely they will never understand and instead blame the users for falling profits.  Once management decides to blame the users they will start engaging in a variety of punitive actions against us evil users.  At that point it will be time to start looking for a new home, because reddit will soon be closing it's doors for good.

       I was a senior mod on a top 10 subreddit.  I quit in protest over things like this, large and small.  Mods deleting posts and banning users for pointing out that the mods were paid shills (SolInvictus!) and mods using reddit as their own personal playground (BritishEnglishPolice) and mods defending and hiding the bad actions of other mods (countless) ....  I have just about had it with this site and 95% of the people in charge of it.  A few months ago I stepped down from modding voluntarily because I had spent a year trying to clean up a couple of the default subs and expose a couple paid spammers who had been made mods of large subs.  When I quit, I was unceremoniously banned from the moderator IRC channel and Paradox spent some time spreading lies and rumors about me since I wasn't present to defend myself.  I was accused of the very things I had tried to expose others for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly, I'm sick of this site.  For months I was promised a moderator spot on
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       as part of an effort to balance things out with the upcoming election.  For months I was put off for undefined, unexplained reasons.  Finally I was told no, because I was a frequent poster in
       <a href="/r/libertarian">
        /r/libertarian
       </a>
       and I would be 'biased'.  Think about that one real hard.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm done with reddit.  I'm done with the admins and mods who have no respect for the users and no interest in sticking to their own rules.  I put 5 years into this site, 2 of them doing a ton of work to try to help out, and at this point, I wouldn't miss it if I never saw it again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Deleting a self-post for being too similar to 'buying upvotes' is the last straw.  Such a post would be lauded if it were an Obama supporter - oh my! Look how grassroots-y and genuine his support is!  But it's Ron Paul, and we can't have him on our front page, now can we?

       Another thing i hate is how they say support small business, but then have all corporate websites. Huffington post, ThinkProgressive, Media Matters, NewYorkTimes etc are always at the top. I posted one article and it got a huge ammount of downvotes after i spent an hour writing the post about why gas prices are going up. Infact here is the post so you can read it yourself.

       I don't agree with you on the business thing.  I am a market capitalist, though a moderate about it as time progresses.  And I do have to say at one point reddit did give free advertising to a Ron Paul moneybomb, through a sponsored link.

       They have plenty.  I don't consider myself a Paul supporter.  I am a supporter of certain positions and issues and concerns, and I back any candidate that represents those things.  Paul, Kucinich, even Bernie Sanders and Barney Frank sometimes.

       Alright, hold the phone here. Do you have some way to verify what you are saying? I have just realized, after reading the post and comments twice, that you have not verified a single thing you have said. I cannot honestly endorse your opinion without verification of your status. Furthermore, if you
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       wanted to help, perhaps consider doing an AMA or some sort of self post to gather attention to this growing problem? Forgive my skepticism - Reddit has made me very cynical.

       I know who he is and seen him make the same statement before in another subreddit... The reason he's legit is because an admin actually talked to him or responded to what he was saying before. I could find you that post but I don't think he wants his identity revealed. But, from what I recall he also got shadowbanned for no apparent reason as well(later unbanned).

       Reddit is not about money, it's about control. The powers that be have been alerted to its ability to mobilize the masses into collective action, and they are seeking to put a lid on it. However, I think there will soon be an evolved version of reddit that will allow users to cryptographically sign their posts and upvotes, and select which moderators to trust which will make it impossible to censor. This version of reddit will end up like Digg and will be replaced with the newer censorship resistance version.

       If you really believe the "bosses" of reddit are that involved with the day-to-day moderation of a subreddit, then you have ludicrous expectations of how companies like this function. It's the failure of an administrator, now let's handle it in a constructive manner and make sure this BS is corrected. But you calling out all of reddit as "hypocrites" for not being immediately and deeply involved with the actions of
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       administrator isn't constructive at all, and it's the reason r/conspiracy has a bad rep.

       It's almost as if you expect another administrator to publicly call out his peer for all of reddit to see in some grandiose self-righteous demonstration of how to avoid the most remote semblance of professionalism. Try to set aside this idealist view of how you wish a business was run, and be just a bit pragmatic.

       Is it possible that you're correct in believing this admin's superiors are collaborating in a scheme to delete someone's post? I suppose. But until there's reason to believe that sort of meticulous (and tremendously inefficient) oversight is conducted by administrators' superiors, then your case isn't merely circumstantial, it's entirely speculative. There's no fundamentally truthful reason to believe your suggestions.

There is selective enforcement going on. Address it and fix it. If you do nothing and allow it to keep happening then you are clearly condoning it.

       Irrelevant.

       There is clear evidence of egregious enforcement of their policies yet nothing is done. It is reasonable to assume that they are aware of the frustration being shown and yet still nothing is done.

       So until proven otherwise, it appears that they have a policy of selective enforcement as they remain silent and allow it to continue.

       If the policy "$ for up-vote" is banned, why are we even having a conversation? If somebody has evidence of selective banning (yet to see any) please bring it forward. The single post showing older "$ for up-vote" posts only brings the question of when the ban first came about. If the ban began with Paul, then it's worth discussing.

       the issue the admins have is that they see this practice as essentially "buying" visibility, up votes are given on the premise of money being donated which rises a post to front pages.

       This is indeed true. I don't really see a problem with the removal although I will if they don't also remove other posts like it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could also be a marketer making clever use of the donation premise to get more attention focused on Ron Paul.

       That's an important component to this discussion. Why are we arguing this? It's not the same. You can't say (a+b) = c and then change it to (d+b) = c and call it the same.

      <p>
       A couple of people have said this but it's my understanding that the rule was in existence long before that. Do you happen to have a link to any discussion about enacting a new rule after the Doctors Without Borders posts?
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also the issue that the admin that deleted the Ron Paul post admitted that it didn't actually break the rules, only came close to breaking them. That was in the first post here about the issue... and no, I'm not going to go hunting for it.

       Since the Doctors Without Borders thing was largely, if not entirely, a product of
       <a href="/r/atheism">
        /r/atheism
       </a>
       , the announcement was in the sidebar of that subreddit, but is obviously no longer there.  You can see that it
       <em>
        was

       there in the

       Since early December, the only donations-for-upvotes style posts I could find were in
       <a href="/r/circlejerk">
        /r/circlejerk
       </a>
       , or were downvoted into oblivion.  We're talking about 5-6 posts here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I went hunting so you don't have to.  What you have on your hands is the first dollars-for-upvotes post in months, and the admins were uneasy about it.  That's hardly a conspiracy, and I'll be happy if the mods continue to remove
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       such posts.  It's good policy.

        Even the mod of /r/ronpaul agrees with the removal of the post.

       If you weren't taking me seriously then you wouldn't be trying to distract everyone from my original comment and link... not to mention bringing all your buddies over from conspiratard[sic] and EPS to downvote it en masse.

       Fair enough. It's equally reasonable to believe it's a single admin with a sense of fairness distorted by their own agenda.
