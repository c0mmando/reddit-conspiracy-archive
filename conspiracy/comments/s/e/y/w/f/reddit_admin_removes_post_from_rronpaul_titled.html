A reddit admin not associated with r/ronpaul called <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/kemitche">kemitche</a> steps in and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ronpaul/comments/senrd/why_were_these_posts_deleted_from_rronpaul/c4dg3uz">says</a>:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The posts were removed by me (admin &amp; employee of reddit), not by a moderator of <a href="/r/ronpaul">/r/ronpaul</a></p>

<p>As for why, well, to copy-paste my response from the main thread:</p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to donate, please just donate (and feel free to make posts that say &quot;I donated $X!&quot;). This sort of post is a hair away from paying for upvotes, which isn&#39;t ok.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t about the karma. It&#39;s about keeping the stuff on the &quot;hot&quot; list of subreddits sorted by what&#39;s interesting, not by &quot;who&#39;s got the biggest wallet&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>one redditor <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ronpaul/comments/senrd/why_were_these_posts_deleted_from_rronpaul/c4dfyms">comments</a>:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>because it made it to the front page of reddit (not just the frontpage of <a href="/r/ronpaul">/r/ronpaul</a>). That sort of successful promotion of a Ron Paul moneybomb can&#39;t be tolerated on reddit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Others are asking why the doctors without borders donation posts were not also removed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The partisan censorship activities of the admins and mods insures that I will never pay for a Gold membership and that I will always run an ad blocker when using reddit.</p>

<p>Taking money out of reddit&#39;s pocket is the only language the reddit &quot;powers that be&quot; might understand, however it is more likely they will never understand and instead blame the users for falling profits.  Once management decides to blame the users they will start engaging in a variety of punitive actions against us evil users.  At that point it will be time to start looking for a new home, because reddit will soon be closing it&#39;s doors for good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was a senior mod on a top 10 subreddit.  I quit in protest over things like this, large and small.  Mods deleting posts and banning users for pointing out that the mods were paid shills (SolInvictus!) and mods using reddit as their own personal playground (BritishEnglishPolice) and mods defending and hiding the bad actions of other mods (countless) ....  I have just about had it with this site and 95% of the people in charge of it.  A few months ago I stepped down from modding voluntarily because I had spent a year trying to clean up a couple of the default subs and expose a couple paid spammers who had been made mods of large subs.  When I quit, I was unceremoniously banned from the moderator IRC channel and Paradox spent some time spreading lies and rumors about me since I wasn&#39;t present to defend myself.  I was accused of the very things I had tried to expose others for.</p>

<p>Frankly, I&#39;m sick of this site.  For months I was promised a moderator spot on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> as part of an effort to balance things out with the upcoming election.  For months I was put off for undefined, unexplained reasons.  Finally I was told no, because I was a frequent poster in <a href="/r/libertarian">/r/libertarian</a> and I would be &#39;biased&#39;.  Think about that one real hard.</p>

<p>I&#39;m done with reddit.  I&#39;m done with the admins and mods who have no respect for the users and no interest in sticking to their own rules.  I put 5 years into this site, 2 of them doing a ton of work to try to help out, and at this point, I wouldn&#39;t miss it if I never saw it again.</p>

<p>Deleting a self-post for being too similar to &#39;buying upvotes&#39; is the last straw.  Such a post would be lauded if it were an Obama supporter - oh my! Look how grassroots-y and genuine his support is!  But it&#39;s Ron Paul, and we can&#39;t have him on our front page, now can we?</p>

<p><strong>Fuck Reddit</strong></p>

<p>Edit:  this is not my normal account.  I have been using this one lately (having made it to avoid a stalker last year) because fuck reddit and fuck having to watch what I say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, hold the phone here. Do you have some way to verify what you are saying? I have just realized, after reading the post and comments twice, that you have not verified a single thing you have said. I cannot honestly endorse your opinion without verification of your status. Furthermore, if you <em>really</em> wanted to help, perhaps consider doing an AMA or some sort of self post to gather attention to this growing problem? Forgive my skepticism - Reddit has made me very cynical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit is not about money, it&#39;s about control. The powers that be have been alerted to its ability to mobilize the masses into collective action, and they are seeking to put a lid on it. However, I think there will soon be an evolved version of reddit that will allow users to cryptographically sign their posts and upvotes, and select which moderators to trust which will make it impossible to censor. This version of reddit will end up like Digg and will be replaced with the newer censorship resistance version. </p>

<p>When you enact selective enforcement for policies you have then theres a problem. </p>

<p>That was a terrible assumption.</p>

<p>I expect what any other person expects. Accountability. 
There is selective enforcement going on. Address it and fix it. If you do nothing and allow it to keep happening then you are clearly condoning it.</p>

<p>Irrelevant. </p>

<p>There is clear evidence of egregious enforcement of their policies yet nothing is done. It is reasonable to assume that they are aware of the frustration being shown and yet still nothing is done. </p>

<p>So until proven otherwise, it appears that they have a policy of selective enforcement as they remain silent and allow it to continue. </p>

<p>Like I said when I first entertained your reply. I wont be playing these games.</p>

<p>Okay, on a serious note. Are you <a href="http://msnbcmedia1.msn.com/j/msnbc/Components/Photos/040527/040527_bozo_ccol.grid-4x2.jpg">this guy?</a> Because you kind of remind me of him with your baloney. :D</p>

<p>P.S. I&#39;d like everyone to look at CitationGivens account and look at his history of harassing EnoughObamaSpam posters and if he deletes any comments it&#39;s okay I have copies as well. ;)</p>

<p>Plain as day, right there in your comment. Continuing to lie when your admission is right next to your lie is just sad. </p>

<p>Ah, the Cow we all know and love: faced with something impossible to answer; refuses to answer and changes the subject. </p>

<p>The only &quot;poster<strong><em>s</em></strong>&quot; I&#39;ve talked about are you and your sockpuppets, Cow. One person. </p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty hard to go on the offensive when you say &quot;these other accounts aren&#39;t me&quot; despite admitting to owning and using those accounts elsewhere. You lied, and blatantly so -- you were caught. Game over, hypocrite. </p>

<p>Nope. You&#39;ve harassed krugman as well when the whole IP Ban thing happened.  You just deleted your old comments and keep trying to hide your history like a pussy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s okay though because there&#39;s a place for people like you to get the help they need. Just call 911 and tell them you&#39;re mentally incapable of living life normally and they will help you ASAP. ;D</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have to call you crazy since you already prove that yourself with all the stalking son.</p>

<p>Your claim: you are not any user other than the &quot;Cow&quot; accounts. </p>

<p>Reality, through your own admission: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/AkJKa.png">You clearly admit to owning the other accounts right here, when called out by crackduck</a>.</p>

<p>So, you&#39;re interpretation to admitting is speculation?</p>

<p>No wonder you post in conspira<strong>tard</strong>, a subreddit meant for the mentally disabled. :(</p>

<p>I seriously feel sorry for you dude since you can&#39;t stop foaming at the mouth and the hatred towards me is pretty sad honestly.</p>

<p>EDIT: I guess he&#39;s done raging. I hope he didn&#39;t get a heart attack from all that anger pent up inside himself.</p>

<p>A couple of people have said this but it&#39;s my understanding that the rule was in existence long before that. Do you happen to have a link to any discussion about enacting a new rule after the Doctors Without Borders posts?</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the issue that the admin that deleted the Ron Paul post admitted that it didn&#39;t actually break the rules, only came close to breaking them. That was in the first post here about the issue... and no, I&#39;m not going to go hunting for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since the Doctors Without Borders thing was largely, if not entirely, a product of <a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a>, the announcement was in the sidebar of that subreddit, but is obviously no longer there.  You can see that it <em>was</em> there in the <a href="https://www.google.ca/#sclient=psy-ab&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;q=site:reddit.com+%22Announcement+re%3A+Upvote+Donation+Posts%22&amp;amp;oq=site:reddit.com+%22Announcement+re%3A+Upvote+Donation+Posts%22&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;aqi=&amp;amp;aql=&amp;amp;gs_nf=1&amp;amp;gs_l=serp.3...204063.208253.2.208795.8.8.0.0.0.0.112.527.7j1.8.0.dQg4-M4uPNM&amp;amp;psj=1&amp;amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&amp;amp;fp=b2d52bd808460ee0&amp;amp;biw=1210&amp;amp;bih=609">Google cache</a>, but unfortunately the announcement page itself is in the wind.</p>

<p>Since early December, the only donations-for-upvotes style posts I could find were in <a href="/r/circlejerk">/r/circlejerk</a>, or were downvoted into oblivion.  We&#39;re talking about 5-6 posts here.</p>

<p>I went hunting so you don&#39;t have to.  What you have on your hands is the first dollars-for-upvotes post in months, and the admins were uneasy about it.  That&#39;s hardly a conspiracy, and I&#39;ll be happy if the mods continue to remove <em>all</em> such posts.  It&#39;s good policy.</p>

<p>edit: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ronpaul/comments/senrd/why_were_these_posts_deleted_from_rronpaul/c4drqtx">Even the mod of /r/ronpaul agrees with the removal of the post.</a></p>
