       I just notice how some school teachers will call things "conspiracy theories" up until the point where they are told by the media that it is no longer a conspiracy theory, and then, without missing a beat, the teachers begin teaching the old conpiracy theory as fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       One I can think of is the gulf of Tonkein incident. The other is the existence of the Bilderberg group.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are some other events that were considered false for a period of time, before being declared true?

       Don't forget the tungsten-filled gold conspiracy which, while suggested 3-5yrs ago, is currently proving itself true. The suggestion was that a high-end American enterprise, possibly with special forces/Fed connection, have been receiving 1.1-1.5 million 1-kg gold bars from the Fed, hollowing them out, salting them with tungsten, and sending them back to the Fed.

       virus/malware monitoring making value judgements about webpages and then blocking some? i know "internet monitoring" or whatever is always a part of these huge suite packages but that doesn't mean blocking a site like that is necessary. i mean what is the point of having an anti virus installed if it blocks the page entirely? don't I have the AV software so i can look at webpages and not randomly get a goddamn virus?

       Actually there is no real evidence that the burning was a false flag. This has been a staple of western propaganda that became enshrined as 'fact', but no proof exists.

       No proof exists that Jimmy Hoffa was murdered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shall we presume that Van Der Lubbe, who was semi-retarded, burned down the entire Reichstag with a pack of matches, and was "found" (like Satam al Suqami's passport in the WTC rubble on 9/11 by the FBI --
       <em>
        which IS considered by the mainstream to be authentic evidence
       </em>
       ) behind the burning building (with the matches &amp; a Communist ID card, Holy Scapegoat, Batman!) was simply the unfortunate truth even though it was all too convenient for the newly-appointed Hitler?
      </p>
      <p>
       Shall we presume the undisputed tunnels from Goering's residence to the Reichstag were a temptation resisted by the Nazis, even though the Enabling Act was the shining prize that resulted from the fire?
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Reichstag Fire-as-Nazi-calling-card does not belong in the "historical facts" record, then it certainly belongs in the "highly suspicious" book.  The "No Proof Exists" book is a specious, dangerous debunking point that is all-too-easy &amp; disregards extraordinary historical circumstantial evidence, that can be abused regarding everything from Jimmy Hoffa to the Missing Link ... and
       <em>
        no proof exists
       </em>
       that Van Der Lubbe was the culprit or sole culprit.

       When I was a kid all the history texts said it was a false flag. Actually I've recently read there was no proof. It could have been Allied propaganda. I've read the conclusion many times but never seen the evidence.

       I don't remember very much of anything taught about any aspect of the war. I do however remember seeing a show, "documentary" about the lampshade, human soap topic being discussed elsewhere in this thread. It was very disturbing to say the least.

       The Israeli attack on USS Liberty has been proven to have been deliberate, and was intended to provoke a US strike against Egypt. With all the information that has come out, and the eye-witness testimonies, it can no longer be considered merely a theory.
      </p>

       Another conspiracy theory that has been proven true is that Israel possesses a stockpile of nuclear warheads.

       When the Liberty first came under attack, planes were immediately sent out from a US carrier ... not to defend Liberty, but to attack Egypt. They were called back when it became clear that the attackers were Israeli, not Egyptian. I ran across this information when reading a detailed account of the events surrounding the attack on Liberty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here, I've found
       <a href="http://www.uss-liberty.com/2010/10/03/the-1967-israeli-attack-on-the-uss-liberty-false-flag-hatched-by-israeli-and-u-s-intelligence-for-invasion-of-egypt-and-possibly-ww3/">
        a page
       </a>
       that carries the same tidbit of information:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        The Liberty‘s S.O.S. message was picked up by the U.S. 6th fleet patrolling 400 miles west in the Mediterranean. Nuclear-armed A-4 bombers are launched from the USS America aircraft carrier. A nuclear strike had been ordered against Egypt. The U.S. embassy in Cairo was notified that an attack was coming. A few minutes later, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara from the Pentagon orders the aircraft recalled.

       Actually nuclear explosions can be done pretty effective now a days, smaller, and what have you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, a lot of nuclear bombs have gone off on our planet already simply for testing purposes. Overall I there have been over 1,000 easily. There's a youtube video about it, but I haven't seen it in awhile.

       My idiot dad doesn't believe this.  Can you direct me to some proof which sounds MSMesque authoritative?  Or some actual authority?  I found in
       <a href="http://fair.org">
        FAIR
       </a>
       the report from 2010 from the IAEA in which they mention that in 2005 Israel didn't participate in the nonproliferation treaty, but I don't know where to look to find anything more specific than that.  Don't we know this because of some high profile legal case involving espionage or something?

       I see where you are coming from. I have thought the same thing about this whole OL business. For a few weeks I was going crazy thinking about that it would happen. Then I got more calm and then nothing happened on the opening ceremony. It's not over yet though, so I am not sure, but damn that would be fucked up if a false flag operation occurred..

       Conspiracy always devolves into a mixture of speculative delusion and tired repetition.

       I think it has to do with the mod censorship that people are starting to notice all over reddit. The mods are pumping this sub-reddit so full of disinformation it distracts from the actual researchers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if you'd like I can provide proof (like actual evidence, primary documents etc) for any number of the conspiracies I'm familiar with.

       I put together courses for a UC History professor, who clearly does not think my research is "speculative delusion and/or tired repetition" because she has hired me to put together more courses for her.

       This a known Tactic for shutting down the legitimacy and free flow of information on a forum. Posing as useful members to gain mod status, then destroying the forum from within by slipping important ideas, spreading disinformation, creating hostile environments for certain members etc. I was on a forum this happened to, the last thing to happen when they couldn't break us, was an invasion by anonys trolling us. They stayed and killed the forums.

       Conspiracy becomes tired repetition because I've personally read it all.

       And the speculative delusions result from people trying to predict the future, or the collapse, or the revolution.

       For full points, we should be able to demonstrate marginalized conspiracists before, and good documentation afterward. For example, Gulf of Tonkin, I'm unaware of where there were claims that it was faked before it slowly came out, but this would add greatly to the historical knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Upvoted in the hopes we'll get more good examples here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Certainly, many things have been revealed slowly over time. But I'm having a hard time thinking of something that nicely fits the pattern "people in the wilderness claim and are denied" followed by "well established fact in the mainstream".
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, Bilderberg, was the existence of the meeting itself ever in question? To my limited knowledge, it has seemed that it's more that there has been a lack of information about their actions, and claims about what those are.

       F.D.R. started with gold at a legally fixed value, confiscated massive amounts of gold while compensating people at that price (vis-a-vis eminent domain-backed executive order - "Executive Order #6102"), and then hiked the price of gold up, creating a $2,800,000,000 increase in value.  adjusting upwards at percent of GDP, that's a modern $750,000,000,000 increase in the value of the gold confiscated.  in other words, he engineered one of the largest thefts in U.S. history.

       Not sure the Bilderberg groups existence was ever a conspiracy. If the Bilderberg group controls and manipulates the world for some evil greedy purpose maybe a conspiracy theory, but by no means has that been proven to be a mainstream fact. except for here of course.

       I meant to say 'soap and lampshades' were once construed as fact but are now recognized to have been propaganda. The same is true with Nazi head shrinking and most of the holocaust propaganda cited above. The 'conspiracy theory' was that these claims were overblown propaganda.

       Not really wrong. There is supposed to have been an experiment, which took place off the camps, and did not involve Jews, to make soap from human fat. One experiment, one time. It was never done in any other way. So the soap stories are all false. The Nazis were not rendering down Jews for soap.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the lampshade story, various articles were made from the skin of dead human beings in Victorian times, as a kind of joke, but I've seen no credible report of the Nazis turning Jews into lampshades.

       It's wrong in the sense that it was a past conspiracy theory that turned out to be an historical fact. It is not an historical fact, therefore, it is wrong.

       This is how wrong you have it. Of civilians transported to be murdered, by the German government during that period, it was 12 million persons or slightly more. Only half or less than half were Jews.

       Off the top of my head, the crime scene was bulldozed for one. What would be the point of that if not cover-up. Oh and there were no pyrotechnics used, expect for the flash bangs that were found in the rubble. The compound front door gone missing. See "Waco: The Rules of Engagement".

       I don't have a cite handy but it's hardly disputed: J. Edgar Hoover's insistence that organized crime/mafia was a myth (lol).

      <p>
       Also, there's E. Howard Hunt's deathbed confession about rogue government elements having involvement in the Kennedy assassination (though I don't know if that's enough to call it "fact").  Audio is probably still available on youtube.

       This a known Tactic for shutting down the legitimacy and free flow of information on a forum. Posing as useful members to gain mod status, then destroying the forum from within by slipping important ideas, spreading disinformation, creating hostile environments for certain members etc. I was on a forum this happened to, the last thing to happen when they couldn't break us, was an invasion by anonys trolling us. They stayed and killed the forums.
