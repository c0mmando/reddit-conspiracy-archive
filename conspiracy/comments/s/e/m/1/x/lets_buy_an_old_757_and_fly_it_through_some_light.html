       Could a 757 knock down several light poles, leave no clearly discernible debris field (see, e.g.,

        straight line
       </a>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       We could test this, couldn't we? Any idea how much would it cost? I think new 757-200's cost something like 70-80 million.. but there must be old ones for sale somewhere...

       Better yet, let's run it smack into a limestone-faced steel-structured building and watch the 120ft. [?] span of wings not clip neatly back and tuck themselves through a 20ft hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have always fantasized about running this experiment. I've wondered if you could put the plane on some sort of track with a catapulting device to get it up to some sort of comparable speed; but this seem impossible to carry out.

       why can't we just buy an old 757, recreate the conditions at the pentagon (light poles, pentagon building wall itself), and fly the plane via remote control using the "official" flight trajectory relative to the light poles/pentagon?
      </p>
      <p>
       seems possible to me
      </p>
      <p>
       might not be able to get away with it in the US, but that's probably where it would be the most expensive anyway, including all the fees, fines, and BS you'd have to deal with. I bet somewhere like Russia would work, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       if we couldn't work out the details of remote control, we could probably figure out some kind of catapult track device.. but i'd really prefer to make the experiment as similar to the (supposed) actual events as possible, so that there is as little room for people to doubt or dismiss the results as possible

       Theoretically, if you managed to do this, and in doing so recreated quite accurately what happened at the pentagon in the 'official' version, would you be satisfied with that conclusion?

       I think the first thing the experiment would show is that flying a boeing 757 in that orbital flight-path 3/4's way around the pentagram is technically impossible.

       True.  We're talking about an aircraft with an empty weight of around 60 metric tonnes.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was travelling at 400mph, it would cover the 150M between the light poles and the pentagon in a bit less than a second.   Travelling at 400mph and no faster, I calculated it covers 177M in the following second.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people say that it 'kept flying' and 'maintained control', I wonder if they are mistaking the distances.  With this sort of timeframe, there's very little you could do to change the flightpath even if you wanted to.  I don't know why people think the aircraft required precise control, or what it could have done in the way of rolling in that fraction of a second before impact.

       Why do you think there would be tons of debris?  It would have continued traveling at 500 mph with the plane.

       Video didn't work for me and there seems to be a lot of skepticism to other claims in that thread. As for the light posts i think people overestimate how strong they are. All that hold them up is some bolts at the bottom of the pole.

       the video isn't really what's important. see, e.g.:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It has been my contention that the damage to the poles is completely inconsistent with the damage that should have happened as a result of a large aircraft striking them at 400+ mph, the final point of rest of the downed poles is also completely inconsistent, the damage done to the wings would have been severe, so sever as to significantly disrupt the lift of the wings and very nearly 100% certain that the lift would be disrupted significantly unequally between the left and right wings. This would cause the plane to start rolling, and as the plane was so close to the ground one of the wings would have struck the ground causing a very dramatic crash somewhat before it even reached the outer wall of the Pentagon.

       I disagree. The damage in my opinion would have been moderate at most and not have affected its next few moments of flight. It already had so much momentum it would have hit the pentagon if there had been twice the poles. These poles were close to the pentagon so i believe that there wouldn't have been enough time for rolling to occure due to damage on hte wings.

       What about debris? The lamp poles were bent pretty badly, yet the plane leaves little or no debris trail. Seems impossible.

       not only that, but the plane on video entering the world trade center building slices through like a knife through butter.  no deformation, no wings or engines come off.. .clean through, as if it was a plane painted over a video of a missile strike.  but there was an E4B in the air at the time at new york and later at pentagon?  why?  how did they know to be there?  why was E4B needed?

       isn't a thought experiment enough?   really, can a plane slice through steel framed building at any speed without deformation?
      </p>
      <p>
       is the collision expected to be partially elastic, or is it completely inelastic? (as appears on the videos)
      </p>
      <p>
       at least some of the momentum from the collision should be seen to deform the plane.  it doesn't, therefore it can not be a passenger plane, but more likely a missile designed for that purpose.  It's easy enough to paint over live video in real-time - I've seen it used commonly in sports broadcasts.

       'missile painted over' could be true. the thing is, relying on "thought experiments" doesn't work when there is so much noise in the mix. Plane? No plane? Cruise missile? Controlled demolition?
      </p>
      <p>
       i'm tired of relying on peoples' "thoughts"
      </p>
      <p>
       i want actual experiments that show actual results. that way no one can question your algorithms, simulation programs, thought processes, or ideologies
      </p>
      <p>
       once (if) we show, without doubt, that it couldn't have been commercial airliners at WTC and/or pentagon.. then we can start figuring out what it could have been. but as long as the public thinks it's ridiculous to think that the damage at WTC/pentagon was NOT caused by a commercial airliner.. and you have no hard evidence to show that it could not have been caused by a commercial airliner... you probably won't get very far with "missiles painted over" theories
      </p>
      <p>
       without making any assumptions or conclusions, we can run experiments that show what would have really happened if commercial airliners flew into the pentagon/WTC. if the results don't match the "official story," the fallout could be damning for the government and whoever else was involved. but as long as people are just running 'thought experiments,' and not producing any hard evidence, the media can label you a conspiracy theorist and push you aside

       good luck getting your hands on the evidence and subpoena power.  the best we have is the video and eyewitness testimony.   the videos especially show many things that don't jibe with reality.

      <p>
       when you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains however improbable must be the truth.    I can list 75 reasons why the hijack theory is full of holes.   That's 75 assumptions.. too many for me.

       basically the 'south of citgo' flight path had to have been taken by flight 77 in order for the plane to have knocked down the light poles, but witnesses say the plane's flight path went north of the citgo.

       that's what i don't understand. how can people believe that a 757 can knock down light poles and continue to fly? in a straight line? and not leave a huge trail of debris?
      </p>
      <p>
       if we flew a remote-controlled 757 through some light poles and recorded what happened.. and then compared that to the light poles and "debris" from flight 77.. and posted the video to youtube.. no one of sound mind would be able to believe the 'official story'
      </p>
      <p>
       maybe we can make the 757 that knocked down light poles go down in history with JFK's magic bullet

       It's not like it continued? to fly? and went soaring about safely.  Try and stop 60+ tonnes of aircraft moving at over 400mph from travelling in a straight line for the second or so between impacting the light poles and hitting the building.  The kinetic energy involved was massive, and remember that a car can take down one of those poles if moving fast enough.

       but the poles are bent and there is almost no debris field.
      </p>
      <p>
       i would expect that the wings, after being used to bend telephone poles, would not remain intact. yet i see zero evidence of any debris field or pieces of wing. there should be pieces of airplane at the same location as the poles.. yet there is nothing.

       which i posted above but was mysteriously downvoted for .. shows more evidence that the light poles were most likely planted

       I would think that an experiment could be setup simply using a wing on a dolly moving at the alleged speed would be sufficient.

       possibly.. good idea. might have to do that if we can't simulate the real thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       i think recreating the (supposed) actual conditions would be the best, though. if you put a wing on a dolly and move it through a light pole, it might mean something, but people could easily say it's "just an experiment" and "doesn't really prove anything".. for example, if the wing is not attached to a plane, it will not act exactly as it would if it were.. meanwhile, if you actually fly a 757 through light poles that are designed to be very similar to the ones that got knocked down at the pentagon and try to get the plane to keep going straight into and through concrete walls ... and then show the world the results of the experiment.. i think that would send a very clear and powerful message, whatever the results

       how about just a wing on a swing arm powered by a air canon? if the force is less and causes any major damage then the increased speed would not make it more durable...?

       The wings still would have gone into the Pentagon, but they would have been folded towards the airplane by the impact with the lightpoles. Objects in Motion tend to stay in motion, and the plane would have enough velocity that the plane and any parts would have gone straight into the Pentagon despite the Loss in velocity from the impact with the lampposts This is all assuming the plane was flying at or near the 757's top Speed of 609 mph.

       wings don't "fold." i've never seen wings fold. have you?

       if a plane hit multiple lamp posts, and those lamp posts bent, i bet that there would be significant debris starting from around where you found the lamp pole to wherever the plane went next.

      <p>
       i see no significant debris.

       I recall watching a video of a computer simulation of the crash on the WTC, showing the damage to structure and subsequent raging fire. Don't remember if it was more of a visual simulation rather than an actual stress/solid materials one.

       Guess with current super-computers a
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       simulation taking into account structural materials and the office equipment could be churned out? I'm talking about Watson-level mainframes.
