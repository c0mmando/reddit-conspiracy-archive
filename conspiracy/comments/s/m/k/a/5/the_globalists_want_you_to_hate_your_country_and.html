    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t have to trust me. I am just trying to help us all in the right direction. If you are against one world government, what is the alternative? What is supposed to protect us from corporations taking over and ruling with impunity? This is the true function of government, but corporations and billionaires have found how to make government say uncle. We can take the power back, but we all need to be on the same page. Patriotism is only foolish when it is blind patriotism. America is not what we see and hear every day from the media. We have been taken over from the inside by a group of very powerful and very evil men who seek to use our military and police state in order to subvert their enemies, all the while convincing us that this is America doing these things. The same is true of Israel and practically true of every aligned nation. So to be patriotic to the destructive elite is absolutely a fools game, but to be patriotic to the true spirit of what your government does right is not. Our government is the last protective layer we have against the tyranny of the elite. If we let it go out the window we can kiss our freedom goodbye. This is why I say we should be patriotic in the truest form. But I digress, if you still do not trust me. I only say these things because I feel it will lead us to victory. I have no ulterior motives. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>america is a country stolen from the natives, with pathetic child poverty rates juxtaposed with global imperialism. has been from the beginning. &quot;true&quot; patriotism is pacifism- refusing to violate human dignity through violence against anyone.</p>

<p>we do need a world government, just not one run by bankers. we need a world government that is an assembly of delegates from regions which are assembled from delegates of cities which are governed by delegates from neighborhoods.</p>

<p>we need a ground-up global government. the bankers are going down, but nationalism is a disease too. </p>

<p>come to OWS, we&#39;ll figure it out together! :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for that, also, I feel we should all be true globalists and realize we&#39;re all on this rock together. Nations are unescessary for a functioning society. We will never beat TPTB until a large enough people understand that. The heads of state, various secret societies, plutocrats and other so called globalists are not, they have fraudulently claimed the title globalist. We are the globalists and Iceland is but one example of a highly functioning society. While still having a faulty and corruptable democracy, their size makes it much more difficult for their leaders to stay aloof and certain important decisions are made by referendum. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>that&#39;s why i want OWS to focus on election reform, even before citizens united. CU is only a symptom of our unresponsive electoral system. </p>

<p>if we untie our hands from behind our backs with instant runoff, referendums, etc., we can tackle CU and the next half dozen things in the time and effort it would take to fix CU alone without the benefit of election reform. </p>

<p>the plutocrats will always use their money in politics, whether it is a bribe or whatever. but their worst nightmare is to have ten thousand responsive candidates that know they will be held accountable to the electorate; candidates that know they need to do better than hiding behind the party bosses and just being the lesser of two evils. that is just too many people to bribe simultaneously. their lobbying system would fall apart.</p>

This latin term means 
ORDER OUT OF CHAOS.
&quot;They&quot; enjoy making you think that the idea to do WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO DO was your idea in the first place.
For example, people out there think the RFID chip is super neat and a fun idea.</p>

<p>In the end, people will SCREAM and possibly beg for a new world order compared to the bloodshed they plan to unleash.</p>

<p>I personally will not and would rather die. But I am a dinosaur after all. It&#39;s you young people that will have to deal with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>many large political groups do have dark histories, but can any of them really compare to the catholic church?</p>

<p>i don&#39;t think anyone should be ashamed of their race, but one can definitely not pay money to tax-exempt scammers. fuck religion.|</p>

<p>white people could also stand to be compassionate towards people whose ancestors were killed by our ancestors. can you imagine how it would feel to see a rich guy drive by, knowing that he got that way because his ancestors killed yours? brutal.</p>

<p>OP is trying to make this a race war, when what we need is a class war.</p>

<p>maybe original replier? OR? idk. </p>

<p>also, i&#39;m all for non-violence as long as the plutocrats are no longer in charge. if it is between violence and being put in paupers&#39; camps, we all remember what happened in the warsaw ghetto. but yeah, non-violence all the way. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not for this nwo global government business but honestly, it&#39;s better then killing innocent people everyday (assuming we stop killing people once it happens, but then there is overpopulation...) </p>

<p>Yeah we&#39;re screwed. </p>
