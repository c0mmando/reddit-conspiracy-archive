       I meant $15 trillion.

      <p>
       It is part of the same money that showed up in Italy and in the US Federal Court law suit in NYC.

       The back story is a demand by the "white dragon society" for payment in gold for their bearer bonds and funds transferred to cover those bonds.

       The items of news have been strung together by Benjamin Fulford into an episodic conspiracy which is unfolding on a timetable that was supposed to culminate this month.

       This announcement seems to be calling for fellow humans to rise up and arrest the evil doers. In my mind that is the neocons of the Bush era. I can't get close to these people. If I could, I do not think I could say "in the name of humanity I place you under a citizens arrest, come with me; you will have to answer for your crimes". If I did would they willingly submit to arrest? If they did where would I take them? None of this makes sense to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are there disgruntled high level operatives plotting a coup
       <em>
        in every western country
       </em>
       ? In the G5? Anywhere? If so aren't tptb taking precautions now that the plot has gone public? This doesn't make sense either.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the people who are at the source of the problem start showing up dead we will know the international society of ninjas (including the after-school marshal arts schools) are eliminating them. They won't need our help so why the announcement or the appeal? Again, it doesn't make sense to me.

       What I think of Benjamin Fulford is he is outraged and trying to start a revolution.

       Yes but it might be because the banking/usury system is failing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of us are just living normal lives and do not have any knowledge of what is going on behind the scenes. So when a guy who does have or has had such access we treat him as an expert.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never even heard of the white dragon society until Fulford said he was the spokesperson. It may be that he
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       their spokesperson and there may be an international conspiracy to overturn the old world order. There is no way for us to know. BUT there are alternate explanations for every thing Fulford says that make more sense.

       Your military family is the "white hats". Are they plotting and planning to defeat the new world order? I don't think so. A few minutes ago I spoke to a soldier who just got back from Afghanistan. You know what he is thinking about? Finding a place to live, visiting relatives deciding on his career path. The uprising that Fulford has conjured up is only going to happen in the theatre of the mind and then only as long as we can suspend our disbelief.

       I think everyone knows that things are bad and are probably going to get worse. I think everyone is hoping for a miracle to turn things around (e.g.  president Ron Paul) while at the same time understanding it probably aint gonna happen.

       [Enter Benjamin Fulford et al] They connect the dots in a new way and voila your worst fears are dispelled. As entertainment this is great but as practical information it does not measure up to Zeitgeist or Thrive.

       I am not convinced that the Bilderbergers have everything under control but they are still at the helm. I
       <em>
        am
       </em>
       convinced they would rather go down with the ship than surrender control. Someone is going to have to get their hands dirty before tptb step aside.

       Indeed. I personally have reached a point where I'm done learning about how fucked and controlled we are. That's the majority of what's posted here; "Look at what
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       are trying to do now!" and "Look at how fucked we are!". I've been unplugged from the matrix, so to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm now interested in how we fix all this. The folks who talk about mass arrests of the cabal, and even some of the extra-terrestrials/angel theories, help to really flesh out how everything in life fits together, and how we might be able to move forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alas, I have personally seen no proof that the arrests will happen (other than the mass resignations occurring), that ETs exist, or that there will be an "ascension", but it logically makes a lot of sense in how everything fits together. Again, time will tell.

       does not have a lot of support because IMO there aren't enough people who understand how desperate things are. The problems of others (in Europe and in the US) don't resonate unless you know someone who is effected. The Israeli threat to Iran is just another front in the endless war.
      </p>
      <p>
       The deus ex machina is older than its name. Arresting implies a legal process. Who will do the arresting? It is more likely that there would be mass resignations and non-compliance but I think that would be a contagion rather than a planned event. I don't think that will reach critical mass.

       Absolutely. I'm not really complaining, I'm just past that stage of awakening. I also agree with you on the current state of fixing things.

       I read that "5 Stages of my personal awakening" about a month ago. It's a good thing to share with people who are starting to question things.
