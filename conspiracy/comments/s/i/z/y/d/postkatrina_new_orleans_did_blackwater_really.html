        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve recently spoken with a few southerners that were fairly adamant about this being a fact: that Blackwater/Xe murdered upwards of 3k drug dealers and gangbangers in New Orleans directly after the hurricane. </p>

<p>A close family member participated in the &#39;clean-up&#39; and his job (he was in the National Guard) was to fasten floating corpses to road signs for removal. I heard straight from him that many of them appeared to have died from single gunshot wounds to the head. This somewhat corroborates the entire conspiracy theory in my mind.</p>

<p>A few searches of this subreddit didn&#39;t turn up that much on this subject. Google searches brought up loads of shit. What do the masses say? Did this happen? Is it feasible something like this could have been covered up so effectively?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a story for you. Can I prove it - no...</p>

<p>I am in Search and Rescue in Canada and was talking to one of the first teams who got down there. Yes, we actually got there before a lot of Americans...</p>

<p>The Team Leader was given a business card from a Member of Parliament and told if things got really, really bad and they needed a rescue - to call this number. He of course asked what would happen. The MP said that Canada already had a detachment of JTF (Joint Task Force) on site down there.</p>

<p>Now the thing is this, the JTF are our elite anti-terrorist, and anti-sniper people. What exactly were they doing down there?</p>

<p>Then I remembered that there were a lot of snipers one day and then none the next...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have heard this before numerous times now, and looked into it myself a pretty decent amount. To me it seems obvious something fishy is up, something strange for sure happened. There are just too many reports of shootings to think nothing of it. </p>

<p>Even if it was just the authorities shooting people repeatedly told not to cross somewhere, why the fuck not? And MURDER over it? Plus it is my understanding that the government cannot legally force your to leave your own home. I can find no such law or instance of it happening. To facilitate voluntary compliance with mandatory evacuation orders first responders and disaster management officials use creative techniques such as asking people for the names and contact of their next of kin, writing their Social Security Numbers on their limbs and torso so that their remains can be identified, or refusing to provide government services in the affected area, including emergency services. Something is up if people were being shot in the head. </p>

<p>I have also heard too that authorities were in New Orleans before Katrina, just like they were expecting it. This caused me to suspect HAARP, and <a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread166343/pg1">sure enough it was extraordinarily active right before the disaster</a></p>

<p>These numbers are probably too high, but something fishy sure seems to have happened. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is such a stupid comparison I shouldn&#39;t even bother replying to it.  You&#39;re comparing a heavily populated area such as NO to a concentration camp in the middle of Nazi occupied Germany.  Not only that but how many people had camera phones in Nazi Germany?  Also, the death toll for hurricane Catrina was about 1800, if that number was almost tripled don&#39;t you think it would be pretty obvious, what about all the family members of the people killed?</p>
