<p>Ayematey says </p>

<p>I&#39;ve removed this piece.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pure opinion, and your headline didn&#39;t help.</p>

<p>Maybe consider posting it to [1] <a href="/r/opinion">/r/opinion</a>, [2] <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, [3] <a href="/r/moderatepolitics">/r/moderatepolitics</a>, or maybe there&#39;s a healthcare-specific reddit somewhere.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t belong here.</p>

<p>no it&#39;s an accurate portrayal of what really has happened since Virgin took over the healthcare of the district.</p>

<p>It&#39;s YOUR opinion that it&#39;s an opinion.</p>

<p>And you removing it is a violation of reddit.</p>

<p>4 upvotes and 2 down votes in 2 hours means YOU are the one out of line. Not the story.</p>

<p>Your job as moderator is to remove SPAM not stories you disagree with.</p>

<p>So sorry but I&#39;ll have to report you for violating moderator guidelines.</p>

<p>What the hell is the matter with moderators? This is reddit. the READERS choose the success of stories. They aren&#39;t edited out of their sight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>in response to the responses I will just say that the differing opinions are EXACTLY WHY REDDIT IS BETTER WITHOUT MODERATORS.</p>

<p>It also shows that while we were told moderators were being brought in to control (non existent) spam in fact they are brought in to control CONTENT and that is what they are doing</p>

<p>If a few humans are deciding what is going to be allowed then their will be censoring from the hive and the hive won&#39;t bring to light important things that a few people may not think the rest of the world cares about.</p>

<p>the genius and uniqueness of reddit adnd the former Digg etc USED to be that the greater crowd brought things to the attention of others that moderators might assume wrongly the crowd would not want to hear about.</p>

<p>even honest main stream media that doesn&#39;t have an owner&#39;s agenda (rare) would simply guess wrong about what should be &quot;on the front page&quot; because no person or small group of people can really know what a crowd is really finding interesting over a period of time.</p>

<p>Reddit was better without moderators. The fact that people are even debating proper roles of moderators shows exactly why moderation can never work as well as a containing story voting system like reddit used to be.</p>

<p>why do we need a few people to tell us what they think the crowd will like on the news list when the technology is built in for the crowd to continually VOTE on what they want.</p>

<p>OF course all that is the naive argument that  media - even reddit owner&#39;s - intentions are honestly to deliver what the readers want.
In fact of course people buy media to CONTROL what readers see and reddit was bought a few years ago and despite the veil of pretending it is &quot;separate&quot; the owners have an agenda and have been subdividing the formerly million strong reddit readership and controlling what they see and hear ever sine.</p>

<p>Reddit is no longer Reddit and everyone knows it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A straight news story reports on the facts but does not inject personal opinion. A column may report on facts but sometimes contains subjective judgments. Although the things voiced by the columnist here are judgments, they certainly seem valid. Nonetheless this places the linked item away from straight news.</p>

<p>I side with both sides, OP is justified in bringing this link to public attention, yet it does differ from a straight news story. If the mod is seeking to keep only pure news stories in r/news, he&#39;s being honest. Cited columns probably lie more under opinion than under straight news. For example, if I had an interesting observation about the sun, it might belong in some r/science_opinion rather than r/science (news).</p>

<p>Both of you appear to be working for the common good so I hope this can be resolved.</p>
