       First what do some of you think is going to happen and how?  I've only been aware for the past 8 or 9 months of what's really going on (Illuminati control) , I've heard dozens of scenarios: US dollar collapse, World dollar emergence, cull of the population, false alien attack, etc.  After Fukushima the 3rd seems very plausible, some think we'll start to see health problems emerge as early as this summer!   Because of this for the most part I've started to feel very apathetic, what the heck is the point to fighting if we're all going to die anyway?  75-90% of the population is still blissfully unaware of all this and most don't think it'll go as far as has been predicted, conspiracy theorists and insiders like John Todd have been at it for decades to try to wake them up ever since Kennedy was assassinated it's just not gonna happen imho the system just won't change they've planned this too well. I've come to the conclusion that I might as well just try to live out the rest of my days as a regular person, do what I can to keep a roof over my head in the meantime and just accept the consequences.  Finally what I really want to ask is what inspires some of you to think otherwise?

       Realize that the elite power structure is far more complex than many here realize. While some of the establishment elite have certain plans to carry out conspiracy, for something really big to go down would require full cooperation of the establishment. This is not easily achieved as there is much infighting among the elites over power. Also there are enough white hats in high positions that would likely turn against the establishment should anything too big go down. While there are many evil people in high power, realize that at least in their sick mind what they think they are doing is for the good of humanity. It doesn't profit them to destroy humanity... what they think they want to do is to control, shape, and guide humanity into what they think is best. They were barely able to stage 9-11, and that was 10 years ago. Today technology has advanced much since then (smart phones, awakening of many people via internet freedom) that makes any bad scheme on their part a bit more difficult to pull off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I rest in faith that someday all will be brought to light and that our mortal life is only a stage in our eternal progression. Do good with what time you have here on this earth and help others. Be aware of the evil and dangers in the world, but also be aware of the much good that does exist.

       All good points.  I must admit I was always skeptical since 9/11 mostly Bush's missteps at press conferences was what gave it away, I'm still surprised so many were duped by it.  Also who can forget the "smoking gun" Building 7.

As for what keeps me sane knowing Im a slave in a mediocre looking cage, just like you, say fuck it and do me. Make a pay check, feed/take care of myself and just wait for the fireworks. Be safe, don't make any radical decisions yet.

       Cannabis is a naturally occurring herb.

       You have done drugs you just don't think of them that way. Caffeine, alcohol, advil and such are all drugs.

       Did you know that a drop of pure caffeine is more addictive than a drop of pure heroin? The vast majority of people in first world countries require a powerful psychostimulant  just to get themselves to work in the morning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention more people overdosed on Advil last year than people who have overdosed on Cannabis in all of recorded history.

       As to your original question - "they" will not succeed. The economy will collapse and sweep away the existing power structure all over the globe. Of the options you listed a dollar collapse is the most likely.

       Hang in there buddy, it's gonna be one helluva ride.  Just like a climatic roller coaster thrill ride, nothing is going to happen immediately.  But we are reaching those last few anxious clicks to the top of the hill.  With all things considered, this is what I see happening:
      </p>
      <p>
       It's going to take quite a push to throw the US dollar into an abyss like spiral, another event on our soil will have to happen.  "They" want that to occur, and we'll see another massive false flag.  Civil unrest is not exactly high right now, but the water is heating up quickly.  In the interest of public safety, this false flag will give us a flash boiling point, because critical mass will see it for what it truly is, and martial law will be in effect.  This too is according to plan.  The culling of the world population will be brought about in the form of a third world war, and governments will have their roles to destroy each other.  I can imagine the spark to ignite this war will be a preemptive strike that will reduce a small section of the Earth into a glass parking lot.  US citizens will be against another unjust war, and may revolt, giving a reason to detain and imprison resistance in the states (of course you'll see this activity elsewhere in the industrial world).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, with my interpretation of the doom and gloom behind us, these are my suggestions to keep your head above water and not feel overwhelmed.  Go outside, meet people, take a motorcycle ride, and breath a little.  Volunteer at a local community event, find a reason to shake the hand of your neighbor, go visit your Grandma.  Start talking to folks, encourage them to have a "family disaster plan", bring up a few things for them to think about, bring some attention to NDAA, and changes you see taking place.  Be as positive as possible, but prepare yourself.  Put together a "Bug out Bag", and have open communication with the ones you love.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're going to see some changes, but what the ruling elite do not seem to grasp (and never will), the human spirit is a powerful force, and cannot be controlled for long.  Ol' TJ had it right when he said  "The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants."

       By "think otherwise" I mean what keeps your head above water, what makes you think we can still survive this.  As to a nomadic lifestyle that would be easier were I single or if my wife was also as aware as me of all this.  She is like most in the Occupy movement sadly, knows that the rich control the government but doesn't believe any of the above scenarios.

       To be completely real a lot may not survive. Most likely a side will have to be chosen. With us or against us situation. And the choice will be easy for all. Conform and obey or die.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to survive with your wife prepare for her. Eventually she will see things as you do and you'll be good to go.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as preparing I'd check out Alex Jones and the interwebs for survival gear and the likes.

       While the sentiment is appreciated there's 3 reasons why prepping just seems pointless to me.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Fukushima contamination, there are things you can do to mitigate the effects but it's still gonna catch you in the long run.
       </li>
       <li>
        My financial situation isn't the best, I've made some bad decisions like most of "the herd."
       </li>
       <li>
        My geographic location (BC, Canada) as ichicax4 (aka radchick) on youtube has said "the west coast is toast."
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Most people I've tried to talk to about it don't believe it's as bad as the independent studies have shown.  I've seen physical evidence that says otherwise though, mostly changes in wildlife.  Hair loss on local deer, a decreased number of birds, also large and strangely shaped produce at the local supermarkets.  Most people don't believe me when I talk about this even members of my family.  They think "the health authorities would be all over it if it were true, and if it really is that bad then there's no helping it, why worry?  All you're gonna do is stress yourself out and possibly give yourself a heart attack."
This is why I've made the decision I have, just living my life as best I can for however long I've got and hope for the best are the only options I really have.  Sorry if this news is disappointing but that's just how I feel.

       Well I was actually trying to keep some hope alive but your eyes are completely open.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel the same way. Game over. Fukushima and BP Oil Spill were straws on a camels back. I'm doing the same as you and just enjoying the last of my days here....wasn't really enjoying the place much at all anyways. This world is a bad place and I won't be incredibly sad if every human perishes from this Earth. We seem to deserve extinction. If Earth is our mother, the human population is raping her. People that rape their mother deserve to die.

       Yeah you never know Ron Paul could still make it in, even though they're already stating that Mitt will be the nominee.  Really wishing that we Canadians had an election this year as well.
