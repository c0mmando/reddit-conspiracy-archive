    <div class="md"><p>I think this is entirely based around how we choose to communicate what we have learned with our family.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be the first to admit that if I sit down and start spouting everything I&#39;ve learned to family in general, they behave like I&#39;ve become unhinged.</p>

<p>Instead, I recommend communicating just a few points to family members (preferably based from news sources they already use and trust). After they look at what you&#39;ve shown them, ask them what they think about it (if they don&#39;t ask you first, which has been my experience).</p>

<p>DON&#39;T expect to completely open their eyes in one sitting. You are fighting decades of forced learning and &quot;status quo&quot;. You need to take baby steps and start them questioning for themselves.</p>

<p>Over about the last three years I&#39;ve progressed from condescending chuckles from some of my family members to open discussions on food storage and purchasing firearms.</p>

<p>Until you are absolutely sure you are on the same page with your family, I would, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, go into length about your preps or just how far down the rabbit hole you believe the world has gone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plant a few seeds then leave them alone. If you try and force your views on other people, especially ones that are controversial it&#39;s difficult to change their minds. News in r/politics is merging with r/conspiracy at a fast rate so it&#39;s becoming easier for people to take away that thin veil of deceit and see for themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the approach I&#39;ve taken with some friends. One of which believed the official version of 9/11 until very recently. A couple years ago I told him my opinion on 9/11 and how I thought it to be an inside job. I&#39;ve shared links and opinions with him over the years, and finally, just a couple weeks ago he told me, &quot;I believe 9/11 was an inside job now&quot;. I was so glad to hear it, as it just reaffirmed my faith in my friend.</p>

<p>It occurred to me at that time, that people just have to take things in at their own pace. It&#39;s not an easy thing to swallow, and to try and force feed such things to people is fruitless. As long as we can keep the internet open and free, the awakenings will continue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey. Just a quick word of advice.  It&#39;s good for you to be informed and all, but having more knowledge/intuition on certain matters will not make you a better person. It will also not give you a happier life. What I mean is,  people that want to get educated on those matters usually do. Those that don&#39;t will get uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Use that information you gathered not to  help others understand because most of them won&#39;t, but to help plan <strong>yourself</strong> a <em>better future</em>.</p>

<p>I am myself a long-time conspiracy-digger, and believe me when I was younger this knowledge <strong><em>truly</em></strong> poisoned my life.  I mean all these conspiracies tend to make us sort of &lt;paranoidal&gt; in nature.   In a sense, this is worse than being a sheep. It like being a nervous sheep that knows it&#39;s headed for the slaughterhouse. It has an impact on how we <em>enjoy life</em>.</p>

<p>Conspiracies have been with us for a long time, every culture, every empire has had it&#39;s share. And they will stay, always. There will always be some &quot;threat&quot; to our well being.  But your life, bro, is very limited in time. Being concerned is ok, but letting this concern seep too much in your life can be non-productive, a source of <em>anxiety</em> of some sort.  I suggest you make extra sure this knowledge does not hamper your satisfaction of life, and that you keep what you learn to yourself when around people not initiated to these conspiracies. <strong><em>Especially</em></strong> the <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2912878405399014351">David Icke</a> stuff!</p>

<p>My 2 cents, cheers friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just be patient.  A big part of it is the fact that you&#39;re family.  I&#39;ve mentioned things to my mom, for example, and she looks at me like I have lobsters crawling out of my ears.  But then she&#39;ll see it on tv, or hear it from a friend and then she&#39;ll say to me &quot;littlegoddess, you&#39;ll never guess what I found out today, you&#39;d probably find this interesting...&quot;</p>

<p>Another way to help them wake up is to question them. Not to argue, but to help them shift their perspective. For example, I&#39;ll hear my family start discussing suicide bombers in Palestine or something, and I&#39;ll say &quot;why do you think they&#39;re strapping bombs to themselves and doing that?  I mean, what is going on in their lives that they feel they need to blow themselves up and kill a bunch of people?&quot;<br/>
What ever they answer, I&#39;d say, &quot;Do you believe that?  Is that what you would do?&quot; or &quot;What would have to happen to you that would make you feel that that was the only answer&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m rambling, but I hope you get my point.  Just be patient and plant the seed of compassion.  Also, let them have the last word in heated discussions.  It&#39;s amazing how powerful that is...</p>

We don&#39;t see each other often, so when i do I suppose I am a little excited to talk about all I have learned since I saw him...and yesterday he told me he didn&#39;t give a shit about any of that line of dialog, and doesn&#39;t want to participate.  He said he would rather talk about video games.  I simply accepted, and said I was merely trying to discuss some of the things I have been interested in, but that we don&#39;t have to talk about that. Hows your burrito?</p>

<p>He later apologized!  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your awakening is incomplete. Study more and focus more on having a great relationship with said family members. Remember that in the end, the reason you want to share this knowledge with them is to help prepare them psychologically for when things break down. You are prepared already from the sound of things, so just take that knowledge and put it away until you need it. When everyone else is losing their minds you will be at peace mentally. You may even be a hero. But always remember the why, rather than the what. You tell your family because you love them. Focus more on loving them and you will see them begin to accept your point of view the more they accept you. I hope this helps. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t expect other family members to understand overnight what has taken you years to understand. My own conviction is that a true grasp of reality is impossible for anyone who continues to watch television on a daily basis. Television viewers may be capable of grasping the edges of the reality, but its wholeness is too much for them. It&#39;s so contrary to everything they have been taught, and are being taught. If you want to win over a convert, first wean that person away from the glass teat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never forget the definition of &#39;conspiracy&#39;, which is basically that 2 or more people are involved in doing something which is against the law.  An awful lot of human activity is a conspiracy, especially now in an era when there are more laws than a person could possibly even be aware of.  An awful lot of human activity which was formerly not unlawful has come to be against one or even several laws.  Conspiracy itself, somehow, is against the law.</p>

<p>On the other hand you have 2 or more people involved in doing something which is perhaps not against the law, but involves advancing an agenda which they desire to keep hidden because for it to be known would undermine or subvert the agenda.  I don&#39;t know what the word is for this but this is what we often are talking about and it&#39;s not really against the law so it&#39;s not a conspiracy, but of course it could also be against the law.  </p>
