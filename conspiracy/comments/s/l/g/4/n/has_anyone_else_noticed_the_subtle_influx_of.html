There&#39;s little intent to fairly debate, only to play hardball and crush other opinions. However, there is on the other side the Obamabot contingent which is less verbally scornful and vulgar but pulls the same game too often, too. A pox on both their houses.</p>

Bush never could&#39;ve passed a bill to allow tens of thousands of drones over U.S. skies, but Obama has.  Bush or any white U.S. president never could&#39;ve established AFRICOM in Africa, but Obama has.</p>

<p>Obama never could&#39;ve killed U.S. citizens on 9/11 with a whitewash investigation, passed the Enabling Act (Patriot Act), whitewashed the Anthrax Attacks &amp; domestic terror, illegally invaded another country on pretenses of WMD, spent $2 Trillion on tax cuts for the wealthy, spent $2 Trillion-plus on wars, &quot;lost&quot; $2.3 Trillion at the Pentagon, expanded the Federal bureaucracy, destroyed the U.S. economy, opened Guantanamo, started torture programs, outed a CIA agent to destroy her WMD detection program, or subverted democracy at home and abroad with the full support of the Republican Party.</p>

<p>They work together:  What Bush cannot achieve, the Bush Family&#39;s Obama sleeper cell is working to accomplish.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to compare which is &quot;worse&quot; -- cancer or coronary disease.  In the end, America will be a military theocracy in less than 5 years.</p>

<p>as far as i know, warrantless wiretapping (with immunity for telecoms), a new NSA data center in utah, and new drone rules are all facts, not theories.</p>

<p>if all the government needs to do is allege terrorism to get location and activity data on a person, how is that not a surveillance state? </p>
