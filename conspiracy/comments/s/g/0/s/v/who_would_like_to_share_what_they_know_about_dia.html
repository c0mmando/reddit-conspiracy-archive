Instead of taking it down because it gives nightmares to all who gaze upon it, they say there&#39;s an ordinance or law that requires it stay up for a certain number of years. </p>

<p>Jesse Ventura&#39;s Conspiracy Theory program has a nice show on it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a little skeptical of Jesse Ventura&#39;s motives behind that show... However, I have seen it and it certainly peaked my interest. </p>

<p>I think what intrigues me the most is the actual construction of the airport itself. There were so many independent contractors that were chosen to work on specific projects. I am not in the construction business, nor do I claim to know much about it but I did not think that was a standard procedure to have so many. </p>

While I don&#39;t know much about DIA in terms of conspiracy, I have seen the murals and read how their connected to occult ideology.  I can say if anything ever happened to Washington DC, Denver would likely become the next nation&#39;s capitol.  And fuck that horse.  The claims about underground secret bases at DIA seem a bit outlandish.  It seems just as well that they at Buckley AFB a few miles down the street.  I should know, I was stationed there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You realize the military has a top secret version of the internet right?  The whole VIP theory is incredibly illogical.  Have you ever been in a top secret facility?  I have, I worked in a few.  DIA has relatively no security compared to T/S areas.  DIA doesn&#39;t even a have a fucking fence.  If a person really wanted to find out what&#39;s there, who would stop them from fucking walking in?  I just spoke with a buddy of mine who also holds a TS, and is working with me.  He says his dad laid most of the concrete at DIA, and there is no fucking underground base.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not the idea behind compartmentalization.  In know way did I believe I knew everything.  I don&#39;t know what bullshit you&#39;ve been reading, but there are no US classifications above TS.  There are only modifiers you can add which organize documents, and essentially act as a need to know specific to said program, we refer to this as being &#39;read in&#39; to a program.  All people that get a TS are civilians at some point.  I got mine as a civilian while waiting to join AF intelligence.  I&#39;m just guessing here, but it sounds like you&#39;ve never held a clearance much less been through the extensive investigative process.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is my take on the whole DIA issue.  Does it have creepy occult murals? Yes, did they waste a bunch of money building a second underground complex and then never using it? Maybe, that shit happens all the time.  </p>

<p>I do know this for sure,  I have a friend who is related to the crown,  we went to school in NY together and two years ago he picks up and moves to Denver, apparently his gf got a job there so they moved.  Knowing that his family is illuminati rich I didn&#39;t think too much of it, but I found out exactly where he lives, which is really close to that airport.  He also keeps urging me to move to denver citing lax marijuana laws and good beer.   While all of that is valid,  I just can&#39;t shake the fact that he and his parents left their 4 million dollar home in ct to live in Colorado.  It&#39;s a little strange to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that&#39;s the whole idea behind compartmentalization, make everyone believe they know everything.  That way people will react violently to new information just as you did, unknowingly protecting the truth. Top secret has been around forever and even a civy can get it.  If you believe that is top clearance all the best.</p>
