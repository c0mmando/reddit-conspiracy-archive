    <div class="md"><p>We have to be careful with the term <em>holocaust denier</em>.</p>

<p>The subject is so sensitive that most historians don&#39;t want to touch the issue. But the common consensus that 6 million Jews were gassed in WWII German concentration camps is simply not true. No one denies that Jews were singled out, discriminated against by the Nazis, put on board trains and shipped to concentration camps. This is fact.</p>

<p>But there is nuance here.</p>

<p>First off, the six million figure is grossly exaggerated. All you have to do is go to Auschwitz and read the memorial plague there. The six million figure was revised down to 3 million in the 60s and further on down to 1.4 million. The memorial at Auschwitz clearly states that today. Also, there is the debate that these 1.4 million died of starvation in the camps when Germany started losing the war and there was no provision to feed all these interned people (all war supplies naturally being diverted to the army). The point here is that it was never the policy of Nazi Germany to <em>exterminate</em> the Jews, just relocate them to prison. Yes, this was horrific and wrong but this opens us up to a bigger point.</p>

<p>Truth.</p>

<p>It matters. One of the major reasons it matters is because if 1.4 million died and not 6 million, it there was no policy of extermination, then a major lie has been told. This lie enabled the Zionists to invade Palastine. The war for Palastine continues today and is a major world conflict zone. If the state of Israel is founded on untruth, that matters.</p>

<p>Sure, you can argue that the numbers do not matter, whether 1.4 or 6 million died, but many <em>&quot;holocaust deniers&quot;</em> think that they do. It is the numbers and their continual revisement downward that leads one to believe that the numbers have been used as a propaganda tool as part of an agenda... the persecution of Jews was used as cover for an invasion. The ongoing policy of the Israeli government borders the same policies used by the Nazis (ghettos, sequestering, curbs on movement for non Jews) and many of these actions are justified by Jewish WWII history.</p>

<p>If even some of this history is not true, then the world is not what the general consensus claims it to be, and that is dangerous and troubling. If we live in a world where the truth does not matter, then nothing is true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Auschwitz wasn&#39;t just a concentration camp, it was a giant nuclear enrichment facility.</p>

<p>IG Farben supposedly had a &quot;buna&quot; (rubber) making plant at Auschwitz run on slave labor, but after the war it came out that not a <em>single</em> ounce of buna was produced.</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t collect tons of Jews and other undesirables to simply exterminate, they collected them as cheap (well, free) slave labor for their massive secret projects such as the nuclear enrichment facility at Auschwitz. Part of the reason there were so many deaths at Auschwitz was to keep this project under wraps.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t have anything to do with the Holocaust happening or not, it&#39;s just an important piece to the puzzle that many people aren&#39;t informed about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hehe, well from what I understand that wasn&#39;t the <em>only</em> thing going on at Auschwitz, just the most important and the most hush hush. The Nazis were up to their ears in research into exotic areas of physics/technology, concentration camp inmates were plentiful and expendable. </p>

<p>I think that many individuals were murdered less from the motive of &quot;KILL DEH JEWS&quot; and more with the convenience of having cheap labor, and more importantly, human guinea pigs.</p>

<p>For example, Hans Kammler, whose name was all but forgotten after the war (disappearing along with the man himself), had a think tank called the &quot;Kammlerstab&quot; where he regularly used inmates to sacrifice in his grisly experiments. Kammler was the individual who personally redesigned the concentration camps for more brutal efficiency. </p>

<p>Kammler didn&#39;t view the camps as a quick way to exterminate Jews in some &quot;Final Solution&quot;, rather he viewed them as an inexhaustible labor pool and perfect for finding guinea pigs (much like the infamous Mengele who also survived decades after the war...come to think of it, most of the worst of the worst Nazis survived and thrived after the war in Operation Paperclip and independently, who actually won again?)</p>

<p>In one of the most notorious of his experiments, the (apocryphal) Nazi Bell (Die Glocke), Kammler would use concentration camp inmates to scrub down the room with brine that housed the Bell after the highly unstable experiments. One can only assume that he cycled through countless people before killing them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um, I didn&#39;t deny the Holocaust, why don&#39;t you calm down a bit?</p>

<p>I just said that the people at Auschwitz weren&#39;t there to simply be murdered, they were there to perform an extremely important function (in this case to enrich Uranium) and that when the Allies came at the end of the war, they (or someone) did their utmost to cover up the fact that the Germans were engaged in this type of research (and had progressed that far!) by saying that Auschwitz was merely a death camp and <em>not</em> a secret enrichment facility. </p>

<p>Yet another crucial missing piece from the &quot;Allied Legend&quot; that was presented to us after the war.</p>

<p>But yeah I didn&#39;t say anything about the Holocaust not happening, why don&#39;t you take a breather.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>:)</p>

<p>But seriously if indeed it&#39;s true that Auschwitz performed that function (a great deal of evidence is in favor of that hypothesis), why on earth didn&#39;t they just tell us about it?</p>

<p>I mean, it would be fairly simple to say &quot;well it looks like Auschwitz had such high extermination rates because the Nazis were conducting a massive secret Uranium enrichment program that they were disguising as a rubber plant and trying to keep quiet.&quot;</p>

<p>Instead, that whole episode seems to have been covered up...makes you wonder what else the Allies hid from the world about just what the Nazis were working on.</p>

<p>No they don&#39;t. But when they do it&#39;s probably because you&#39;re deflecting blame from those entities by pulling the persecution card like my middle school comrade. You&#39;re the one bringing up 30 benign posts that happen to mention jews out of a hundred thousand submissions. </p>

<p>I fucking love this.  I&#39;m not trying to censor you, I&#39;m <strong>criticizing you</strong>.  Free speech is a two way street; if you&#39;re allowed to say whatever you want about Jews, I&#39;m allowed to say whatever I want about your beliefs regarding Jews.  When I call your beliefs stupid, and point out the lack of good evidence supporting them, that isn&#39;t me censoring you, that&#39;s me <strong>exercising my right of free speech to criticize you</strong>, and your implication otherwise is so intellectually dishonest I can&#39;t believe it.  I mean, really, how did you make this distinction?  It&#39;s free speech to tell people Jews are trying to enslave them, but it&#39;s &quot;censorship&quot; to disagree?  If anyone&#39;s the thought police here, it&#39;s the fucking people I&#39;m disagreeing with.  I virtually never call for bans or censorship, and yet somehow, I&#39;m always accused of being such.  </p>

<p>Get off your high horse.  You dislike Jews, so you refuse to accept the evidence supporting the Holocaust, and accept evidence to the contrary.  It&#39;s called confirmation bias, and it&#39;s not a crime; that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m going to run away and stop criticizing you because you called me a &quot;censor&quot;.</p>

<p>I swear, it&#39;s the same thing on r/ronpaul; you ridicule someone&#39;s beliefs, or try to criticize anything Ron Paul says, and you&#39;re a fucking censor/police statist/Fascist.  Free speech isn&#39;t &quot;I can say whatever I want and no one can call it dumb!&quot;, it&#39;s &quot;I can say whatever I want, and so can everyone else!&quot;</p>

<p>You want me to believe your persecution complex?  Maybe you should <strong>stop persecuting Jews.</strong></p>

<p>This is not what he&#39;s doing you mental midget. He&#39;s criticizing the absurd conclusion that you came to in &quot;thinking for yourself.&quot; Independent thought is great, but the results aren&#39;t necessarily. If, through independent thought I concluded that humans don&#39;t need water to live, I&#39;d be wrong. The same holds with your Holocaust denial bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never mind. Wrong subreddit. It&#39;s a branch of economics that presumes to need no numbers or facts for its legitimacy because it has all been derived from irrefutable axioms and first principles. Cartesian economics.

<p>Just because they were called &#39;Death Camps&#39; doesn&#39;t mean people didn&#39;t spend time there <em>alive.</em>  The goal was mass extermination, but it takes time to kill a truckload of people, and unload the bodies.  The Nazis were human - awful, but still only human.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really hate that you&#39;re using deflections. It just looks like you don&#39;t want to admit that there were death camps. </p>

<p>My grandmother&#39;s experience wasn&#39;t unique either. Let&#39;s compare her experience to WWII Canada. My government put the Japanese Canadians in concentration camps. It was terrible and I must admit I don&#39;t know a lot about it. But the families got to see each other. There wasn&#39;t a mysterious disappearance of everyone who wasn&#39;t useful. This was a regular occurrence in Auschwitz and, as I understand, many other camps. Tens of thousands of witnesses alive today can testify. I believe that hundreds of thousands of people lost their lives there, close to 800,000.  </p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s important to realize that in my grandparents home country of Poland, 90% of the Jewish population died. That cannot be denied. It just doesn&#39;t fit into your narrative that Jews were ever the victim. The only time you use the words Jews and victim in the same sentence is sarcastically. You are just so ignorant as to the scope of this it is mind-boggling. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how long they were in the camps for. My grandmother does not talk about her experience and she and her sister (who recently died but was in a coma from Alzheimers for ~20 years) were the ones in Auschwitz. She does talk about her parents, aunts and uncles and brothers and sisters who didn&#39;t survive the Nazi Holocaust.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow.  This is the most heartless - and useless - question ever.  They were &#39;camps&#39; because people went there, lived there, and then got exterminated.  If no one spent time there alive - thus allowing for some survivors - it wouldn&#39;t be called an extermination &#39;camp&#39;.  </p>

<p>These camps <em>were</em> liberated, some by Russians, some by Americans...there are soldiers who&#39;ve seen them, and prisoners who survived...and to imply that none exist is not only stupid, but offensive.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I should know as I include myself in that group. But what exactly does that have to do with anything? I was specifically referring to the antisemitic (or anti-Jewish if you prefer that term) content that often makes it to the front page of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and in the comments section. Stuff about Holocaust denial, &quot;Jewish gold&quot; and &quot;Jewish supremacy&quot;. None of which has to do with Zionism.</p>

<p>It&#39;s time that the haters of Jews and those people and ideals who they use to hide behind come out and admit that just because demonization of Israel is conflated with antisemitism does not mean that antisemitism doesn&#39;t exist in its own right.</p>

<p>Disagreeing with Israel, and Zionism does not equate to antisemitism. </p>

<p>Antisemitism still exists, but that doesn&#39;t mean <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is a hub for hate speech. If anything, this subreddit is more critical of the policies of the US and foreign governments. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want a few bad apples, who are not representative of all 53,375 subscribers to be allowed to taint the waters of a subreddit for all topics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that the issue is the few kooks, I think the issue is the silent compliance that most of the subreddit has for those kooks. They are constantly making it to the front page with their hateful diatribes. Furthermore, users of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> adamantly refuse to acknowledge it. </p>

<p>Now don&#39;t get me wrong, I don&#39;t think that the existence of these posts and their popularity is an issue, it just delegitimizes <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> which I have no problem with. The problem, as I see it, is the people who refuse to acknowledge that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has basically become the haven for Neo-Nazis, racists and antisemites where even if their more extreme beliefs won&#39;t be accepted, at least they could push some of their more &quot;moderate&quot; beliefs and have everyone gobble it up hook, line and sinker. </p>

You should have sympathy for your brethren duped by a media source.

<p>This is the part of the comment where, rather than addressing actual facts, you take the time to set up a narrative in which you don&#39;t have to prove anything, because I&#39;m just a sheeple, and proving things to me is pointless.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t know any of this, and know next to nothing about me...but here you are, laying out this narrative in the spur of the moment about me, that I&#39;m sitting here, some hyper-patriot demanding the blood of some vague, brown foreigners.</p>

<p>Now, listen closely: you believe this narrative with 0 proof.  Why should I expect that you required any more hard evidence before reaching your position regarding 9/11?  </p>

<p>research it yourself</p>

<p>I have.  That&#39;s what you don&#39;t get.  You people walk into every debate with the assumption that whoever your debating <em>must</em> know nothing about the subject, and so you can dismiss them as simply being unwilling to learn, or ignorant, before you even begin the discussion.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>what are facts? what officials tell you? what you experience? what Dick Cheney experienced? What Osama Bin Laden experienced? Was it what fox news presented or CNN? Janes military defense? the BBC?  </p>

<p>i have been arguing this for over a decade and it is always the same, but &quot;bush would never lie to us&quot; &quot;but some appointed head of NIST said so.&quot; 
(&quot;nu-uh- my mommy said so&quot;)
i will never convince you. 
For 3 days after 9-11 i thought just like you. Then I saw some things that made me rethink my previous paradigm.   unless one grows up and is immersed in the DC (military/politicians) environment and pays attention, you are not going to get it. you&#39;re going to take whatever is told to you at face value. if the roles were reversed i&#39;d be ignorant of some facts and probably believe the official version. but I know better, and so do many that live and worked in the DC region. most won&#39;t mention it because they don&#39;t want to lose their clearance or be ridiculed by the likes of you.</p>

<p>the ignorant mob is a powerful silencing force. If you ever want to know why the truth is always hidden, that&#39;s why. Of course you won&#39;t believe me, you have been so conditioned to trust your masters/experts. </p>

<p>the faa always had shootdown protocol down to the grunt. (google it)
andrews air force base was ready (hang out with the pilots and commanding officers)
the pentagon does have weapons to shoot down. (get to know your pentagon employees)</p>

<p>they were not given permission. if you think that the lower levels would shit without permission you are sorely mistaken. </p>

<p>you can choose to google and read alternative viewpoints (from the official version) and take it with a grain of salt, or outright dismiss them because they don&#39;t fit your worldview (which is what most do).  if you were interested in the truth, you wouldn&#39;t be reinforcing your paradigm. </p>

<p>the only thing I can do is invite you to challenge your viewpoints whether you believe in them or not. </p>

<p>of course my experience means nothing to you as much as your regurgitation means zilch to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So now, one day later, there&#39;s a different namejacker who is trolling someone who posts about HAARP. The namejacker is doing the exact same thing to try to discredit the poster, the exact same methods, and has even started a sub called /haarptard (how very interesting that a conservative crowd uses &#39;tard&#39; so much for demonizing any opponents).</p>

<p>I am hoping the HAARP name jacker is just a copycat killer, but if we begin to see more such jackings, it might be a wider assault. Keep on the lookout.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I think the point IamJulianAssange is making is that he doesn&#39;t sensationalize &quot;Jews as oppressors&quot; (i.e., he doesn&#39;t post <em>about</em> &quot;jews&quot;). And, I&#39;m pretty sure that interpretation stands... even in the face of your <em>strenuous, tiring, and exhaustive</em> reddit searches. </p>

<p>Seriously. I mean ... you, too, could do a little research before you try rallying a lynch mob with lies. None of the articles posted by IamJulianAssange have even one iota of disparaging commentary about &quot;Jews&quot; (whether by race, heritage, or religion).</p>

<p>And, since you&#39;ve chosen to be a lying weasel in a subreddit that I&#39;m kind of fond of, I can assure you I won&#39;t forget your username.... even when I (inevitably) change mine. Have a nice life, liar.</p>

<p>You&#39;re just plain wrong.  I get this <em>constantly.</em>  You&#39;d just rather bury your head in the sand and pretend you&#39;re not surrounded by racists.  But you are.  There are quite a few of them, and as a Jew, I&#39;m expected to defend Israel.</p>

<p>it&#39;s probably because you&#39;re deflecting blame from those entities</p>

<p>Wow, you&#39;re not even going to consider it, you&#39;re just going to <em>assume</em> that if this happens, it&#39;s my fault.  You know what happens when you assume, friend?  You make an ass out of you (me, not so much).  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t defend Israel, nor AIPAC...these people ask me to explain their actions <strong>for no other reason than because I am of Jewish blood, and therefore responsible for the actions of other Jews.</strong>  Why is this so hard to believe?  Have you even <em>read</em> the comments on here from people like texmex, Occidentalist and tttt0tttt?</p>
