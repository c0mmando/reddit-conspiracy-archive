       Heat, economy, lack of opportunity, debt, inequality, social unrest...  These are the makings of riots.
      </p>
      <p>
       Add in communities with unused "antiterrorism" equipment and gear that they're just dying to break out... along with new anti-riot technology that needs field testing...
      </p>
      <p>
       If the riots aren't occurring as quickly as the elite desire, they'll just use the media to exploit cases like Trayvon Martin.

       I sure hope not. People who would want to increase their control over society will use destructive disobedience as an excuse to hasten their efforts.

       Nice try..  Reverse Psychology always sounds good. but really Epic Violence is the  only way major change happens and if there are no one left to protest your actions you win.

       it's not going to be nice for philly, detroit, cleveland, atlanta, miami, vegas, la.

      <p>
       It's been a long time comming, and just a continuation of our struggle for rights and freedoms. The military isn't planning on being an intervening force between citizens and police either. People are so polarized these days and caught up in corporate culture, it's like a full on manic society ripping itself to shreds. Epic violence, when it turns to civil war, will not be a nice scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
       At what point do desperate men and women who see no future for their children break?
      </p>
      <p>
       There will always be somebody left to protest. Corrupt society's don't sit well with the human spirit.

       People don't understand how great they have it today. It use to take 2 people to haul one of those big console televisions in the 80's. Nowadays you could carry two or three of those LED flat panels by yourself.

       I assume the logic is this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Racist hick fucks like guns.
Racist hick fucks hate having a black president.
Racist hick fucks with guns are already chomping at the bit to get a revolution started, probably shouting stuff about Ruby Ridge the whole time.
Meanwhile, there are plenty of non-whites in the country with a "kill whitey" attitude.
If the powers that be want to drag the population into a divisive conflict, plastering the media with 1990's style Rodney King beatings and super scary NWA gangsters would be an effective way to fan the embers of racial tension to the point where it all bursts into flames.
      </p>
      <p>
       Granted, I don't see this going on where I live at all despite living in a very racially and culturally mixed city in the North East. It's hardly a racist-free enlightened paradise, but the Neo-Nazi militias and radical Black Power types really just don't exist in my world and seem like boogey-men that have been exaggerated by a sensationalist media looking for a dramatic story. Most of the low income neighborhoods and even some of the street gangs are mixed race.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, the white radicals, Rodney King race riots, and hyperactive anti-immigration laws always seem to go on a long ways away from here. I don't see people falling into that crap again. But I do have to consider that the more socially liberal, race mixing, pro-immigration attitudes of places like NYC really don't represent much of the country. It's also why I wouldn't want to live in Compton, or Backwater Wyoming.
