<p>Add in communities with unused &quot;antiterrorism&quot; equipment and gear that they&#39;re just dying to break out... along with new anti-riot technology that needs field testing...</p>

<p>If the riots aren&#39;t occurring as quickly as the elite desire, they&#39;ll just use the media to exploit cases like Trayvon Martin.

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s not going to be nice for philly, detroit, cleveland, atlanta, miami, vegas, la. </p>

<p>It&#39;s been a long time comming, and just a continuation of our struggle for rights and freedoms. The military isn&#39;t planning on being an intervening force between citizens and police either. People are so polarized these days and caught up in corporate culture, it&#39;s like a full on manic society ripping itself to shreds. Epic violence, when it turns to civil war, will not be a nice scenario.</p>

<p>At what point do desperate men and women who see no future for their children break? </p>

<p>There will always be somebody left to protest. Corrupt society&#39;s don&#39;t sit well with the human spirit. </p>

<p>We are but a rome, like a flower we wither and fade depending on our present actions and policies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I assume the logic is this:</p>

<p>Racist hick fucks like guns.
Racist hick fucks hate having a black president.
Racist hick fucks with guns are already chomping at the bit to get a revolution started, probably shouting stuff about Ruby Ridge the whole time.
Meanwhile, there are plenty of non-whites in the country with a &quot;kill whitey&quot; attitude.
If the powers that be want to drag the population into a divisive conflict, plastering the media with 1990&#39;s style Rodney King beatings and super scary NWA gangsters would be an effective way to fan the embers of racial tension to the point where it all bursts into flames.</p>

<p>Granted, I don&#39;t see this going on where I live at all despite living in a very racially and culturally mixed city in the North East. It&#39;s hardly a racist-free enlightened paradise, but the Neo-Nazi militias and radical Black Power types really just don&#39;t exist in my world and seem like boogey-men that have been exaggerated by a sensationalist media looking for a dramatic story. Most of the low income neighborhoods and even some of the street gangs are mixed race.</p>

<p>Then again, the white radicals, Rodney King race riots, and hyperactive anti-immigration laws always seem to go on a long ways away from here. I don&#39;t see people falling into that crap again. But I do have to consider that the more socially liberal, race mixing, pro-immigration attitudes of places like NYC really don&#39;t represent much of the country. It&#39;s also why I wouldn&#39;t want to live in Compton, or Backwater Wyoming.</p>
