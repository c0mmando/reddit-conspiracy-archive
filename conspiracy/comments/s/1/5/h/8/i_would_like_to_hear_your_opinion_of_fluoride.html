Believing fluoride is deliberately harming us fits the &quot;elite&quot; are eugenicists conspiracy, and to believe it definitely sends you much further down the rabbit hole than others are willing to go.  I do think fluoridation has evil intent, but due to extremely low funds for a while, I haven&#39;t been able to do much to avoid it other than trying to get bottled water that says it uses reverse osmosis techniques.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It helps to calcify your pineal gland, which every ancient religion conflated with &quot;the third eye&quot;, enlightenment, esp/sight of the divine, etc.  That&#39;s enough to make me want to avoid it, especially since I had a physical chemistry professor who was part of a study about the chemical action of fluoride on teeth.  The thesis was that if we could get the fluoride to stick to your teeth it would protect them, why? well because of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytetrafluoroethylene">this</a>.  </p>

<p>His team was completely unable to identify any chemical pathway/action that the fluoride in drinking water would react with your teeth and make teflon-like coating.  They found no evidence that fluoride would even react with your teeth at all.</p>

<p>Current &quot;reasoning&quot; is that it helps prevent bacterial clusters from forming, as referenced by a endodontist when asked by myself.  </p>

<p>So, if it doesn&#39;t actually react with your teeth, and it&#39;s only help can be gotten by brushing your teeth with nothing but water, why are we forced to drink it?</p>

<p>As some good food for thought, this is the mechanism of skeletal fluorosis:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>Fluorine enters the body by two paths: Ingestion or respiration. Both paths lead to corrosion of exposed tissue in high concentrations. Since the most likely form of Fluorine to enter the body is Hydrogen Fluoride gas, this is what starts the process. Exposed tissues will be utilized by HF in neutralization reactions.</p></li>
<li><p>This will leave F− free to pass further into the body.</p></li>
<li><p>It reacts with the concentrated HCl in the stomach to form the weak acid, HF.</p></li>
<li><p>This compound is then absorbed by the gastro-intestinal tract and passes into the liver via the portal vein. Since F is the strongest oxidizer known currently, it is immune to phase 1 metabolic reactions, which are generally oxidation reactions, in the liver. These reactions are the body’s first line of defense to biotransform harmful compounds into something more hydrophilic and more easily excreted.</p></li>
<li><p>The HF is now free to pass into the blood stream and be distributed to all tissues including bones.</p></li>
<li><p>Bones are largely composed of Ca compounds, particularly carbonated hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2); the reaction of Ca and HF forms an insoluble salt, CaF2.</p></li>
<li><p>This salt must be cleared by the body and as a result washes away some of the calcium that would be part of the bone matrix.</p></li>
<li><p>This process results in increased density, but decreased strength in bones.</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>While at very low levels, this happens every single time you drink a glass of water with floride in it.</p>

<p>So how do you avoid it?  Start with drinking water.  You can normally buy 5 gallon water jugs at your local organic food store.  These are used with high capacity reverse osmosis filter systems they should have in the store.  Get some BPA free water bottles and drink nothing but this when you want water.  If you buy anything but 100% juice, you can assume it was made with floridated water.  I still drink soda from time to time, but it&#39;s all about amounts and concentrations, so a little here or there isn&#39;t going to hurt you (too much ;).  Also, since you have this huge 5 gallon jug of water, use it for cooking to.  Boiling floridated water will do nothing but concentrate it and infuse it into whatever your are cooking.  Doing this will cut it from your drinking water and your cooking.  If you also stop drinking pop and such, this will reduce your floride intake by probably 80-90%.  You will also inhale/absorb floride from taking a shower, and there is nothing you can do about that unless you want to spend the money to install a reverse osmosis filter that will serve your house, or get well water (hows the fracking in your area?).  </p>

<p>Also know that those little tap/gallon &quot;brita&quot; filters do nothing about floride, and most other chemicals.  The only thing I know that would remove it is steam distillation or most reverse osmosis filter systems.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve found nothing reliable.  The pineal gland is mostly treated, for one reason or another, in academic/business circles as a vestigial organ with limited functionality in the role of sleep and dreaming.  Thus there is not a lot of peer reviewed articles about pineal gland functionality and how things like calcification interfere with it&#39;s operation.</p>

<p>However, some research put forward indicates that vitamin K has the ability to reverse or at least buffer the effects of fluoride.  It&#39;s not super conclusive as it points to needing to go through a metabolization from vitamin K to vitamin K2, and will only be effective after you have a certain level of vitamins A and D.  As well as being unclear if just taking vitamin K2 would work or if the only way to get the K2 where it needs to go is through metabolization.</p>

<p>It suggests taking a multi-vitamin with food (obviously one with A &amp; D).  After a few hours to let the food/vitamins metabolize, take a vitamin K supplement, or take vitamin K and K2. </p>

<p>I know there are also more esoteric practices to help with the pineal gland in everything from Taoism to Sufism.  I&#39;ll leave those avenues up to you, because as with all esoteric practices, mileage will vary by user.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.icnr.com/articles/fluoride-deposition.html">What about this study?</a></p>

<p>&quot;In conclusion, this study presented evidence that fluoride readily accumulates in the aged pineal. Fluoride may also accumulate in a child&#39;s pineal because significant amounts of calcification have been demonstrated in the pineals from young children [Cooper, 1932; Wurtman, 1968; Kerényi and Sarkar, 1968; Tapp and Huxley, 197 1; Doskocil, 1984].&quot;</p>

<p>I guess the study doesn&#39;t cover how calcification would interfere with its operation, but fascinating nonetheless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless of all of the effects associated with fluoride, the crux of the argument is that it <em>is a drug</em>, and it is being distributed in a one size fits all dose to everyone even if they don&#39;t want it.</p>

<p>We have a right to decide what we put into our bodies.  The goal of water treatment facilities should be to give us the most pure, least chemically adulterated water they possibly can.  Besides, <a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/10/24/vitamin-d-may-be-better-than-fluoride.aspx">Vitamin D would be better than fluoride anyway</a>.  So why the fuck isn&#39;t this ever being discussed?</p>

<p>Edit:  As far as avoiding it?  It is tough, from what I understand reverse osmosis is only really effective when it&#39;s gravity filtered, not forced through the elements at a high rate of speed.  I have a 2.5 gallon Big Berkey and it&#39;s pretty damn awesome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To stabilize the commodities markets and better regulate for growing populations. Gold is a finite resource. You can only leverage so much. The larger the population, the more inflated the price of gold. It would stagnate much of our research and technology areas. Not to mention simply starve out millions.</p>

<p>The problem with fiat is that it&#39;s not being properly regulated and the ignorant bunch like yourself simply look to throw it out rather than actually commit to positive action in terms of limiting/controlling commodities speculation (particularly that of oil), limiting/controlling usury, limiting/controlling banks&#39; ability to use their resources on what&#39;s effectively little more than gambling on the markets and cheating at it.</p>

<p>Fiat currency won&#39;t go away if the dollar does fail. It&#39;ll just move toward a more finely regulated economy that isn&#39;t as malignant as ours has become. Gold will also likely drop in value at that point since it&#39;s no longer being priced in the flawed currency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said anything about Ron Paul, or the gold standard. Clearly we can see that had I bought lots of gold just a year ago, I could sell it right now for a very healthy profit gain. It is directly related to the decline of the dollar, and our economy.  No one insists that someone should buy gold without ever having the intent to sell it. It&#39;s a calculated risk.</p>

<p>I would also never insist someone invest in PM&#39;s without already first having (6 month - 1 year) emergency provisions. Gold is what you do when you have extra cash and like shiny stuff and little bit of risk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The gold standard is simply a way to keep the government and central banks from printing unbacked money and therefore doing a hidden tax. It&#39;s not that complicated. Fiat currency always fail, always. The reason is simple - when you give someone the power to issue an IOU they&#39;re going to eventually start issuing IOU&#39;s that aren&#39;t backed by anything. It really sucks that we have to have gold and silver as stores of wealth but we do b/c people cannot be trusted. We need a natural, external control.</p>

<p>The dollar has lost 98% of its value in the last 100 years. Gold has not. That much cannot be debated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK here is what I know, Fluoride is a by product of the aluminum and nuclear industry and it is hazardous to human health. Also know that there is another fluoride that is natural but that is not what they add to the water.</p>

<p>The only water I trust is distilled water. Now some might say that it does not have minerals and will leach minerals from your body. To a degree they will be correct but they are missing a very important point. The minerals it takes from your body are inorganic minerals. This is a good thing. Also you are supposed to get your minerals from your food anyways. Also the removal of inorganic minerals is a good thing for you. I have listed two study&#39;s from Pubmed about fluoride and one of them even talks about how it is hazardous. Also two other sites, One is of course the trusty MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet.) The next one is about fluoride&#39;s history. Hope this helps you.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fluoride accumulates in the pineal gland in the brain. Pineal gland is responsible for making melatonin. Scientists have found that Excess Fluoride causes a lack of Melatonin production. Melatonin regulates sleep and scientists have found that lack of it may be responsible for sleep disorders of varying kinds. </p>

<p>Lack of Melatonin in the system means that we are also predisposing ourselves to cancer.  A large proportion of young women with a close family history of breast cancer also have low melatonin levels. Same with prostate cancer.  </p>

<p>Fluoride is also ascribed to the drain on vitality and produces the lack of will to fight. This is caused by the chronic lack of quality sleep which the lower levels of Melatonin produces over time. The Nazis found this out in the concentration camps - it stops people from revolting and allows you to control people who are in an endless sleep like, zombified existence.  </p>

<p>Getting the sheeple to &quot;Wake up sheeple&quot; is not as simple as it sounds...  </p>

<p>To remove Fluoride from the system:  </p>

<p>1) stop drinking it  (get a reverse osmosis or distiller - these are the only effective ways of removing fluoride from drinking water) </p>

<p>2) it can be removed it by taking vitamin K - found in fermented cod liver oil and rat fish oil  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey guys, what is the best way to get fluoride free water? I&#39;d like a somewhat cheap solution.</p>

<p>I currently have one of those Brita water filter jugs that you pour water from the faucet into.</p>

<p>I&#39;m 25 and I feel like my body is breaking down on me and the only thing I eat or drink that I feel might cause anything is the water.</p>

<p>Over the past few years I feel like I&#39;m getting &quot;dumber&quot; having a harder time speaking clearly, keep forgetting words, I get constant headaches and man...I don&#39;t know when was the last time I had a solid poop, that&#39;s where the user name &quot;WetPoop&quot; comes from. Constant Diarrhea. (that&#39;s kinda gross, sorry) I don&#39;t drink, smoke or do any drugs, or drink any soda...I do though drink a crap load of water that now I&#39;m thinking might be the culprit to everything. Just found out about fluoride a few months ago.</p>

<p>I did go to a doctor and he just said I had irritable bowel syndrome, that nothing else was wrong and didn&#39;t get any further tests or medicine for it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not being a troll I&#39;m genuinely asking for some help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got to spend some time shooting the shit with a brilliant neurologist a few years ago. I brought up the topic of fluoride and what I had read about it online. He said it is dangerous stuff, but only if consumed at levels far greater than what we&#39;re subjected to. He did tell me to stay far far away from artificial sweeteners as they are capable of causing brain damage, but brushed off the fluoride threat. He did tell me it is relatively useless (little to no benefit), so there&#39;s no harm in avoiding it. I have well water and my preferred toothpaste happens to be fluoride free, so all&#39;s good I guess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can add to this. Myself and my parents get cavities easily. My sister doesn&#39;t. Why? She was a child of the 60s and according to my mom, fluoride supplements for children was ok. My sister was given this supplement daily. She&#39;s over the hill in terms of age and has had no cavities her whole life. Mind you, she does not have a healthy diet, nor does she floss regularly. My parents and I do and we have had cavities our whole lives. </p>

<p>My sister is also the head of research for an undisclosed University hospital, was a 4.0 student her whole student life, and has had zero health issues related to anything listed here in r/conspiracy for fluoride. </p>

<p>I&#39;m still skeptical about the bad claims as she seems to be perfectly normal as a child who was forced to take fluoride growing up as a child.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Primarily a concern for the elderly as it is bad for bones if calcium intake is below normal (keep in mind, vit D needed for cal to be metabolized). This can be especially concerning for women with osteoporosis. Something of great importance to note: There is a lot of fluoride in black tea. Keep in mind a diet rich with tea (boiling water concentrates fluoride) could become an issue. Which becomes slightly troubling as many older women enjoy tea (but adding milk does help). Otherwise it&#39;s completely unfounded in terms of the Prozac connection. </p>

<p>Let me add, removing fluoride from the water is not easy. None of the standard water filtration systems do the job. Reverse osmosis or distillation are two methods to remove it. My research has led me to believe that while dental health has improved consistently over the past few decades, the correlation to regions with fluoridation is non existent. This leads me to believe that it serves no purpose. I must admit that I don&#39;t know what motivates large scale fluoridation, the best answer I&#39;ve come up with is business agreements relating to NaF.</p>

<p>My grasp of chemistry can tell pretty comprehensibly that a compund of many different elements can have COMPLETELY different attributes like reactivity. They are not the same just because they have fluo in both the names. It&#39;s like saying salt is deadly because it has chlorine in it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you know Fluoride is tentatively linked to the age when puberty hits animals and our children.</p>

<p>The Pineal gland produces an amino acid derivative commonly called Melatonin. Melatonin helps you sleep and affects your skin colouring.  As you age your Melatonin production decreases.</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineal_gland">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineal_gland</a>
&gt;The human pineal gland grows in size until about 1–2 years of age, remaining stable thereafter, although its weight increases gradually from puberty onwards. The abundant melatonin levels in children are believed to inhibit sexual development.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ok so lots of melatonin suppresses the sexual drive and puberty onset in children.  Then that means if our environmental factors load the pineal gland with toxins(one of is Fluoride), less melatonin is derived(produced) and our children can hit puberty at a younger age.  </p>

<p>Contaminants such as Fluoride/Fluorine and its free radicals accumulate in the Pineal Gland thus decreasing the melatonin production which in turn has shown to decrease the sexual age of maturity for animals.  I know so far all they say are animals...but we are mammals...animals.

<p>How many babies are fed tap water mixed with formula?  Babies are not designed to handle that excess fluoride load.  Distilling water(boiling) decreases the chloride content but increases the fluoride content as water loss occurs. Babies can develop dental fluorosis, among the other fluoride issues.</p>

<p>Environment Canada Toxicity List.  Inorganic fluoride(toothpaste fluoride is inorganic) is in that list.

<p>Other topics related to Flouride Ive encountered if anyone cares to research them:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Lowers male testesterone levels</p></li>
<li><p>Accumulates in the thyroid</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I avoid it with a well.  Lucky so far with no fracking in the area.  Test every 6 months as well.
Fluoride free toothpaste, or I make my own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Health care workers are not interested in the fluoride issue, because it seriously calls into question their credibility.  Most nations on the planet recognize its toxicity and negative effect on people.  There are numerous medical studies on the damage it causes.  However, if the health care professionals were to acknowledge the science on the matter they end up losing their status as knowledgeable people, so instead they ignore the very real science that implicates fluoride as being bad, and go on as if this data does not exist.</p>
