    <div class="md"><p>Sorry but I don&#39;t subscribe to that assertion. I read the arguments in the past.</p>

<p>Some Buddhists believe in gods, some don&#39;t, but belief in gods is not at all required by Buddhism and, arguably, is actually recommended against. This makes Buddhism and atheistic religion - both in practice because of the Buddhists who are also atheists, and in theory because of the lack of any defining teachings about the existence of gods. </p>

<p>Also Buddhism is conscientious which is defined under religion and, is not just defined in the limits of a belief in god alone. </p>

<p>(<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conscientiousness">http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conscientiousness</a>)</p>

<p>It has other several meanings which make Buddhism a religion like it or not. It is defined by academic scholars. You have a set of moral principals which guide your conscience by philosophy. You are religious unless you consider yourself unmoral. Atheists who wish to fill a spiritual void use philosophy of Buddhism as a cop out excuse.</p>

<p>(<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/religion">http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/religion</a>)</p>

<p>BTW my wife is a practicing  Japanese Buddhist and worships their gods and goddesses.</p>

<p>There are close to 500 million in the world. It is a religion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many Hindus and Buddhists will say their beliefs are more of a philosophy than a religion. There are fundamentalists though that do truly view it as a religion. It depends on context and the person really. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean by &quot;true&quot;?  If you are referring to the Sun as a god, isn&#39;t it a god, in a manner of speaking, especially when viewed from a primitive perspective?  All life is completely dependent on it, and it anchors and gives position to the Earth; it nurtures us and protects us from death by cold; we are composed of elements created in stars, and we will ultimately all form parts of another star (or many other stars).  For humans, it is our beginning and our end, and it is as &quot;godlike&quot; as anything we can observe from Earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your statement is broad and is a huge misconception from that shitty Zeitgeist film (The God that Wasn&#39;t There is another horrible documentary that gets this wrong). Christianity is very similar to the myth of Krishna in Hinduism (the birth story is almost identical). All the other religious diverge greatly. There are some common themes (birth of virgins, astrological signs based around Solstice/Equinox) that speak more to the human condition than anything.</p>

<p>I think many religious borrow myths from one another. The Jesus birth story wasn&#39;t created until almost 70 AD and is viewed by secular historians as a way of integrating existing gods into the gnostic-Christian myths; but even Jewish/Christianity wasn&#39;t anything like it is today with many sects believing in reincarnation. </p>

<p>Myths do breed other myths, but I think people imagine the direct path. Also Gerald Massey  was not remotely qualified to make any of the statement he did, plus he was kinda a moron. Please never use him as a source. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From my understanding of the various religions, Vedic Hinduism seems to be a root religion. While we have an estimate of how old hinduism is, It is assumed that it is actually much older. Considering that the oral traditions seem to go back to pre-history. Not to mention the complexity of Hinduism is quite out of this world. Especially since it has elements of science in its teachings. Including ages of the universe and a early preconception of string theory.  When it comes to abrahamic religions, they seem to spawn from Zoroastrianism ( the prophet Zoroaster = Abraham), which is a early precursor to the latter. There are elements in that early religion which in my opinion stem from Hinduism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Religions are mostly derived from ancestor worship. All religions are based on spiritualism, when you come down to it. Revered ancestors are prayed to for help, called upon through magic rituals, and eventually are elevated to the level of gods. Then one of them is elevated above the others, as the chief god (for example, Zeus or Odin). In monotheism, the one highest god becomes the only god. This is what happened for the Hebrews, who originally worshipped many gods (there are traces of these other gods in the Old Testament texts).</p>

<p>anyhow, in this episode the filmmakers claim that early in egypts history the people worshiped female pharoahs and as a result were much more in tune with the feminine. they had balance in their spirits, and had a greater sense of connectedness to the each other and the world around them. </p>

<p>then, at some point, male priests started to obtain power. they offered people &quot;salvation&quot; in exchange for money and loyalty which eventually led to the rise of powerful men in egypt. after they gained power they made efforts to destroy an hide evidence of the female pharoahs so they could retain that power. </p>
