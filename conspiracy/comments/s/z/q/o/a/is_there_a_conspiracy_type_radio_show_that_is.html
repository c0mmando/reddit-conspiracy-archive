    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t characterize Alex Jones as an idiot.  Idiots don&#39;t work as hard or get as much done as AJ does.</p>

<p>Instead, I&#39;d say Alex Jones is an egotistical personality who never bothered (probably because of his ego) to pursue a formal education, but has gotten away with it because of his tremendous capacity to recall information.  His recall is 100% by any means, but his memory is pretty impressive.  His lack of education shines through every other minute, but his memory recall of a vast array of information fills that void.</p>

<p>That being said, he&#39;s disorganized and has WAY too much on his plate, and it&#39;s been showing a lot these last 5 years.  His prime was the 2000 to 2007 period where he was more focused on real issues and had an important message to spread.  But lately it seems to me AJ is burning out.  He&#39;s riding the wave he generated for many years but that wave is receding.</p>

<p>A burning out ego manic, Yes, but an idiot, No.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He has such poor skills for the job he is doing. He can&#39;t interview to save his life. He always interrupts his guests or callers just as they are about to say something important or interesting. He tells a guest &quot;OK, you&#39;ve got the floor for the next five minutes.&quot; That&#39;s not interviewing.</p>

<p>Then, there&#39;s his tendency to descend into a kind of trance and spew out the same doggerel he&#39;s been reciting in a robotic way for years -- the banksters, the globalists, yada, yada, yada. I also hate it when he starts to channel the &quot;globalists&quot; as he calls them, and starts insulting his listeners. That&#39;s really irritating.</p>

<p>Given how poor his skills are, it&#39;s astonishing he&#39;s enjoyed as much success as he has enjoyed. It must be due to two things -- first, much of what he is talking about is true, and is important; second, his sheer energy carries his listeners along in spite of his faults.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My favorite laughable moment (and cringe worthy one) with Alex Jones was his interview with Noam Chomsky. I was shocked that AJ had scored such a ground breaking, and potentially, credibility enhancing interview. </p>

<p>The interview had been going, so-so, Alex Jones was acting like an adult, asking decent questions, Noam Chomsky trying his best to have an intellectual conversation with the bulldog.</p>

<p>Noam mentions something about gun control, AJ interjects for Noam to clarify his position.  Noam basically states his opinion that he thinks gun control is a necessary policy in this modern age, etc.</p>

<p>Alex Jones flies off the handle, and begins shouting at Noam Chomsky that he&#39;s a &quot;Shill!  A New World Order shill!!!&quot;</p>

<p>Needless to say, after about 30 seconds of that, Noam hangs up the phone. LOL</p>

<p>Classic crazy AJ.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He did a lot of good bringing people into the scene and waking them up. Him and Rivero are what got me thinking differently and interested in world events. Some of his movies were good but overall he won&#39;t touch the zionist issue and makes us all look crazy.</p>

<p>Now Michael Rivero if you check out his old stuff about Vincent Foster, OKC, Etc. He has been consistent through the years is obviously not in it for the money.</p>

<p>I disagree with his views on certain things but overall he&#39;s done good work.</p>

<p>I&#39;d check out Mike Rivero, Antiwar Radio, and some of Truth Jihad Radio. I don&#39;t necessarily agree with Kevin Barret&#39;s theories regarding 9/11 but he is a really nice man, and I like his interview style.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a clip on Youtube in which Cooper cuts on on a radio host to belittle a caller for his opinions. It was very bullying. Cooper was a cunning and able debater, and the guy calling in had no more than ordinary speaking skills -- Cooper just attacked him for no obvious reason ... maybe because he didn&#39;t like the guy&#39;s opinions, which (needless to say) were no further out there or nuttier than Cooper&#39;s own. But when you have a cult, there&#39;s a lot of infighting and bitching about fine points of dogma. Cooper struck me as a little bit of an L. Ron Hubbard type.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It depends on how you define conspiracy-type, but <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/">http://www.democracynow.org/</a> might fit the bill, considering that they cover a lot the MSM won&#39;t or will barely touch. It&#39;s a daily, non-corporately funded show you can watch online or listen to on the radio, and Amy Goodman gives me a raging brainer.</p>

<p>Also there is <a href="http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/tag/podcast-episode/">http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/tag/podcast-episode/</a>, a podcast hosted by Sibel Edmonds (FBI whistleblower and &quot;most-gagged person in the US&quot; via the states secret privilege) and Peter Collins, but, as they are entirely reliant on listener support, the most recent podcasts require a subscription (like 5 a month I think?) to hear in their entirety. It looks like most of the archived shows are fully available to non-subscribers. They have free previews for each episode and the site has other features, like articles on current events, political cartoons and some video. I haven&#39;t been there in a while but it looks like they&#39;ve been busy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Illuminatus Trilogy [circa 1975]. Robert Anton Wilson [author] was the editor of Playboy back in the 60&#39;s or so and he got a lot of letters about the Illuminati from people writing into the publication. That&#39;s how that trilogy got started. His view was, &quot;They believe it&#39;s really real.&quot; He thought it was so interesting that he wrote a couple books about it. You should hear what old Bob had to say about an East Berliner who smuggled his books out. R.A.W. has a hell of a sense of humor. It&#39;s half parody and half not for a reason. This becomes more clear the more of him you read.</p>

<p>Robert Anton Wilson is a personal hero of mine. And fucking sane. Saner than me.</p>

<p>They only do shows twice a week Tuesday and Sundays.
You can sometimes get interesting stuff off there but you have to deal with juvenile talk(they repeat the phrase douche bag at least ten times every show) and sometimes thinking, and almost half the show is a conflagration of self solicitation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trust me, you can sell t-shirts for $10 or $15 and still make a very healthy profit. You can sell DVDs for $10 and make a quite healthy profit as well. There is absolutely nothing wrong with capitalism, but when he does those &quot;money bombs&quot; for himself while still raking in huge profits from advertising and merchandising, one might wonder why he&#39;s actually doing this. Have you looked at how much he charges for advertising? How about how he does &quot;long form advertising&quot; on his radio show?</p>

<p>Once again, I&#39;m all for people making this into a career and making a healthy living but deceiving your viewers and readers (he actually had to change those in-text links a bit, probably because he was informed that he could actually get fined big time for his deceptive practices) isn&#39;t all that admirable. </p>

<p>He also advertises some products which are straight up dangerous and based on completely deceptive if not fraudulent claims (look up Youngevity scam and then check out his whole &quot;infowars team&quot; thing as well as the &quot;guests&quot; he has had on who promote these products).</p>

<p>Again I&#39;m absolutely 100% in favor of people making money doing this and providing for themselves and their families. I think that&#39;s the only way the alternative media can survive. That being said, I think Jones should be a little bit more transparent.</p>

<p>If you&#39;d like to know exactly how much I make (or, more accurately, how much of my savings I lose every month) I&#39;d be happy to share that. What do you think Alex would say if you asked him to show all of his income from ads on his sites, ads on his show, long form ads, merchandise, subscriptions, etc. etc.?</p>

But he&#39;s really just a lot of bluster that should be given no more thought than the ground underneath your feet. The gargoyle is inbetween you and your goal.</p>

<p>Waking people up? Hardly.</p>

<p>I knew about him <em>after</em> I had &#39;woken up&#39; (whatever that even means).</p>

<p>He&#39;s like the Glenn Beck of the conspiracy world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trust me, you can sell t-shirts for $10 or $15 and still make a very healthy profit. You can sell DVDs for $10 and make a quite healthy profit as well. There is absolutely nothing wrong with capitalism, but when he does those &quot;money bombs&quot; for himself while still raking in huge profits from advertising and merchandising, one might wonder why he&#39;s actually doing this. Have you looked at how much he charges for advertising? How about how he does &quot;long form advertising&quot; on his radio show?</p>

<p>Once again, I&#39;m all for people making this into a career and making a healthy living but deceiving your viewers and readers (he actually had to change those in-text links a bit, probably because he was informed that he could actually get fined big time for his deceptive practices) isn&#39;t all that admirable. </p>

<p>He also advertises some products which are straight up dangerous and based on completely deceptive if not fraudulent claims (look up Youngevity scam and then check out his whole &quot;infowars team&quot; thing as well as the &quot;guests&quot; he has had on who promote these products).</p>

<p>Again I&#39;m absolutely 100% in favor of people making money doing this and providing for themselves and their families. I think that&#39;s the only way the alternative media can survive. That being said, I think Jones should be a little bit more transparent.</p>

<p>If you&#39;d like to know exactly how much I make (or, more accurately, how much of my savings I lose every month) I&#39;d be happy to share that. What do you think Alex would say if you asked him to show all of his income from ads on his sites, ads on his show, long form ads, merchandise, subscriptions, etc. etc.?</p>
