    <div class="md"><p>Although Area 51 has been supplanted by a newer, much more secret site elsewhere, projects continue there. But workers fly in from Las Vegas on special flights from McCarren.</p>

<p>There are rumored underground bases as large as a city in various places. For example, &quot;a secret underground facility beneath the Balsam Mountains of Western North Carolina. The entrance to the facility is hidden beneath the benign looking Pisgah Astronomical Research Institute known as PARI. Hidden in plain sight because surface equipment and buildings are available to astronomy students and researcher specialists. The underground facility is at least city-sized and has supporting infrastructure (water, electricity, roads, etc.). However, the facility is in a remote area and well guarded. Outsiders only are welcome by appointment or by special invitation. What has and is going on beneath PARI is highly classified.&quot;</p>

<p>The locals know about it. One keeps a website about it and other things.</p>
