    <div class="md"><p>To get a clear answer you need to go back in time. </p>

<p>In the 90&#39;s Technology was progressing to the point where stopping the internet from organically developing was long past.  Back in the late 80&#39;s early 90&#39;s the &#39;internet&#39; was made up of stand along dial up Bulletin Board Systems.  They were hard to track, hard to monitor, and people could easily see that the number dialing in was an odd one, and shut the operation down. Information traveled across phone lines, but also physically on disks from one BBS&#39;er to another. Back then the people involved were largely anti-government, anti-social, hackers, crackers, and other &#39;undesirables&#39;.  (source : having been there)</p>

<p>The internet becomes public and things change.  From day 1 there were conspiracy, anti-government sites, alien tech discussions, and all of the other things that you see here on r/conspiracy, but early days of the net meant that people weren&#39;t as horribly skeptical about everything and opened their minds a bit.  They quickly fixed that problem by flooding the net with disinformation while also opening up wide area&#39;s of distraction to get more people on the net to focus on single areas,  ebay, yahoo, porn sites, etc.   </p>

<p>Now we&#39;re to the point where they&#39;ve managed to link most people into the database, whether it&#39;s here, linked in, facebook, twitter, steam, or any of the other ways they can build a profile of you.  Yes, there&#39;s potential that people can do things they don&#39;t like, and a great example is the Arab Spring using technology to protest the government publicly but without them seeing who is doing it directly,  but the western governments solved that problem a while back with 9/11.  The Patriot Act, and the various other governments legislation that does the same thing is very intentionally vague about it&#39;s extent.  It gives governments who feel threatened plenty of room to invade anyone&#39;s privacy.   </p>

<p>So while you may think that the internet is a free flowing place of collaboration that could be a threat to them, it&#39;s not their best tool of defence.  You could have direct clear evidence of government complicity in 9/11 (which actually, I think there is already) but they easily discredit that by flooding the discussion with disinformation and mistruths so that the entire conversation is derailed and you are now no longer trusted within that &#39;community&#39;,  not to mention, they now know you&#39;ve got information they don&#39;t want getting out and can follow you a lot easier online.</p>

<p>So the answer is, while it seems that they&#39;ve given you a great place to collaborate, conspire and work against the government, they&#39;ve actually created a perfect &#39;net&#39; to catch all of their flies in, and the younger generation seems very interested in handing over massive amounts of their information to anyone who&#39;s watching.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Boy, that is really such an excellent comment.</p>

<p>Something to consider: while the NSA and the FBI might have a field day with the information gleaned from the services you mention, like twitter, facebook, this place, steam, etc. foreign governments do not enjoy the benefits of the vacuum cleaner -like slurping up of information that <em>U.S.-based sites</em> provide to <em>U.S.-based governments</em>.</p>

<p>So twitter, facebook, et al are to <em>them</em> opaque communication channels for the masses, while to .gov Stateside, they are telescopes peering into the lives of those masses. The asymmetric nature of this relationship should be apparent, and it should explain why repressive regimes like China hobbles Google, by hampering the user experience though random and arbitrary blocks of Google content, manifested as annoyingly tedious gateway timeouts, while completely blocking sites like twitter and facebook. And why &quot;freedom fighters&quot; in Egypt, Tunisia, and other part yon and hither, could successfully launch a revolution using those technologies.</p>

<p>The idea that there is any anonymity at all on the web should be quickly demolished. In countries like Iran, <em>all</em> Internet traffic is routed through <em>one</em> route, which Iran has used to completely block access to whatever site they deem too threatening. If you can choke all traffic off at one point, then you can monitor <em>all the traffic</em> through that same point. Connections between clients and hosts can be logged, and packet contents can certainly be sniffed. Unless you do everything encrypted, then most of what you send and receive across the wire is as public as the back of a postcard.</p>

<p>ARPAnet was a research project that succeeded beyond their wildest expectations. It was effectively a purely academic network until end-1980s. It did not became a public communication medium before mid-1990s.</p>

<p>So this was not planned, and censorship is expensive. Which is why it is only being bolted on after the fact, and it can be readily circumvented via encryption and P2P. Obviously, they&#39;re trying to tar P2P with the brush of piracy, to discredit it and to attempt to outlaw it. As soon as some protocols are illegal, many users will avoid using &quot;criminal&quot; technology. The very few who dare will be very visible, and many of them likely to wind up in the global persons of interest database.</p>

<p>Early hackers had no clear political agenda. CCC still actively avoids the association with the Pirate Party.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what the internet is. You probably mean the Internet.</p>

<p>Most of the hacking culture came from phreakers and the organisation form was typically BBS. Few hackers had access to the Internet in 1980s.</p>

<p>No clear political agenda, yes, but still a political agenda even if it was being anti-social.</p>

<p>My experience starting from the BBS&#39;s introduced me to plenty of activists and people looking to change the system,  they migrated to the ~I~nternet as soon as it was available.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m up in Canada,  Niagara region specifically.  The activism was certainly not as large spread or organized as it is, or is possible today.  But what people were doing was spreading information and ideas about how to &#39;take the system down&#39; which seemed to be a big topic for the teenagers that were largely involved back then.</p>

<p>Personally I was involved with a group of 8 or so people organizing a protest at our school in response to the bombing of Iraq in the first Gulf war.   </p>

<p>Another group I&#39;m aware of organized a counter protest to a football game being played (nerds vs jocks type attitude).  </p>

<p>People were sharing the School Busters book and the Anarchist Cookbook (I may have an old ascii based copy from back in the day somewhere).  </p>

<p>And while our activism wasn&#39;t far reaching or very big, people elsewhere were already organizing into like minded groups and using the backbone of the network to get around the other controlled media areas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And that&#39;s to be expected.  There&#39;s few if any organizations started in the backwaters of the early internet that would still be in existence.  </p>

<p>Back then the people were far too few, with far too scattered of ideas.  20 years later it was a lot easier to gather like minded, local masses to your cause.  </p>

<p>I will not disagree that activism is far more rampant now, and people are using the medium better, I&#39;m just saying it was there in it&#39;s infant forms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Elites can&#39;t perceive and understand everything that&#39;s an impossibility. For example the internet of its time the Gutenberg printing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press">press</a> helped to free the minds of men in its early inception. However, slowly these tools were co-opted by publishers, editors, and newspaper to exclude the common man and recapture and shape his perception. Similarly, I think if we don&#39;t jealously guard the internet these same forces will use the exclusive newspaper models of editors, mods, and censors to destroy the liberating quality of the internet. An example of this is HuffingtonPost, which only approves comments that are not &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;, essentially they control the broad structure of the information and segregate and marginalize the readers into a passive entity. This is the same unaccountable, top down management style of old media, no wonder AOL Time Warner bought them up. Eventually, I can see pages like YouTube following the same model, unaccountable top down structure that favors traditional entries to the detriment of liberty and the common man. </p>

While the surveillance part is slowly-but-steadily moving forward, the control part is not, and in fact may be moving backward; in that sense, their MIC created a monster, which they struggle even now to subdue under the guise of IP and cyber-security litigation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.  When &quot;everyone wakes up&quot; and the &quot;cover is blown&quot; on a worldwide scale on the major conspiracies (NWO, elite, 9/11 fraud, etc), even this will be a deception to make everyone think that true good is on the way. Remember that the secret elite provide both the problem, and the solution. Massive suffering will come from what is brewing right now, and after that, they will bring about the solution. And everyone will be crying out for peace more than ever. This will be the perfect time to usher in the utopian society.</p>

Examples include:  Any link about evidence or supposition related to 9-11, and the mysterious circumstances surrounding the whole day.  </p>

<p>The Israeli atrocities against Palestine is also censured.  Climate change links almost never make it to the front page.  (All these kinds of links were on reddit every day a few years ago). Now you have to go to obscure subreddits to see links like this.  This is, (in my opinion) their aim; to censure and obfuscate information that most people will see) They don&#39;t care if the censure is complete, because if the majority believe a falsehood, then it doesn&#39;t matter what a &quot;crazy&quot; minority believe.    This is a pattern which I&#39;ve noticed.  </p>

<p>Absolute control does not exist. Notice that the powerful have been aware that the Internet routes around media propaganda, and they&#39;re trying to address that by increasingly ratcheting up surveillance and introducing censorship. However, the Internet is global, and the technologies are open, and hence are out of control. In order to kill Internet as a grassroot communication medium you&#39;d have to outlaw generic computers and introduce mandatory authentication, which would be very expensive and largely break the network. As the Internet has become a vital part of world&#39;s infrastructure that&#39;s not in the cards.</p>

<p>So we&#39;re getting a little arms race, with an uncertain outcome long-term.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Boy, that is really such an excellent comment.</p>

<p>Something to consider: while the NSA and the FBI might have a field day with the information gleaned from the services you mention, like twitter, facebook, this place, steam, etc. foreign governments do not enjoy the benefits of the vacuum cleaner -like slurping up of information that <em>U.S.-based sites</em> provide to <em>U.S.-based governments</em>.</p>

<p>So twitter, facebook, et al are to <em>them</em> opaque communication channels for the masses, while to .gov Stateside, they are telescopes peering into the lives of those masses. The asymmetric nature of this relationship should be apparent, and it should explain why repressive regimes like China hobbles Google, by hampering the user experience though random and arbitrary blocks of Google content, manifested as annoyingly tedious gateway timeouts, while completely blocking sites like twitter and facebook. And why &quot;freedom fighters&quot; in Egypt, Tunisia, and other part yon and hither, could successfully launch a revolution using those technologies.</p>

<p>The idea that there is any anonymity at all on the web should be quickly demolished. In countries like Iran, <em>all</em> Internet traffic is routed through <em>one</em> route, which Iran has used to completely block access to whatever site they deem too threatening. If you can choke all traffic off at one point, then you can monitor <em>all the traffic</em> through that same point. Connections between clients and hosts can be logged, and packet contents can certainly be sniffed. Unless you do everything encrypted, then most of what you send and receive across the wire is as public as the back of a postcard.</p>
