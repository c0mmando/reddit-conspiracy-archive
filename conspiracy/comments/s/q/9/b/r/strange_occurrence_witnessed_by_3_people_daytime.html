        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So here I go, I will do my best to explain the situation without sounding like I need a tinfoil hat:</p>

<p>I was sitting in my living room about 2 months ago (this has bothered me for quite some time) with two other friends. We were talking and enjoying the afternoon light that filters into the many windows on the side of my house. The house actually has so many windows, and is so bright- that I never turn the lights on until after 8pm. </p>

<p>Around I would guess 2pm, there was what I can only describe as a flicker of the outside light. The entire house went dark for a small fraction of a second, then for a larger fraction of a second. Exactly in the same way that the lights flicker in your home when there is a power surge. So similar, in fact, that my buddy immediately  blurted out &quot;did the power just go out?&quot; Only to immediately realize that there were no lights on in the entire house. My other friend (who is also a redditor) was sitting in the room and witnessed the entire thing as well, although he didn&#39;t comment to much on what it might be. We pretty much dismissed it at the time, decided it was weird, and never talked about it again. </p>

<p>After several weeks of thinking, it has occurred to me that this could have been a VERY LARGE flying object. The flicker was much too fast to have been even a very fast-moving cloud. The weather was clear, and there was not even any wind that day. It would have to be a freaking HUGE plane to block out the light as substantially as it did. If it was not some sun-obscuring object, what else? A glitch in the Matrix? </p>

<p>It still makes me feel funny to think about it. </p>

<p>I would love to hear your ideas. Any chance anyone has had a similar experience?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember the first time that happened to me, it freaked me out for a moment. I thought &quot;no way could a plane&#39;s shadow block the sun for so long.&quot; But seeing a plane&#39;s shadow move across the ground can alter that perception as well.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.ehow.co.uk/facts_7612341_fast-commercial-jet-airplane-fly.html">this article</a>, &quot;The average cruising speed [of a commercial jetliner] is between 550 and 580 mph&quot;. That&#39;s between 806 and 850 feet per second. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_777">Boeing 777</a> is between 209&#39; and 242&#39; long. So the shadow of the fuselage a Boeing 777 traveling at cruising speed should take roughly a quarter second to pass over any given point on the ground. A quarter second is more than enough to notice, and perhaps enough for your retinas to react, perhaps causing the &quot;flickering&quot; effect the OP described. A Boeing 777 is a very long plane, but planes don&#39;t always fly at cruising speed, either. Especially if the OP was anywhere near an airport.</p>

<p>Solved. I liked the idea of the Matrix flickering, though. But the first time a plane flew directly over me, I thought for sure it must have been a huge UFO or something. Sucks that the explanation was so banal, but accepting that banality is a huge part of the experience of the phenomena of life around us, is part of having a skeptical mind. I don&#39;t think any of us here would be reading <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> if we didn&#39;t have a skeptical mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is weird, but keep in mind that our perceptions often lie to us. A brief complete change in the lighting could appear to be pitch-blackness, especially if your pupils are undialated. And besides the state of your irises, your consciousness decides autonomously what to show you and how- this is why I don&#39;t go in for UFO theories, even when corroborated by a group. Memes are powerful influencers of perception.</p>

<p>For it to have been a &quot;bird&quot; is completely ridiculous, this wasn&#39;t as if a shadow passed over the sun, it was as if the sun quit shining for a second. In the early afternoon, we are not talking a low-level of light either. I have witnessed the sun being completely obstructed by clouds, etc later in the day and early at night.
