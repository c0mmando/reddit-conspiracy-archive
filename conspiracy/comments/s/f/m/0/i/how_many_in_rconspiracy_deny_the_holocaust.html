    <div class="md"><p>Do you have any evidence for your claims? </p>

<p>Stalin&#39;s atrocities were hardly ignored, they were scrutinized and condemned. The difference between Stalin&#39;s Russia and Hitler&#39;s Germany was that Germany participated in industrialized mass genocide whereas the Russians did not. And the pogroms themselves have their own history of scrutiny. </p>

<p>The term Holocaust doesn&#39;t come from arameic at all, in fact in Israel and other countries the Holocaust is called the shoah, translated as &quot;the purge.&quot; Holocaust has Greek roots.</p>

<p>You say the world isn&#39;t black and white and yet your arguments are based upon that perception. There are secret societies that control everything, and then there are those who see through the veil of illusion. That sounds black and white to me, and that coupled with your incorrect facts and ridiculous assumptions really leaves your argument hanging out to dry.</p>

<p>This is the problem right here, you&#39;re attacking his &quot;argument.&quot; Attack the evidence instead. The things he said are not concocted ideas, they are conclusions drawn from evidence, so instead of attacking his conclusions for not fitting into your worldview, go look at the evidence to see if his conclusions are valid. You don&#39;t approach an idea by first denying it.</p>

<p>You&#39;re implying that we glamorize ourselves by &quot;seeing through the veil of illusion.&quot; No, we don&#39;t, we glamorize ourselves with what everyone <em>should</em> be doing, looking at the god damn evidence. It&#39;s clear as day, but it&#39;s an uphill fight to get a single person to even consider these ideas in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>I find it important to have the discussion at all, which in my country (germany) is illegal and can me jail time, which shows me, that there is something wrong about the official history, which I am not supposed to question, so I do it.</em></p>

<p><em>Germany just gave two Dolphin atomic subs to Israel, so my tax monex goes into the next mass genocide....</em></p>

<p>This is what Gunter Grass is going on about, and it is valid. How crazy is it that Germany, a seemingly enlightened nation, can actually <em>put people into prison</em> for discussing various historical events that took place between 1939 and 1945? I mean, it&#39;s CRAZY. Anyone with any objectivity can see that it is insane, yet it is not even debated in any widespread manner. Mind you, Jewish control of the media is responsible for much of the lack of public debate on the subject, but fear and irrational guilt is probably responsible for the rest of it.</p>

<p>It would be so ironic if Israel used its German subs to launch nuclear warheads against some city, killing hundreds of thousands of human beings, wouldn&#39;t it? Gunter Grass gets the irony of it, and I hope other Germans do as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>My answer to this is that the common jewish people were sacrficed by the zionist elite with the purpose of creating an untouchable &quot;race&quot; and creating the (historically illegitimate) state of Israel, and the sacrifice was to Lucifer.</em></p>

<p>Good points. Holocaust means an offering to God that is wholly consumed by fire upon the altar. Most sacrifices of meat were eaten by the worshippers -- God got only a few specific bits of the animal -- but in the case of a holocaust, God got everything and the worshipers ate nothing.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty evident from their acts that if Jews are the Chosen People, they aren&#39;t the chosen of the highest God, but of something else with more materialistic, crass purposes.</p>

<p>Elisabeth de Rothschild <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_de_Rothschild">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_de_Rothschild</a></p>

<p>Elisabeth de Rothschild (née de Chambure) (March 9, 1902 - March 23, 1945) was a member by marriage of the wine-making branch of the Rothschild family.
Born in Paris as Elisabeth Pelletier de Chambure, into a wealthy <strong>Catholic</strong> aristocratic family whose roots were in the Burgundy region. In 1934, immediately after her divorce from her first husband, Jonkeer Marc Edouard Marie de Becker-Rémy, a Belgian aristocrat, she married her lover, Baron Philippe de Rothschild, a member of the prominent Rothschild family and the owner of one of France&#39;s most famous vineyards...</p>

<p><strong>She was the only Rothschild to die in the Holocaust or during WW2.</strong></p>

<p>The funding of atrocities (especially war profiteering) is the <em>first</em> thing I look at. And, in this particular situation (&quot;the holocaust&quot;), it appears that the Rothschilds bankrolled Hitler/Germany before, during, and after WWII and made enormous profits doing so (i.e., If you aren&#39;t seeing it yet, it appears that the Rothschilds funded, <em>and profited from</em>, this particular slaughter of Jews.).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no documentary evidence for an exterminationist policy as carried out by the government in WW2... not a single written order.</p>

<p>There was no airtight seal in the alleged extermination chambers (not where you want to be putting poison gas)</p>

<p>Zyklon B started its life out as a disinfectant</p>

<p>Scientists doing soil tests at the alleged extermination sites have found no evidence for cyanide</p>

<p>&quot;The Auschwitz Museum maintains, not too surprisingly, that Poland&#39;s acid rain had eliminated the cyanide. This flies in the face of the scientific fact that the &quot;Prussian blue&quot;, the compound formed by cyanide and iron in the bricks and mortar, is one of the most stable and enduring compounds (discoloratation is perhaps a better word) known to man. The late Dr. William Lindsey, Chief Research Chemist for Dupont of America stated that this combination of Zyklon B with iron could last thousands of years in rain, sleet and open air. This telling blue stain is clearly seen today in disinfection chambers, but not in the so-called &quot;gas chambers&quot; at Auschwitz. 
    We are now asked by the Holocaust Hucksters to believe that the rain selectively washed out the evidence of the so-called &quot;gas chambers&quot; but left the evidence where vermin had been killed. Believable? So is the Easter Bunny. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Over a period of 25 years, Lüftl was regularly called in court cases as an expert witness involving engineering and construction matters. In 1992 Lüftl wrote a report calling the alleged extermination of millions of Jews in gas chambers during WWII &quot;technically impossible.&quot; 
Lüftl also pointed out that the design and numbers of the crematories showed that they were incapable of handling the number of &quot;gassed&quot; victims routinely alleged by the Holocaust Lobby. &quot;Corpses are not flammable material,&quot; wrote Lüftl. &quot;to cremate them requires much time and energy. . . &quot; none of which the Germans had in limitless abundance. 
Lüftl was criminally charged in Austria - where &quot;Holocaut Denial&quot; is a criminal offense - for writing this report &quot;denying the Holocaust.&quot; but all charges against him were quietly dropped. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Rudolf Report - Germar Rudolf, a diplom chemist in Germany trained at the Max Planck Institute, a famous German facility, investigated the sites of the alleged homicidal gas chambers of Auschwitz and took samples for the purpose of determining cyanide levels. Rudolf&#39;s report concluded, like Leuchter&#39;s, that the alleged gas chambers could never have been used for the claimed mass gassings on an industrial scale. Tests on samples showed no or minimal traces of cyanide. 
Germar Rudolf is a special case and illustrates that when it comes to the so-called &quot;gas chambers&quot; of places such as Auschwitz, society no longer deals in rationality and reason. Here is a young, profoundly apolitical young man with a new family and no links whatsoever to any political, much less &quot;extremist&quot; group - like &quot;Holocaust Deniers.&quot; He wrote a treatise on his findings that is impeccable. He submitted his report to more than 300 experts for their critique before he published it. 
Not one of them found even the smallest error! 
Germar Rudolf was criminally charged under Germany&#39;s repressive &quot;Holocaust-is-a-dogma&quot; law. Just a few weeks ago, Germar Rudolf has been sentenced to a prison term of 18 months for his scientific finding. The book he wrote has been banned in Germany, and many people connected to its publication have been punished with jail terms and/or fines. The report has been ordered to be destroyed. 
This brilliant scientist, with a young, pregnant wife and a baby already born, has been evicted twice from his apartment for his &quot;sin.&quot; He is now in political exile - his career ruined and his life in shreds.&quot;</p>

<p>Well believe what you want to believe... I used to totally buy into the holocaust myth (all my life)... now I hardly know what to think...</p>

<p>Watch &quot;Last Days of the Big Lie&quot; (easily found on youtube) which contains a moving account of a black american soldier liberating a camp (which we now know to have been liberated by the russians) the truth is anyone can concoct emotionally charged stories...</p>

<p>The human skin lampshade idea emerged sometime soon after Germany surrendered... but its now considered even by Exterminationist Historians to be a myth... well doesn&#39;t that in itself stink?</p>

<p>If you want the most evidence filled, most cited and sadly most difficult to sit through revisionist documentary... then look no farther than &quot;One Third of the Holocaust&quot; (again easily found on youtube) if you can actually sit through this all the way to the end you will have some very unsettling thoughts... but I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll just switch it off after 10 minutes... after all its far easier to imagine that these people have all been brainwashed (or have some illogical hatred towards jews) than to actually put in the intellectual time and effort to look through these claims yourself</p>

<p>you see the establishment very clearly wants noone to question this... that&#39;s why they put to jail anyone who does... most people that should be revealing this shit to us (scholars, journalists, scientists) either don&#39;t know the evidence or if they do... they know how the boat works and they ain&#39;t about to rock it...</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry but the holocaust is the biggest mind game that we&#39;re all forced to participate in... it takes a strong character to stop being victimised and step aside in laughter (the true victims of the holocaust... are the rest of the world for buying into it, and wasting their emotional energy on it... no scratch that the true victims of the holocaust are those who truly believe they are trying to do the right thing by saying hey somethings weird here before getting promptly thrown in jail)</p>

<p>like I said believe what you want to believe... the important thing is nearly 99% of what we&#39;re told about everything is lies... not just the holocaust... but its done in such a way as to be easily sucked in... its not even a question of intellect... its a question of how vunerable are you to social forces... and the simple fact of the matter is we&#39;re most of us (like it or not) extremely vulnerable (everyone else is just very vulnerable)</p>

<p>of all the lies we&#39;ve been fed in our existence here on planet earth... the holocaust has to be one of the most profound</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Different numbers are from different sources, I&#39;ve read up to 12 million people were killed by the Nazi&#39;s during the Holocaust, of which ~5.1 million were Jews, making up the majority, followed by Soviet P.O.W&#39;s, Poles, Romani, Disabled people, and Homosexuals. </p>

<p>The number of 5.1 million comes from Raul Hilberg, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raul_Hilberg">1</a>, who wrote <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Destruction_of_the_European_Jews">the first comprehensive historical account</a> of the Holocaust, called the Destruction of The European Jews. </p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve read on here, a lot of people seem to deny the Holocaust and take it as part of some giant Jewish conspiracy to take land from Palestine, which makes no sense to me. </p>

<p>Seems like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_libel">blood libel</a> that was large in Europe for centuries before and up until the Holocaust is still alive and well on this sub-reddit.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I am critical of Israel and its policies as much as all of you are, I just think that denying an event that has been scrutinized and studied by academics for years is foolish. Hilberg himself spent most of his life in libraries studying the Holocaust, rummaging through papers stamped by Nazi bureaucrats sending millions to their deaths. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just curious as to what evidence these denialists have, it seems that this event has been well documented without considerable bias. </p>

<p>As far as the inflated numbers being used to justify policies (in Israel and abroad), I think that is another issue entirely; it isn&#39;t as simple as &quot;Oh, Israel is using the Holocaust to promote x agenda, must be a grand Jewish conspiracy to take over the world.&quot;  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you&#39;ve asked is not only a loaded question, but a meaningless question. It can&#39;t be answered.</p>

<p>For one thing, everyone has their own conception of what the term Holocaust means. These conceptions differ.</p>

<p>For another thing, different people have different ideas what &quot;denial&quot; means in this context. Is it denial to disagree with even one of the many tenets of the standard, approved Holocaust dogma? Or is it only denial when every single tenet is flatly denied?</p>

<p>The people who ask the question you&#39;ve asked are usually Hasbara Zionists who are seeking something they can use against other individuals, as a way of silencing them.</p>

<p>When you get right down to it, the Holocaust is only an invented term, drawn from Jewish folklore and Talmudic lore, that has been applied to a collection of separate events that happened during World War II. Some of the events claimed under the Holocaust umbrella term may not even have actually happened; or at least, there is reason enough for some individuals to doubt that they occurred. Other events may have been wildly exaggerated. The purpose or meaning of still other events under the Holocaust umbrella may have been misinterpreted by Zionists after the War.</p>

<p>One point that should be made on this subject is that mainstream history texts about the Holocaust are not to be trusted. This subject is so loaded with emotionalism, and even hysteria, that historians are not free to write all the truth as they find it, but must conform to the approved dogma. You can no more trust the history books on the Holocaust than you can trust the mainstream media on the subject of Israel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean denial in the sense that the official story is somehow fabricated or has elements of falsehood. </p>

<p>I am really just looking for others opinions and input on the topic, as I have done quite a bit of research (and read Hilberg&#39;s Destruction of the European Jews) and am leaning towards the conclusions he draws. </p>

<p>However, I am also aware of Finkelstein&#39;s &quot;Holocaust Industry&quot; and how the Holocaust is used to manipulate public opinion on certain issues. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The first casualty of war is the truth&quot; and &quot;history is written by the victors&quot; these 2 quotes should remind us that during war there IS a lot of war propaganda that may or may not be true and we as the victors got to write our version of history and it would be in our best interest to look the best we could and the other side as evil as possible. So no I&#39;m skeptical of some of the history especially when people are put in jail and demonized simply for wanting to do more research on the holocaust or questioning facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know for sure, but I did see a convincing video on youtube once that talked about how given the officially reported number of murders at a particular concentration camp and the size of the ovens found there how it would be mathematically impossible for them to have killed and cremated that many people.  Sorry though I don&#39;t have the link. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It? That&#39;s the problem, what is &quot;it&quot;? Six million? Deliberate mass-scale gassings with cyanide? Was it a deliberate attempt to exterminate all Jews? Were Jews made into lampshades and soap and flowered hats? The &quot;it&quot; of the matter can become pretty vague, and can vary from person to person.</p>
