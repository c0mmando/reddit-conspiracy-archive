<p>I&#39;m subscribed to the major subreddits (politics, worldnews, etc.), and constantly see posts about how horrendous the oil industry is, and how the rich are screwing the 99%. I have not seen one post on Obama&#39;s oil speculation speech hit the front page. Not even on the under-subscribed Progressive subreddit. </p>

<p>My tl;dr, moderators are only allowing certain relevant info hit the front pages. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Party bots for both sides are really active on Reddit both as users and infiltrating as mods. Also lobbyists, industry shills, and government shills. You can often tell, when a user since account creation posts nothing but on one topic.</p>

<p>The problem is that when a medium becomes successful, it attracts the attention of the people who want to control public opinion, and they begin spending money to ensure they dominate it. It&#39;s all about power and money and politics in the end.</p>

<p>I keep a list of topics for which any post critical of the subject almost automatically gets downvotes very quickly even if it&#39;s obscure. I can guarantee that if you criticize certain companies, politicians, or topics, there will be rapid negative response, for which if you review the commenters, you can see they are one-topic Redditors with an agenda. In the case of some link postings, the filters have been set in some places to prevent them from showing up. There are corrupt mods, there have been ones exposed in the past and there are still some in place.</p>

<p>There are also some people on Reddit who use topic-spotting software that informs them right away and they swarm to it to kill it or bury it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. Here is one: post a link to a site that casts the lhc in a negative light.  Try it here or in <a href="/r/science">/r/science</a>, or any larger subreddit.  I found a pattern of instantaneous downvotes that was different from what I get when I submit on other topics.</p>

<p>Another one, i have noticed a pattern in<a href="/r/energy">/r/energy</a> where links related to Fukushima slowly get up votes and then suddenly drop down to 0.  It&#39;s as if someone alerted his buddies or sockpuppets and then they all act together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed. There&#39;s  case where there is a certain group on Reddit that hangs out in its own multiple subReddits. Often, when someone the group opposes makes a comment, the group leaders post a link to where the opponent commented, but in  subs they moderate, sometimes with an admonition similar to: &quot;Now, don&#39;t go and downvote this person, because that would be bad.&quot; The snicker accompanying this is not posted.</p>

<p>I know of Redditors who are continually harassed by them, with one guy (not me!) whose every comment is instantly downvoted by this crowd. I friend-subscribe to his posts and see this all too often.</p>

<p>Given the amount of time these specific people spend daily on Reddit, it seems very likely they are funded, because no one with a day job would have the time to track people and also run many subReddits as they do. The sheer volume of activity says paid shills to me, not merely fanatics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I will agree. Ever since the about SOPA stuff was active there has been a major shift in Reddit.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying censorship isn&#39;t taking place, but surely you must realize that just because a topic you find interesting isn&#39;t covered on the front page, doesn&#39;t necessarily mean the topic being censored. Perhaps there&#39;s simply not enough other people who are interested or are even aware of the topic that you believe to be censored. In other words, maybe it&#39;s not censorship. Maybe people just aren&#39;t making submissions or finding those submissions worthy of an upvote?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just the fact that they have mods tells you they have censorship. If it was really about what the people thought was good or not they would just let us up vote or down vote whatever gets put there. Now if someone is posting stuff that could harm your equipment  or threaten the security of your information then somebody has to have the ability to block that content but that would be it, if this was a truly non censorship site which it&#39;s not and never has been.</p>
