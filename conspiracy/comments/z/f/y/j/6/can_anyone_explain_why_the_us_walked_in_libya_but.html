       How do you mean?  Russia really has no leverage over the US and has no where near the ability to project power like we do.  Putin doesn't have the political capital to deploy Russian troops in a fight he knows he would lose badly.  Naval power, and especially naval aviation power would be the deciding factor in any modern conflict and you are talking about a warehouse full of apples compared to a crate of oranges.

Why is it that people underestimate other nations. How do you really know what the Russians do and don't have. Someone, somewhere "gathered" intelligence from the Russians and we must assume that that's all the power they have. Better to overestimate your enemy than be unprepared when the time comes.

       What the hell are you talking about?  Aircraft carriers take a lot of time, money and space to build.  Russia isn't exactly in a position to hide a couple of hundred billion dollars in super secret military funding so again, what the fuck are you talking about?
      </p>
      <p>
       The US has 12 Carrier Strike Groups, Russia has a single (1) aircraft carrier.  Yet again I will point out that this is the kind of math you can do with crayons folks.

       Aircraft carriers are not the only way to project power, and in any event they are not useful against an opponent with long range anti-ship missiles.  The next conflict will prove that they are all but obsolete.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Russia suffers an attack by a US aircraft carrier, you can expect them to retaliate.  They don't need a carrier to do so.  By limiting yourself to counting carriers on your 12 fingers, you are proving your idiocy.

       Meet the Phalanx CIWS.  They have been using these since the Falklands proved the effectiveness of the anti-shipping missile.  Also remember we are talking about Carrier Strike GROUPS, including Aegis equipped cruisers.

       The Phalanx CIWS has never been tested in actual battle.  Anyway, when it is, it will be tested by more targets than it can intercept in any given time frame.  I'm not impressed by bolt-on equipment of dubious utility.

       None of that matters.  All that matters is supply.  If Russia (or China, or another weapons manufacturing country) can keep sending weapons and supplies to Syria, the US cannot expect to be able to win a ground war.  Period.

       Russia doesn't really need to project power with an aircraft carrier in order to retaliate against a US strike.  They can do it with Sunburn missiles, conventional or nuclear ballistic missiles, etc.  They can launch attacks from the air with their White Swan aircraft or with Bears (both of which are insanely long range).  Aircraft carriers are mostly useful for bombing the crap out of some brown people and controlling airspace during a land invasion.  They suit the US doctrine well, but Russians operate on a totally different operational plan than the US and NATO do.  They are also not nearly as exposed as the USA, so they don't really need to be able to take a floating airbase around the world on misadventures.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the USA were to attack Russia with aircraft carriers, Russia would simply sink them one way or another.  They have the capability to do this.  Heck, they sell missiles against which there is no credible defense to anybody with the cash.  A couple of Sunburns fired in a salvo would overwhelm any Aegis system, and any one of them would cause a fatal wound to a carrier.  Or perhaps a supercavitating torpedo?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's clear that you don't understand that we won't attack Russia because they have credible deterrence capabilities.  Naval power is useful when you want to bomb the shit out of people living in an undeveloped country.  It would be totally useless against Russia with the notable exception of submarines.  And, guess what, the Russians have always made much better submarines than we have.

       Are you retarded?  The only way the US would ever attack Russian forces is if they used force against NATO in Syria.  This is the scenario you seem to think is likely, I'm saying there there is absolutely no way Russia would risk an outright war with the US over Syria.  The regime there is almost certainly going to fall just under rebel pressure and do you really see Moscow deploying tanks to prop up Assad?  I'll tell you a secret, they tried that in Afghanistan and it didn't work out well for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once ICBM's start being prepped the game is over.  The US nuclear and conventional arsenals are both larger and once fueling of solid rockets began en masse you would start seeing Russian boomers (most of which are 40+ years old) sinking.  Seriously, just look at wikipedia man, there is no match on either the nuclear or conventional fronts.  We spend more than all other nations combined on our military.

       I'm not retarded you dirty shill.  Clearly you're retarded because you're sitting around counting carriers when they have no relevance to a discussion about the relative toughness of the US and Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm undoubtedly more qualified than you are to speak on military matters.  Your commentary so far has been just the opposite of insightful.  Measuring military might in dollars spent is also more proof of your status as a mental midget.  When Russia and China maintain state owned military industries, they can naturally get by on much less money.  I would estimate that 1/1000th the cash would be sufficient for running a state-owned military company compared with a for-profit money waster like Boeing or any of our major companies.

       Our advanced technology drone / mounted infantry war in Afghanistan is going just as badly as the Russian one in the 1980s, and the irony there is that they Afghans do not even have access to the kinds of support they did when we were supplying them.

       Who exposed them?  Your blowhard buddy Alex Jones or Mr. Lizard-people David Icke?  Oh...let me guess, you are not a fan of either....almost the same with me and Anderson Cooper.  Not sure about the homosexual comment, that is a bit Freudian though.

       Having that much money not under western control is an obvious invitation for intervention.  Question is, is that actually what happened?

       It could be because Libya is an oil-rich country with established ports and a relatively small population. On the other hand Syria has a large population and is close to several hostile countries - i.e. any Syrian intervention isnt cost effective to the US.

       Syria is supported militarily by Iran, and Russia and China also want to keep their economic interests secure so will not agree to any military intervention such as a no-fly zone. Also Syrias military is a lot mor efficient and modern than Libya's, they have anti-aircraft weapons and an Airforce that are capable of shooting down NATO Jets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially NATO were able to go into Libya without having any losses militarily or economically the same cannot be said of Syria where they would just stand to lose men and money.

       lol...wat?  The only effective AA system they have was given to them by Russia (S-300) and they only have 8 launchers.  The US currently has 19 operational B-2 stealth bombers plus a large and secret drone fleet, this is the kind of math you can do with crayons.  S-200's pose no real threat to modern fighter jets and the rebels are capturing or destroying them like crazy in Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       Syria's terrain and the lack of a unified resistance on the ground play a much bigger role.  In Libya they had the TNC who was ready to take over functions of government as areas fell (not saying they did it well, but it was a plan none the less).  Syria simply does not have this, the SNC is largely controlled by the Muslim Brotherhood and is plagued with infighting.

       LOL, I had to google that one, never been called that.  Israel stands to lose the most in a new "free Syria".  Believe it or not, dealing with a dictator is a hell of a lot easier than dealing with a democracy.  While Bashar did supply Hezbollah, the spectre of his chemical weapons calling into the hands of more or less stateless jihadist is pretty much the worst case scenario for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which of course makes this whole situation here on r/cons laughable.  You guys are citing Syrian and Russian government propaganda blaming a country who's interest would be harmed by aiding the rebels.  These are the little reminders I get that many here are not playing with a full deck when it comes to foreign policy.  Blaming the Jews in every situation is way easier than learning the difference between a Sunni and a Shia.

       Israel's hoping that the Western-funded rebels (and likely Western educated leaders) will be gentle cattle.  Even if they aren't, they have long planned to soften Syria in this fashion.  Finkelstein has mentioned this on several occasions.

       These rebellions in Syria always start in Homs.  Where's Homs?  Why Homs?  Because of its proximity to Israel and the relatively easy border nearby.

       Research the situation, the Syrian military is on it's last leg.  Rebels are controlling entire cities in the north and they are attacking every supply convoy on the highways.  The Syrian Air Force is so desperate for bombs  that they are dropping 55 gallon oil drums filled with either TNT or just random metal objects.  Add to that the fact that the Rebels in both the North and Central part of the country are showing off newly captured SA-7 Grail surface to air missiles and you have a royal shitstorm brewing.

       At this point the US could move the equipment into place to utterly destroy the Syrian military in under a week.  Remember, a single American aircraft carrier has more firepower than ALL of the Iranian air force combined.  Syria's air force is smaller, older and will only get more unreliable as this conflict goes on.

       Syria has anti air defense, therefore it would be closer to a real war like Iraq. Also Russia is in the mix and the united states would need a very good reason, like a direct attack from Syria for example.

       Do some research, the US routed the Iraqi military (both times) in a number of hours.  Syria's air defenses were penetrated as late as 2008 by Israeli jets and helicopters taking out their fledgling nuclear program around Der Azor.

       Did you even listen or read gheddafi's biography? That guy was crazy ,  a complete nut job , something out of The dictator movie , you  can't befriend him nor consider him an ally , he can just back stab you at any moment . He was making trouble all over the place , funding insurgency , funding terrorist groups , funding war all over africa .
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         He can't be trusted and have no real allies .
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Toppling gheddafi was cheap and easy .
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         He had almost no army , he kept the army weak because he was always afraid of a coup . It is not the case in Syria , the army is the actual ruler of the country .
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The country has a lot of oil and you can get  a profit out your bomb investment very quickly , and  very lucrative project  .
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Burning Syria , might create an other Afghanistan  just at the door step of Israel which is out of the question,  the Syrian regime was pretty docile the last 3-4 decades .
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       They might go into Syria if the regime become weak enough , always remember that corporate thinking is deep in our government policies , if there is enough profit and less risk they will go for it .

       What freedom are you talking about , it is a middle eastern / north African bloody dictator .  He killed his own people , any opposition just disappears .
      </p>
      <p>
       String social support programs ?  Compare how Libyans where living to lets say Norway ? Qatar? Kuwait? Dubai?  They had a low population of 3m people and sitting on large oil reserves .
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said , I don't like painting stuff pink , because they are on my team or they are fighting the global imperialistic agenda  ,  this guy was bad , the NATO going in libya and getting ride of him is bad move too .

      <p>
       Grossly oversimplified.  Did he kill people within his geographic borders?  Unarguably, he did.  Were they HIS people?  This gets a little more definitional.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did he play geopolitics with the big boys?  I'd say he did the best he could with the tools he had.  Did he win?  It does not appear so.

       Conflating this with other non-parallel issues is unconstructive.

       In the arab world saddam hussein might be  respected by a lot of people but gheddafi is a joke .
      </p>
      <p>
       You think that a dictator , that tolerated no press , no democracy , if you rebel against him he wont kill you? tell that to the hundreds of political refugee around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah he did play geopolitics when he was young  but he gave up a long time ago , and was shaking hands with the same enemy he did fought  .
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying that Libya invasion is illegal is one thing but making those dictators like saddam or gheddafi martyrs or fallen heroes is just some bull shit .

       I would make a martyr of no man.  But it is a simple fact, that Quadafy had MANY supporters, not merely societal elites, but poor villagers and common citizens.  In his latter days he was a respected statesman, who, as you say, shook hands with men whom he had fought.
      </p>

       This does not paint the picture of a joke, but more of an actually mature man.  A saint?  Obviously not.  A sinner?  Of a certainty.

       The African leaders that were backing them , he was paying them , the African league was financed mostly by one country Libya .

      <p>
       Libya stayed at the tribe level "thanx to him" they had no institution , he was the state , and you know Arabs tribes don't refer to logic to debate , either he's from your family and you support him or you fight  him .
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you ever listen to one his speeches?  he doesn't make any sense most of the time .  He was an incompetent fool , did you ever heard about something made in Libya ? some scientist that was from Libya?  i mean anything not related to gheddafi ?  there is almost none .  Iran is run in a good way , Iraq was run in a good way in the time of Saddam Hussein before 91 , but Libya was a  joke .

       I think quite a lot of nations are guilty of funding insurgency, terrorist groups, and funding wars across Africa. Nefarious foreign policy is not unique to Gaddafi, nor was he even one of the worst offenders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some examples (to name but a few): In the 1980's the USA funded the Contras in Nicaragua; in the 1920's the UK armed Druze insurgents in Syria; and every major power played a role in the Angolan civil war. Look at France planning to send artillery to the current Syrian rebels, if that's not aiding insurgency and violating sovereignty I don't know what is.

       You're right about the profit motive though.
