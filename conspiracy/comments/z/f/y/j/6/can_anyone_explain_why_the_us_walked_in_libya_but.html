Why is it that people underestimate other nations. How do you really know what the Russians do and don&#39;t have. Someone, somewhere &quot;gathered&quot; intelligence from the Russians and we must assume that that&#39;s all the power they have. Better to overestimate your enemy than be unprepared when the time comes.</p>

<p>If Russia suffers an attack by a US aircraft carrier, you can expect them to retaliate.  They don&#39;t need a carrier to do so.  By limiting yourself to counting carriers on your 12 fingers, you are proving your idiocy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia doesn&#39;t really need to project power with an aircraft carrier in order to retaliate against a US strike.  They can do it with Sunburn missiles, conventional or nuclear ballistic missiles, etc.  They can launch attacks from the air with their White Swan aircraft or with Bears (both of which are insanely long range).  Aircraft carriers are mostly useful for bombing the crap out of some brown people and controlling airspace during a land invasion.  They suit the US doctrine well, but Russians operate on a totally different operational plan than the US and NATO do.  They are also not nearly as exposed as the USA, so they don&#39;t really need to be able to take a floating airbase around the world on misadventures.</p>

<p>If the USA were to attack Russia with aircraft carriers, Russia would simply sink them one way or another.  They have the capability to do this.  Heck, they sell missiles against which there is no credible defense to anybody with the cash.  A couple of Sunburns fired in a salvo would overwhelm any Aegis system, and any one of them would cause a fatal wound to a carrier.  Or perhaps a supercavitating torpedo?</p>

<p>It&#39;s clear that you don&#39;t understand that we won&#39;t attack Russia because they have credible deterrence capabilities.  Naval power is useful when you want to bomb the shit out of people living in an undeveloped country.  It would be totally useless against Russia with the notable exception of submarines.  And, guess what, the Russians have always made much better submarines than we have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you retarded?  The only way the US would ever attack Russian forces is if they used force against NATO in Syria.  This is the scenario you seem to think is likely, I&#39;m saying there there is absolutely no way Russia would risk an outright war with the US over Syria.  The regime there is almost certainly going to fall just under rebel pressure and do you really see Moscow deploying tanks to prop up Assad?  I&#39;ll tell you a secret, they tried that in Afghanistan and it didn&#39;t work out well for them.</p>

<p>Once ICBM&#39;s start being prepped the game is over.  The US nuclear and conventional arsenals are both larger and once fueling of solid rockets began en masse you would start seeing Russian boomers (most of which are 40+ years old) sinking.  Seriously, just look at wikipedia man, there is no match on either the nuclear or conventional fronts.  We spend more than all other nations combined on our military.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not retarded you dirty shill.  Clearly you&#39;re retarded because you&#39;re sitting around counting carriers when they have no relevance to a discussion about the relative toughness of the US and Russia.</p>

<p>I&#39;m undoubtedly more qualified than you are to speak on military matters.  Your commentary so far has been just the opposite of insightful.  Measuring military might in dollars spent is also more proof of your status as a mental midget.  When Russia and China maintain state owned military industries, they can naturally get by on much less money.  I would estimate that 1/1000th the cash would be sufficient for running a state-owned military company compared with a for-profit money waster like Boeing or any of our major companies.</p>

<p>Our advanced technology drone / mounted infantry war in Afghanistan is going just as badly as the Russian one in the 1980s, and the irony there is that they Afghans do not even have access to the kinds of support they did when we were supplying them.</p>

<p>In Syria the rebels have been exposed for what they are - foreign militants who have been playing a dirty war, committing atrocities and blaming it on the government forces, faking news reports with the homosexual boy lover Anderson Cooper among others, using snipers to indiscriminately fire upon crowds of civilian protestors who are both pro and anti Assad, and so forth.</p>

<p>Who exposed them?  Your blowhard buddy Alex Jones or Mr. Lizard-people David Icke?  Oh...let me guess, you are not a fan of either....almost the same with me and Anderson Cooper.  Not sure about the homosexual comment, that is a bit Freudian though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol...wat?  The only effective AA system they have was given to them by Russia (S-300) and they only have 8 launchers.  The US currently has 19 operational B-2 stealth bombers plus a large and secret drone fleet, this is the kind of math you can do with crayons.  S-200&#39;s pose no real threat to modern fighter jets and the rebels are capturing or destroying them like crazy in Syria.</p>

<p>Syria&#39;s terrain and the lack of a unified resistance on the ground play a much bigger role.  In Libya they had the TNC who was ready to take over functions of government as areas fell (not saying they did it well, but it was a plan none the less).  Syria simply does not have this, the SNC is largely controlled by the Muslim Brotherhood and is plagued with infighting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL, I had to google that one, never been called that.  Israel stands to lose the most in a new &quot;free Syria&quot;.  Believe it or not, dealing with a dictator is a hell of a lot easier than dealing with a democracy.  While Bashar did supply Hezbollah, the spectre of his chemical weapons calling into the hands of more or less stateless jihadist is pretty much the worst case scenario for them.</p>

<p>Which of course makes this whole situation here on r/cons laughable.  You guys are citing Syrian and Russian government propaganda blaming a country who&#39;s interest would be harmed by aiding the rebels.  These are the little reminders I get that many here are not playing with a full deck when it comes to foreign policy.

    <div class="md"><p>Research the situation, the Syrian military is on it&#39;s last leg.  Rebels are controlling entire cities in the north and they are attacking every supply convoy on the highways.  The Syrian Air Force is so desperate for bombs  that they are dropping 55 gallon oil drums filled with either TNT or just random metal objects.  Add to that the fact that the Rebels in both the North and Central part of the country are showing off newly captured SA-7 Grail surface to air missiles and you have a royal shitstorm brewing.</p>

<p>At this point the US could move the equipment into place to utterly destroy the Syrian military in under a week.  Remember, a single American aircraft carrier has more firepower than ALL of the Iranian air force combined.  Syria&#39;s air force is smaller, older and will only get more unreliable as this conflict goes on.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Grossly oversimplified.  Did he kill people within his geographic borders?  Unarguably, he did.  Were they HIS people?  This gets a little more definitional.</p>

<p>Did he play geopolitics with the big boys?  I&#39;d say he did the best he could with the tools he had.  Did he win?  It does not appear so.</p>

<p>Conflating this with other non-parallel issues is unconstructive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think quite a lot of nations are guilty of funding insurgency, terrorist groups, and funding wars across Africa. Nefarious foreign policy is not unique to Gaddafi, nor was he even one of the worst offenders.</p>

<p>Some examples (to name but a few): In the 1980&#39;s the USA funded the Contras in Nicaragua; in the 1920&#39;s the UK armed Druze insurgents in Syria; and every major power played a role in the Angolan civil war. Look at France planning to send artillery to the current Syrian rebels, if that&#39;s not aiding insurgency and violating sovereignty I don&#39;t know what is.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right about the profit motive though.</p>
