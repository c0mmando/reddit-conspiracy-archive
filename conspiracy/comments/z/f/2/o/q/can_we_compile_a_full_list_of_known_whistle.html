<p>I would like to expand this list with detailed information about each person and their experiences that day. I am also very intersted in people that had appointments at the WTC that morning that missed their appointments, mostly related to fraud cases and financial misdoings. According to Micheal Jackson&#39;s brother, Micheal missed an appointment there on 9/11. I want to build something wonderful with your help. Let&#39;s make this a tribute that they won&#39;t soon forget.</p>

<li><strong>Barry Jennings:</strong> Former New York Housing Authority Emergency Coordinator – reported that he and Michael Hess had been blown back by an explosion inside Building 7.

Shortly after appearing in a BBC documentary, On August 19th 2008, two days before the release of the NIST Final Report on the collapse of WTC 7, Jennings was found dead in his home with three bullet entrance wounds in the back of his head. The death was ruled a suicide. </li>

    <div class="md"><p>AFAIK, the exact circumstances of his death have never been publicly revealed.</p>

<p>Apparently Dylan Avery (the director of Loose Change) hired a private investigator to look into it, but without success: the Investigator referred the case to the police, refunded his fee to Dylan, and told him never to contact him again.</p>

<p>However, we only have <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1dl0mC8Omo&amp;amp;t=24m30s">Dylan Avery&#39;s account</a> to go on, so it&#39;s difficult to know what to make of it. I&#39;ve never seen any corroborating evidence of what actually happened either with Jennings, or the investigator.</p>

<p>I&#39;m surprised that no progress appears to have been made on this case for a number of years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Framed in a certain light, that would seem suspicious.</p>

<p>I have an alternative theory. The investigator had no idea who Dylan Avery or Barry Jennings were.</p>

<p>He googles it. See all the conspiracy nonsense, and decided not to harass a grieving family. Refunds money. Reports Dylan to the police. And tell him not to contact him again.</p>

<p>I know. I know. My scenario is far fetched knowing the fame and fortune Dylan has achieved that someone might not have heard of him before accepting...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) You are in conspiracy, if you are looking for an NYTimes expose you won&#39;t find it.  That point was speculation, but <em>clearly there is foul play</em> involved when details of his death are not public.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You say it is a mystery, he said is was a suicide. Which is it? That is why I was asking for a source as he clearly seems to have details of a suicide and three bullets.</p>

<p>There is another scenario that you aren&#39;t considering, that conspiracy theorists tortured this man in their desperate attempt to prove something he didn&#39;t agree with. So maybe the family wants privacy to keep you truth seekers away. I think you should also consider that possibility and I find that FAR more likely then foul play. I think the website you linked is clear evidence of this theory.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s score it:</p>

<p>Conspiracy Theroists harassing as evidenced by the very website you linked <strong>1</strong></p>

<p>Evidence of foul play <strong>0</strong></p>

<p>The firefighters knew it was likely to collapse because they saw the damage first hand and decided not to save the building. You say foresight, I say saw the evidence of a badly damaged building and fire not being suppressed in any way. A prediction from evidence isn&#39;t foresight. <a href="http://imgur.com/nLOV1">And you mean the news got facts wrong? That never happens.</a></p>

<p>Caffeine. Here I thought these ice tea drinks I have been buying didn&#39;t have any caffeine in them. I recently found out I was wrong. I drink way to many of the damned things.</p>

<p>Trying to hamper them? By giving them evidence that contradicts claims from people seeking the &quot;truth&quot;? Truth comes from all the evidence, not just the evidence that support your worldview.</p>

<p>I welcome any evidence that you have that contradicts my claims.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have any evidence of Barry&#39;s death, but the original poster still has up there that he was shot three times into the back of the head and it was a suicide. So I was questioning his sources on that.</p>

<p>My grandmother died a year ago. How come there wasn&#39;t an investigation?</p>

<p>Local police and the family members don&#39;t need an investigation. It is their choice not to play your silly game. </p>

<p>Why would the family want privacy? Let&#39;s start with the website you linked. I think that is a good reason to want privacy. Do you think it is fair to use his name to support something he doesn&#39;t want to be connected with? When does it turn into harassment? How many truthers do you think called up his work? How many truthers do you think called his home? </p>

<p>I think that is a damn good reason to want privacy. They very website you linked.</p>

<p>Privacy? Maybe they don&#39;t want to end up like Jennings.  The fact remains, he admitted seeing &amp; witnessing MANY events that are not explained by the official account, and he ends up dead.  </p>

<p>Was Suzanne Jovin -- like the heroic beauty in the new television show &quot;Alias,&quot; -- recruited to be a spy early on in her Yale career? Was Van de Velde her controller, or just a very unlucky fellow, who got tarred and feathered for being her thesis advisor and who has been personally ruined by both the egg-sucking weasels of the Connecticut press and by Yale&#39;s leadership?</p>

<p>Suzanne Jovin was precisely the kind of bright, clever, and multi-lingual operative that any intelligence agency might want to have on its rolls. Who, then, recruited her? Was she working for some group -- kind of like the fictional SD-6 on &quot;Alias&quot; -- that was a renegade group and no longer loyal to the U.S.?</p>

<p>What other reason is there to kill a bright young woman, in the peak of her academic career, if she was not -- even just accidentally -- getting too close to the truth about Osama bin Laden, whatever that really, really is!?! Every murder brings with the possibility of discovery. Murder in the spy business is entirely too common to be remarkable, but it is always risky. </p>

<p>It&#39;s because she was basically like Jennifer Garner on Alias, because, hey wouldn&#39;t that be cool?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s actually one of the more interesting aspects of this story.  Their own stories are somewhat inconsistent, and there are no avowed witnesses to the act.  The only witness present, was listening over a phone.  And her depiction of events did develop over time.</p>

<p>Gunshots were reported, but his son later avowed this was a salute.  He was also allowed unsupervised access to the body after the police arrived.</p>

<p>The firearm involved appeared not to have operated correctly.</p>

<p>That having been said, it is entirely feasible that the death certificate is correct.  That that suicide note was genuine.  That everything happened just as it&#39;s described on paper.</p>

<p>But feasibility isn&#39;t always truth, is it?</p>

<p>A sample of what he reported.  </p>

<p>&quot;When they finally got to us, and they took us down to what they called the lobby, because when I asked them, I said &quot;Where are we?&quot; He said, &quot;This was the lobby.&quot; And I said, &quot;You got to be kidding me.&quot; Total ruins. Keep in mind, when I came in there, the lobby had nice escalators--it was a huge lobby. And for me to see what I saw was unbelievable.&quot;  </p>

<p>...&quot;I know what I heard I heard explosions,” said Jennings,&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And the firefighter who took us down kept saying, &quot;Do not look down.&quot; I kept saying, &quot;Why?&quot; We were stepping over people. And you know when you can feel when you are stepping over people.&quot;  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You say it is a mystery, he said is was a suicide. Which is it? That is why I was asking for a source as he clearly seems to have details of a suicide and three bullets.</p>

<p>There is another scenario that you aren&#39;t considering, that conspiracy theorists tortured this man in their desperate attempt to prove something he didn&#39;t agree with. So maybe the family wants privacy to keep you truth seekers away. I think you should also consider that possibility and I find that FAR more likely then foul play. I think the website you linked is clear evidence of this theory.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s score it:</p>

<p>Conspiracy Theroists harassing as evidenced by the very website you linked <strong>1</strong></p>

<p>Evidence of foul play <strong>0</strong></p>

<p>The firefighters knew it was likely to collapse because they saw the damage first hand and decided not to save the building. You say foresight, I say saw the evidence of a badly damaged building and fire not being suppressed in any way. A prediction from evidence isn&#39;t foresight. <a href="http://imgur.com/nLOV1">And you mean the news got facts wrong? That never happens.</a></p>

<p>Caffeine. Here I thought these ice tea drinks I have been buying didn&#39;t have any caffeine in them. I recently found out I was wrong. I drink way to many of the damned things.</p>

<p>Trying to hamper them? By giving them evidence that contradicts claims from people seeking the &quot;truth&quot;? Truth comes from all the evidence, not just the evidence that support your worldview.</p>

<p>I welcome any evidence that you have that contradicts my claims.</p>
