        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In the past weeks we have seen the U.S back away from Israel and it&#39;s position of preemptive war against Iran over its&#39; nuclear program, with rebuff&#39;s from both Secretary Clinton, President Obama, and General Dempsy. A Meeting with Netanyahu over the crisis with Iran in Israel occured in which General Dempsey is reported to have further expressed America&#39;s unwillingness to go to war with Iran over it&#39;s nuclear program, which U.S intelligence indicates is at nowhere near the stage of sophistication it would need to be at to make a weapon. Days later his plane is destroyed by rocket fire in the heart of America&#39;s most secure air force base in Afghanistan moments after his departure from the aircraft.The assailants evade security forces in the highly guarded area.</p>

<p>Days Later a video appears on the internet, known as &quot;the Innocence of Muslims&quot; in which an anonymous director hired an unwitting crew of actors and production artists in LA to create a film that through overdubbing and editing, was turned from a desert action/adventure into a slanderous 13 minute long video with little other clear plot or motive in it&#39;s creation other than to insult Islam, Muhammad, and Muslims, thus predictably provoking violence and protests in the volatile region in the uncertain aftermath of the Arab spring. Protests erupt in Cairo where the epicenter of the outrage began on Islamic television program&#39;s after the &quot;finding&quot; of the video and soon after the attack on the embassy occur&#39;s in Benghazi.</p>

<p>Libyan eye witnesses attest to their being no initial protests at the Consulate at all but rather several vehicles arriving simultaneously and immediately attacking the Consulate with rpgs and gun fire, setting the building ablaze and in the process killing 4 American&#39;s and Several Libyan security personnel. One of the dead was American Ambassador Chris Stevens, a central point man for Americas effort to aid in the Arab Spring&#39;s push for democracy in the region and the liberation of Libya. Stevens was also an advocate for diplomacy with Iran and is noted to have wanted to be the first American ambassador to return to Iran if relationship&#39;s normalized, which has been a stated long term goal of Obama&#39;s outreach for a peaceful and diplomatic solution to Iran&#39;s status with both it&#39;s nuclear program and it&#39;s station in the world community regarding Israeli and America&#39;s interests.</p>

<p>Steven&#39;s assassination and the attempted assassination on General Dempsey, as well as the strange and murky origin&#39;s being revealed about the offending video, outline a plot seemingly coming from Israel&#39;s intelligence community to utilize violent and antagonistic tactics towards American officials&#39; security, as well as planted propaganda in the middle east to create a environment of mutual hostility between western and middle eastern ideologies in which war will become more palatable to the American people, as well as replicating the Iranian Embassy crisis that undid the progressive Carter administration in order to similarly seek to undo the progressive and tempered Obama administration&#39;s second term, thus increasing the probability that the impending conflict with Iran would turn to war rather than end in diplomacy.</p>

<p>The timing of this attack on September 11th is not coincidental and was done to evoke a specific response from  the American people as it was the first major terror related event to occur on this date since the initial attacks in 2001, further likening the probability that the public would react with anti- Islamic and anti middle eastern sentiment in a time period where Israel&#39;s Prime Minister has been openly challenging America and Obama over the willingness to go to war with Iran by invoking vision&#39;s of nuclear armed Islamic radicals. All the While Mitt Romney, republican presidential candidate begins lambasting Obama for only having one war going on at a speech in Virginia, as well as beginning a espouse hard line views on American willingness to go to war in the region. Spread the word we can&#39;t let them do this again</p>

<p>Edit: Sorry for the wall of text, it was just sort of a stream of consciousness thing when I first wrote it, I honestly expected it to get buried.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. And you saw how well that worked here on reddit after reading the comments on the front page submission after the whole thing happened. It&#39;s ironic, redditors are <em>mostly</em> intelligent and open-minded people, yet they still can&#39;t see through the propaganda. The antitheist (not necessarily the atheist) portion of the demographic lapped up the official story because it reinforces their circle-jerk mentality. I&#39;ll never understand how people can get such a kick out of atheism as an atheist myself. I don&#39;t need to discuss and reaffirm my belief that 2+2=4 every day, yet the atheism sub is default and is constantly on the front page. These people need to get a grip and move on with their lives. There&#39;s also irony in the fact that most atheists will proudly proclaim religion is a tool of control and boast of how they have beaten it, yet they never question the media, their party, or the asinine policies set forth by both parties. It really does upset me when atheists on that sub get up enough courage to openly insult and belittle people who hold religious beliefs. Just one more way our society encourages infighting and division. We have more important things to do than pick fights with each other. Grow up people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest, r/atheism makes me sick.  It seems they have nothing to talk about, so they just bash other people&#39;s beliefs all day everyday.  They make Atheism look like a godless cult of hate.  I thought atheists were supposed to transcend this pattern of behavior, but they fell into the same intolerance as the religions that they so misunderstand. </p>

<p>Just another divide and conquer tactic.</p>

<p>I grew up in the buckle of the Bible belt and let me tell you that the suffering I endured at the hands of the &quot;holy&quot; filled me with enough rage to power a city for a week. Forgive r/Atheism for their attitude. Jesus, in his divinity, forgave. Look within in yourself and find why you are offended.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know that number, but from the writings of the guys at the time we clearly see that some big names among them would be categorized as &quot;batshit insane religious nutjobs&quot; today. Take Newton, for instance, who revolutionized all science with the laws of movement and gravitation but on the other hand calculated the date of the end of the world using a Bible code; or Huygens, who made noticeable advancements in Astronomy but wrote a whole book, the <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/5563343/COSMOTHEOROSCHRISTIAAN-HUYGENS">Cosmotheoros</a>, arguing that alien life <em>had</em> to exist because of the Divine Providence.</p>

<p>Or perhaps that is just because they had a lot of shoulders of giants to climb over and see far way. Giants that, unfortunately for current science ideology, were religious freaks.</p>

<p>&quot;In the past weeks we have seen the U.S back away from Israel and it&#39;s position of preemptive war against Iran over its&#39; nuclear program, with rebuff&#39;s from both Secretary Clinton, President Obama, and General Dempsy. A Meeting with Netanyahu over the crisis with Iran in Israel occured in which General Dempsey is reported to have further expressed America&#39;s unwillingness to go to war with Iran over it&#39;s nuclear program, which U.S intelligence indicates is at nowhere near the stage of sophistication it would need to be at to make a weapon. Days later his plane is destroyed by rocket fire in the heart of America&#39;s most secure air force base in Afghanistan moments after his departure from the aircraft.The assailants evade security forces in the highly guarded area.</p>

<p>Days Later a video appears on the internet, known as &quot;the Innocence of Muslims&quot; in which an anonymous director hired an unwitting crew of actors and production artists in LA to create a film that through overdubbing and editing, was turned from a desert action/adventure into a slanderous 13 minute long video with little other clear plot or motive in it&#39;s creation other than to insult Islam, Muhammad, and Muslims, thus predictably provoking violence and protests in the volatile region in the uncertain aftermath of the Arab spring. Protests erupt in Cairo where the epicenter of the outrage began on Islamic television program&#39;s after the &quot;finding&quot; of the video and soon after the attack on the embassy occur&#39;s in Benghazi.</p>

<p>Libyan eye witnesses attest to their being no initial protests at the Consulate at all but rather several vehicles arriving simultaneously and immediately attacking the Consulate with rpgs and gun fire, setting the building ablaze and in the process killing 4 American&#39;s and Several Libyan security personnel. One of the dead was American Ambassador Chris Stevens, a central point man for Americas effort to aid in the Arab Spring&#39;s push for democracy in the region and the liberation of Libya. Stevens was also an advocate for diplomacy with Iran and is noted to have wanted to be the first American ambassador to return to Iran if relationship&#39;s normalized, which has been a stated long term goal of Obama&#39;s outreach for a peaceful and diplomatic solution to Iran&#39;s status with both it&#39;s nuclear program and it&#39;s station in the world community regarding Israeli and America&#39;s interests. Steven&#39;s assassination and the attempted assassination on General Dempsey, as well as the strange and murky origin&#39;s being revealed about the offending video, outline a plot seemingly coming from Israel&#39;s intelligence community to utilize violent and antagonistic tactics towards American officials&#39; security, as well as planted propaganda in the middle east to  create a environment of mutual hostility between western and middle eastern ideologies in which war will become more palatable to the American people, as well as replicating the Iranian Embassy crisis that undid  the progressive Carter administration in order to similarly seek to undo the progressive and tempered Obama administration&#39;s second term, thus increasing the probability that the  impending conflict with Iran would turn to war rather than end in diplomacy.</p>

<p>The timing of this attack on September 11th is not coincidental and was done to evoke a specific response from the American people as it was the first major terror related event to occur on this date since the initial attacks in 2001, further likening the probability that the public would react with anti- Islamic and anti middle eastern sentiment in a time period where Israel&#39;s Prime Minister has been openly challenging America and Obama over the willingness to go to war with Iran by invoking vision&#39;s of nuclear armed Islamic radicals. All the While Mitt Romney, republican presidential candidate begins lambasting Obama for only having one war going on at a speech in Virginia, as well as beginning a espouse hard line views on American willingness to go to war in the region.

    <div class="md"><p>A slow and patient build up of power occurred throughout the 20th century that all but guaranteed Israel&#39;s dominance in the world. Now that the internet threatens to undo all the secrecy, fear, hate, and divisiveness that empires thrive on, the apocalyptic death cults feel immense pressure to carry out their plans immediately -- before a great awakening threatens their designs. So now, it&#39;s a foot race between the bloodthirsty and the peaceful. </p>

<p>Fuck... I can&#39;t believe this rubbish is actually occurring in 2012. I thought the powers that be would do everything to avoid as much as a knife fight this year... just to keep the new-age Mayan calendar nuts from gaining credence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, its not a coincidence.</p>

<p>Obama is the first president in a long time that does not bend to Israel&#39;s <em>every</em> whim. But he bends to many, many of them--simply because he has to. He has no choice.</p>

<p>Considering Romney has <em>already promised</em> his uber-rich Israeli donors &quot;their war&quot; if he is elected...well, you can see how Obama is being sabotaged.</p>

<p>The Zionist Death Cult, like a tick, is going to keep its fangs dug into America until there is no blood left to suck. Once they have no interest in lobbying the hell out of America&#39;s political and monetary system--well, <em>then</em> its time to worry!</p>

<p>I am very happy that you are awake and seeing first-hand what the Zionist Death Cult is doing to America. Now let&#39;s hope the other few hundred million can get as informed as you already are!</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t matter though. I am voting this election based on one criteria: <em>who will bend to Israel&#39;s every whim?</em></p>

<p>Romney--Bought and paid for by Sheldon Adelson and Israelis to the tune of $100 million...at least.</p>

<p>Obama--Still owned by AIPAC, but not afraid to say no to Nuttyahoo. Not soliciting campaign contributions from Israel.</p>

<p>Looks like I&#39;ll be voting for Obama again...not like it matters.</p>
