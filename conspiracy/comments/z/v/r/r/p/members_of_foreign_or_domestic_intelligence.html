       Israel and our govt(US) have programs in place so its not surprising  to see one from the federal reserve or anyone with enough money to hire a PR firm. If you look at the facebook page of almost any business almost 25% of the likes are from employees. Social media is just  one more avenue for propaganda and advertising.

       True many likes on facebook are either employees or people that dont like the company the reason they like them is zo that they can post on the wall.....source my friend works for a data mining company that searches all platforms of social media....also i believe it is called cointel pro or something its a document that describes the ideas and ways to influence a forum or site....they use different tactics to help either to switch focus from the subject or to produce disinformation or be supportive of certain ideas to help influence the thought process of the forum visitors

       Well from her the like on a companies facebook page are actually ignored because of that and a few more reasons they dont look at those numbers as a solid source and a majority of the time they are just ignored

       I don't know if I can agree with "they are just ignored"... Tweet counts and Facebook Likes are thrown around in the media, usually to
       <del>
        segway lol
       </del>
       segue to a topic
       <em>
        or
       </em>
       use as backup 'fact' to a statement about popularity.  The Likes have more cultural sway than financial, which in turn becomes a powerful financial tool in of itself.

       They gather the information, but in the reports that they run they are not used as accurate data do to the fact that people "Like" them so that they can post on the walls of those company pages... However many of those people tend to bash on the company...So they do not use it as a benchmark to show a positive correlation is what I was getting at.

       100%, pretty easy to spot too. I just wish people would stop giving them what they want, attention &amp; distracting discussion. Down-vote, ignore, report and move on.

       It's just the whole view on his account. The comments, the threads (95% in
       <a href="/r/conspiratards">
        /r/conspiratards

       ). I could see a "David Star" next to his user name before, now I can't... I don't know about that.

      <p>
       His comments are always pro-Israel. It's not a conspiracy to be pro-Israle. It is just weird, if you engage only in a debate to bash anti-Israelism and Liberalism. His threads are just pointing out his main subject: Jews.

       reddits custom coding is very tricky, I loose the sub-reddit format on various pages every now and then on my computer at work (I balme IE 9 personally). If you understand the whole

       meme, we (I post there sometimes!) like to play a lot of the whole "jews/reptiles control everything" trope that is prevelant on conspiracy theory blogs, it drives more serious bigots
       <em>

       He bashes anti-Israelism a lot(also evidently talks about magic the gathering, US case law, and biology a lot too, kind of strange to get a retrospective summary of a user's comments) but this is only proof of being non anti-Israeli or pro-Israeli, you'll find out in life, people often have different opinions and perspectives than your own. They are all not paid to express their opinion.

       Yes, I believe Ben Bernanke did a wonderful job dealing with the recession, even as our Republican congress works on a daily basis to fuck everything up as hard as it can.  If Obama had gotten his stimulus (not the one 1/10th the size of what he asked for) we'd be out of this mess.  But, as I've said elsewhere, there's no point in arguing, as this community is full of people who think (and openly say) that anyone who disagrees with the anti-Obama hyper-Libertarian narrative is a government shill.  Enjoy your witch-hunt!

       Nowhere NEAR 95 percent of my comments are in conspiratard (oh, look, people in r/conspiracy exaggerating!  That's new!), and I frequently discuss many other subjects, as those_draculas pointed out.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one pays me a single cent to speak on the internet.  Yes, there are people who are paid to serve as propagandists, but you guys need to get through your head that not everyone has the same exact narrative you do, because different people trust different sources of information.  Me? I prefer not to get all my info from blogs with names like "Judeofascism" and russiatoday, so I can see why that might make me seem like a PRO ISRAEL ZEALOT!!!!1one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Except I'm not.  If you've actually read my comments, you'd find dozens of condemnations of the state of Israel, and a statement that the damn thing certainly shouldn't exist where it does.  That said, any time I point out, for example, that Israelis are being shelled with rockets on a daily basis and that retaliating against people who commit acts of terrorism while using civilians as human shields (I.E. Hamas) I'm called all sorts of awful names, because r/conspiracy isn't about truth, and it isn't about free expression, it's about propping up an ALTERNATIVE narrative in exactly the same way that neo-cons prop up the ISRAEL GOOD PALESTINIANS EVIL narrative - by dismissing dissenters as evil.  You're really not that different from them.  I'm just the middleman, pointing out the hypocrisy I encounter here (and on places like r/nolibswatch, which invaded this thread to pat you on the back for feeding their insane paranoia).
      </p>
      <p>
       &lt;I could see a "David Star" next to his user name before, now I can't... I don't know about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll enlighten you: my flair on r/conspiratard is a Star of David with "Mossad" in big letters.  It's Ironic.  Because whenever I point out that someone in r/conspiracy is practically quoting Mein Kampf, I ACTUALLY get accused of being a Mossad agent...because this is a community populated by, surprise, paranoid nutjobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it so hard to believe that someone can have an idea without being paid to?  You, Soigroeg, for example, like to post in Seddit, a forum dedicated to treating women like gazelles in need of hunting on a good day, and objects to be acquired on a bad one.  You don't see me accusing you of being "paid" to promote a chauvinist ideology; I'm quite sure you do it because you believe it.  Then again, I'm not fucking crazy person, and don't assume that people who disagree with me are conspiring against me.

       I bash Libertarianism because it's generally based on economic falsehoods and contradictions.  I bash "anti-Israelism" because so often on r/conspiracy, "anti-Israelism" is just an excuse to bash Jews for existing.  This place REALLY looks like stormfront an awful lot of the time.

      <p>
       My "main subject" is not Jews, but the main subject of what I post on r/conspiratard has frequently been Jews.  Do you know why?
       <strong>
        Because r/conspiracy spends an awful lot of time looking like fucking Stormfront
       </strong>
       .  If people like tttt0tttt and bumblingmumbling - who aren't "anti-Israel", but actually just plain hate Jews and want to spread that hatred - weren't treated like paragons of honesty and bravery instead of the neo-Nazis they are, then maybe I wouldn't have to post so much about Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's always interesting how Neo-Nazis accuse their detractors of spending too much time talking about Jews when they're the ones who steered the conversation there in the first place.  If r/conspiracy's anti-Israel posts didn't degenerate into JEWS ARE EVIL AND RULE THE WORLD AND SHOULD BE EXTERMINATED, I'd never have said a damn thing in the first place.  But they do, because you're surrounded by literal Nazis, and you don't even realize it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But so what if I post Jewish issues at times?  I'm Jewish, and if these people get their way, I'm going to find myself in the camps with the rest of them, despite the fact that I'm an atheist, don't ACTUALLY support Israel, and haven't set foot in a synagogue since I was like, 17.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, this entire thread is one large circle-jerk of congratulations for exposing a "shill" without a shred of evidence - literally, NOTHING that any sane person would consider evidence - that I'm anything but a guy who thinks you folks are batshit stupid.

       Bonus Fact: Did you knew, that prior to the gathering and deportation of the jews to the camps the German government had passed a gun-law, that strictly forbid weapons in the population.

       I could care less about the anti-Israel stream outside of the fact that it so often turns into an anti-Jew one.  I've seen people on this subreddit literally call for a second holocaust to "wipe out" the Jews because of Israel (no1113), and half a dozen others express direct agreement and admiration for Adolf Hitler.  These are people who are active in this community, and frequently they get upvoted until someone puts their posts on subredditdrama or something and they get downvoted (something I've done once or twice, but only with the intention of showing people what some here believe).

       And I even understand where this is coming from.  Jews ARE disproportionally represented in the financial sector, and do have a disproportionate amount of political power.  The so-called "Israel-Firsters" exist, and hearing them speak makes me think they're just as deluded as the Neo-Nazis, and the two ideologies feed into each other in a bad way.

       A fair point, and one I sometimes forget.  I generally have a pattern-driven view of history rather than a conspiratorial one, so that explains a bit of my distaste for what I read here.  Honestly, I'm more amazed by the hypocrisy than the racism; so many people accept alternative narratives with next to no evidence simply because they like them better.

       At the end of the day, all I'm dealing with are some jerks on the internet.  No one's throwing me into camps, or rounding Jews up.  But that doesn't mean the idea isn't chilling, and that I won't fight it where I encounter it.

       Probably because you, like the rest of this subreddit, has a "IF YOU AIN'T WITH US YOU'RE AGAINST US" mentality.  I stood up to crazy bigots like bumblingmumbling, who literally spouts Nazi propaganda, and that makes me a "Zionist".
      </p>
      <p>
       Even when I've explicitly denied supporting Israel, even when I've said STRAIGHT UP that the state should never have been created in Palestine, that's still not enough to disqualify me as a "Zionist".
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the word doesn't really mean "supports Israel's status as a Jewish state" to you people.  It just means "Jew who interrupts our circle-jerk".  Whatever.  Carry on, Stormfront.

       Amazing how his/her interests are so varied, yet his/her opinions are exactly in line with the status quo in every respect. Also, for someone of such high intellect, why spend so much time trolling the very people he/she claims are so silly? It's almost like he/she is being paid to do it.

       It's not only the comments.

       It's just the whole view on his account. The comments, the threads (95% in
       <a href="/r/conspiratards">
        /r/conspiratards
       </a>
       ). I could see a "David Star" next to his user name before, now I can't... I don't know about that.

      <p>
       His comments are always pro-Israel. It's not a conspiracy to be pro-Israle. It is just weird, if you engage only in a debate to bash anti-Israelism and Liberalism. His threads are just pointing out his main subject: Jews.

       Wow.  This is the nicest response I've ever gotten.  Literally every time I explain where I'm coming from on these issues, people reinforce the argument, declaring I'm STILL a Zionist, no matter what I believe.

        I live in Germany and therefore I am well educated about the camps, and I even have seen them from the inside. Thus let me explain that I am not anti-jew. But neither am I pro-jew. I am just positively neutral to all races.

       This is basically the first time I've heard someone on r/conspiracy say they're not "anti-jew" and felt it was believable.  You should see the holocaust denial around here sometimes.

        But nevermind. I am sorry that you are confronted with this big Anti-Israel and Anti-Jew neverending stream and I therefore understand your motivation. From an outsiders point of view, your actions just really didn't make sense. Now they do.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I could care less about the anti-Israel stream outside of the fact that it so often turns into an anti-Jew one.  I've seen people on this subreddit literally call for a second holocaust to "wipe out" the Jews because of Israel (no1113), and half a dozen others express direct agreement and admiration for Adolf Hitler.  These are people who are active in this community, and frequently they get upvoted until someone puts their posts on subredditdrama or something and they get downvoted (something I've done once or twice, but only with the intention of showing people what some here believe).

      <blockquote>
       <p>

        <a href="/r/conspiracy">

        are based on a jew-centrical political view (Illuminati, Hollywood, Bilderberg &amp; Banksters a.s.o.) and therefore understand your strong opposition versus this subreddit.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And I even understand where this is coming from.  Jews ARE disproportionally represented in the financial sector, and do have a disproportionate amount of political power.  The so-called "Israel-Firsters" exist, and hearing them speak makes me think they're just as deluded as the Neo-Nazis, and the two ideologies feed into each other in a bad way.

        Remember by ridiculing the community as a whole, you are just drawing attention and hostility from not antisemtists.

      <p>
       A fair point, and one I sometimes forget.  I generally have a pattern-driven view of history rather than a conspiratorial one, so that explains a bit of my distaste for what I read here.  Honestly, I'm more amazed by the hypocrisy than the racism; so many people accept alternative narratives with next to no evidence simply because they like them better.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day, all I'm dealing with are some jerks on the internet.  No one's throwing me into camps, or rounding Jews up.  But that doesn't mean the idea isn't chilling, and that I won't fight it where I encounter it.
