<p>Barry Jennings: Former New York Housing Authority Emergency Coordinator – reported that he and Michael Hess had been blown back by an explosion inside Building 7. He said in an interview he heard explosions in WTC 7 before collapse. He also said he was stepping over bodies, which contradicted the government claim that nobody died in Building 7. Shortly after appearing in a BBC documentary, On August 19th 2008, two days before the release of the NIST Final Report on the collapse of WTC 7, Jennings was found dead in his home with three bullet entrance wounds in the back of his head. The death was ruled a suicide.</p>

<p>Apparently Dylan Avery (the director of Loose Change) hired a private investigator to look into it, but without success: the Investigator referred the case to the police, refunded his fee to Dylan, and told him never to contact him again.</p>

<p>Perhaps someone confused the death of Gary Webb, the author of Dark Alliance who supposedly shot himself twice in the back of the head.</p>
