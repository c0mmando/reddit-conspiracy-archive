       i have read that the church/elite actually know about what the leylines do and build their big cathedrals or other important structures on those points to gain some kind of higher power. Im not sure if thats true, it seems like the ancient cultures had all their major citys build on those linepoints aswell.
      </p>
      <p>
       if someone has an article, a video or just some general information on ley lines, pls share. I would like to read more about it, thx.

       I have found Ley Lines to be so interesting. For about a decade now I have enjoyed reading the trip diaries of men and women who have recently walked the Camino de Santiago, which is a Ley line that extends from France to Portugal.

       This is untrue. Considerable research has been done by multiple sources over the years that shows pyramids and ancient holy sites lay along such grids. In fact the pyramids of Giza are at the center of the Earth's energy grid. I would recommend watching the documentary/interview on this:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wd5AJvRUQ">
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wd5AJvRUQ
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I realize that anyone can draw lines between holy sites/pyramids and it could be meaningless, but there are too many coincidences for such lines to line up time and time again without some kind of significance. If you do some research into orgone energy/generators (if you check the link to the right of my username) you will understand why such ley lines are not only probable, if orgone energy really works it is a statistical guarantee such lines exist. And take it from me, orgone energy DOES exist, as I have personally bought generators and wear my pendant every day and can feel a huge difference in my energy levels from having such items around. Friends of mine that have also bought such devices and even random people all agree that orgone pendants/generators are legit.
      </p>
      <p>
       This Pdf is also relevant as it explains how pyramids work as orgone/scalar energy generators:

       Read an interview of Tesla and see his thoughts on energy and consciousness:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Further; I am trying to awake the energy contained in the air. There are the main sources of energy. What is considered as empty space is just a manifestation of matter that is not awakened. No empty space on this planet, nor in the Universe.. In black holes, what astronomers talk about, are the most powerful sources of energy and life.

       The reason observation changes outcomes in quantum mechanics is because particles need to be

        struck with light,
       </em>
       or
       <em>
        photons,

       in order to be observed. It's an entirely
       <em>
        physical

       phenomenon, it has

       This is untrue. I do not remember the exact number, but 99.9999% of the essence of an atom is empty space. Check out Nassim Harameins documentary "black whole" (yes it's spelled whole) to see evidence that the entire universe is tied together, blinking in and out of existence infinitely fast, and we are all...mathematically tied together.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the core of orgone generators are quartz crystals. Here is quote by Tesla on crystals:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In crystal we have a pure evidence of the existence of a formative life principle, and although in spite of everything we cannot understand the life of crystals - it is still a living being."
       </p>

      <p>
       I really REALLY despise godlikeproductions, but this forum post is relevant as it contains how consciousness works according to Tesla, in his own words:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Thus, everything that exists, organic or inorganic, animated or inert, is susceptible to stimulus from the outside.
        <em>
         There is no gap between, no break of continuity, no special and distinguishing vital agent.
        </em>
        The same law governs all matter, all the universe is alive.
       </p>

      <p>
       Essentially physical reality IS the manifestation of consciousness. They are tied together irrevocably.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another quote by tesla:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "We are all one. People are interconnected by invisible forces. Although we have the freedom to think and act, we stick together, like stars on the heavenly arc, with unbreakable connections.
        <em>
         These connections cannot be seen, but we can feel them."

       Do some research on Nikola Tesla and his concept of unlimited free energy from the ether around us, and get back to me about scientific proof. Tesla and his inventions should be all the scientific evidence/studies needed to substantiate such a claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I love how people always ask for peer reviewed studies as if that's the only thing that guarantees information to be accurate. Alternative scientific theories are rarely studied in universities, not because there is not science to back them up (again, Teslas unlimited free energy generator) but because funding is needed to do such studies, and government grants/funding is NEVER going to fund studies that may break the elite's control over the people. It is the same reason why Tesla never completed his unlimited energy generator that would beam energy for free all over the planet. Once the people that funded him realized it couldn't be metered, they dropped all funding from it.

       If you want a reputable source, I recommend Nikola Tesla himself. Read an interview of Tesla and see his thoughts on energy and consciousness:

       Apart from the fact that your reply literally had
       <strong>

       I have a great admiration for Tesla, and particularly liked what I learned about him
       <em>
        pre-internet
       </em>
       before all this wild exaggeration started. Also,
       <em>
        you're
       </em>
       talking bunk. And there's no such thing as ether either. I really hope you're not one of those "electric universe" clowns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tesla was very smart, but he's not as smart as everyone who's come after him. He was never going to get anywhere going in the direction he was following. The proof is in the fact that there's no working generator, no theoretical basis for thinking that such a generator would work, and the fact that with the colossal advancements we've made since Tesla's time reproducing anything he did would be trivial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you seriously think that any modern high-end scientist working in physics wouldn't be able to rustle up a free-energy generator (or the underlying mathematics) if if was so easy? Turn away from baseless credulity please.

       Tesla's concept of Unlimited Free energy worked off of the same concept. Of course, given the kind of trash Tesla invented, I must be a total moron to believe in the same concept. And seriously, it's not trash, I would say 90% of people that try my pendant on or hold the generators in their hands feel a difference. And im talking random people, not friends of mine, not new age hippies, just random people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recommend checking out David Sereda's research done on such pendants. They raise the body voltage of people simply by putting them on. Tesla himself said that everything around us is conscious (remember, the Tesla that invented much of the technology we have today, the guy on Einsteins level?) and all energy is communicating subconsciously. Seriously tttt, you have +112 karma from me, I am somewhat surprised you are so close minded on this stuff when you can easily see how the powers that be lie to you about virtually everything else in the world...why so close minded? It's not a matter of opinion that I "believe" in this stuff, I have seen it work firsthand. My energy levels have skyrocketed since wearing my pendant daily. It creates a physical difference from just wearing it for 15 minutes.

       The laws of the universe state that observation changes outcome. Simple quantum mechanics proves this. Placebo effect does exist for one (although they may not be able to say WHY it works, it does work) because observation changes outcome. In addition, the concept of orgone energy works with the same concepts that Nikola Tesla's free energy generator worked off of.

       Oh please, this whole "quantum mechanics means magic is real" thing is so old and tired. It's based on a severe misunderstanding of the whole concept which does in no way suggest that you can just will things into existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I can tell through the layers of quackery and pseudo-science, orgone energy is supposed to be some ethereal "life energy" involving bions, and has nothing to do with electricity. And even if it did, what the hell is gathing a tiny electrical charge in a pendant even supposed to do? You might as well lick a 9V battery, at least you can feel the result.

       Maybe orgone energy does exist but isn't what they think it is...... Tesla's radiant/cosmic energy collector does work. Take a piece of metal surrounded by an insulator connected by wireto a capacitor, connect the other connection of the capacitor to ground/earth (negatively charged). The insulated metal (orgone device) will collect positively charged particles. And your body is a capacitor.  I have made a simple tesla device and it will charge at a rate of about 1 volt per 2 hours. Then you ask well what can positively charged particles do for me. I would say research the subject of free radicles (electrons) in your body and the lose of electrons.

       First of all, Wil-Cock slips in a sentence or two here and there about the aliens existing and being real. That's the first tell. David also claims to know high ranking Illuminati / Freemasons just like Jordan Maxwell claimed. Maxwell was caught giving his secret handshake by the way.

       Don't listen to that guy, just another shill, or at the very least someone that still has some awakening to do.

       Check out the links I posted for you, especially the PDF about the pyramids, that is a great read for understanding the ether energy around us, and ley lines as well.

       The reason observation changes outcomes in quantum mechanics is because particles need to be
       <em>
        struck with light,
       </em>
       or
       <em>
        photons,
       </em>
       in order to be observed. It's an entirely
       <em>
        physical
       </em>
       phenomenon, it has
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       to do with consciousness.
