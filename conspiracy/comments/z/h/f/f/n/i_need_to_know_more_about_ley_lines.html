    <div class="md"><p>This is untrue. Considerable research has been done by multiple sources over the years that shows pyramids and ancient holy sites lay along such grids. In fact the pyramids of Giza are at the center of the Earth&#39;s energy grid. I would recommend watching the documentary/interview on this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wd5AJvRUQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wd5AJvRUQ</a></p>

<p>I realize that anyone can draw lines between holy sites/pyramids and it could be meaningless, but there are too many coincidences for such lines to line up time and time again without some kind of significance. If you do some research into orgone energy/generators (if you check the link to the right of my username) you will understand why such ley lines are not only probable, if orgone energy really works it is a statistical guarantee such lines exist. And take it from me, orgone energy DOES exist, as I have personally bought generators and wear my pendant every day and can feel a huge difference in my energy levels from having such items around. Friends of mine that have also bought such devices and even random people all agree that orgone pendants/generators are legit. </p>

<p>This Pdf is also relevant as it explains how pyramids work as orgone/scalar energy generators: <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/13029879/The-Secrets-of-the-Pyramids-Revealed">http://www.scribd.com/doc/13029879/The-Secrets-of-the-Pyramids-Revealed</a></p>

<p>This is untrue. I do not remember the exact number, but 99.9999% of the essence of an atom is empty space. Check out Nassim Harameins documentary &quot;black whole&quot; (yes it&#39;s spelled whole) to see evidence that the entire universe is tied together, blinking in and out of existence infinitely fast, and we are all...mathematically tied together. </p>

<p>At the core of orgone generators are quartz crystals. Here is quote by Tesla on crystals:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In crystal we have a pure evidence of the existence of a formative life principle, and although in spite of everything we cannot understand the life of crystals - it is still a living being.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I really REALLY despise godlikeproductions, but this forum post is relevant as it contains how consciousness works according to Tesla, in his own words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thus, everything that exists, organic or inorganic, animated or inert, is susceptible to stimulus from the outside. <em>There is no gap between, no break of continuity, no special and distinguishing vital agent.</em> The same law governs all matter, all the universe is alive. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message906035/pg1">http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message906035/pg1</a></p>

<p>Essentially physical reality IS the manifestation of consciousness. They are tied together irrevocably. </p>

<p>Another quote by tesla:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We are all one. People are interconnected by invisible forces. Although we have the freedom to think and act, we stick together, like stars on the heavenly arc, with unbreakable connections. <em>These connections cannot be seen, but we can feel them.&quot;</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do some research on Nikola Tesla and his concept of unlimited free energy from the ether around us, and get back to me about scientific proof. Tesla and his inventions should be all the scientific evidence/studies needed to substantiate such a claim.</p>

<p>EDIT: I love how people always ask for peer reviewed studies as if that&#39;s the only thing that guarantees information to be accurate. Alternative scientific theories are rarely studied in universities, not because there is not science to back them up (again, Teslas unlimited free energy generator) but because funding is needed to do such studies, and government grants/funding is NEVER going to fund studies that may break the elite&#39;s control over the people. It is the same reason why Tesla never completed his unlimited energy generator that would beam energy for free all over the planet. Once the people that funded him realized it couldn&#39;t be metered, they dropped all funding from it.</p>

<p>If you want a reputable source, I recommend Nikola Tesla himself. Read an interview of Tesla and see his thoughts on energy and consciousness: <a href="http://www.freedomtek.org/en/texts/nikola_tesla_interview_1899.php">http://www.freedomtek.org/en/texts/nikola_tesla_interview_1899.php</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apart from the fact that your reply literally had <strong>nothing</strong> to do with the topic being discussed, I will reply to it anyway.</p>

<p>I have a great admiration for Tesla, and particularly liked what I learned about him <em>pre-internet</em> before all this wild exaggeration started. Also, <em>you&#39;re</em> talking bunk. And there&#39;s no such thing as ether either. I really hope you&#39;re not one of those &quot;electric universe&quot; clowns.</p>

<p>Tesla was very smart, but he&#39;s not as smart as everyone who&#39;s come after him. He was never going to get anywhere going in the direction he was following. The proof is in the fact that there&#39;s no working generator, no theoretical basis for thinking that such a generator would work, and the fact that with the colossal advancements we&#39;ve made since Tesla&#39;s time reproducing anything he did would be trivial.</p>

<p>Do you seriously think that any modern high-end scientist working in physics wouldn&#39;t be able to rustle up a free-energy generator (or the underlying mathematics) if if was so easy? Turn away from baseless credulity please.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tesla&#39;s concept of Unlimited Free energy worked off of the same concept. Of course, given the kind of trash Tesla invented, I must be a total moron to believe in the same concept. And seriously, it&#39;s not trash, I would say 90% of people that try my pendant on or hold the generators in their hands feel a difference. And im talking random people, not friends of mine, not new age hippies, just random people.</p>

<p>I recommend checking out David Sereda&#39;s research done on such pendants. They raise the body voltage of people simply by putting them on. Tesla himself said that everything around us is conscious (remember, the Tesla that invented much of the technology we have today, the guy on Einsteins level?) and all energy is communicating subconsciously. Seriously tttt, you have +112 karma from me, I am somewhat surprised you are so close minded on this stuff when you can easily see how the powers that be lie to you about virtually everything else in the world...why so close minded? It&#39;s not a matter of opinion that I &quot;believe&quot; in this stuff, I have seen it work firsthand. My energy levels have skyrocketed since wearing my pendant daily. It creates a physical difference from just wearing it for 15 minutes. </p>

<p>As far as I can tell through the layers of quackery and pseudo-science, orgone energy is supposed to be some ethereal &quot;life energy&quot; involving bions, and has nothing to do with electricity. And even if it did, what the hell is gathing a tiny electrical charge in a pendant even supposed to do? You might as well lick a 9V battery, at least you can feel the result.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe orgone energy does exist but isn&#39;t what they think it is...... Tesla&#39;s radiant/cosmic energy collector does work. Take a piece of metal surrounded by an insulator connected by wireto a capacitor, connect the other connection of the capacitor to ground/earth (negatively charged). The insulated metal (orgone device) will collect positively charged particles. And your body is a capacitor.  I have made a simple tesla device and it will charge at a rate of about 1 volt per 2 hours. Then you ask well what can positively charged particles do for me. I would say research the subject of free radicles (electrons) in your body and the lose of electrons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course they were a catalyst. You&#39;re becomming illuminated. That&#39;s the whole point.  </p>

<p>First of all, Wil-Cock slips in a sentence or two here and there about the aliens existing and being real. That&#39;s the first tell. David also claims to know high ranking Illuminati / Freemasons just like Jordan Maxwell claimed. Maxwell was caught giving his secret handshake by the way.  </p>

<p>Same goes for Drunvalo Mal-whatever-idek.  </p>

<p>They use a lot of pyramid stuff and mumbo-jumbo to make you think they&#39;re letting you in on some big secret, only to ruin it by telling you the aliens are real. C&#39;mon man, it&#39;s all bullshit, you know that.</p>
