       They are diluting this subbreddit with stupid stories, and pointless topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the main one, and the one I feel is taking away from actual discussions. 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe 150% that it was inside, and that the truth needs to be spread. But I don't see any reason why we need to have two+ threads, every single day, giving more and more evidence, against something we almost all can agree was inside.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you argue that we need to spread awareness? Thats true, add a link in the side bar, only upvote half of the threads you do now, or just link all the new 9/11 submissions to /r/9/11truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not just because 9/11 is coming up. It has been this way for months. I don't know about you, but I feel that these repetitive threads and videos is prohibiting actual discussions from reaching the top. I also feel like this...
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the person knows 9/11 was a lie, and they see that the government can not be trusted... Drop it. What good will it do to have multiple threads and videos posted EVERY DAY? Nothing. Its absolutely a waste of time, productivity, and focusing on ISSUES that matter. Like the coming elections.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please stop upvoting every 9/11 thread. Save it for every third or second.

       I agree that there are quite a few "stupid stories and pointless topics" but the 9/11 issue is most definitely not one of them. It's one of the most important conspiracies of our time and needs to be kept at the forefront so the generations that follow realize what the people in power in and behind governments are capable of doing.

       A huge surge of junk .self posts also; this op seems to be a modification of the one being used to dumb-down/bore-out the main reddit with such great success; they have even defeated the reporting feature by forcing the mods to disable it through abuse. These guys are either pros, or doing a good job of imitating them; I can't help noticing the current op began in-earnest soon after the assault of Jewish outrage during early/mid Summer. On the upside; this means we are beginning to matter.

       I'm definitely not a dis info agent, or anyone working towards destroying this sub. In fact I've asked to become a mod multiple times. If you think I'm a dis info agent, you should reconsider your definition.

       From The Gentleperson's Guide To Forum Spies:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Technique #6 - 'GAINING FULL CONTROL'
It is important to also be harvesting and continually maneuvering for a forum moderator position. Once this position is obtained, the forum can then be effectively and quietly controlled by deleting unfavourable postings - and one can eventually steer the forum into complete failure and lack of interest by the general public. This is the 'ultimate victory' as the forum is no longer participated with by the general public and no longer useful in maintaining their freedoms...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I just think its funny that the one thing you point to as evidence of your not being dis info agent is covered in the sidebar reading as 'the ultimate victory' for a dis info agent.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no, you're absolutely right, we should do away with anything that exposes people to the multitude of glaring inconsistencies in the official 9/11 story, especially the ones that get so many votes that they are likely to be seen by people who may not have been aware of these things and start researching as a result of their exposure to this 'waste of time'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, or we can put them in r/911 truth so that we may only be preaching to the choir, which would be a much more effective use of our time than actually trying to spread this information to people who are not already aware of it. Then again that is exactly your reasoning that it should not be here (we all, according to you, are in agreement of it being an inside job) which is the premise of the r/911truth sub, so I'm a bit confused that you should point us in that direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       But don't you worry Sir, I'm certain we shall all be sure to ask your personal permission before up voting anything 9/11 related in the future, so that you may enlighten us as to what is a worthy use of this communities' time.

       You act like I said burn every single submission that involves 9/11. Thats not my point. My point is do we really need SO MANY posts on it? Do I need to watch a video of some celebrity talking about it? Wait, scroll down... oh look here is a video of some buildings falling, scroll down, oh no way! a picture with a quote on 9/11? scroll down... Look, it wasn't a real plane it was a drone! scroll down... no way, bush said he SAW the planes? Wow!

       All on one page, wtf? We don't need all that, we need one of those. Thats all that is needed to spread the word, allowing more room for other topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: oh yeah... forgot to talk about being a dis info agent... really? jesus christ, so I asked for a mod position? Does that mean every current mod is an agent? and would a dis info agent... directly list something from the guide on finding one? Really? lol. If you honestly believe that I am one... then you better praise your lizard gods, because im taking over reddit!

       That is from the title of your post. What are the bullshit stories you pointed out? 911. End of list.

      <p>
       Which one? They seem to cover different things (yes, they all relate to 911, this doesn't necessarily mean they cover the same information). So which one of these submissions should we be up voting?
      </p>
      <p>
       Telling us to only pick one of the four to up vote would essentially mean that each 9/11 post has to compete against the other 9/11 posts for our up vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may feel that these submissions are undeserving of your time but a lot of other people seem to have felt all of them worth an up vote. Feel free to use your up votes and down votes in whatever manner you see fit.

       Quite the contrary. This sub is a haven for anti semites such as tttt0tttt and bumblingmumbling. By not getting rid of these bigots, it's "silent consent". Nevermind the upvotes they often receive.

       If there are any perfect people I never met them. I certainly don't think I see one in the mirror in the morning. We just try inform people, and try to inform ourselves. We are sorry any user thinks any peoples are better or worse than any other. It is ideologies, beliefs, that lead people to do evil. Not anything innate in themselves. Or very rarely and then individuals and not groups.

       We should have a sidebar dedicated to some of the best links on certain confirmed or semi-confirmed topics, like 9/11 or the Kennedy assassination. This way new users can access the information and old users don't have to see the same posts all the time.

       I like the phrase 110%. I agree, 150% is a bit overboard, but 110 makes sense. Its like hey bob wheres the car keys, 'the're in the drawer', are you sure there in the drawer bob? 'yea im 100% sure'. Then the guy pulls a gun on bob and points it at his head and says, 'are you 110% sure bob?'. 
Bob very well may be 100% sure in his mind, but is he so sure he would put his life down with it, that's 110%.

       I think it is worthy to note that every single day we also see several "this thread is going to shit" or "we are being gamed" threads.
      </p>
      <p>
       They generally attract more attention than the 9/11 threads and are not nearly as important (or even worthwhile)
      </p>
      <p>
       So now instead of talking about current events, or 9/11, were talking about what we should be talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel posts like yours are more detrimental to the sub, as a new user may be interested in learning about 9/11 (especially in september).

      <p>
       I imagine new users would be put off by a community of people so paranoid they think the Illuminati gives a shit about their sub.

       9/11 should be posted here, however posts like the no planes theory detracts from the good, credible evidence that has been put forward. I don't think we should start omitting certain events just because you feel it could cause reposts or misdirection. 9/11 is central to the conspiracy that has happened in the last decade. War, war or terror, spying, body scanners, TSA, the Patriot Act etc all spawned from the fraudulent 9/11 event.

       There was a post earlier about the government making the Moon look like the Death Star. That is clearly a bullshit post. Trolls get the most far out, whacky shit you can come up with and then either have people agree with it or another troll account agrees with it and then this sub-reddit becomes a joke.

       This. I feel a main reason / a GIANT catalyst to the ailments of our nation / the turning to fascism / the reverse direction the world is turning now stems from this lie. I feel if we could open America's eyes to the fact it was an inside job they would wake up real fast and realize they have been letting themselves get preyed upon and fight back.

       9/11 is the key. It has the power to wake up someone who is a sleep. If you are willing to accept 9/11, you instantly know there is no difference between the 2 parties, financial systems are being controlled, laws are being passes against your freedoms, the wars are not just, ect ect ect. This all stems from 9/11. Its like a truth shortcut. I think the dis info is terrible for the truth though, no planes, coke can nukes, lazer weapons, missiles, ect ect. That discredits the entire theory for the beginner with half a brain. 9/11 IS KEY. Wake someone up to 9/11 and you win.

       I believe all the other stuff.

      <p>
       Not 9/11. It's really not all that necessary to demonstrate the truth or falsehood of the official story in order for someone to accept the exploitative nature of our current political system.

       So I guess...keep posting 9/11 stuff to convince me of that one? I don't know man.

       Your right in that its not necessary, but its a huge short cut. Do you really think building 7 fell on its own? If you think in your mind of a plane hitting a building, what happens? Does it fall like that in your mind? Does it completely blow up like that?

       Yes. When I go back and watch the footage, it doesn't seem that off-kilter to me. Now granted, I'm not an expert in building collapse, certainly not an expert in plane-based building collapse. But I've yet to find an argument that fully convinces me.

       How about first hand witnesses who describe countless secondary explosions, some in the basement. Why did the lobby of the building look like a bomb went off? How did 3 buildings fall on the same day due to fire? Can you explain how building 7 fell? Why did they delay the investigation and then undermine it. Why did some of the people on the 9/11 commission report say there investigation was impeded by government and its not a complete report. Why do so many architects and engineers say there had to be explosives in all 3 buildings. How about the 40+ year pilots who say they couldn't hit the twin towers with a plane on the first pass, yet amateur pilots who have never flown commercial airliners were able to hit them both first try. Amateur pilot also flew into the pentagon flying feet off the ground. BBC reported building 7 collapsed 20 min before it actually did. Why didn't the media even question if there were bombs in the building or not? How did the media know who carried out the attacks the very same day?
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't a coincidental hijacking, the whole thing was planned start to finish. You should look into it more if your not convinced.

       First hand witnesses inside a building that was collapsing? I'd be more suspicious if all their testimonies
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       How did building 7 fall? Flaming debris flying everywhere, building 7 was unlucky in that key support structures were hit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did they delay the investigation? To hazard a guess, they were embarrassed they didn't see this coming. Or rather, they were embarrassed that they had all the pieces to figure out it was coming, but didn't communicate. The government does this shit constantly. Ass-covering, obfuscation, a general belief that the general public shouldn't know about anything that happens within government institutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well who
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       fly the planes into the buildings then? If 40+ year pilots can't do it as you claim, than who the hell can?
      </p>
      <p>
       The BBC reported that, because rescue workers in the area had known the thing was going to come down for hours. They knew it was just a matter of time. Wires crossed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why didn't the media even question that? Because planes certainly crashed into the buildings. And as of yet there has been no explanation for how demolition equipment was smuggled multiple busy office buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Osama wasn't exact subtle about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have looked into it. The whole thing looks just as chaotic and confused as any other disaster. All of the questions raised by 9/11 "truthers" are just that, questions. None of them has a single shred of hard evidence substantiating their theories. While massive heaps of evidence support the official story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are there details being withheld? Almost certainly. Are asses being covered? You bet. Did the United States government blow up buildings full of people? No. They took
       <em>
        advantage
       </em>
       of it once it happened for sure, but they didn't
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       it.

       They're fucking rescue workers dude. I'm sure they've seen a building or two prior to its collapse.

       So you're saying that the same commercial airliners that can barely fly a straight line via autopilot can be directed precisely into a building (so precisely a 40+ year veteran pilot couldn't manage it according to you) via remote control.

       Oh yea, fucking rescue workers know when building are going to collapse. That's the biggest fucking horse shit I've ever heard anyone say ever. Go look at burning buildings, they never collapse, yet some genius rescue workers knew! GIVE ME A FUCKING BREAK. I don't have to figure out how they got the planes into the building, the burden of proof is on you, not on me. All I know is its almost impossible for those amateur pilots to hit all there targets, and by almost impossible I mean fucking impossible. For real though, I don't know what your agenda is, but if you really do care if this was an inside job or not please look more into it.

       ....so you're saying that you know more than rescue workers about how to judge the impending collapse of a building?
      </p>
      <p>
       You are aware that just plain old fires take down buildings right? It's not an exceptional occurrence.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, I assure you that explaining the magical plane-flying super-technology is entirely your problem. My explanation is quite simple: pilots. I call your testimony into question. If there's not a pilot in the world who could do it, than why the silence by just about every pilot in the country?
      </p>
      <p>
       As a programmer, if somebody told me that stuxnet was introduced via a javascript exploit or some nonsense, I'd be pretty goddamn suspicious and would make my incredulity known on a quite vocal level.
      </p>
      <p>
       I cannot tell why you're getting so nonconstructive about this. In my opinion, it's a rather important skill for rescue workers to develop for one thing. Any sort of controlled demolition would leave the question of just how the hell enough ordinance was smuggled in to level each structure (which you have not addressed to my knowledge). And your proposal that the government planted hi tech guidance systems on these airliners for the express purpose of pulling off a humanly impossible crash flies (poor choice of words really) in the face of common sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why in the hell would one choose a delivery method that was patently impossible given the cover story? The simplest explanation for me is not that the cover-up is good enough to silence the majority of those with flight experience. It is that the feat is not as difficult as you claim it is.

       Since they were the first 3 steel highrises to collapse from fire it's pretty implausible that 'rescue workers' were able to predict the building collapse. Yes it is a exceptional occurrence. You want pilot testimony?

       Exactly. A key support structure was hit, rescue workers knew it was just a matter of time
       <em>
        hours
       </em>
       before the thing finally gave out.
      </p>
      <p>
       A building exploding out like that? Well I sadly do not have more than one example of plane impact, which would seem to make the matter of definitively proving whether that was or was not the result one could expect.
      </p>
      <p>
       See, I feel that the flaw you and your ilk (people who buy into the inside job theory) make is that of speaking outside your expertise. The vast majority of your evidence boils down to "that is not what I would have expected to happen". Well bully for you. You claiming that it looked more like explosives were involved does not prove a thing without somebody finding some evidence of those explosives.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have not explained how they got there, and I am growing ever more suspicious that you just have no clue how this scenario of yours could have been executed.

       I truly believe that there cannot be
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       really good discussion of 9/11 without knowing the basic facts. If you haven't read it already I
       <strong>
        highly
       </strong>
       recommend Chris Bollyn's free book available at:

       No, you are wrong. We need to repeat the 9/11 story until it reaches into the concience of the nation. Just like we need to repeat the story of the JFK murder and the Gulf of Tonkin, the invasion of the Phillipines and all of the rest.

       If you find new information on this subreddit and believe it, the productive thing to do is to disseminate that info.

       Well, there has been a call to make a detailed summary of what is known, but I don't know what the response was. I know it is tiresome. But, you either repeat or say read the FAQ....

       But, awareness on 9/11 is still too low. It is treated as a joke. It is the most important operation that they have run recently. It took a great deal of effort to bring JFK back onto people's minds for a while. Maybe it would be better to post to AskReddit or WTF?

       R/conspiracy is not really a valid arena if you care about spreading awareness. If you just want to discuss, than alright.
