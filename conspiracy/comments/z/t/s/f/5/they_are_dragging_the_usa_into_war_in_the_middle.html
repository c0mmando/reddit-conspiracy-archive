       Arab American here, ive been trying to post on
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       whenever issues like this come up - I try to explain to them the bigger picture, the Zionist involvement in the region and how the US support for Israel is a major factor in this, why should we waste our tax dollars on foreign aid etc. but there is so much hatred and people there keep buying the mainstream media version of the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       The strange thing about
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       is that they weren't like this 6 months ago - so either hasbara with the aid of bots are heavy involved there or we're getting more "average" mainstream users using reddit - but im guessing its an organized effort as the pro-Israel redditors don't post on weekends, which raises many questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US doesnt need and can't afford another war in the region. Sadly the average American doesnt understand that the main reason why the US is hated in the Arab and Islamic World is because of its bias support to the Zionist regime in Israel - even the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan is connected to that one country that has been ruining the lives of most of the people in the Middle East.

       I'll have to agree with the downvoting, after posting in many topics about libya in regards to their oil deals from 2009 leading to the civil war along with the concept of an african dinar to lead away from the petrol dollar we know as the greenback. What was the truth given? Downvotes.

       Meh, let the societies crumble slowly i say. Hyperinflation is the new status quo for pro western societies. The asian market is about to overtake the world as we know it.

       Problem is, currency is a belief system. Soldiers will still be soldiers if the money is better than unemployment, regardless of the real world value of said money.

         I can't speak to your criticisms (I haven't read them) but I very much sympathize with not getting anything remotely critical of US and Israel discussed.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         My experience from when I went on /worldnews was sharing my perspective, which is based on very non-controversial observations about political violence that I first actually picked up from studying
         <em>
          every country I could find
         </em>
         and eventually was confirmed by the leading Jewish group in France  -- namely that political violence follows political uncertainty. I posted on the lower comments which are usually less idiotic but I was not well received. The only person I know of who tries to deny this is true is Glenn Beck.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I think it's hard to get a reading at the moment on who is explictly responsible for this video besides this guy (the KONY video is the reason I hesitate to dismiss it outright), but it's undeniable that there's a sense of injustice that people are allowed to feel in a very controlled manner and that's what made this video popular -- but just because it's a stupid video doesn't exactly mean it's intelligence. I think it would be interesting to look at how far the power systems have pushed radicals into completely irrational beliefs, and feelings of isolation, to such a degree that they do their bidding without a second thought. They themselves, in all their personhood, are a product of propaganda before they even open their mouths. That this video is conceivably done by a true believer, who can walk around his whole life and see the world as they want to, is a
         <em>
          much more
         </em>
         damning indictment of the imperial power system.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Regardless of if they believe the US radicals are dragging us into war, or who made the video, I don't see a reason why we shouldn't hold the country that has been torturing and starving these countries for the past decades upon decades accountable just because our government told us we're the heroes and we don't like religion anymore (that's the logic, really!). When PTSD troops come home from America we
         <em>
          demand
         </em>
         they get aid. But when Egyptian elections don't come out with the CIA favorite, well, they have to be provoked to justify a distance (this is just accepted in the press as US's natural support for 'democracy'). But again, you can't say these things to them, it makes them feel foolish.

       Educate your self man. It should be clear by now that the POTUS isn't in control. For example look at Obama's running platform in 08' anti-war,troops out of the middle east, take it to the bankers etc. 3+ years later and bombing in pakistan and yemen, support of insurgency's in libya, syria and egypt. MORE troops in A-stan. POTUS' clearly don't pull the strings.

       Watching Obama's presidency unfold has been one of the most enlightening and depressing events of my lifetime.  The will of the people is being truly and completely ignored for the gain of multinational corporations.

      <p>
       There's no other way to describe it.  Take a look at what happed to Gadaffi?  He's got the most open and stable society in the continent of Africa!  Women are allowed to drive cars and are allowed to vote and have educations!  Healthcare and education are free!  He had abandoned his nuclear power ambitions under pressure from the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously, the NATO war in Libya wasn't about a ruthless dictator repressing a popular uprising.  The US media just portrayed it that way, so that the real objective could be obscured.
      </p>
      <p>
       The United States puppet government, and their puppet media are the most dangerous and vile systems on the planet.  They are not beckons of democracy.. They are actively destroying democracy for corporate profit.

       Oh yes, we are well aware. I don't know if you frequent this sub, but we have been under attack from downvoters, trolls, and spammers for a while. There is an entire separate sub dedicated to mocking and disrupting this sub specifically. The smartest thing to do is to keep submitting and keep commenting. People who are looking for the truth will find it beneath the garbage, and they might suspect what you think is going on as well. You should definitely tell us if the mods are censoring you though.

       Most people can't be bothered to think critically or deeper, they just need a explanation, whatever it may be that's all they want. People don't want truth, just a good enough explanation that will get the topic of hand off their minds. It's sad, the USA is so intelligent and innovative in many ways, yet so naive and dumb

       Someone would be the diabolical Zionists that have staged our media and world events.  Since they have also infested US government, our foriegn policy has been set up to make America the woeful gaurdian of Israel. 
The Zionists stage an event....like the vdeo/assasination, then use that self provided incident as the pretext for another war. In this case, it will be somehow twisted to place Iran in the picture for Israels convenience.

       Replace "when in doubt" with "once mountains of circumstantial and physical evidence exist", and "Jews" with "Israel/Zionists".

       T, my coffee was too hot this morning and it burned my tongue. Now I haven't been able to taste anything all day. How can I expose the Jew Mossad agents working at "star bucks" (name alone should of been an immediate red flag) who did this to me?

       Educate your self man. It should be clear by now that the POTUS isn't in control. For example look at Obama's running platform in 08' anti-war,troops out of the middle east, take it to the bankers etc. 3+ years later and bombing in pakistan and yemen, support of insurgency's in libya, syria and egypt. MORE troops in A-stan. POTUS' clearly don't pull the strings.
