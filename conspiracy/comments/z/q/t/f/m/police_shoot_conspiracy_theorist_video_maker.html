       This sounds very fishy. The guy made videos saying the government was a bunch of thieves and that the cops in his area are controlled by free masons. For some reason the cops took his video equipment. And when they met for him to get his equipment back the cops shot him for possessing a gun.

       Excellent. Thank you. This is very interesting. DO you have a direct link to the "If they get me" letter? I'd like to think that someone would read mine if I left one, so I feel kind of honorbound to read his.

       his petition comes across as extremely paranoid (and possibly rightly so).  i don't see it as too far a stretch to think a man this worried for his life at the hands of the police wouldn't come armed to an arranged meeting, however stupid that may be.
      </p>
      <p>
       of course we may never know if he actually was armed or not, or posed a threat to police officers. his demeanor in this petition would make me pretty wary of being anywhere around him with a firearm.
      </p>

       theres a plausible explanation... and theres also a plausible motive for conspiracy... i dunno.

       It's too early to tell.  It's possible there is dash cam or footage from the gas station that might make it more clear.  At this point I don't even think it's worth speculating until more evidence comes out.

       He was shot 4 days after filing a writ in the missouri supreme court alleging all kinds of things. Seems fishy. 
He was a hard core conspiracy theory believer (probly what they consider the mental issue) and who hasn't assaulted some one in their life, fights happen.

       You have never been in a fight in all your life?
 Assault is just when someone gets the cops involved afterwards. 
I was in a bar where this drunk punched me in the mouth out of the blue for no reason, no words spoken, didn't even know him. I reacted. Some people like to push till you react.

       Before I respond I want to make certain we agree on the definition of the term:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/assault">
        Assault
       </a>
       : a violent physical or verbal attack.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Have I been in a fight? Yes.
       </li>
       <li>
        Was I the attacker? No.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       And in the example you gave, you were assaulted. The drunk who punched you was your assailant. Not the other way around.

       The DSM is a comprehensive manual covering the entire range of human emotion. There's quite literally a treatment for everything. You need to learn that "mental illness" isn't a real powerword that automatically discredits someone.

       I'd like to see some evidence that he had a SERIOUS mental disorder. This growing trend of turning people who make threats against the State into WARDS of the State instead is yet another incredibly slippery slope the dumb, ignorant, and blind are going to drag us down if we're not careful.
