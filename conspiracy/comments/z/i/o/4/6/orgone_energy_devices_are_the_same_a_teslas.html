       Well I ran across mention of orgone energy. And lately I have been playing with Tesla's cosmic energy collector. And I came to realize they are the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tesla's cosmic energy collector is this. Take a capacitor, run a wire from one connection to the ground/earth. Wire the other connection to an insulated piece of metal put up high off the ground (higher the better). The insulated metal will collect positively charged particles, while the earth is negatively charged. I did this using a coil of insulated wire for the positive side. It does work. It charged my capacitor at a rate that would equal 1 volt every 2 hours. Ya not much but it does work. I see it as a motionless static charge collector.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you have orgone devices which are metal (and sometime crystals) incased in resin (an insulator).
      </p>
      <p>
       Your body does act as a capacitor. And if your bare feet touch the ground....You become Tesla's device.
      </p>
      <p>
       So does anyone else see the connection here?
      </p>
      <p>
       Some reference to Tesla's cosmic energy collector. Seems he just proved free energy was available, but this device was not practical. He later made a device that was, but that design is a mystery.

       <em>
        Experiment with Einstein
Reich discussed orgone accumulators with Albert Einstein in 1941.
On December 30, 1940, Reich wrote to Albert Einstein saying he had a scientific discovery he wanted to discuss, and on January 13, 1941 went to visit Einstein in Princeton. They talked for five hours, and Einstein agreed to test an orgone accumulator, which Reich had constructed out of a Faraday cage made of galvanized steel and insulated by wood and paper on the outside.[51] Einstein agreed that if, as Reich suggested, an object's temperature could be raised without an apparent heating source, it would be a "bombshell" in physics.[52]
Reich supplied Einstein with a small accumulator during their second meeting, and Einstein performed the experiment in his basement, which involved taking the temperature atop, inside, and near the device. He also stripped the device down to its Faraday cage to compare temperatures. In his attempt to replicate Reich's findings, Einstein observed a rise in temperature,[53] which Reich argued was caused by the orgone energy that had accumulated inside the Faraday cage.[54] However, one of Einstein's assistants pointed out that the temperature was lower on the floor than on the ceiling.[55] Following that remark, Einstein modified the experiment and, as a result, concluded that the effect was simply due to the temperature gradient inside the room.[56] He wrote back to Reich, describing his experiments and expressing the hope that Reich would develop a more skeptical approach.[57]
Reich responded with a 25-page letter to Einstein, expressing concern that "convection from the ceiling" would join "air germs" and "Brownian movement" to explain away new findings.[54] The correspondence between Reich and Einstein was published by Reich's press as The Einstein Affair in 1953, possibly without Einstein's permission

       Interesting read. Thanks for sharing.
The orgone devices today are different than the original insulated metal box. They basically take metal shavings and chips with some crystals and other stuff and encase it all in resin. 
So it would be taking on the properties of Tesla's device, but also since it contains multiple pieces of metal that may not all be touching each other, it could be taking on the properties of a capacitor also. A capacitor just being 2 pieces of metal separated by an insulator.
so that would be 2 different electrical properties that are incorporated in these devices.

       That's only because you're not matching the impedance in the circuit. Set up a separate interrupter +LC tank circuit with a high impedance coil and ramp up the voltage. Then tap that voltage with a transformer ( primary is from the LC tank ) of  low self inductance secondary. Just like Tesla said.

       Tesla had devices made in 1890s which could alter the mood of the persons nearby. Orgone was not unknown to him. Read his electric therapeutic devices article to see how this was done.

       Being an electrician reading these posts it honestly sounds like a bunch of malarkey. Volts aren't a meaningful measure of power, they are a measure of energy, you'd have to provide the amperage to give a real idea of its usefulness or just list the joules which would be the product of those two numbers. 1 volt at .001 amps is trivial amounts of power, would generally be misreported by all but the most sensitive meters, and could be caused by wind blowing across the wire building up microscopic static charges. It would take a hugely creative mind and a huge sum of resources to scale a device like this up to the size necessary to power an easy bake oven. That's why you don't hear about it, because it's essentially bullshit.

       Interesting. Does this have anything to do with
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odic_force">
        Odic Force

       , researched by Carl Von Richenbach? A friend let me borrow a book that covered Odic force and it fascinated me. I've since lost contact with him and I can't remember the name of that book, but it was really good.

       I've only learnt about Orgone from William Riech's work in 1940's. It could be the same, only that its intentionally kept under wraps. Please let us know the name of this book if you come across it. 
Dogs, especially German Shepards come with this sensory organ which I suspect is sensitive to this force coming off living things.

       Hi there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would like to explain the difference between the 'orgone' field generated/accumulated with your Tesla device and the orgone field generated using organic material (crystals, metal and resin or wood).
      </p>
      <p>
       To start we need to clear a topic up with the help of the Bhagivad-Gita: "Earth, water, fire, air ether, mind intelligence, and false ego - all together these eight comprise My seperated material energies"
Krsna explains here in the Bhagavad-gita that vayu (gas) comes from Him, and that finer than the gasses is kham (ether). Finer than ether is the mind, finer than the mind is intelligence, and finer than the intelligence is the soul. Neither scientists nor the Veda philosophers know anything of the spirit soul. They are simply analyzing Krsnas material energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       OK NOW THATS OUT OF THE WAY :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Willhelm Riech deserved to be locked up, as he was generating the Tesla mechanical orgone and trying to use it to 'heal' humans. As ignorant as he was, he did start off the idea of using western science to enhance the healing effects of Chi or Pranic energy. It wasn't until the reinvention and research done by Don Croft that the idea of putting crystalline pieces which happen to contain extremely rich and powerful geometry (and the mathematics there-within) that orgone was accumulated at safe levels for humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Orgone can only be used properly when it is tuned to the same frequency of the process it is intending to manipulate. In humans, our bio-energy fields or 'auric' field resonates at certain frequencies at different parts of the body, orgone can be used to help even out imbalances or disturbances in the auric field when used with a crystalline filter - usually silicone quartz crystal (the most abundant mineral on the planet).
      </p>
      <p>
       Orgone can also be used to tap in to processes that occur at a mechanical, biochemical and molecular level. I decided to write this post as just on IRC last night I was explaining to a friend this exact phenomena. Here is the log of how orgone (Tesla version) accumulators can be used to run a car engine:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         What we're after is a field effect
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         So if you think of a fishing net that expands in 3 dimensions, a mesh
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         This is the field effect that is generated which penetrates ALL matter. As physical matter is moving/oscillating/vibrating at a much lower frequency.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Orgone does not replace any gas or fuel in an engine.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It instead provides 'lubricant' for quantum events that occur in any process.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The internal combustion engine (when running) is a process, one could say is operating at a certain frequency - is the antenna.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Making a dish or a transmission signal that can transcieve to the antenna (the process of an ICE) is possible via generating this field (which is similar to a ferromagnetic or a electromagnetic field).
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The field when passing through physical matter essentially provides a 'alignment' on a molecular level that helps quantum events occur more frequently, and more accurately during the process the physical matter is involved in. Quantum events occur in the process of electrical discharges within the human nervous and neuro systems, aswell as the plasma spark that combusts air and flammable liquid to force pistons down etc
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         This happens at an etheric, elemental, molecular and then maybe a cellular level; depending on what kind of field you are generating, and what antenna you are trying to hit
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         But in an engine, the fuel economy achieved when you successfully tune an orgone accumulator to the ICE process comes from a few different things
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A magnetic 'alignment' happens at the molecular level on the steel itself, so not only is wear &amp; tear reduced, but the metal does not get as hot or accumulate waste heat as much
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Fuel is not only burnt more efficiently, but in most cases you can 'lean' out the engine beyond normal levels, achieving a higher air to fuel mix ratio.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There are also a number of other advantages of producing an orgone field attuned to a car, including reduced rust &amp; other nasties that occur when water and metal are in contact
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       I hope this helps clear up the differences between generating orgone for healing in the human body, and generating orgone to manipulate processes that occur in physical reality (be it a running engine, atmospheric events, or electricity generation/transmission)

       I look at things from a more scientific point of view. The 2 electrical properties these contain are scientifically proven. And the radar absobant thing is interesting, but I haven't had time to read up on it.
I have researched heavily into the whole vibration frequency thing, and it is true. But most lies are initially built on a foundation of truth.  And I am not yet convinced of anyone who claims they know anything of manipulating these frequencies in a positive way. It sounds good and is built on a foundation of truths but seams like they start making things up from there.

       I should mention the above notes are from my own personal research and are by no means universal truths or facts at all. They are just my observations from years of working with batshit insane newagers and hard-line cold logic scientists, and building many an orgone device. You are free to look at orgone through a reductionist, psuedo-skeptical 'scientific' point of view, but you are limiting your own progress.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you are dealing with orgone you are dealing with aetheric energies that emanate down in to the physical energies we can measure with tools. I'm not sure why you'd start a post on orgone if you are still struggling with the idea of there being a chi/prana/lifeforce/aetheric energy?

       i believe in chi/lifeforce energy from my research. But when things start getting spirit names that's when I start backing off. Yes everything resonates, alpha, beta waves, your eye balls have a frequency of 18hts why go calling it "the Obama energy force" instead of looking at things from a perspective of reality? If it can not be converted into the perspective of reality, then it is not reality in my book.

       I can see you're still struggling with the 'we're just walking biomechanical bags of meat' conundrum.

      <p>
       Reductionism does not explain consciousness, as even the
       <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-08/uoi-sih081712.php">
        latest neuroscience
       </a>
       has proved self-awareness is nonlocal to any particular region of the brain. As aetheric energies (which as stated, emanate down in to physical energies) deal in matters of consciousness, your 'perspective of reality' is not something I'm trying to change (I'm not selling anything here) - only expand your imagination.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was quite serious when I stated that quantum events occur at the neurological level and the nervous system in general.

      <p>
       Being able to accumulate 'orgone' or prana/chi/whatever spirit name you want, is an aetheric energy that lubricates quantum events and makes them a) happen more reguarly, and b) more accurately. There's nothing voodoo about it mate!

       Did he conduct experiments that harmed human health in any way? It would be interesting to know why he was so reviled compared to Tesla, as they both experimented on humans.

       A lot of scientist's did crazy things in the past, and they still do. We still have things on the market in our water and atmosphere that, while they have not been proven harmful, have not been proven not to be harmful. We are all, essentially human guinea pigs when you think of it.

       Interesting read. Thanks for sharing.
The orgone devices today are different than the original insulated metal box. They basically take metal shavings and chips with some crystals and other stuff and encase it all in resin. 
So it would be taking on the properties of Tesla's device, but also since it contains multiple pieces of metal that may not all be touching each other, it could be taking on the properties of a capacitor also. A capacitor just being 2 pieces of metal separated by an insulator.
so that would be 2 different electrical properties that are incorporated in these devices.
