<p>Nothing is being done to curb the infiltration and destruction of this subreddit. The mods are stricken with paralysis and do not have the balls to ban the obvious shills, detractors and fucktards. </p>

<p>Seems like my subscription time to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is drawing to an end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have begun to suspect that the moderators here have no desire to improve the sub one iota.  They feign paralysis and claim that they will &quot;catch flak&quot; for banning people.  Fine, do it and catch flak.  Who cares?  Clearly the only people who would complain if this sub was closed off to the forum spies and shills would be forum spies and shills.</p>

<p>I estimate that there are 6-7 full-time shills watching and downvoting things that they don&#39;t like, another two dozen who post nothing but inflammatory trolls and sidetrack the discussion here, and that together they operate at least sixty sock puppet accounts that can be called upon for mass downvoting when required.</p>

<p>The need for action here is clear, and this needs to consist of banning users who post garbage, banning users who have track records of being obvious page lengtheners, and banning any regular poster in the several subs who are devoted to disrupting this subreddit.</p>

<p>I seriously doubt this will happen, which in my opinion reduces the credibility of the moderators here.  Without decisive action to clean up this sub, they are clearly implicated as being responsible for its downfall.  There is no other responsible party that has the ability to take action.  Shit or get off the pot, mods.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Political bullshit is conspiracy. A conspiracy is two or more people planning in secret to do malice. To fit the definition, only the planning needs to be secret. Making plans in secret is very easy to do. Just because other people eventually (or even immediately) figure out that something fishy is going on does not mean there was no conspiracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Checking the votes on our little comment thread here, it seems like r/Conspiracy has agreed with me to a larger extent than you.  </p>

<p>So maybe it&#39;s <em>you</em> who doesn&#39;t belong here!</p>

<p>I&#39;m kidding... it&#39;s rude to tell people that they don&#39;t belong in a subreddit.   </p>

<p>But still, all that time spent saving 20-30 links into a .txt file hoping it becomes relevant and spamming it into threads could be better spent just crafting a well-written, properly sourced comment here and there that more people will read in its entirety.  Sometimes less is more.</p>

<p>Hell, spamming it into r/Conspiracy is probably a waste anyway since we are exposed to this kinda stuff on a daily basis.  Most of those links are purple for alot of us!  It&#39;s probably better to craft a decent referenced comment in a default subreddit than linkspamming here.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I seem to have displeased the illuminati shills as this comment is now downvoted.  I must be onto something big guys!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is so much paranoia and division in that statement I don&#39;t know where to start.</p>

<p>Sure, there are some people (r/conspiratard etc) who for one reason or another have a hardon for r/conspiracy.  Maybe they just like to troll people who are passionate about a subject (like PC users trolling Mac users), or maybe even some are &quot;shills&quot;.  But you can&#39;t say that most downvotes are from people who look to disrupt this subreddit.</p>

<p>Subscribers to this subreddit are like anyone else.  They agree with some things, disagree with others, and hit the little arrows to signify which.  There&#39;s almost 80k people on this reddit, ~200 online right now, and there&#39;s no way most of them are part of some shadowy enemy looking to do us harm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel the same way, but am hesitant to admit defeat.  Apart from creating any army of sock puppets I&#39;m not sure how to combat the existing army of puppets.  Remember though, although it seems like we are vastly outnumbered here - it&#39;s completely artificial.  Ignore the votes and put up your opinion.</p>

<p>Another thing I have noticed is the rise of mainstream news sources, and the sliding of alternative news.  Tack on a rise in picture posts, we have a degrading situation.  Touch any conspiracy involving Israel, vaccines, 911 and you attract the puppets like maggots on dung.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Political bullshit is conspiracy. A conspiracy is two or more people planning in secret to do malice. To fit the definition, only the planning needs to be secret. Making plans in secret is very easy to do. Just because other people eventually (or even immediately) figure out that something fishy is going on does not mean there was no conspiracy. </p>
