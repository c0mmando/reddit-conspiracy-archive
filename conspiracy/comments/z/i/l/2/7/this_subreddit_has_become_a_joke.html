       Nothing is being done to curb the infiltration and destruction of this subreddit. The mods are stricken with paralysis and do not have the balls to ban the obvious shills, detractors and fucktards.

       Seems like my subscription time to

       I have begun to suspect that the moderators here have no desire to improve the sub one iota.  They feign paralysis and claim that they will "catch flak" for banning people.  Fine, do it and catch flak.  Who cares?  Clearly the only people who would complain if this sub was closed off to the forum spies and shills would be forum spies and shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       I estimate that there are 6-7 full-time shills watching and downvoting things that they don't like, another two dozen who post nothing but inflammatory trolls and sidetrack the discussion here, and that together they operate at least sixty sock puppet accounts that can be called upon for mass downvoting when required.
      </p>
      <p>
       The need for action here is clear, and this needs to consist of banning users who post garbage, banning users who have track records of being obvious page lengtheners, and banning any regular poster in the several subs who are devoted to disrupting this subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I seriously doubt this will happen, which in my opinion reduces the credibility of the moderators here.  Without decisive action to clean up this sub, they are clearly implicated as being responsible for its downfall.  There is no other responsible party that has the ability to take action.  Shit or get off the pot, mods.

       I noticed for a while their definitely seemed like a deliberate movement to paint this subreddit as antisemitic, and when that stopped working it seemed like they moved to posting and upvoting random nonsense instead.

       It seems like maybe a third of submissions at any given time in the "New" queue are not conspiracy related. Most of which are either "Fucked Up World News" or "Political Bullshit". It's irritating when some of them make the "Hot" list.

       Political bullshit is conspiracy. A conspiracy is two or more people planning in secret to do malice. To fit the definition, only the planning needs to be secret. Making plans in secret is very easy to do. Just because other people eventually (or even immediately) figure out that something fishy is going on does not mean there was no conspiracy.

       Sometimes it's nice when those posts are made here though...because the amount of effort to cover them up else where really amounts to conspiracy, IMO.

       YRUGay is one of the most useful posters here.  He makes it possible for a person to easily research and confirm or deny something.  I can't understand why you would contend otherwise.

       Because no one is going to click on 20 links to "learn more" about 1 subject.  It's not even like its in conversation, he just bursts in and pastes a wall of text that no one asked for.
      </p>

       Just write a comment like a regular person, cite it with a couple links, and be done with it.  Maybe have a normal conversation with someone.

       Well, perhaps you don't have any interest in learning about certain subjects.  That's unfortunate but not too surprising.  YRUGay serves the same function as a footnote or a bibliography - a useful purpose for those who wish to take advantage.

       Checking the votes on our little comment thread here, it seems like r/Conspiracy has agreed with me to a larger extent than you.
      </p>
      <p>
       So maybe it's
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       who doesn't belong here!
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm kidding... it's rude to tell people that they don't belong in a subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       But still, all that time spent saving 20-30 links into a .txt file hoping it becomes relevant and spamming it into threads could be better spent just crafting a well-written, properly sourced comment here and there that more people will read in its entirety.  Sometimes less is more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, spamming it into r/Conspiracy is probably a waste anyway since we are exposed to this kinda stuff on a daily basis.  Most of those links are purple for alot of us!  It's probably better to craft a decent referenced comment in a default subreddit than linkspamming here.

       Don't be an idiot.  The votes here are systematically gamed by sock puppets, shills, forum disruptors and other people who have no honor or integrity.  In fact, being downvoted has become an indication that somebody is on the right track in this subreddit, because there is a clear and ongoing operation aimed at downvoting or otherwise marginalizing people who contribute usefully.

       There is so much paranoia and division in that statement I don't know where to start.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, there are some people (r/conspiratard etc) who for one reason or another have a hardon for r/conspiracy.  Maybe they just like to troll people who are passionate about a subject (like PC users trolling Mac users), or maybe even some are "shills".  But you can't say that most downvotes are from people who look to disrupt this subreddit.

       Huh? yrugay consistently posts based off of buzzwords and it's not rare that his links have nothing to do with the topic.

       One must understand that whenever this subreddit becomes overly moderated then it will lose its true purpose in the first place.

       I feel the same way, but am hesitant to admit defeat.  Apart from creating any army of sock puppets I'm not sure how to combat the existing army of puppets.  Remember though, although it seems like we are vastly outnumbered here - it's completely artificial.  Ignore the votes and put up your opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing I have noticed is the rise of mainstream news sources, and the sliding of alternative news.  Tack on a rise in picture posts, we have a degrading situation.  Touch any conspiracy involving Israel, vaccines, 911 and you attract the puppets like maggots on dung.

       While I don't fully agree, I do agree there are problems in this sub that don't seem to be going away. I might just get down voted for this plug, but I've started a new sub called r/countermine and so far I've just been populating it with my own links I've saved over the last while and new ones I find containing pertinent information to world events and various goings on in an attempt to create a spot for real discourse. Not sure I'll succeed and I've never modded a sub, so its kinda an experiment for me, but check it out if you're so inclined.

       Probably because this is the millionth "we've been infiltrated! " self-post in the sub as of late. Get over yourself. The world (and also reddit) at large doesn't care about this sub.

       So, two Zionist cocksuckers walked into a bar and ordered the blood of Rachel Corrie, on the rocks. And the bartender said "We don't serve apartheid Nazis in here." And the first ZCS said "You anti-semite!" and downvoted him.

       I'm here because I can be. Is it really "painfully" obvious? I mean, does it actually

       A lot of the new people on here either don't know what this subreddit is about, or they don't know how to spot actual conspiracy info.  I like to post obvious propaganda and Agenda 21 info(the

       NWO conspiracy).

       Political bullshit is conspiracy. A conspiracy is two or more people planning in secret to do malice. To fit the definition, only the planning needs to be secret. Making plans in secret is very easy to do. Just because other people eventually (or even immediately) figure out that something fishy is going on does not mean there was no conspiracy.

       Sometimes it's nice when those posts are made here though...because the amount of effort to cover them up else where really amounts to conspiracy, IMO.
