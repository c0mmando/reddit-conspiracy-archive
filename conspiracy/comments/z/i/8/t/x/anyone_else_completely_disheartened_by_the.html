       They should be embarrassed by some of the things being said...yet these things are being upvoted. I mean look at this headline on r/politics:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Michelle Obama was foreplay, Bill Clinton was pure sex, and Barack Obama was the cuddle in the afterglow."
      </p>
      <p>
       That's finger-down-the-throat stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile everything critical of Obama continues to be downvoted into oblivion.  It's all hushed up. Reddit did not used to be this stupid. I
just can't figure out whether it's the new mainstream readership or whether it's the work of Democratic operatives. Maybe it's a little of both.

       Well, there's definitely Stockholm Syndrome at work. Bush/Cheney shocked and awed "progressives" and they became so afraid of social conservatives that they're willing to blindly support Democrats. This is a big win for the lobbyists like AIPAC and Goldman Sachs that fund both parties. America's being looted like the U.S.S.R. was.

       Exactly. Hegelian dialectic at work, specifically in the synthesis phase. Except our Afghanistan war is... oh the elegant symmetries. It's poetry in motion. In a world of farce and destruction, even the evil has its aesthetic pleasantries derived from ironic juxtaposition of the situation, only visible through the tinted glasses of madness and continuous depravity. The comedy shall end well though, else it be tragic.

       I've always thought that maybe 80% of people are completely stupid beyond all help. Lately I've bumped it up to 99%, and I'm very comfortable with that figure as a lower bound.

       There is a much larger 'election' going on... one that has been gaining incredible momentum for some time. It is entirely manipulated, just as all elections are. It's certainly not an 'official' election of any sort... but, in terms of its' effects on its' 'voters', is one of the most important in history. On top of this, it's very nearly impossible to detect because it hinges almost entirely on the 'voters'
       <em>
        ego
       </em>
       (as any election does to some degree).
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't fall for it. The two parties are commonly known as
       <em>
        The Awake
       </em>
       vs.
       <em>
        The Sheep
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you guys honestly believe that the ruling elite would allow
       <em>
        The Internet
       </em>
       ... the most vast and instantaneously accessible tool for information gathering/researching the world has
       <em>
        ever known in history
       </em>
       ... to operate as a
       <em>
        truly
       </em>
       free and uncontrolled domain to share and debate 'subversive' ideas?
      </p>
      <p>
       All the recent SOPA/etc stuff are false flags. The truth is, the internet has
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       been controlled...
       <em>
        entirely
       </em>
       . It's
       <em>
        very purpose
       </em>
       is to make it easy to research all of the popular 'conspiracy' topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why else would it be so incredibly simple to type a few key words into Google and get back thousands upon thousands of pages, outlining all manner of dark/evil/plausible/implausible/fucked up/mundane/you name it 'conspiracy theories' (granted, many of which are true) in
       <em>
        seconds?
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't think the 'elite' know how to use the internet? Or, how it works?
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't think they
       <em>
        already know about AND approve
       </em>
       of the information being discussed endlessly, emphatically, passionately and with immense conviction? Of course they do.
       <em>
        We are not uncovering ANY truths they don't already want us to know about
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       They
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       us to be chasing white rabbits all over the place... with no real idea as to where they lead, where they go, or what they
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       mean. It is very easy to manipulate people by giving them bits and pieces of 'classified/secret/subversive/uncovered/etc' information and letting them believe they know something that most do not. It's a very
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       basic method of manipulation and highly effective. Religion and all manner of cults have used this method to great success for
       <em>
        eons
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So then, why? To get people to draw sides between those 'in the know' and 'the sheeple'. It's the new election. The election of the century. The election no one knows is going on... and the number one thing they want from you is your
       <em>
        REACTION
       </em>
       ...
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to start asking some
       <em>
        different
       </em>
       questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S. I like your writing style, ThrowawayNumber11.

       I see it like an economy of sorts where ideas and language are the currency. The rate of exchange is regulated and monitored, and when certain currencies reach the desired rate of proliferation, you can move on with sanctioning the use of the currency. You have to try and watch the trends instead of just focusing on the exchange.
      </p>
      <p>
       Examples would be something like 2012, ancient aliens, HAARP and weather manipulation. Those subjects have been popularized now, and it is "okay" to talk about it with your neighbors without wearing a tin-foil hat because you can watch a special on the "history" channel about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why are we allowed to talk about aliens and HAARP on the history channel but you don't get anything about the history of money, education, or the Commission on Presidential Debates yet? (Which by the way are just more up and coming trends, soon to be sanctioned if not already.)
      </p>
      <p>
       More and more it seems the whole story being built up is a mass initiation or indoctrination into something, and nobody is exactly sure what that something is.

       Humanity as a whole is seemingly guided, similar to the idea that we are been pulled towards an "eschaton" or a transcendental object at the end of time and our evolutionary administrators (TPTB) are trying their damnedest to get us ready for whatever is headed our way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part of this preparation is getting a certain set of ideas in our heads, hopefully to help us not completely lose our minds when the sustainability of everything we are so dependent on and accustomed to is completely unmanageable. Save some magnificent coincidental string of technological breakthroughs or some sort of extraordinary intervention, humanity is fucked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from information you personally derive from your own experiences, everything else is "external" parroting of what some other guy came up with before you. Nobody hardly ever has an original thought anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are at that point on an exponential graph where the curve just shoots off the scale, in population, creation and distribution of information, debt, reckless use of resources, ect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything is becoming a microcosm of the macro story of how humanity is fucking itself over, while at the same time how it is attempting to overcome its own fuckery, and the mass indoctrination is not only the telling of this story to ourselves of which we are all the heroes, villains, and what ever other literary archetypes we decide to play along the way. It's getting the people, that haven't and/or don't want to realize that
       <em>
        we all
       </em>
       are the characters embroiled in the Hero's cycle, that every culture has a story of, with their own particular nuances, to pay attention via
       <strong>
        any means necessary
       </strong>
       .
      </p>

       There isn't any such thing as "original thought"... period. Losing our minds would be the best thing to happen. The mind/thought process is what creates and maintains this entirely insane illusory 3D 'reality'.

       You know, I've thought about that, (the whole they want you to know aspect) and its truly frightening. But at the same time the internet is getting larger and larger with more and more information becoming available, how do they keep track of it all? I can understand (from what I believe) technology is developed way before it's even released to the consumers, so I would think they'd have extremely, extremely powerful technology we haven't ever imagined to exist be able to allow anything to happen on that large of a scale. The biggest problem I see is HOW and WHY. I don't understand why they'd (whoever "they" are, definitely assuming the Rockefellers are involved for starters) want things to be so tied down and controlled. I just don't see why and blame my naivety or lack of understanding for this, as I am newer to learning all this conspiracy stuff. (I feel I really trailed off sorry for a long read)

       They don't really have to keep track of
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       of it. If you control a few keys areas (with the added benefit of technology, as you mentioned)... the rest takes care of itself. When you control media/education/politics/military/medicine/banking/technology/religion/etc, it's pretty easy to control most everything else without having to be directly involved with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is technology that is
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       even spoken about outside of very small circles, let alone released to the public.

       I got into (by accident) 'conspiracy' stuff in the early 90's... and I was terrified. Now, compared to the ridicule I often received then... it almost seems mainstream. I'll hear young people talking about the Illuminati like it ain't no big deal.

       The specific events are trivial against the common theme which must be addressed first. We are regressing too far for representative government to do what it was initially meant to do without skimming some off the top. And by some I mean trillions.

       They merely play leaks off as purposeful, or for strategic purposes if actually real. Follow the motive. Sometimes it is hidden, but often it is in plain sight.

       I would like for the US population to approach a critical proportion at which point enough people would have knowledge of crucial facts and spread them around through word of mouth till they become common knowledge. This tipping point is ambiguous and perhaps very close (?) and so every effort helps and hope must not be abandoned. Then, the best case scenario is that humanity survives another 4 years and we get a liberty candidate to win in 2016. This is of course not nearly enough most likely, and I will admit that we may be past the point of no return in regards to a peaceful resolution that is entirely "lawful" (or any resolution for that matter). Besides that, impeachment and emergency elections would be the next best thing because 4 years is a VERY long time nowadays.

       To combat each and every event on its own is difficult, and taken one at a time, the fabricated pseudo-history of the media can combat it automatically without external intervention. By this I mean that some real events are so ludicrous from most people's perspectives that they are immediately disregarded. If taken as a whole however, namely the international socialist conspiracy whose main method employs the Hegelian dialectic, in which economic problems are created and crafted solutions are prescribed, you can then see the common theme which is very important for analyzing what actually is happening and seeing the total scope of the situation which is impossible to grasp from the average point of view. Without the overarching theme, you can not connect the dots.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps we agree but don't realize? You don't believe that the prime motives, i.e. the motives directly created to further international socialism, are important? How else would you wake someone up? I can't stress hard enough that analyzing small parts on their own is difficult because they are chosen to be self-contained within the fiction. With the main theme known you can put the rest of the pieces together.

       Why would they need to worry?  They have the strength to stop any actual meaningful investigation or retaliation.  Something as nice and clear as 9/11, a very large portion of the population is aware and consider it to be kinda a big deal that it is a farce.  Does anything happen?  No.  You give them a lot of credit for master planning that is more likely just disconcern.  Sure some of it is manipulation, but not really having to fear retaliation would make most of it just meh.

       This is my impression as well. What does a population ("the government") have to fear from anybody, with a military at its disposal (an all-volunteer one, at that) that is better-funded than the entirety of the rest of the world's militaries combined? If I had just ONE Navy SEAL as a loyal protector, I would feel very safe...

       I'd say it's due to Reddit's popularity.  Where I live 2 kinds of people make up 85% of the population.  The first half thinks Obama has done a damn good job considering what he inherited and is a beacon of human rights for helping the gays.  The other half
       <em>
        hate
       </em>
       him and a fair percentage would like to
       <em>
        hang
       </em>
       him.  But, they also want to bring in Romney because he's a conservative?  Reddit really has become a reflection of the American people.

       What's worse---this is the pinnacle of mind shaping.  You're giving people the illusion that they're somehow ahead of the curve and educated by being leftist---much like how college students' erroneously believe they're so educated by being leftist fools as well---what makes reddit WORSE---is that it's interactive.  People are receiving social Qi-points in the form of upvotes for exhibiting the toolish behavior that the 'Invisible' Hand that is control of our media and government since the 1860s is trying to implant in the worlds' collective brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are extremely small minded---and I fear that shit like reddit is the perfect storm of leftist indoctrination that could finally send our world off the edge of lunacy toward the new world order wet dream.  It's fucking scary out there right now.

       I've been on Reddit for 2 days and I already find it incredibly frustrating... but, I guess that's point.
      </p>
      <p>
       The upvote/downvote system is simply a smaller version of any two-party political system. Whether people 'officially' vote or not... everybody still likes
       <em>
        (needs)
       </em>
       to cast
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think I'll be able to stay on Reddit for very long.

       Frequently I find pro-Democrat posts and comments upvoted, and third-party posts and candidates ignored. For example, on r/environmentalism, a post praising Clinton's lip service to global warming was on the front page, but a post outlining the manifesto of the Green Party was completely ignored, even though the type of radical change it calls for is exactly what we need (and many want). This false dichotomy is sickening.

       Oh, I love his failure. I relish it. I never said I didn't care. But you keep continuing to care...short sentences require thought and reflection on a subject. Then you even took time to tell the world about your thoughts and reflection. That's caring. That's caring for a failure.

       Nope, you're still right here, hours later paying attention and still caring about this conversation. Looks to me like you're not that bright. You can't see that you lied when you said you don't care, because it is so obvious that you do every time you respond more.

       Absolutely no question it's operatives.  They're following the same playbook as at Democratic Underground.  Even some of the same slimy characters showing up.  It all started over a year or so ago when PHOY led the takeover of the

       The problem with that phrase (and I read it on a daily basis everywhere when describing Obama) is that they're not even considering fighting the system and voting for a 3rd party. If all of us "awake" people united we'd cause real damage if we voted for a 3rd party.

       That is exactly why obama had to run a negative campaign.  It is really fear of the other guy that keeps people locked in the two parties more than love of their own guy.  2008 was an exception.  Otherwise people would look at those third parties and say wait a minute...

       Im lucky i live in a state where my vote doesnt matter, i get to be all idealistic and vote gary.  If i was in one of those spots that matters i'd begrudgingly vote obama because its not good for my eye to roll as much as they would during a romney presidency

       I generally agree with most of what you said - except to me there is no difference between Obama and Romney, they'll both end up doing the same thing (particularly in terms of our foreign policy) but they'll say it differently to the media.

       That's not what they care about.  If a few percent of Obama's base walks away from this election (as I am doing), then Obama loses.  To them, America is just a big soggy teat... don't read any intelligence into their actions.

       Most people legitimately don't care.  The response is always

       , my favorite was from the other day just sort of summing up how childish it was, something along the lines of, "Bill Clinton's speech has made be abandon the Republican party." These people are SOOO RED!!! or SOOO BLUE!!! But at the same time one little speech makes them change their perceived "sides" of the same coin. It seems like an accurate sample of the population overall, sad isn't it?! I actually feel bad for them, poor ignorant know-it-alls.

       i completely agree with you guys. the democrat vs. republican fight is a joke. how can it be true democracy when you disagree with both of your choices?
      </p>
      <p>
       in france, when the presidential election came up they started with
       <strong>
        10
       </strong>
       nominees all from
       <strong>
        different
       </strong>
       parties/platforms. then during the second round it was down to the socialist party vs. sarkozy (the past president). even though at the end, it was still one on one, but at least the citizens of france had an actual opportunity to see what all the candidates had to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       in this country, we did start with 13 candidates. but we do not have 2 rounds of voting. 8 of the candidates withdrew to endorse mitt romney. ron paul got cheated out by the gop. currently there are still 4 candidates running, obama, romney, gary johnson (libertarian) and jill stein (green). but do we ever hear any main stream media coverage on the latter two?
      </p>
      <p>
       also the electoral college is a joke. in 2000, al gore took the popular vote. the vote made by the people of united states. but yet when it came down to it, bush took the electoral college and won (by cheating, but that is another debate). if we are a democratic country, then how come our votes don't count?
      </p>
      <p>
       ultimately, whether obama wins or romney wins this country will not change. both parties use loyalty to keep their supporters. they both know what heart-strings to tug on. they passively and aggressively trash talk each other. and both parties are getting involved in "personal" (marriage, abortion, birth control, marijuana use) issues instead of "national" (education, health care, clean energy) issues. it is really sad to me that people are so passionate about being pro-choice or pro-life, but if you talk to them about education then they have very little opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       last point, it is gut-wrenching to see that most of this election is run on hatred. the hatred of people that don't see the world in your perspective. the hatred of gays, immigrants, women, the rich, the poor, non-theists, theists, science (sad, but true). a truly democratic country should run on
       <strong>
        logic and reason
       </strong>
       , not on faith and emotions.

       I wrote a message on Facebook last night to a friend who was beating the "obvious choice" in Obama last night:
      </p>
      <p>
       I couldn't understand how a clear thinking and rational individual thinks voting for either false-choice candidate will result in any particular change.
      </p>
      <p>
       All we have left in Jackass Vs. Peanut Counter presidential politics are the two most financially-backed opponents with the flashiest speeches, most expensive campaigns, and prettiest platitudes -- not actual ideas that fairly represent the varied population of America.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shoving the millions of Americans into two divisions just leads to a football match. Everyone picks a side and treats their leader like Jesus, ranting and raving about how they have the right idea. When election time comes around, it's about how puny the other leader would be compared to theirs, and never about standing back and saying "Alright, what have you actually done for us as President? No, not what your salaried speech writer thinks. No, not what your fucking wife thinks -- what actually happened?"
      </p>
      <p>
       People voted Obama in as a mass rejection of Bush, but unfortunately in their fervor, they elected a true center-right conservative who only worsened many of Bush's gravest crimes. It has come to my understanding that neither side has the ideas nor the will to carry things through. They're all bought and paid for to quell the masses with fake debates and empty promises of better things to come. They aren't where the real change or hope is going to come from, they're the same shit and you'd be the dope to think saying "Left" or "Right" once every four years is going to actually change something.
      </p>
      <p>
       The obvious place to actually affect real change would be in Congress, but thanks to the pants-on-head-retarded first-past-the-post voting approach, once again all people are shoved into voting between two parties, and that leads to no one actually being represented. This is a Duverger's Democracy; an utter sham.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't sell yourself short and pick a side because they claim to want what you want. Congress fucking has what you want and then some, and they aren't gonna let you have it. As long as they make 100x what you make by telling you what you want to hear, and that means the person with the most money has the most of the politician's ear, they do NOT represent you, the little person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus I am left with the conclusion that anyone with any sense in this country isn't voting, they're either fleeing this madhouse for saner, functional countries, or stewing for the eventual revolt.

       Biden's rant on Bin Laden was disgusting. I understand, people are still hurt about 9/11, but come on! Rather than teaching people about trying to heal both cultures through understanding and love, thousands of people are celebrating hate by cheering for another pointless murder that was supposed to be the entire reason we were in this war and has accomplished nothing towards getting us out of the middle east. But hey, "We sure put a boot up that Bin Ladens ass! Don't Mess the US!"

       I'm all about fighting for truth guys, But what these two political conventions have showed me is that, there are just sooo many dumb people. Almost too many. The way they looked when Obama came out on stage. Lord, savior, Obama. It's religion now, and if you're atheist and have ever tried to show logic to a christian, that's what we're dealing with now. How do you fight that? When the crowd started chanting USA after every Biden "Bin Laden is dead and GM is alive" catch phrase, I was looking into plane tickets for somewhere else to move to.

       That was my exact thought.  People were actually crying when he came on stage.  I couldn't believe it.  I have a hard time putting it into words.

       I'm also tired of Gabby Giffords.  I'm glad that her recovery is coming along, but the Democrats are seriously milking her for everything that she's worth, and she is either too (literally) brain damaged to realize it or else she is compliant with it.  She's now nothing more than just a tool to get the crowd good and emotional (and
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       logical) before their savior comes out to greet them.

       Yup, it is pretty disheartening.  I watched most of both conventions on c-span and have never felt so cynical about the American political system.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there is hope. I know that a lot more people are "waking up," we just tend to be quiet and go unnoticed. I have hope that by 2016 or 2020 we might have something resembling fair elections/the rule of law in this country.

       Look at it this way.  Politics is like a bunch of 5 year olds watching pro wrestling.  Poke fun at the bad guy and root for the good guy.  Meanwhile they are both doing steroids and doing lines of blow off hookers.

       Whattta mean? He has done 3 good things for me. I got healthcare choices, I can go to planned parenthood if I choose to have a baby and can afford its healthcare, and I can serve in the military and hopefully get married some day without being in the closet. A republican would never have given me these options and a libertarian is against them too, even if they say they think a state should decide. The southern states decided they wanted slavery. States rights. Yeah, I don't want anything to do with that kind of mindset.

       NDAA, assignation of US citizens, continuation/escalation/creation of wars/ assassination of us citizens/continuation of bush era torture policy/fast and the furious (latest in a long, long string of government scandals) etc. These create a dark world that will blot out the petty progress you envision. I actually I agree with you - Obama is clearly the lesser of two evils - but none the less, he is still an evil.  And should we tolerate and praise an evil, just because it is lesser? I do not think so.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean man you're jerking over being able to serve in the military and not be discriminated against. Imagine a USA where similar jobs (in enumeration) were available en masse - except they didn't involve all the darkness of the cause and job. Yeah.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I don't want anything to do with your moral relativism about how Obama really isn't that bad. GOSH DAMN, THE REPUBLICANS ARE SITH LORDS, AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE ONLY SOMEWHAT DARK JEDI. WHEE I'LL VOTE THE DEMOCRATS IN!!!!!!

       The party absolutely believes that a state can
       <em>
        choose
       </em>
       to ban gay marriage. If all the private businesses in a state decide they wont sell food to blacks, so be it, states and private property rights. Hell, they probably wouldn't mind if a state decided that only white male landowners should get a vote, because
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       was the original intent in the constitution.

       Voters don't cast votes based on factual details about issues, or future plans/positions that may help address issues.  They vote based on sound bytes that resonate at a subconscious level. You can't say this about everyone, but you can say it about a very large percentage of the voting population. People make quick judgements with a lack of information, rather than intellectual decisions based on truth and knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Politicians knows this and herd the sheeple with well known psychological tactics, priming each and every one of us toward a decision in their favor.  It works because buzz words and sound bytes are all we have floating around in the hollow space between our ears. The problem is not the politicians or the system (though both are broken and need improvement,) it's the people, and the flawed processes we use to make decisions (Not to say there wouldn't be a ton of obstruction even if we started to do this more effectively.) The politicians simply use the best tactics at their disposal to achieve the results they desire, even if that is done with a lack of ethics or values. If the approach wasn't as effective as it is, it would have changed already.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's hard to assume a crazy person with an oxygen tank who thinks Obama is a Muslim, wearing a giant fuzzy hat with blinking stars and stripes, sat down and reviewed hard facts to develop a position on an issue. They should have, but dancing with the stars was on or something else equally ridiculous. That is a stereotype, but I would love to see a real study. People have power in numbers, 1 vote each, and that power is thrown out the window when a vote is cast without sound judgement. You should have to pass a god damned test about the pertinent facts and issues facing a nation, before you are allowed to cast a vote to help set the course of the naton. Otherwise it's a destructive process of power shifts and policy changes, whether or not they make logical sense.

       I look at it like this. Look at the Republican field. There's no chance any of those Jesus-freak conservatives would ever get (honestly) elected. Those guys serve the purpose of making Obama look good by comparison, and Obama is just more of the same. He's another puppet. There's no political solution. I'll eat my words if Obama actually does something with his second term, but I'm not holding my breath. That's a hard viewpoint to show people.

       It seems obvious to me. The Republican nominee hides the millions of dollars he earned from dismantling American companies in offshore accounts while his wife plays with dancing horses. He wears magic underwear, he's trying to take womens' rights back to the 50's, and he condescendingly attacks anyone who thinks about the issues. I can't think of a candidate who would resonate
       <em>
        less

       with a broad swath of the American public. It's a joke. He exists to lose to Obama.

       My life has changed between the last election and this one.  I'm a home owner, a father, and the sole breadwinner for the family.  I'm on the low end of middle class and I figured now may be a good time to listen to both sides and see who has my best interests at heart.

       Neither party has your best interests at heart. They are only looking out for themselves and that's what you need to do. Look out for your new family and your home. I'm not saying go full prepper retard, but seriously think about investing in a shotgun for home defense and stock away some food, water, fuel and emergency supplies. It's better to have them and not need them than need them and not have them.

       I strongly believe that most media outlets intentionally report on things like the more "energetic conference" and other things that don't care.  Viewers are intentionally kept in the dark.  Some media outlets are worse than others, but none of them are really trying to get to the bottom of anything.
      </p>

       My local news in my area is on an ABC station, so I used to just watch ABC World News after my local news was over with.  I had to quit watching it because it was such a joke.  Same with Good Morning America.  I watch CBS now, which I think is a little better.  It still suffers from the same problems, though, just slightly less so.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mainly watch the news just to know what the current topics are and what's going on in the mainstream world.  You can't ever take anything that is reported and just assume that it's true or important, though.

       Nobody is trying.  There was a supposed "political analyst" on CBS This Morning today talking about the Democratic National Convention.  Charlie Rose asked him if he thought the convention was a success and the guy said "yes" and then went on a rant about how wonderful Obama and the convention was.  In the middle of it, he actually stopped and said
       <em>
        "My politics might be showing a little here, but I don't care."
       </em>
       Gale King was right beside him agreeing with everything that he said and telling him to go ahead and let it out.  It was pathetic for "professional" journalists to be talking this way.  The only person who tried to remain neutral was Charlie Rose.

       That's just one example, but it happens all of the time.  I had to quit watching ABC News because it's such a joke.  All it does is distract you with useless things that don't matter and when given the chance, praise the Democrats.

       I had NPR (WNYC) on this morning and they were all tripping over each other to praise the DNC while smashing the RNC but I never got any information at all.  And that's NPR who's not add driven, is mostly neutral, and boasts about both those things.

       I really get more offended that the two major parties can get together for a convention and there's nothing to talk about afterwards besides crowd reaction and which bands played where.

       Politics should be boring.  We shouldn't have fun crunching numbers and discussing policy.  Lives are on the line every second of every day and the people who pull the trigger are too busy screaming general BS that doesn't have a hint of substance.

       Study history to understand the two party system, &amp; even more understand the history of the financial system. Obama for sure has done some scary things already, don't really need to go much further then the NDAA in my book but in the end. Maybe why this election may be feeling so much scarier is because more of the facade has been falling apart, &amp; the ridiculousness has increased. Hence the terms Obamny &amp; Robama. There is more then a simple red or blue vote to fix the problems. Also don't look for a 'center' view, look for a completely outside one from the entire system, only then will you understand it better. Carrol Quigley, Edward Bernays, Gary Allen, torrents of all three can be found... or your local book store/online shopping can also find these interesting historical perspectives. Some interesting videos can be found here:

       As with all information be a skeptic, research the claims yourself of all input to form some sort of intelligence. Create your own opinion &amp; then share it :)

       Sadly, I think it's too late to turn back (I'm not so sure there ever was anything to turn back to). The more you peel the onion the more you find that we all are slaves to the Government and they will do what they want.

       What's worse---this is the pinnacle of mind shaping.  You're giving people the illusion that they're somehow ahead of the curve and educated by being leftist---much like how college students' erroneously believe they're so educated by being leftist fools as well---what makes reddit WORSE---is that it's interactive.  People are receiving social Qi-points in the form of upvotes for exhibiting the toolish behavior that the 'Invisible' Hand that is control of our media and government since the 1860s is trying to implant in the worlds' collective brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are extremely small minded---and I fear that shit like reddit is the perfect storm of leftist indoctrination that could finally send our world off the edge of lunacy toward the new world order wet dream.  It's fucking scary out there right now.

       He lost. And r/politics beat him too. Seems like your very nostalgic about his failure both on the national stage twice and also on reddit. I feel sorry for you.

       Thanks for the detailed response... and it reads much better... maybe it was just a couple of your short comments that came off as a bit 'odd'.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do agree with what you're saying... you describe it very well.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, we agree to agree.
