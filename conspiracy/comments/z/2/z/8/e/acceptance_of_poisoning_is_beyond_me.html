       What I don't get is how people tolerate environmental poisons.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Silver" Amalgam is fine.  It is just more mercury than silver.  But that's okay.  It's just a little bit of mercury.
      </p>
      <p>
       BPA is fine.  It just a little bit of BPA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pesticides are fine. It is just a little bit of pesticides on your food.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fluoride is fine, it's just a little bit of it in your water (sometimes from unnatural sources).
      </p>
      <p>
       Thimerosal is fine, it's just a little bit of it.  Or a lot.  We did flip flop and banned it into trace amounts now.  In other words it wasn't even necessary to put that much in vaccines. A O K.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aluminum is fine, its just in little amounts too!
      </p>
      <p>
       Lists go on and on.  Optimally, you should have none of it.  So why the fuck do people just go "oh it's okay to stress my body out all the time".
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are so many people sick and fat too?  Is it really commonplace for human beings to always be sick and on medications?  I find it hard to find some one completely medication free.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do I think happens when you add it all up?  Modern Society.

       Do you really think people are more sick now than when we had people dropping like flies a century ago? Every wonder why the population is increasing at a faster rate?  Probably because we aren't sicker than we used to be. Also, ever wonder why obesity seems to increase dramatically with and increased access to cheap and quick meals?  Sure doesn't seem like poison to me.

       Population increase?  Are you referring to the influx of illegal aliens and various immigration policies?  Obesity certainly does have a relationship to certain types of food and additives.  Obesity isn't so healthy, almost poisonous really.

       Bong-Nolose is referring to global population increase which, unless you subscribe to some of the more far-reaching conspiracies, doesn't have to do with illegal aliens.

       It's not just about what particular substances are toxic or harmful; routes and amounts are very important too. For example, a gallon of water on your skin would not be harmful to you. A cup of water in your lungs would be.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are lots of potentially hazardous substances that in small enough amounts can be metabolized by your body without causing harm. Alternatively, in large enough amounts, pretty much anything can be a poison. Which is not to say that we should be okay with it if a company was found to be putting arsenic in our food or something, but your reasoning here is flawed.

       Chlorine is an extremely dangerous chemical. If you drank pure chlorine you would die, but if you put a tiny amount of it in the water, it's completely harmless. In fact, it'll keep you healthy by preventing deadly bacteria from growing in the pipes.

       I think the real issue is that we have several of what I call "non-afflictions" (diseases/ailments that people are diagnosed with but only cause slight issues - RLS for example) that people are constantly diagnosed with. When you have enough of these non-afflictions you are bound to find one for everyone that comes into a doctor's office.

       Our bodies are resilient- the reason we've been around so long is because we're built to not drop dead at the exposure to trace amounts of things that don't mesh well with our body chemistry.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are so many "poisons" around us (we breathe in small amounts carbon dioxide all the time and we're fine with that, however if we breathed in only C02 we'd die) that if we weren't built to cope with handling things that don't mesh with us, we as a species wouldn't have made it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It adds up to the fact that a little bit of something won't kill you because our bodies are made to tolerate it, but a lot will.

       I don't disagree, I just have serious doubts that those trace chemicals affect us to a degree worth stressing out over. I'm inclined to be more concerned with the terrible things that almost everyone does in large doses like drinking alcohol, eating overly processed foods, sitting and staring at various screens for hours and hours a day- those things likely cause us as a species WAY more damage; let's worry about that stuff first before we lose sleep about the trace amounts of BPA we may or may not come into contact with throughout the course of the day.

       I understand that correlation doesn't imply causation, but how do you rectify your notion of trace chemicals lowering lifespan with the fact that the average human lifespan has increased substantially in the past two centuries? If they were going to lower our lifespan, I'd think that they would have started doing it by now, yet a story just on Reddit today posed the notion that someone born today might live to 150.

       Crazy how cancer rates have increased as we have gotten better at detecting it.  Every wonder why people just dropped dead at such young ages just a century ago? Also your anecdotal evidence of life being longer is demonstrably false

       Yes, the average life-span for the human race has increased, not in the way you think it has though. Yes, 100+ years ago, people were capable of living into their 70's, 80's, and sometimes 90's. However, infant and child mortality rates have dramatically dropped. This decrease in infant and child mortality is thanks to the advances of medical science. As less and less people die between the ages of 1-20, the average lifespan of people increases, because more and more people are making it into their old age.

       As for diseases like cancer and autism (which is always a favorite among conspiracy theorists), which have seen a marked increase in diagnosis, of course the % of diagnosis is going to increase when you give something a name and you begin to learn how to identify it.

       That isn't how it used to be. It used to be, before we had all those industrial processes and byproducts and medicines that people died of natural things, like infections from poor hygiene and the elements and by tooth and claw in the night, usually around the age of 35.

       Its because people don't see the detrimental effects right away, like smoking. So if they dont stop smoking when everyone tells them its bad including the government, then why would they complain about fluoride or BPA when they're being told its fine, and you don't see the detrimental effects for years. And the to vaccine crowed, polio was on the decline before the vaccine was administered. The leading cause of polio today is the vaccine, hows that one for ya?

       Well I am a smoker, but I disagree with fluoride and all these other chemicals that are in pesticides and such. Here's the reason why.
      </p>
      <p>
       I CHOOSE to smoke. I know it can lead to health problems. In fact I know 2 people that have died from cancer directly cause by smoking. But I do not CHOOSE to ingest pesticides and fluoride. I am forced to put these alien chemicals in my body. I cannot drink water essential to my survival without fluoride in it (maybe if I spent $5 a quart in Fiji or something). I cannot eat food essential to my survival without ingesting pesticides preservatives and who knows what else they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's just my 2 cents.

       Yes. It looks like it saves lives, is effective on many HPV strains, and has very few side effects. Seems better than the influenza vaccine (flu shot is still very important though as the flu will kill you very soon whereas HPV kills you later in life).

       Fair enough. But the existence of harmful vaccines doesn't discredit the good ones, nor the idea of a vaccine.

       Did I say that it did? There are obviously lots of arguments in favor of vaccines. What you don't hear a lot about is arguments against them, and there are many reasons for that, many of which have to do with money and the pharmacuetical industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccines need to be tested rigorously before being mandated as a requirement for all people of a certain sex or age group, and that doesn't always happen, because the motive is almost always profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       People need to be aware of the risks, even if there are lots of positive aspects to the vaccine argument.

       It's statements like this that are the problem.  By saying something like this, you plant a seed masquerading as objectivity into the mind of someone who doesn't understand the thing.  It's what Fox News does, and you should feel bad about that.

       Smallpox and Polio being nearly wiped out are enough of an argument for vaccines that the idea that HPV is a bad vaccine shouldn't dissuade anyone from getting vaccines.

        Vaccines have been one of the most important public health interventions ever developed. As a new study notes, past analyses have estimated that the childhood immunization schedule prevents 42,000 deaths and 20 million cases of disease—and that's only for the kids born in a single year. The estimated savings is currently at $14 billion a year.
       </p>
       <p>
        With the exception of safe water, no other modality, not even antibiotics, has had such a major effect on mortality reduction and population growth.
