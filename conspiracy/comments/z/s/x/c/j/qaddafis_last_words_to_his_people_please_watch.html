       -- In the name of Allah, the beneficent, the merciful..
      </p>
      <p>
       For 40 years, or was it longer,I can't remember, I did all I could to give people houses, hospitals, schools, and when they were hungry, I gave them food, I even made Benghazi into farmland from the desert, I stood up to attacks from that cowboy Reagan, when he killed my adopted orphaned daughter, he was trying to kill me, instead he killed that poor innocent child, then I helped my brothers and sisters from Africa with money for the African Union, did all I could to help people understand the concept of real democracy, where people's committees ran our country, but that was never enough, as some told me, even people who had 10 room homes, new suits and furniture, were never satisfied, as selfish as they were they wanted more, and they told Americans and other visitors, they needed "democracy," and "freedom," never realizing it was a cut throat system, where the biggest dog eats the rest, but they were enchanted with those words, never realizing that in America, there was no free medicine, no free hospitals, no free housing, no free education and no free food, except when people had to beg or go to long lines to get soup, no, no matter what I did, it was never enough for some, but for others, they knew I was the son of Gamal Abdel Nasser, the only true Arab and Muslim leader we've had since Salah' a' Deen, when he claimed the Suez Canal for his people, as I claimed Libya, for my people, it was his footsteps I tried to follow, to keep my people free from colonial domination—from thieves who would steal from us—
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I am under attack by the biggest force in military history, my little African son, Obama wants to kill me, to take away the freedom of our country, to take away our free housing, our free medicine, our free education, our free food, and replace it with American style thievery, called "capitalism," but all of us in the Third World know what that means, it means corporations run the countries, run the world, and the people suffer, so, there is no alternative for me, I must make my stand, and if Allah wishes, I shall die by following his path, the path that has made our country rich with farmland, with food and health, and even allowed us to help our African and Arab brothers and sisters to work here with us, in the Libyan Jammohouriyah,
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not wish to die, but if it comes to that, to save this land, my people, all the thousands who are all my children, then so be it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let this testament be my voice to the world, that I stood up to crusader attacks of NATO, stood up to cruelty, stood up to betrayal, stood up the West and its colonialist ambitions, and that I stood with my African brothers, my true Arab and Muslim brothers, as a beacon of light, when others were building castles, I lived in a modest house, and in a tent, I never forgot my youth in Sirte, I did not spend our national treasury foolishly, and like Salah'a'deen, our great Muslim leader, who rescued Jerusalem for Islam, I took little for myself...
      </p>
      <p>
       In the West, some have called me "mad," "crazy," but they know the truth but continue to lie, they know that our land is independent and free, not in the colonial grip, that my vision, my path, is, and has been clear and for my people and that I will fight to my last breath to keep us free, may Allah almighty help us to remain faithful and free.
      </p>

       I always found it snide how israel claims to be the only democracy in the middle east, yet their citizenry continuously vote for racist, warmongering, fundamental zionists to run their country. Yet when the Palistinians vote for Hamas or Egypt votes for Muslim brotherhood they have the gall to point fingers and call them savages, not realizing they are just as bad.

        Interesting perspective on his people's reactions to their leader.

       Think about how much different the armed motorcades are here, leading the President from guarded building to guarded building.

      <p>
       I have also read this speech before, there were a few videos on Youtube that reference it but the links I had have been 'pulled for copyright violation' and I haven't had a chance to find mirrors for them yet. Here is a link to a
       <a href="http://www.sundaytimes.lk/110417/Timestwo/t2_07.html">
        news site that references this, as to indicate that OP didn't make it up.

       As for further reasoning on US intervention,
       <a href="http://www.goldbuzzer.com/is-gold-the-real-reason-for-nato-s-action-in-libya/">
        just prior to the air strikes, Gaddafi was releasing the gold dinar as an alternative form of currency to purchase oil with.
       </a>
       Also, considering the massive amount of gold he had in his country, and the instability of the oil market and the US dollar....just something to think about.

       We often say the best things when we know we are in real peril. The man was made a king cause God allowed it. For whatever reason it was what it was. I do not think for a moment he was as benevolent as he holds himself out to be but then again I was never there, never met him.
