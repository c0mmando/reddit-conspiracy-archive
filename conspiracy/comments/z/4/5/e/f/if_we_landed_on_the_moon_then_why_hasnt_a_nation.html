       If I was a nation such as China or Russia and wanted to go to the moon, why not land somewhere near to conduct experiments and also go by to just check to see if Americans weren't lying. Just a thought.

       yea so the weird thing is all of this came to a head in the mid 1990s... necessitating a presidential pardon for the Robert Gallo guy....  and then there was like an investigative committee that was dismissed after they dug up a shit ton of dirt on the dude... and in the end they tried to make it seem like all he did was steal a viral sample from the french...
      </p>
      <p>
       but never do they acknowledge that he changes the conclusion of the original paper which was "Despite intensive research efforts, the causative agent of AIDS has not yet been identified." (you can see where he crosses this statement out in that link).  He also changes the title of the paper to include the word "cytopathic"... which means it kills cells... yet nowhere in this published paper or any of the initial papers do they ever establish this thing killed a cell.... and that mixed with him saying he has pictures of HIV, even when his electron microscopy person tells him its cellular debris (thats that first letter there).....  its one of the most mind blowing derps of all times.  i don't claim to know whats going on here... all i know is the evidence is pretty clear that someone lied and made a lot of non-scientific shit up in those first papers.

       So I guess tuberculosis doesn't cause death and hepatitis doesn't cause cirrhosis? Just because it's not completely understood by science how pathogens affect cells doesn't mean it's not understood THAT they affect cells.

       Citing Gallo is useless as there have been volumes researched and written since then.

       Almost all research funded in the United States for HIV studies goes through Gallo to this very day. He is the head of the
       <a href="http://www.ihv.org/default.html">
        http://www.ihv.org/default.html
       </a>
       Institute for Human Virology.  All samples of "HIV" for research purposes come from his institute and the NIH. So citing Gallo, who still is very much in charge of this thing, and whos name is cited on a whole array of this amorphous,non-specic group of "volumes researched and written" is quite fucking relevant.  (heres 10 pages or so with his name on them since 2008
       <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_ylo=2008&amp;amp;q=Robert+Gallo&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;as_sdt=0,44">

       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't argue anything about causal links... i argued that there is a clear case of someone falsifying information at a foundational level that is at the very top of this institution and is currently in charge of deciding who gets funding for research.

       unfortunately the implications of such a fraud open most peoples minds to all sorts of speculation... so all the HIV conspiracy theories get lumped into one unit...  whether its a population control mechanism instituted by Kissinger, or a way to exterminate undesirables, or vaccine program gone awry...  theres a whole host of them, of which are all purely speculation, with limited evidence in support.... and they weaken the impact of the fact of the matter... that a crook is in charge of this institution and currently deciding who gets funded and who doesn't.

       Why bother with that and spend massive amount of money, when they can just point to the video of the pod launching off from the moon, its classic 60's special effects, where the pod just puffs out a little bit of air, no flames, no continuous ignition, no major winds blowing, no dust flying around, no sound, no nothing. It just goes pack, a little bit of air and white smoke and that's it.

       I mean classic 60's movie special effects.

       The flag isn't there. Rather, even if the flag were real, it would be gone now. It was blasted over when the LLM took off. It was made of Nylon and has been disintegrated by sunlight already.

       Sure lets spend about 2 billion USD to see if a flag is sitting there. What an awesome way to spend our money.

       There's going to be private spaceflights to the moon soon anyway so they can check when they get there. I bet you the Apollo 11 site will be a HUGE tourist attraction soon.

       I was just curious. If a nation truly didn't believe that we went there, then it would be the ultimate disgrace to prove that we lied about the whole thing.

       There is no nation that believes the landing was a hoax. The only place that I have seen such a claim in on some random television shows and online. No other nation, including our own, has come out and said that it was a hoax.
