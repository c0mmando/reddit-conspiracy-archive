       So I turn my PC on not too long ago to see I have updates that need to be installed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see what the updates are, and it says 1 Important update: Skype 5.10 for Windows.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought to myself: I don't use Skype, why is this an important update??
      </p>
      <p>
       I recall a little while back Microsoft buying Skype, or Microsoft doing something weird with Skype.
      </p>
      <p>
       And after a quick search here, I find
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/search?q=skype&amp;restrict_sr=on">
        these
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it very strange that Microsoft has decided this is an IMPORTANT software that needs to be installed, rather than something optional.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is exactly why I don't allow updates to install automatically...
      </p>
      <p>
       Did anyone notice this? Am I just being overly cautious?

       This is r/conspiracy, friend.  You really think writing off all these bizarre Windows updates as "accidents" will quell our paranoid/inquisitive minds?  Truth is,
       <strong>
        you don't know
       </strong>
       what is in Windows, nor its updates, and relying on a third party explanation won't absolve that fact.

       Actually I do and I knew about the flub update as it happened.  Speaking with a microsoft rep was my source, but I added the link because you (not you specificly but the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       A Microsoft rep has no more of an idea of what's in Windows than you do.  Nor do most of the programmers - each one works on a tiny feature, much like all the scientists working on the Manhattan Project who had no idea that they were working on the bomb.

       When did I assume any of that?  You seem pretty defensive.

       Why would you assume a MS Rep would have any information as to the inner workings of the OS?  How could you possibly know what's going on inside the OS?

       I am on the defense.  Got a bit hammered over this so I was standing my ground.  I never said the rep had any understanding...the skype push was done accidently - as soon as it was done we were notified.  My comments never stated anything about the inner workings, who knows what, etc...

       Why would you even pretend to know what you're talking about if you admit that the rep doesn't know either?
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is, you and your rep and most people have no idea what is in any Windows Update.  Why would you try to assuage the paranoia of a person without knowing anything relevant?

       Again, I do not/did not say I knew what was in the update.  I was informed that an update slipped and it was rolled back.  This doesn't mean the sky is falling and it sure as hell doesn't mean Microsoft is in line with some conspiracy.  Although thinking about this...most updates can be rolled back and removed.  Need to change my name to repetition...although my typing is getting better.

       So let me get this right.  MS slips and releases an update by accident to install something on everyone's OS - for some sort of conspiracy.  Then turns around and states (publicly) that rebooting their servers pushed an update.  All that run around when they could have kept quiet and 90% of the world would have been clueless.  This is the part I have a hard time dealing with.  Does that make sense?

       It's true that OSX is based on an opensource foundation (BSD), however, they can change that as they like and keep the changes closed if they so choose (and they do).  So, in the end, it is just as closed as Windows.

        My question to you though is what kind of security risk do you believe this presents?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Honestly, I don't know.  Do any of us know if there are backdoors in Windows/OSX?  I don't.  Given the megacorporation-biggovernment relationship these days, I wouldn't put it past them to have inserted spying abilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <strong>
        only
       </strong>
       reason to use OSX or Windows is because of the applications that run solely on those platforms.  If you can make due with open office etc, then go to Linux.  There is nothing special about OS GUI's anymore.  If you try Ubuntu/Mint/etc you'll find their interfaces to be slick, professional, easy-to-use, etc.  As I said, the bottom line is application compatibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask yourself: in this day and age, why is my operating system not opensource?  This is basic computer functionality.  It is old and done.  There is no OS-specific reason to choose a closed source OS anymore, apart from a few edge cases.

        I need OS X for audio production. Linux and windows both fail miserably when put up to this task mostly due to audio latency when using a live monitor. Also I am not sure sure about your experience in this field.

       Agreed, I produce music myself and use an unconnected Windows box for the task.  While Linux does suck for audio production, it is still usable, but is really missing the apps.

      <p>
       That's a pretty bold statement.  The OS could do so if it wished, and hide it from a software firewall (not hardware).  Not saying it happens, but it could.  Besides, there are many other ways to sneak by you from an OS perspective.

       Sure.  Unplug them both.  ;)  Anyways, it's not just about security.  There are bigger reasons to use an open-source OS.

       OS X is mostly open source.  The GUI stack and the Cocoa libraries are closed source, but the OS / Unix layer itself is open source.

       So let me get this right.  MS slips and releases an update by accident to install something on everyone's OS - for some sort of conspiracy.  Then turns around and states (publicly) that rebooting their servers pushed an update.  All that run around when they could have kept quiet and 90% of the world would have been clueless.  This is the part I have a hard time dealing with.  Does that make sense?
