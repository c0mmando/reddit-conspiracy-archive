     Fake question in the Obama AMA?

       I'm not sure if this has been brought up before, but I found one question in the Obama AMA very suspect. User "hmlee" submitted a question about how he was graduating grad school and there were no jobs, etc. Obama replied with a 300 word piece straight from his campaign about how much he's doing/done to create jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       My main concern with this are a few things:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) User "hmlee" was created moments before the question was asked.
2) The user's story is strikingly similar to political stereotyping. They might as well have led off with "I'm an 18-24 male who is concerned about the economy".
3) The tone used is in no way Redditesque.
4) Finally, the closing comment/question is VERY slanted call to action:
      </p>
      <p>
       "What can I say to encourage those in similar situations as I am to show up again in November? What hope can you offer us for your second term?"
      </p>
      <p>
       I fully believe user "hmlee" is a campaign staffer.

       Here are 5 other questions to consider.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         What were the terms that President Obama was given the username PresidentObama when it was already an active account.

         Why was access restricted to only this post when I was allowed to log in everywhere else? I was only able to view the post after logging out.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why were some of the more provocative questions deleted when it was an AMA?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why was President Obama sitting at his laptop accepted as proof when it could have been and most likely was a staffer answering questions?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Were there any guidelines or restrictions that President Obama requested in order to do the AmA?

       Another one: there were several typos in PresidentObama's posts. I find it hard to believe that an intelligent Harvard Law graduate would make more grammatical errors while typing than I.

       This might have a perfectly innocent reason, as the rapidly changing comments page probably wreaks havoc on reddit's caching and the logged out version may be easier to cache than the individual logged in version.

       Just a thought in answer to the PresidentObama active account.. Maybe he has been an active user? But only until the AMA, was it verified as to be him?

       In his defense, during the AMA a lot of the login servers were screwed up. I can see someone making a new account to bypass not being able to log onto their regular account. He does sound pretty generic though, and it does sound very slanted.
