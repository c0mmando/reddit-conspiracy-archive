    <div class="md"><p>here the basic summary:  HIV is a complete fabrication, there is no consensus of scientists, there is only a very vocal cartel of a few government sponsored researchers that espouse very very questionable and incomplete science as conclusive evidence that HIV causes AIDS. </p>

<p>No one can question this hypothesis. Those that do, are no longer able to obtain grants for research and are in effect stifled. </p>

<p>The man in charge of the HIV industry, <a href="http://www.ihv.org/about/robert_gallo.html">Dr. Robert Gallo</a>, is the main person who decides who gets funded and who does not. The man was found guilty of scientific misconduct by a congressional committee, and <a href="http://www.fearoftheinvisible.com/fraud-in-key-hiv-research-background">there is significant evidence that he committed gross fraud in the initial HIV causes AIDS studies</a>, including but not limited to changing the original conclusion of researchers which was &quot;Despite intensive research efforts, the causative agent of AIDS has not yet been identified.&quot; to the exact opposite without evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would add to conspiracynut and say that the video points out the testing is so flawed. You can send your blood to several different labs and get several different results. There is no test for HIV, they can only test HIV antibodies. The real crime in my opinion in the misdiagnosis in Africa. They don&#39;t even administer a HIV antibody test in most cases, they go by symptoms. If you have diarrhea for more than a month ect ect. Why this is such a crime is because the international community can write off all these deaths and say its from HIV, when in fact is malnutrition, dirty water, and cheap curable and preventable diseases. </p>

<p>PCR has been around since the 80ies and modern HIV tests are a two step process where the first detection is done via antibodies (has a cross reactivity with some other AB) generates false positives. The second step is detection via PCR, where you directly measure if HIV RNA is present, and since our fundamental understanding of biology hasn&#39;t changed yet, the presence of viral RNA means that something bad is about to happen, here AIDS. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This shows a fundamental lack of understanding about PCR. PCR is used to amplify primer DNA (or rather the complement to primer DNA), primers which you add to the culture. You cannot use PCR to claim existence of a foreign virus. PCR amplification only shows that somewhere in the DNA found in a culture (this includes the endogenous DNA found in the cell), the strand that complements your primer is found. Using PCR would hold more sway, if they were able to show that a pure isolation of the virus can be found.... to date that paper has not been written. The &quot;isolations&quot; of HIV are all highly contaminated with cellular debris... which means the RNA/DNA that is in the culture they are using PCR on is also infected with RNA/DNA other than that of their phantom virus.</p>

<p>And since &quot;HIV&quot; only contains 9 genes or so, depending on what source you cite, theres a good chance they are not specific to this virus and are found in the complementary human DNA sequence (or whatever other cellular detritus is in their &quot;isolations&quot;).</p>

<p>How did they arrive at the primer which they have added to these cultures, which they are then in turn amplifying. I&#39;d like to read that paper.</p>

<p>They are misusing PCR to justify the existence of their phantom virus, so much that inventor of PCR and nobel prize winner Kari Mullis is one of the most vocal and adamant proponents of the &quot;HIV is a myth&quot; school of thought. Dr. Mullis is one of the prominent researchers interviewed in this video.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is from 2001, and the science in it is rather up to date. It is by no means invalid because the year it was written.</p>

<p>HIV isn&#39;t what is being cultured. In this study, you will see the only thing they are using to determine the existence of HIV is the ELISA p24 protein detection.  This is not a test for foreign virus. This is a test for an ubiquitous protein, heavily concentrated around the golgi apparatus, that shows up in healthy cell cultures as well. </p>

<p>To say that p24 was indicative of only being a capsid protein, and not from the cells themselves, you would have to have a pure isolate of HIV, of which no method exists to obtain this. All &quot;isolates&quot; of HIV are heavily contaminated with cell detritus. This paper has only shown they have detected a ubiquitous protein, and by no means have they detected a virus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I linked is an abstract on a protocol for culturing HIV in Monocytes and you do need a HI Virus for that to work, also there are HIV sequence databases so you know exactly how the virus looks like and it&#39;s gene sequence.</p>

<p>A common factor of all HIV strains is p24, so testing for p24 makes sense and please show me where and how p24 is found on healthy cells, we are talking about the capsid protein here, there seems to be a p24 protein involved in the golgi apparatus too. I have already written that ELISA can produce false positives but PCR is rather good at detecting HIV. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have the numbers in my head but the two step test is very reliable. With the ELISA (Antibody test) you get false positives, which is actually good false negatives would be far worse. The false positives are then tested via PCR where you can def. rule out a HIV infection (of course it takes some time post infection until you can get results). 
I don&#39;t want to talk about the situation in Africa, because if you have no basic healthcare and coverage you will be running into alot of problems.
And yes there are some misdiagnosed cases imho, but these are not AIDS, because AIDS = HIV by definition (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency</a>) </p>

<p>The RNA sequences detected by PCR cannot be said to be pathogenic. PCR does not test for pathogens. PCR amplifies KNOWN DNA/RNA sequences, regardless of if they came from a pathogen or the cell&#39;s own DNA. How do you know HIV&#39;s sequence beforehand? How do you know its specific to HIV and not other stuff in the culture? If you could provide me with this paper, it would be great.  Ive been looking for it for many a year.</p>

<p>That is why you use PCR for testing, HIV has been sequenced, so you know how the RNA looks like and then you just search for it, there is not more to it. What I really doubt is that a body cell would produce a retrovirus killing T-Cells/Monocytes and that is what these RNA Sequence detected does. RNA is a blueprint for Proteins and this RNA detected encodes for a lot of unhealthy proteins to the human body. </p>

<p>Actually, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/9802/03/earliest.aids/">the earliest reported case of AIDS was in 1959.</a> It wasn&#39;t until the late eighties that it became incredibly big.

<p>this disease came about so randomly and so decisively.</p>

<p>Actually, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/9802/03/earliest.aids/">the earliest reported case of AIDS was in 1959.</a> It wasn&#39;t until the late eighties that it became incredibly big. Except for a few fictional diseases (The Super Flu in Stephen King&#39;s <em>The Stand</em> and the disease in the movie Contagion), diseases need quite a few years to get big enough to be as widespread as AIDS is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>here the basic summary:  HIV is a complete fabrication, there is no consensus of scientists, there is only a very vocal cartel of a few government sponsored researchers that espouse very very questionable and incomplete science as conclusive evidence that HIV causes AIDS. </p>

<p>No one can question this hypothesis. Those that do, are no longer able to obtain grants for research and are in effect stifled. </p>

<p>The man in charge of the HIV industry, <a href="http://www.ihv.org/about/robert_gallo.html">Dr. Robert Gallo</a>, is the main person who decides who gets funded and who does not. The man was found guilty of scientific misconduct by a congressional committee, and <a href="http://www.fearoftheinvisible.com/fraud-in-key-hiv-research-background">there is significant evidence that he committed gross fraud in the initial HIV causes AIDS studies</a>, including but not limited to changing the original conclusion of researchers which was &quot;Despite intensive research efforts, the causative agent of AIDS has not yet been identified.&quot; to the exact opposite without evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would add to conspiracynut and say that the video points out the testing is so flawed. You can send your blood to several different labs and get several different results. There is no test for HIV, they can only test HIV antibodies. The real crime in my opinion in the misdiagnosis in Africa. They don&#39;t even administer a HIV antibody test in most cases, they go by symptoms. If you have diarrhea for more than a month ect ect. Why this is such a crime is because the international community can write off all these deaths and say its from HIV, when in fact is malnutrition, dirty water, and cheap curable and preventable diseases. </p>
