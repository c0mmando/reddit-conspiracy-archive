<p>declaring that such-and-such a vaccine supposedly doesn&#39;t work. (The current spread of whooping cough is the flavor of the month for this.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jesus Christ, will people learn some goddamn biology?  That&#39;s not what this means.  </p>

<p>The outbreak of pertussis is due to <em>decreases in vaccination.</em>  Pertussis has the highest herd immunity threshold of any preventable disease.  Once vaccination declines, the science dictates that the first disease we&#39;d see major outbreaks of is - you guessed it - Pertussis!</p>

<p>This <em>confirms</em> vaccination theory, not challenges it.</p>

<p>Every one of you who is talking about the vaccine conspiracy is completely scientifically illiterate.  If you&#39;re asking questions like &quot;HOW COME I NEED A NEW FLU SHOT EVERY YEAR&quot; or &quot;WHY DOES IT MATTER TO OTHER KIDS IF MINE IS VACCINATED&quot;, then go to fucking school, because the answers to these questions are <strong>readily available.</strong>  These questions are <em>actually</em> every bit as dumb as &quot;IF WE CAME FROM MONKEYS HOW COME THERES STILL MONKEYS&quot;, used to &quot;disprove&quot; evolution.</p>

<p>The only people who think this shit disproves vaccine theory are people who don&#39;t understand the actual science behind vaccine theory, and people who have been mislead by Andrew Wakefield, and Mike Adams (who runs NaturalNews.com, considered one of the most anti-science websites on the entire internet).  </p>

<p>Seriously, I&#39;m absolutely sick of having to answer the same stupid questions from people who saw a video on youtube, and think they&#39;re suddenly immunology experts.  I&#39;ve ACTUALLY studied this shit.  I&#39;ve ACTUALLY taken the classes.  I ACTUALLY know the theory.  Stop. This. Garbage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People don&#39;t trust the medical establishment because the medical establishment pushes unnecessary drugs - pushing some people to suicide - and largely stays mum about the environmental factors that are increasing cancer rates and other modern medical issues. The corrupt establishment, by discrediting themselves, pave the way for &quot;alternative&quot; quacks and witch doctors.</p>

<p>I&#39;m personally not passionate either way with the vaccine issue. Vaccines do make medical sense, but when an increasing amount of vaccines are being pushed it seems like more pharma industry profiteering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Congratulations, you&#39;ve been fooled by con men, like Mike Adams, and Alex Jones, whose very livelihood <em>depends</em> on you being ignorant of

    <div class="md"><p>I tend to listen to my doctor, take the pills and firmly believe she has my best interest as heart. (after all she&#39;s my sister in law)  </p>

<p>When I ask her about the effectiveness of vaccines she cites the usual studies and I agree - vaccines do indeed work. </p>

<p>When I ask her what the dangers are (particularly for a new vaccine) she will say there are none because the studies are simply not there.Fine. </p>

<p>For older vaccines like whole cell pertussis vaccine (DTPw) caused Frank encephalopathy, which is brain damage in a small number of children. Previous research from Guinnea-Bissau demonstrated that a single dose of pertussis vaccine in DTP shots doubled the mortality rate in infants and more than quadrupled the mortality rate after the second and third DTP doses. so I asked her  once again &quot;does this not bother you?&quot; The answer I got back was well we stopped using that in 1996&quot;</p>

<p>great!</p>

<p>but it took 11 years <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dpt-Shot-Harris-L-Coulter/dp/0446341037">after it was well known</a> to cause issues before it was replaced with acellular version that was more safe.. </p>

<p>While it&#39;s unfortunate for the kids involved (and doctors too) what happens in this situation is that parents (who are the gatekeepers of vaccines to children) will see this and put up a brick wall against anything because of the lack of trust.  </p>

<p>No doubt the vaccines worked but to the sacrifice of thousands of children and children&#39;s lives open the debate up and introduce conspiracy theories in the absence of facts around their usage.</p>

<p>Big pharma will always push a new vaccine as safe regardless of the actual safety. I&#39;t all about the marketing (which if you read <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2011/05/26/3225450.htm">this</a> article it will become clear that doctors are being used as sales people for the vaccine manufacturers) </p>

<p>1) Vaccines can infect people with other natural viruses, such as Hepatitis, due to purposefully negligent screening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I&#39;ve been a pretty active member for the past year or so. And actually, although I would agree for the most part that government funded studies are typically bullshit, there are exceptions to the rule. Given the fact that 99% of government studies act like vaccines are perfectly safe, a study that stands opposed to the rest is most likely not bullshit. Or maybe you&#39;re being sarcastic I&#39;m not sure....</p>

<p>Also, one way or another EVERY scientific study is government funded for the most part...university funding comes from the government and so does FDA/AMA/KIGGS funding etc. etc. Anything that can be touted as a &quot;scientific study&quot; WILL have funding from the government of a country one way or another 99.9% of the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s more likely that the vaccines are cheaply produced.  You hear that because vaccine A is safe, all vaccines are safe.  You hear that the definition of trace amounts of the chemicals that perserve them are changed when people question their safety.  You then realize that vaccines are the largest US export, and you see the money involved, and you wonder.</p>

<p>This is likely more the problem with unfettered capitalism, and I&#39;m a capitalist.  Vaccines are likely extremely useful in a very cases.  But, there&#39;s money is selling more, so bloggers bought, studies are produced and quashed, and disinfo is everywhere.</p>

<p>The solution is simple: exclude medical care from the capitalist system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is called disinformation. Most people who spread this disinformation are coming from the right place. They know there is something wrong with it, they know people are lying to them, but they come to the wrong conclusions. This damages the very cause they are trying to fight for by discrediting themselves. Vaccines are bad for children, especially if they contain any from of mercury or live virus. In the United States, they have many more vaccines on their schedule than all other countries. The misconception is that the reason for this is the powers that be want to make people sick. Although I&#39;m sure they don&#39;t mind when people get sick and have to pay money into the medical community, but that&#39;s not why they give us vaccines with chemicals in them. They do it because they make a lot of money doing it. Let me put it to you this way, if every American gave you a dollar, you would have 300 million dollars. If every American had to buy a vaccine from you, well you would get very rich, especially if you had one that was seasonal. Many of the added, potentially harmful and seemingly unnecessary, ingredients alarm people. This is what gets them thinking they are trying to make them sick. I won&#39;t doubt the premise completely, I&#39;m sure some elites do enjoy this fact, but keep in mind that each added ingredient increases the price of the vaccine. </p>

<p>Just to continue this idea with another conspiracy. I wonder how much it would cost the industrial company to dispose of its fluoride byproduct waste. I wonder, instead of paying for disposal of this toxic chemical if there was some way of not only getting rid of it for free, but making some money at the same time. Just something to think about. Is it bad for you? Of course it is. Is their goal to make you sick? Maybe, but I know for certain one of their traits is greed and they love money. </p>

<p>Edit : I&#39;d just like to give some quick thanks to everyone who made my comment the top under most controversial. This seems to happen a lot and I&#39;m very proud of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who needs whistleblowers when you can have the facts. Just look at the vaccine ingredients. Those are hard to come by, but it&#39;s possible. Pulling a well-known Bulgarian site that list those, I have no idea where to get that info in English.</p>

<p>Looking at the vaccines &quot;required&quot; to be administered to Bulgarian children (probably similar to the ones all around the EU), I can see the alluminum hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, mercury, formaldehyde and other nasty stuff in the ingredients list. I wouldn&#39;t want to inject myself or my children with those &quot;naturally-occurring&quot; chemicals, thank you very much.</p>

<p>I too am inclined to think there isn&#39;t a grand vaccination &quot;we&#39;ll make you sick and dumb, so you just obey the Illuminati elite&quot; conspiracy, but there&#39;s definitely tons of cash in there that&#39;s, to put it mildly, better spent elsewhere.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/swine-flu/7585599/Swine-flu-vaccine-did-not-trigger-potentially-deadly-neurological-condition.html">The Telegraph says &quot;Swine Flu vaccine did not cause Guillain-Barré syndrome&quot;</a> but when you look at the actual sources, the words of the researcher :</p>

<p>&quot;Dr. Souayah noted that 60 of the 62 cases of GBS following H1N1 vaccination occurred within six weeks of vaccination, with 51 cases occurring within the first two weeks.&quot;</p>

<p>“If you look at the [temporal] distribution, you see this curve. That curve is not normal,” said Dr. Souayah. The odds of such a distribution occurring by chance are “almost impossible,” he said, at less than 0.00002. He reported a similar temporal distribution among the 57 GBS cases following seasonal vaccination, with 51 of these cases occurring within the first two weeks after vaccination.</p>

<p>The ONLY evidence that vaccines cause autism - ALL OF IT - came from a man named Andrew Wakefield, who was discovered to be a fraud.  This claim has been debunked a dozen times, and yet people on r/conspiracy still believe it, because apparently, youtube videos by average joes are more reliable sources of medical knowledge than fucking medical journals and peer reviewed studies.</p>
