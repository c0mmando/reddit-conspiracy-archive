       Some people use lies to back up otherwise sound theories. If you point out that one aspect you're immediately written off as someone trying to poison the well or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like some people are so desperate to find the hidden truth that they'll look straight past ones that aren't hidden looking for something else. It's quite ironic.

      <p>
       Conspiracy theorists
       <strong>
        want
       </strong>
       to be proven wrong.  If you can fully debunk any theory,

       , so we can move on to another theory.

       If you can't debunk a theory with facts, you are going to be downvoted for being a "disinfo agent."

       We know the difference between someone using lies to back up a theory and someone who uses the facts.

       The times i call people out for being paid personas is when they discredit without reason. If they actually give a reason for why they think a certain way, a reason that logic can stand behind, i will discuss. If they say things like "you,re a moron" or a tinfoil hat comment without reasoning, i assume they are trying to discredit and derail the conversation rather than discuss.

       Calling someone a paid person because they called you a moron and thinking it is justified seems wrong to me.  It's not logical to conclude that someone calling you a moron or tinfoil hat wearer infers they are paid shills.

       If someone is trying to have a discussion, they don't call the other person a moron or imply they are crazy paranoid and should be wearing a tinfoil hat. People trying to discuss something give their opinion and ask questions of the other persons. If it seems wrong to you then you probably shouldn't do it. It seems right to me, so i do.

       I wonder about the effect of the shill calling has generally though.  I think it encourages general fear and mistrust.  Can you not be respectful or bite your tongue and hold yourself to a higher standard than those who act in the way you describe?

       I like to think it might make people aware that paid personas are an actual issue. I used to be blind to it, and assume others still are. I feel as long as i give reasons why i think that(something they don't do) i have committed no hypocrisy. I don't understand how it would generate fear. It would definitely generate mistrust, but that seems like a good idea. Why would you trust some random screen name? Should i be quiet if i see a problem?

       What makes you think they are? From what it sounds like - anyone that disagrees with you must be a paid persona, so I can see why you think they would be a problem, but that seems more personal, as opposed to something that is taken from evidence within

       When I joined I was hoping for a healthy amount of skepticism all around, not just on a few things. That's the first mode we hit when we hear something outlandish, but it seems some subscribers only become skeptical when they read about ammo purchases by government agencies they, of all people, deem to have no need for (when we all know that large ammo purchases have happened forever because, well even a local yokel cop has to hit the range sometime and the same holds true for federal agents).

       That would be the boiled down version, yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really all it entails is if someone gives info that makes your pet conspiracy invalid, that person isn't a shill necessarily. Fight fire with fire by getting all your sources together and show all the evidence that you have.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also have to know that some people, no matter what you show them will ever believe it. 
That's ok, you tried.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try to find evidence in the MSM (I know, I know :)) to give them. Maybe seeing it there will convince them.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's cool if you wanna get an idea out that you saw on a blogging website, but just because it's on there, doesn't make it true.
      </p>
      <p>
       My next point is: Don't use Alex Jones and infowars as your back up. If the world is really as bad as some of the Chicken-Little's here say it is, then why has Alex Jones
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       been suicided or disappeared? 
Because nothing he says holds water, pure and simple. Have you seen this man rage? No one has been that manic-depressive and lived to their 40's. 
Ok, AJ is kinda fun to watch and sometimes he has awesome interviews (like the one with MPG2 creator) but most of it is to sell advertising space and line his pockets.

      <p>
       And I guess a modicum of courtesy can fit there somewhere as well.

       My favorite is the complete lack of traction that right wing 'conspiracies' get here.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a forum where the suggestion of getting an ID is mocked. Yet, when it comes to voting - every time voter ID legislation conspiracies get posted here, it gets laughed out with the response "why can't you get an ID? Why don't you have an ID? Why don't you want to show your ID to vote?" Which seems to be the basic opposite of actual conspiracy theorist mythos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet there are videos online of republicans exclaiming how they will use this type of legislation to prevent non-republican voters from voting.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point of this isn't to fall into a left-right dichotomy, but to demonstrate that many people here
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       still stuck within their own belief systems, regardless of how skeptical or critical they claim to be.

       This subreddit should take a leaf out of
       <a href="/r/trees">
        /r/trees
       </a>
       book. The problem here is certainly more complex than getting a bunch of stoners to be nice to each other, but complex doesn't mean impossible.

       We need to inculcate a sense of intellectual inquiry, and rational argument. Comments should ensure they don't commit basic logical fallacies  - great list here:
       <a href="http://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/">

       </a>
      </p>

       Really we just need collective leadership; to make a statement about what flies, and what doesn't, that still allows massively divergent opinions on issues that will always generate some rancor and discord.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need rationality over emotion - each time you lose your shit on this subreddit and cuss someone out, our enemies win a small victory.

       I can't count how many times I've been downvoted simply for asking for evidence, not even implying the person is wrong, just asking for some evidence to look over and form my own opinion. I feel that a few people on this sub think that is a bad thing.

       Is this a place to discuss conspiracy theories or is this a place to circle jerk personal paranoias?
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone makes a claim or suggestion and doesn't have evidence, that is fine. But calling people
       <em>
        shills
       </em>
       because they want to see some evidence is a bit much.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you are advocating for is a complete disregard for skeptical analysis.

       See the way it works here is EVERYTHING is the Jews, or conservatives fault. If you disagree with that or point that out, you are a paid shill working for the government, hence the very first comment on this post. See this why most real researchers are never taken serious, just look the place over and it becomes quite obvious what r/conspiracy is all about....

       Except all of the posts and comments that completely discredit the two party paradigm and address the fact that the whole system is corrupted and the conservative/liberal trademarks are used to take away from the over-arching problem that is the elitist mindset that doesn't represent the sentiments of the average person or the country as a whole.

       That would be the boiled down version, yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really all it entails is if someone gives info that makes your pet conspiracy invalid, that person isn't a shill necessarily. Fight fire with fire by getting all your sources together and show all the evidence that you have.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also have to know that some people, no matter what you show them will ever believe it. 
That's ok, you tried.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try to find evidence in the MSM (I know, I know :)) to give them. Maybe seeing it there will convince them.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's cool if you wanna get an idea out that you saw on a blogging website, but just because it's on there, doesn't make it true.
      </p>
      <p>
       My next point is: Don't use Alex Jones and infowars as your back up. If the world is really as bad as some of the Chicken-Little's here say it is, then why has Alex Jones
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       been suicided or disappeared? 
Because nothing he says holds water, pure and simple. Have you seen this man rage? No one has been that manic-depressive and lived to their 40's. 
Ok, AJ is kinda fun to watch and sometimes he has awesome interviews (like the one with MPG2 creator) but most of it is to sell advertising space and line his pockets.

       And I guess a modicum of courtesy can fit there somewhere as well.
