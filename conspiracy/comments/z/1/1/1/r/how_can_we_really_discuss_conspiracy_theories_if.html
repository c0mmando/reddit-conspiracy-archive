<p>Some people use lies to back up otherwise sound theories. If you point out that one aspect you&#39;re immediately written off as someone trying to poison the well or something. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like some people are so desperate to find the hidden truth that they&#39;ll look straight past ones that aren&#39;t hidden looking for something else. It&#39;s quite ironic.</p>

<p>What makes you think they are? From what it sounds like - anyone that disagrees with you must be a paid persona, so I can see why you think they would be a problem, but that seems more personal, as opposed to something that is taken from evidence within <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, no, no, that&#39;s not how this works. I don&#39;t have to prove I&#39;m <em>right</em>, you have to prove I&#39;m <em>wrong</em>.</p>

<p>And if you <em>do</em> manage to achieve that, then it just proves you&#39;re part of the conspiracy, as OP has pointed out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I joined I was hoping for a healthy amount of skepticism all around, not just on a few things. That&#39;s the first mode we hit when we hear something outlandish, but it seems some subscribers only become skeptical when they read about ammo purchases by government agencies they, of all people, deem to have no need for (when we all know that large ammo purchases have happened forever because, well even a local yokel cop has to hit the range sometime and the same holds true for federal agents).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That would be the boiled down version, yes.</p>

<p>Really all it entails is if someone gives info that makes your pet conspiracy invalid, that person isn&#39;t a shill necessarily. Fight fire with fire by getting all your sources together and show all the evidence that you have. </p>

<p>You also have to know that some people, no matter what you show them will ever believe it. 
That&#39;s ok, you tried. </p>

<p>Try to find evidence in the MSM (I know, I know :)) to give them. Maybe seeing it there will convince them. </p>

<p>It&#39;s cool if you wanna get an idea out that you saw on a blogging website, but just because it&#39;s on there, doesn&#39;t make it true. </p>

<p>My next point is: Don&#39;t use Alex Jones and infowars as your back up. If the world is really as bad as some of the Chicken-Little&#39;s here say it is, then why has Alex Jones <em>not</em> been suicided or disappeared? 
Because nothing he says holds water, pure and simple. Have you seen this man rage? No one has been that manic-depressive and lived to their 40&#39;s. 
Ok, AJ is kinda fun to watch and sometimes he has awesome interviews (like the one with MPG2 creator) but most of it is to sell advertising space and line his pockets. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My favorite is the complete lack of traction that right wing &#39;conspiracies&#39; get here. </p>

<p>This is a forum where the suggestion of getting an ID is mocked. Yet, when it comes to voting - every time voter ID legislation conspiracies get posted here, it gets laughed out with the response &quot;why can&#39;t you get an ID? Why don&#39;t you have an ID? Why don&#39;t you want to show your ID to vote?&quot; Which seems to be the basic opposite of actual conspiracy theorist mythos. </p>

<p>Yet there are videos online of republicans exclaiming how they will use this type of legislation to prevent non-republican voters from voting. </p>

<p>The point of this isn&#39;t to fall into a left-right dichotomy, but to demonstrate that many people here <em>are</em> still stuck within their own belief systems, regardless of how skeptical or critical they claim to be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This subreddit should take a leaf out of <a href="/r/trees">/r/trees</a> book. The problem here is certainly more complex than getting a bunch of stoners to be nice to each other, but complex doesn&#39;t mean impossible.</p>

<p>We need to inculcate a sense of intellectual inquiry, and rational argument. Comments should ensure they don&#39;t commit basic logical fallacies  - great list here: <a href="http://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/">http://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/</a></p>

<p>Really we just need collective leadership; to make a statement about what flies, and what doesn&#39;t, that still allows massively divergent opinions on issues that will always generate some rancor and discord.</p>

<p>We need rationality over emotion - each time you lose your shit on this subreddit and cuss someone out, our enemies win a small victory.</p>

<p>If someone makes a claim or suggestion and doesn&#39;t have evidence, that is fine. But calling people <em>shills</em> because they want to see some evidence is a bit much. </p>

<p>What you are advocating for is a complete disregard for skeptical analysis. </p>
