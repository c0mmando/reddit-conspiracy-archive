        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>On Barack obamas AMA, the second highest rated question was by one &quot;hmlee.&quot; upon reading the question, I found it to be surprisingly leading, and a bit overenthusiastic. But what really struck me was its LENGTH. With reddit under such heavy load, its next to impossible to even GET to the page--i cant even log out of my account on alien blue, so I&#39;m using my brothers already-logged-in account--let alone write and successfully submit such a long question. Then I went to hmlees page. Guess when he became a redditor? AT THE EXACT SAME TIME AS THE AMA FIRST CAME ONLINE. He has posted nothing else, and made no other comments. So, after seeing this AMA, do you really think he wouldve had time to register, find it again, get on the page successfully, write that question out, AND get it successfully posted before he was too far down to be noticed? </p>

<p>In short, I think hmlee may have been a plant. Can y&#39;all help me figure out if I&#39;m onto something?</p>

I would probably chalk it up to coincidence if that were the only factor at play here but, as the OP stated, there&#39;s more than just one red flag to be raised...I don&#39;t know why anyone should be surprised though. This is American politics we&#39;re talking about. It would hardly be the first time a &quot;plant&quot; was used to bolster a politician&#39;s image.</p>

<p>This is the problem with you guys, you would have found something to twist this AMA into a conspiracy no matter what. That&#39;s how you guys work. You take one element that fit into your view, that can be twisted in a way that your story works,  and then block the rest. Okay, so one question was from a new user, okay, makes sense, that AMA blew up qo fast all over the web, many new people joined reddit for it. 9 other questions were answered from diverse long time redditors. Why don&#39;t you even mention those? Right, because they contradict your made up preconstructed story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, lets debunk this:  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>First, there is no need for a plant. In a topic with a zillion people asking every kind of question, which one do you think its easier: to pick the ones you want to asnwer (and those WILL be asked when there is that many people) or to plant someone to ask them?</p></li>
<li><p>The lenght of the question is not important. Technically, yes, a bigger text will take more time to be sent, but its a veeeeeery small difference when we are talking about just a few lines of text. Its 2012. We arent using dialup anymore. And even if the lenght had any importance, what are you suggesting? That the plant had a way to avoid the server issues that we were all having? This doesnt make any sense.</p></li>
<li><p>5 minutes after the topic was created, twitter and facebook were already flooded by people saying that the president was answering questions. Im assuming a lot of websites also reported that in a very short time. So, not only its completely normal that hmless created an account just to ask that question, if you go back to that topic and look into the other questions you&#39;ll see a bunch of new accounts too. People who came from twitter and facebook. This happens all the time when we have celebrities here doing AMAs.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>...  </p>

<p>Seriously, what happened with you guys?<br/>
You werent like this before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but this shouldn&#39;t be surprising. Think about it like this - you decide to run for city council or something. Something small. You get invited onto a local talk radio program to answer questions and take calls from listeners.

You&#39;d probably expect it and maybe even encourage it. Especially since you know your opponent is going to have their staff call in and try to nail you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That whole AMA was a farce IMO. The guy takes it woody almost immediately and only selectively answers 8 bullshit questions. It makes a mockery of what people actually care about and completely re-enforces the idea that politicians have no interest in addressing the issues of the populace. </p>

<p>All of the top upvoted questions are either about the failed war on drugs, US citizen assassinations, net neutrality, TSA abuse, illegal wiretapping or gitmo. </p>

<p>Even if he doesn&#39;t address any of these issues it must be at least clear to him that these are the things people actually care about. You would think it would advantageous to include some of these in his campaign. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would that be caught in the spam filter? I&#39;m just paranoid that Obama&#39;s time is worth millions, and there is no way he would risk doing this unless it was completely fool proof. I wonder how much power his administration has to do things like use vote bots to change votes. There are definitely agencies that interfere with social networking sites, so I think it&#39;s a possibility.</p>

<p>I also wonder why the websites that track votes were down, such as <a href="http://erqqvg.com/vizeddit/">http://erqqvg.com/vizeddit/</a>. I wanted to see the votes on Obama&#39;s AMA real time, but Reddit&#39;s servers are blocked</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or, the more likely explanation, is that with the thousands(if not hundreds of thosands) of new people coming on Reddit to see this &#39;AMA&#39;, a number of them created an account. They asked questions, and were fast enough to catch to POTUS&#39;s attention and get answered.</p>

<p>no need to go all nuts over this one. What would really be interesting, if you DO wish to continue this line of thought, is for you to go into the thread, and find just how many of these comments were from &#39;new&#39; Redditors. I would put my money on a good number of them.</p>

<p>As to the few questions he did answer, come on. Did you really expect him to answer some of those complex question with the limited time he had? Even if he had hours, you think he would come on to the internet(a place with little political success) and talk about major policy changes, or explain some decision or another that could affect his campaign re-election in some meaningful way? That would be very silly of him.</p>

<p>Despite being extremely abrasive, that guy is right. His comment in there got deleted by the mods but not before reaching 19 downvotes; I think the rest of us should have done something similar (anonymously, of course) to bring it to peoples&#39; attention in such a hot thread.</p>
