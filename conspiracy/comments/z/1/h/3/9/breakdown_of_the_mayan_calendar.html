<p>&quot;Approximately 2500 years ago, The Maya used two calendars that worked together:
The Maya were the most recent ancient civilization that left the freshest tracks for us to learn from. Currently, their track record is still accurate. No other calendar has ever been more accurate than the Mayan Calendar. In fact, other calendars have been adopted from their concept, like the Gregorian Calendar, not so detailed, but reflects calendared days. This would be considered the calendar of Western Civilization or the Christian Calendar of todays civilization. In my own opinion, the Gregorian Calendar is mislead to humanity. Its purpose has only been in gain for consumerism, profits, dollars, and different classes. But none of that, really teaches us anything about true history or the future as it will be..
No matter what, the future will come..You live in the present, and the past is gone..But the past, has a lot to teach for the future IF, and only IF you are listening. Theres a saying, &quot;If nothing is learned from history, then its doomed to repeat itself..&quot; Think about that for a second, then consider what the Gregorian Calendar really has to offer. And if, theres nothing to offer, then well, you aren&#39;t learning anything about &quot;true history.&quot; In fact, what you are being bred to learn is &quot;HIStory,&quot; the history thats been rewritten over and over through generations, changed in every way..It is a deception of the mind. However, know this,
THE MAYA CALENDAR HAS NEVER EVER BEEN CHANGED IN THE COURSE OF ITS HISTORY
You can learn a lot about history. Its not my favorite subject. But I am compelled to learn what I need to know now, so that I will be clear on the future..In other words, I WILL NOT BE CONFUSED or TERRIFIED by what I see in front of me.
In fact, this will reveal a sort of comfort for you. Change, (not as in govt) is never something to be afraid of..Welcome change, because, it is right on time every time. And in these times...We need Universal change...So, that said, Im going to show you HOW and WHY you have the POWER of the future.. Based on the Mayan Calendar (Smile). I apologize for getting off track a bit, I had to put some things out there. Moving on...</p>

<p>Tzolkin Calendar: Means the Count of Days. A &quot;260 Day Calendar&quot;, that was served as a &quot;personal&quot; and &quot;Astrological&quot; calendar. 13 Intentions (time periods of change in consciousness) repeated 20 times in aspect...Hence, 13x20 = &quot;260&quot;. They were very mathmatical.
Note: The intentions are marked on the pyramid as &quot;The Vertical Line&quot; that makes each step upward the pyramid. Again, Intentions are time frames of change in consciousness. Example: Every 100yrs or every 20yrs a change occurs in the evolution of consciousness. Just an example, so you understand.</p>

<p>The second calendar is called..
Tun (Tune) Calendar: 360 Day Divine Calendar. Still accurately current since thousands of years. (18 months of 20 days) is the only Maya calendar directly connected to the Tzolkin and they run together like two gears, each day being a tooth on the respective gears.</p>

<p>The Mayan pyramid has 9 steps. Some have 5, but we&#39;ll focus on the 9 step Pyramid cause it coincides with the long count of the Mayan Calendar. Each step represents the 9 levels of Consciousness that exist.</p>

<p>Believe me, long count is exactly what it is, so have an open mind. Their civilization was far advanced about the cosmos, which remains a mystery, their source of knowledge. Their calendar has never been wrong, and never out of date. In fact, their calendar has been accurate to date within 30 seconds of events (its been said). Now, thats an amazing accuracy for what you are about to embark on. You will have a better understanding of the future, and how your role in it, is very important. Its not doom and gloom like they say, unless, thats what YOU create. Remember this, if nothing else, &quot;You are an eternal being, having a human experience&quot; you are in control, always in all ways! So, Lets get on with it, shall we?</p>

<p>Each step of the Mayan Pyramid represents &quot;Consciousness&quot;.
Define Consciousness: Consciousness is subjective experience or awareness or wakefulness or the executive control system of the mind. Simply put, its YOU! Your mental state of consciousness, your awareness of being.</p>

<p>Each of the 9 steps of the Mayan Pyramid has 13 individual sections for each step i.e.
7 periods of Light and 6 periods of Dark.</p>

<p>7 days and 6 nights to each level of creation, well, not literally. Each day is said to be cycle of increase in consciousness. Each night is said to be a cycle of applying that consciousness. The pyramid itself starts wide at the bottom. A very long period in time/consciousness. The bottom first step is recorded as &quot;16.4 Billion Years,&quot; when our physical universe began. That&#39;s right, the start of our YOUniverse, folks! This is marked as the Cellular Period. As you may notice the pyramid structure in steps get smaller (less wide), representing an acceleration in time periods of consciousness, a shortening in time span. Although those spans in time near the bottom of the pyramid, seem in no way, short.</p>

<p>Just so I don&#39;t lose you with the finer details of each step, lets cut to the chase...
The last two steps at the top of the mayan pyramid are the most important, because, those steps are our consciousness cycles that we are currently, and will be experiencing soon.. We are currently in the Galactic Cycle, which began Jan 5, 1999 and runs 13 complete cycles of 360 Days, each. Each cycle of 360 Days (During the Galactic Cycle) is a change in consciousness itself, a state of mind evolution, per say.</p>

<p>The last step at the top of the pyramid is the &quot;Universal Cycle&quot;, which begins on Feb 10, 2011 and runs a complete 260 days until October 28, 2011. By now you may see the Acceleration in consciousness based on how the Mayan Calendar works. If not, just run thru it a little til it sticks, it will make sense once your learning curve takes grasp of the concept.
Here you can do a number count on the days. <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/date/duration.html">http://www.timeanddate.com/date/duration.html</a></p>

<p>most importantly,there are no more steps once we reach the end count .The Maya stopped at 9 steps of evolved consciousness, what does this mean, you might ask? Now this does not mean the end of days, nor is it doom and gloom..This is a process of rebirth. We are ending the Age of Aquaurius and entering into The Age of Pisces. No one in &quot;this lifetime&quot; has ever experienced whats next. However, you being aware of these events and your consciousness gives you power to understand and direct peace and harmony in the future. Because we have the control. The Youniverse answers our intent. Work on that task, so that you may master it. My recommendation of enlightenment to yourself, is to learn the Spiritual Laws of The Universe. Use them to advance humanity.. Service to others rather than service to self. Everyone syncs that idea, the faster we realize, there is no competition, because
WE ARE ONE collective consciousness. Find your spirit guides and learn your higher self. You have help, believe me you do! You just have to ask..MEDITATE on it..This opens many doors! With intent visualize world Peace, Love, and Happiness for humanity. The universe &quot;mirrors&quot; your intent.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What &quot;events&quot; has the Mayan calendar been right on before? Also, did the Mayan&#39;s believe in astrology/ &#39;Age of Aquarius--&gt;Age of Pisces??&#39; Also, what did you mean when you said the bottom step is recorded as 16.4 billion years ago? Who/why/how could they have recorded it as that number? So, once you reach the top does it cycle back down or does it mean there are no new levels of &quot;consciousness&quot; to obtain?</p>

<p>ps. Thanks a lot for the post. I hope I didnt come off as contentious/condescending, I&#39;ve been curious about the whole Mayan calendar business and never really understood it. Your post definitely clarified a lot for me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus would say listen to my words and those that came before me [Old Testament].  &quot;I am the way, the truth, and the light.  Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter.  While people are saying, &quot;Peace and safety,&quot; destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.&quot;</p>

<p>If you took the time to study the book you&#39;d know that it illustrates the coming times pretty well.  If you heeded its message you wouldn&#39;t be worried about them.  The New Age mystery religion has a very dark origin and many people will fall in its trap.</p>
