       The questions were submitted and upvoted by coordinated staffers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The notice was very brief so that questions by actual redditors wouldn't have a chance to overwhelm the planted ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Batting 1.000 in answers in an unscripted setting by him would be impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence: go look at the top-voted questions that went unanswered as of now each of these would have been terrible questions for him politically to answer, and the one's he answered questions that read like a campaign commercial.
      </p>
      <p>
       The questions are phrased leadingly: i.e.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        What can I say to encourage those in similar situations as I am to show up again in November? What hope can you offer us for your second term?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Even the summary orders the question in a cohesive narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, guys, what do you think.

       Have you considered that people phrased their questions in such a way because they knew Obama would respond to them? Go to any other politicians AMA and you'll find similarly phrased questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's obvious Obama just chose the easiest/safest questions to which he could reply; but I don't think there is anything conspiracy about it.

       It's likely true.  Obama wouldn't want to say anything on there that could get him into hot water later, even if it was just a simple slip-up.

       What do you mean by this?  He barely answered anything, how can that be considered batting 1.000?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see why this has to be a conspiracy.  He was asked thousands of questions, it's not very hard to pick out the easy ones and answer them just like he would in a regular interview.  And obviously the ones that he answers are going to get more votes than ones that were ignored.  If it was setup, the useless questions like "who is your favorite basketball player" would have been near the top instead of far below more compelling ones.

       You find she was a student of law in Chicago (!) that interned for the Department of Justice as well. Check out LinkedIn results.

       In addition to the AMA hype, has anyone else noticed the pro-Democrats/pro-Obama threads and commenters all over them place? I mean, reddit has historically been a liberal venue but, today it seems a bit over the top.

       No argument on the rest, but I really don't think the "upvoting by a coordinated group" is necessary at all. Users would upvote anyway.

       I don't know about you, but that seems to make sense to me. A lot more sense than Obama asked himself questions and, with the help of reddit's admins, got them upvoted to the top. Especially considering that reddit's admins don't want the site to be down cuz they make less money when it's down (obviously). And finally, Occam's Razor; it stands to logic that an account created 16 hours ago that uses NO markdown and so obviously isn't a regular redditor, and that has only ever commented once is not a puppet account of the fucking president and is just an average Joe that came after hearing about it from a news source and never intends to come here ever again.

       Obama has answered each of those questions ten thousand times.  He knows the answers by heart.  I would have liked him to have chosen to answer some of the more interesting, off-the-wall, provocative questions too.  It was a pretty boring AMA.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be better next time if the reddit community decides on a list of questions beforehand, and then asks a President (or other similarly popular person) to answer them.

       I'm pretty sure they don't try to hide these facts. All media is a set up when interacting with political and most entertainment figures. I'm pretty sure that reddit wasn't going to let someone cart blanch ask a million cat related questions to the Prez.

       This is a great thing for Reddit and a great thing for the President of the United States to participate in. It's a great story. Whether it was somewhat "scripted" or whether mechanisms to omit certain questions was part of this or not. Frankly, it doesn't change the great story that it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not like anyone was expecting some intense debate on core issues over this medium (no offense).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a very cool thing, a great promotional/marketing/PR story and it only encourages more people to come forward, for more/better AMAs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't waste too much time trying to determine what may have been "conspired"

       Of course it was.  This isn't a conspiracy, it's politics.  Take it to r/politics.
