<p>The notice was very brief so that questions by actual redditors wouldn&#39;t have a chance to overwhelm the planted ones. </p>

<p>Batting 1.000 in answers in an unscripted setting by him would be impossible.</p>

<p>Evidence: go look at the top-voted questions that went unanswered as of now each of these would have been terrible questions for him politically to answer, and the one&#39;s he answered questions that read like a campaign commercial.</p>

<p>The questions are phrased leadingly: i.e. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What can I say to encourage those in similar situations as I am to show up again in November? What hope can you offer us for your second term?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even the summary orders the question in a cohesive narrative.</p>

<p>So, guys, what do you think.</p>

<p>Have you considered that people phrased their questions in such a way because they knew Obama would respond to them? Go to any other politicians AMA and you&#39;ll find similarly phrased questions.</p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious Obama just chose the easiest/safest questions to which he could reply; but I don&#39;t think there is anything conspiracy about it. </p>

<p>What do you mean by this?  He barely answered anything, how can that be considered batting 1.000?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see why this has to be a conspiracy.  He was asked thousands of questions, it&#39;s not very hard to pick out the easy ones and answer them just like he would in a regular interview.  And obviously the ones that he answers are going to get more votes than ones that were ignored.  If it was setup, the useless questions like &quot;who is your favorite basketball player&quot; would have been near the top instead of far below more compelling ones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just gonna bluesky this idea, but maybe this is one of the many people who flocked here after hearing about the AMA <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?sugexp=chrome,mod=7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;q=the+guardian+obama+ama#q=obama+reddit&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;tbm=nws&amp;amp;prmd=imvnsu&amp;amp;tbas=0&amp;amp;source=lnt&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;psj=1&amp;amp;ei=HGI_UPCNMKrO0QXay4GQBg&amp;amp;ved=0CB0QpwUoAA&amp;amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;amp;fp=73ab09c948e3182f&amp;amp;biw=1366&amp;amp;bih=681">from one of the many news sources reporting about it</a>, and Mr/Miss/Mrs/Ms H M Lee (I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s their name) came here just for the AMA.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about you, but that seems to make sense to me. A lot more sense than Obama asked himself questions and, with the help of reddit&#39;s admins, got them upvoted to the top. Especially considering that reddit&#39;s admins don&#39;t want the site to be down cuz they make less money when it&#39;s down (obviously). And finally, Occam&#39;s Razor; it stands to logic that an account created 16 hours ago that uses NO markdown and so obviously isn&#39;t a regular redditor, and that has only ever commented once is not a puppet account of the fucking president and is just an average Joe that came after hearing about it from a news source and never intends to come here ever again.</p>

<p>Why the fuck is this so hard for you to understand?</p>

<p>EDIT: I just thought about this. I&#39;m not saying that the AMA wasn&#39;t shit, cuz it was. Compare it to Gary Johnson&#39;s from 10 months ago and you&#39;ll see just how shit it is. I&#39;m saying I don&#39;t think it was a set up. He definitely only answered crap questions deliberately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obama has answered each of those questions ten thousand times.  He knows the answers by heart.  I would have liked him to have chosen to answer some of the more interesting, off-the-wall, provocative questions too.  It was a pretty boring AMA.</p>

<p>It would be better next time if the reddit community decides on a list of questions beforehand, and then asks a President (or other similarly popular person) to answer them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a great thing for Reddit and a great thing for the President of the United States to participate in. It&#39;s a great story. Whether it was somewhat &quot;scripted&quot; or whether mechanisms to omit certain questions was part of this or not. Frankly, it doesn&#39;t change the great story that it is. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not like anyone was expecting some intense debate on core issues over this medium (no offense). </p>

<p>It&#39;s a very cool thing, a great promotional/marketing/PR story and it only encourages more people to come forward, for more/better AMAs. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t waste too much time trying to determine what may have been &quot;conspired&quot; </p>
