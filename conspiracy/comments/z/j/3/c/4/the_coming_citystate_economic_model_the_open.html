       The city state framework is obviously where things are headed. Check out Shell oil's 2050 planning material, it's available on their website. Most large corporations have stuff about it if you read the right documents and connect the dots, they're called long term planning or vision statements usually. Look at energy or financial companies  HSBC has one with a lot of this stuff in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea is that individual cities become somewhat sovereign from the counties they inhabit, they'll be called something like, special zones or districts, and will have their own sets of laws which will be internationally uniform with local customizations and be administered by private entities.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the economy goes really bad, people will agree to create these zones because the cities that submit to the scheme will get economic benefits, businesses will agree to locate there and spend money on infrastructure etc, those that don't will languish. Cities that don't sign up will be outside of what will be peddled as the modern economy. City A gets private investment in new roads etc and City B has to make due with the dwindling funds available the vestigial national governments.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're building three cities from the ground up under this model in Ecuador. In the US laws have been passed in several states, notably Michigan,  that allow poorly managed cities to be taken over by the state government and run by a non-elected administrator. Those laws have been pushed by special interests as part of the larger scheme.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cities that won't agree to submit to the plan will be more and more likely to go bankrupt, because they'll be cut off from the modern infrastructure etc... When they go bankrupt the private administration will take over.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea is the ultimate free market wet dream, every, including government run as for profit entities. It's not like it'll be done in a scary way, it'll be very soft and most importantly, most people will think its a good idea, because by the time this comes to full fruition, the alternative economic landscape will be very bleak.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the main reason the ultra wealthy and large corporations are sitting on money. They've got to starve us out, people wouldn't agree otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly I don't know what I think about it, Maybe it'll work well, who knows. It might create a lot of efficiencies. As long as personal freedom is intact and laws are uniformly enforced etc.

       Cities don't produce their own food or have their own natural resources.  Come collapse cities will be the worst places to be. Let the oil companies see if their owners and workers can eat oil.

       Financial frauds like LIBOR are also helping those cities go bankrupt.

       This is a corporation's wet dream. Imagine the surveillance state, company scrip and company stores, RFID chips, no labor unions, no civil liberties, corporate police,
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       state propaganda television, and slave labor in for-profit prisons. All of which emerges out of the desperation of a huge financial collapse. This is why we have things like conplan 3501/3502, so we can have a smooth transition. The financial collapse is the perfect catalyst for a revolution, but we can't have the citizens thinking for themselves and taking the power back. Docility and compliance are preferred so that we can be easier to "handle" as we transition.

       This is called AGENDA 21!!!!!  "Sustainability" is a scam to bring in the world government!!!  The ultra rich are the ones pushing it and they will be the ones benefiting from it.  We need to wake up the fucking idiot liberals!!!!  It will be really really really really hard to do because they push this shit in college so hard.  Almost every aspect of life is tied into Agenda 21 which is the implementation plan to bring in the NWO!  I am not fucking around people, this is the enemy this is the threat! They are going to eliminate all of the small towns like this post implies and herd people into population zones that are "sustainable" stack and pack cities run by communitarian law.  Come over to
       <a href="/r/agenda21">
        /r/agenda21
       </a>
       and read some of the research and learn how to spot the implementation programs.

       What does Agenda 21 say about alternative energy and efforts to get energy independence from the Sun or Wind energy?  Thorium and Nikola Tesla, etc?  How could these efforts and efforts to clean up the environment be to the benefit of oil conglomerates?

       Agenda 21 promotes sun and wind energy, the oil companies are buying up solar and wind energy companies.  The big business, especially the oil industry will be able to hoard the resources.  You gotta understand it's beyond money at this point.  It is about control.  The President's Council on Sustainable Development has had more than several heads of Oil Companies, Chemical companies, etc on it.  Just google big companies and the word "sustainability" they all have "plans" that align with Agenda 21.  It is really the NWO implementation program.  Its technocratic authoritarianism.  They will dictate to us how to live.  Obamacare was a part of the health aspects.  Now that everyone is forcibly "insured" they will raise the insurance premiums for "unhealthy choices", its a no brainer.  They are already starting to implement this shit.  Like I said googling any biggish city and "sustainability" as keywords and they will have a "plan" that is almost straight word for word out of Agenda 21.

       Sure, get off the grid, they are setting up a world wide grid with this. So get off it.  Everyone will have rationed energy, it is so in depth and genius, this plan they have.  The mass brainwashing began back in the early 90s right after the Agenda 21 treaty was signed, it was called Captain Planet.  Remember that?  Predictive programming.

       No because they want to maintain control.  You aren't thinking from their perspective.  We are the slaves, they are the "ruling class" that wants to KEEP us slaves.  They want LESS of us, hence the depopulation plan, so that we are easily controlled, they basically just want the earth to themselves with a small group of mindless serfs working the land.  I don't see what you're missing, its the new feudalism, what did the kings do once they were kings?  NOTHING, they just maintained control and luxury for their family and they kept a herd of uneducated mindless serfs who grew their food and maintained their infrastructure.

       They will control the world, just like in 1984, they will start wars just to keep the population in line.  Like I said broseph, Brave New World mixed with 1984 mixed with Fahrenheit 451.

       Ive read all of them.  But this lust for power cant last forever, its so philisophicly devoid of reason.  I realize power and control visceral fun for us man monkeys but it doesnt last, especially once you 'win', or into the next generation.  The game ends, the need for wiles and cleverness end, the point is gone and nothing less than masterbation remains.  Our deaths were inevitable anyways and the earth could use a solid cleansing.  Let them to there game, as soon as victory is achieved it will fall apart

       Oh man, you still don't get it.  They are working on life extension technology.  Transhumanism.

       Agenda 21 is there to eliminate the "useless eaters" and consolidate mankind into the serf class, the elite will plugged in and living forever via life extension technology.  The point of the "power" is to have the monopoly on infinite life, or at least really really long life.

       Well duh, gotta not die.  I lik humans, most of my endeavors involve helping them in both micro and macro scale, but i also like nature. Hard to route for both knowing humans as they are.  But, go ahead, take control.  Artists gone, musicians shitty, philosophers gone, conversations nothing but guarded animocity and power plays, point to existance gone, scientist hard to know could o wither way.  Earth repairing.  You can achieve this so called goal and you end up with meh.  Then internal power struggles and back stabbing since that was the vein it started on.  Then colapse, then reset.  As a fan of nature  im ok with this

       You can be a fan of nature and not want a collectivist authoritarian society dude.  I think you are just siding with Agenda 21 because you like the "good" stuff about it, which btw is just a guise.  Nature will be fine either way.  The earth has been around a lot longer than us, its not going anywhere.

       I know, and humanity in our whiles will outlast it no matter what we do.  And the simpler plan that works out for far more people is, well, you know, peaceful coexistence combined with genuine concern and knowledgeable starship.  I just feel that on a long enough timeline it will end up there anyways and the death of billions will appear as ww2 does now, some sort of inevitability even though it could have been avoided.  Nobody will care a thousand years later

       So what is the tactic to fighting the Agenda 21?  I figured localized independent energy sources was the best way.  How do you suggest we sidestep this agenda, anything we can do besides just resisting all changes?

       You have to get the local cities out of the grips of the tentacles of the A21 NGO funding.  Let me put it this way, the UN isn't doing this, the US government isn't doing it. The implementation of Agenda 21 is happening on your local city level, I am talking EVERY city, they are in every fucking imaginable city, infiltrating the local governance.  The Non-Governmental Organizations like ICLEI, which is only one of DOZENS of NGOs that give local governments "Grants" under the stipulation that they implement "sustainability" changes.  The hard part of this, will be to wake up the city administration.  It is so fucking deep of an infiltration, this is such a genius plan on their part.  You have to be able to spot what changes are part of the plan, it is so broad spectrum that it includes the educational system, the food supply, the energy supply, the laws, the regulations, the sewer systems, everything, it is comprehensive.  So waking people up to it is the only way we can stop it, that is the EASY part, is waking up everyone.  We have to do that before we can
       <em>
        even start
       </em>
       to fight it.  Because the vast majority of people have no clue what is happening, they will resist even being
       <em>
        told
       </em>
       this information.  Then once they are told and shown what is happening there is a 70% chance they will think it sounds like a great idea, because of the schooling and the TV culture brainwashing that has been predictively programmed into their psyche.  The resistance to this is only in its infancy, it is up to us to wake up the masses, once you know this info and can see it happening, because it is, you are almost obligated to attempt to expose it to everyone.  Its an undermining of the system.  There are so many facets of it though it is very difficult to find someone with the attention span to get all the info into a presentation they can comprehend.  At
       <a href="/r/agenda21">
        /r/agenda21
       </a>
       there are a few lectures on it that just break down the basics and they are hour and a half long massive presentations with powerpoint slides, quotes, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think localized independent energy would be a better idea, then you have to convince the city council to say NO to the millions upon millions being "gifted" to them to do the opposite.  GOOD LUCK!  This is going to be one hell of a fight.

       Excellent and thoughtful post.  There is NO DOUBT that private wealth is gaining more and more control over public functions.  This shit started a long time ago and the plan, I'm afraid, is nothing short of global banking hegemony through enslavement under the yoke of public indebtedness.  (See:
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_trust">
        The Money Trust

       for this story's prequel.)

       They have made major progress since the early 20th century.  The American Dream's a pyramid scheme.  We are the investors that have come along as the pyramid topples under the weight of its own malignant body.

       What I would say though, is this isn't necessarily bad, in fact, I think it's good. The democratic system we have doesn't work, people are too dumb.

       So? This is just very simple mindedness here. First of all there are literally hundreds of millions of businesses all over the world. Cities are the least productive places, they are based around services, but the real economy and production and products is based in rural areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus you don't understand human behavior, there will always be a need for trade with other cities, but city based laws aren't new. In fact its history and present. All the cities have their own laws and stuff like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no you won't have city-states, just because people with same culture, traditions and stuff want to be unified, there are also many patriotic people, but even apart from that its identity.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        They're building three cities from the ground up under this model in Ecuador. In the US laws have been passed in several states, notably Michigan, that allow poorly managed cities to be taken over by the state government and run by a non-elected administrator. Those laws have been pushed by special interests as part of the larger scheme.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Those are libertarian cities, which are on a bad start since people don't really like their land usurped, so its not a great start, certainly not on a libertarian basis. That said Ecuador is a hell hole, I mean being run by Hitler at this point would be better. So these cities are libertarian initiatives, are supposed to be with no regulations, own small administration that enforces laws and contracts and otherwise be a libertarian form of governing. This is supposed to bring in investors as cheap labor, no regulations and cheap land price is very beneficial. Its supposed to create many jobs, everyone can become a business owner, everyone can join, but we'll see how it works in practice.
      </p>
      <p>
       These cities are certainly not in the same frame as "smart cities" which are basically just totalitarian control grids run by huge governments that track and control everything.

       It is the other way around.  Governments are corporations; public, not-for-profit corporations serving their shareholders (citizens), or at least that is the way the American forefathers intended for them to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Private, for-profit corporations have hijacked the sovereigns (public corporations aka governments) to suck them dry and take over in a televised coup that nobody can even comprehend is occurring.

       And this is the most terrifying part about it!  The People see it. The People feel it.  But they just can't quite understand it.

       Polis
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Polis ( /ˈpɒlɨs/; πόλις, Ancient Greek: [pólis]), plural poleis ( /ˈpɒleɪz/, πόλεις [póleːs]), literally means city in Greek. It could also mean citizenship and body of citizens. In modern historiography "polis" is normally used to indicate the ancient Greek city-states, like Classical Athens and its contemporaries, so polis is often translated as "city-state."
The word originates from the ancient Greek city-states, which developed during the Archaic period, the ancestor of city, state and citizenship, and persisted (though with decreasing influence) well into Roman times, when the equivalent Latin word was civitas, also meaning 'citizenhood', while municipium applied to a non-sovereign local entity. The term city-state which originated in English (alongside the German Stadtstaat) does not fully translate the Greek term. The poleis were not like other primordial ancient city-states like Tyre or Sidon, which were ruled by a king or a small oligarchy, but rather a political entity ruled by its body of citizens. The traditional view of archaeologists, that the appearance of urbanization at excavation sites could be read as a sufficient index for the development of a polis was criticised by François Polignac in 1984[1] and has not been taken for granted in recent decades: the polis of Sparta for example was established in a network of villages.The term polis which in archaic Greece meant city, changed with the development of the governance center in the city to indicate state (which included its surrounding villages), and finally with the emergence of a citizenship notion between the land owners it came to describe the entire body of citizens. The ancient Greeks didn't always refer to Athens, Sparta, Thebes and other poleis as such; they often spoke instead of the Athenians, Lacedaemonians, Thebans and so on. The body of citizens came to be the most important meaning of the term polis in ancient Greece as a polis.

       Oh man, you still don't get it.  They are working on life extension technology.  Transhumanism.

       Agenda 21 is there to eliminate the "useless eaters" and consolidate mankind into the serf class, the elite will plugged in and living forever via life extension technology.  The point of the "power" is to have the monopoly on infinite life, or at least really really long life.

       You are thinking in terms of your own paradigm, not in terms of how these power hungry people think.
