        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Greetings.  We are <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/thirdpartyroundtable/">r/ThirdPartyRoundtable</a>.</p>

<p>How we recently got started:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zq0ow/i_am_gov_gary_johnson_the_libertarian_candidate/c66q0o6">Top voted comment from Gary Johnson&#39;s AMA</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zs2n3/i_am_jill_stein_green_party_presidential/c6781bs">Top voted comment from Jill Stein&#39;s AMA</a></p>

<p><strong>We are dedicated to organizing roundtable discussions (perhaps over a Google+ Hangout) after each upcoming presidential debate with Gary Johnson, Dennis Kucinich, Jill Stein, Ron Paul, Russ Feingold and others where Romney and Obama&#39;s comments will be analyzed &amp; critiqued.</strong></p>

<p><em>Incoming obligatory suck-up:</em>  I come here with this post because I have always been a fan of r/conspiracy.  People that submit and comment here typically aren&#39;t afraid to ask difficult questions about the problems that face our world, and it&#39;s this spirit that we seek to mobilize in order to bring this concept to life.  </p>

<p>We all know that the two-party duopoly that controls the U.S. political system is in dire need of reform.  We feel that livestreaming these types of discussions after the Presidential Debates would be an important first step in the process of making the political process become more inclusive.</p>

<p>It is our hope that you will consider subscribing (1,000 gets us on the r/politics sidebar) and contributing towards making this idea a reality, and together we&#39;ll work towards getting important discussions between the few honest politicians/journalists/influential figures that we have left in front of the masses.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a great idea, and has been done before correct? It didn&#39;t have the desired effect of opening up the CPD. We should focus all efforts directly at petitioning the CPD through use of media and mass awareness of the fraud. Maybe lawsuits too.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t aware, do you have any links or know what it was called / who was involved?</p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;d like to see the first discussion center around the CPD and have folks from the Left and Right explaining how it hurts our democracy by only allowing the views of corporate dems/reps to be expressed at the debates.  </p>

<p>Since there&#39;s a lot of noise out there today in social media, I think a high-profile discussion featuring Paul, Kucinich, Feingold etc. (that could then be replayed and shared across social media) would be instrumental in bringing about the mass awareness that could then lead to movements/lawsuits against the CPD...   </p>
