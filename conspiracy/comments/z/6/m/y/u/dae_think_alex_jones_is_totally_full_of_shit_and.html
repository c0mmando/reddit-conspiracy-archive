<p>I would call this a key.  I can only go in circles for so long, myself, before I must break them.  Alex was one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My theory on Alex is that he&#39;s like a light that the &#39;global elite&#39; uses to attract moths (truthseekers).  They probably monitor his site to determine how many people are seeking out alternative news sources.  </p>

<p>As long as that number hovers around a percentage of the population that they&#39;re comfortable with (maybe like 10%) then they ignore it and proceed as planned.  That minority will be dismissed as conspiracy nutjobs by the majority following the mainstream anyway.</p>

<p>But if that number starts to spike, then they do something to appease the suspicious (jailing more bankers, delaying the inevitable internet control bill, staging a false flag to generate fear, etc).  I don&#39;t know, just rambling here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones is a fraud.</p>

<p>There are certain things I noticed he always does.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Despite the obvious fact that our country is being run by proxy through Israel, he never even touches on the subject. He didnt even cover the latest US intelligence briefing that basically said that Israel is destroying the US for its own benefit.</p></li>
<li><p>He always exaggerates stories and headlines to the point of hysterical ranting and stupidity. This I believe is designed to turn average people away from learning about what is really going on. As well as enrage those who know whats going on, to the point where they expose themselves by doing something stupid out of anger.</p></li>
<li><p>He never supports true libertarianism, or any third parties. When he had Gary Johnson on his show, he opened with the classic media attack against him regarding his stance on abortion. Yet, despite Johnson&#39;s stance being fundamentally the same as Ron Paul&#39;s, he has never attacked Paul on it. This is the &quot;first impression&quot; rule of propaganda interviewing - designed to immediately turn the audience against Johnson. The rest of the interview was as dismissive and condescending as any interview in the mainstream media. The reason for this is my next point.</p></li>
<li><p>He continues to champion the idea that we need to continue to support the system - and you know, somehow &quot;fix&quot; it from within the rules of the system. The Ron Paul supporters gave it a really good try, and found out that the system will not let them win at any cost, despite playing by the &quot;rules&quot; they, will just spontaneously change the rules - or as documented, cheat. Alex Jones just spins this into, the &quot;you just need to try harder&quot; mentality. The Republican and Democratic parties should be completely dead to anyone who cares about liberty.</p></li>
<li><p>He relentlessly bashes the Police. And while it is true, that police corruption is a problem, the extent to which Alex does this, leads me to believe this is just a simple divide and conquer strategy. Wanting you to feel helpless and afraid even of your local police which is absurd. And as importantly, he wants the police to think the public distrusts and hates them. This is the &quot;lets keep all the peons in the game distrustful and angry at each other&quot; strategy to prevent any real organization of grass roots movements.</p></li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure he has police on the show now and again, says he wants to hear from them individually. He had Gary Johnson on the show for the same reason, to give the false impression of impartiality. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, every other story on his site is demonizing the police. He&#39;ll have one or two cops call in, but through repetition of his attacks on the police in general, he intentionally creates the idea that while a few police are good, most are evil and corrupt and out to get you. While in reality the exact opposite is true. Alex Jones is intentionally manipulating his audience to regard the police in a negative light. </p>

<p>Then on the other side of the spectrum, the police themselves are manipulated into being distrustful and even hate the public. They are bombarded with this idea that the public is dangerous and need to be watched and suppressed. This is why the majority of good cops cover for and dont expose the bad ones, because in their minds they&#39;re at war with the public.</p>

<p>I believe this is an intentional strategy on both sides. Turn the people against the police, turn the police against the people. And alex jones is obviously part of this plan.</p>

<p>Just look at his site right now :</p>

<p>&quot;Tampa RNC Cop Gets In Trouble For Being Nice&quot;
<a href="http://www.infowars.com/tampa-rnc-cop-gets-in-trouble-for-being-nice/">http://www.infowars.com/tampa-rnc-cop-gets-in-trouble-for-being-nice/</a></p>

<p>The message is, yeah look here, we have a good cop! Oh, and he&#39;s being punished by the majority of bad cops for being good. But wait.. watch the actual video, where did this &quot;good guy cop&quot; get punished? He didnt. This is pure and intentional propaganda. </p>

<p>That one link alone should tell you all you need to know about the bullshit that is alex jones. The &quot;citizen&quot; in it, probably working for Jones, was clearly trying incite a response from those police. Laying hands on the cop like that? You just dont do that, getting in his personal space and touching him several times. He was trying to provoke. But it didnt work, so Alex went with the &quot;good guy cop&quot; gets punished angle, instead of police arrest innocent citizen for defending the constitution or some shit. </p>

<p>There is a lot of corruption in the police force, and anyway the majority of cops don&#39;t seem to have a problem with arresting people for victimless crimes (i.e. for having a piece of vegetation in your pocket).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like him. I think we need people to point out the worst case scenario of &quot;what is actually going on&quot;. &quot;Real&quot; news is at one extreme trying to convince us one thing. He&#39;s on the other extreme saying the opposite. Most people with half a brain realize that the truth is somewhere in the middle, but we can&#39;t agree on what the truth is because nobody really knows. Often I find myself cracking up at ridiculous shit he says while thinking &quot;he kind of has a point...&quot;. The problem lies with his dumbass followers that take everything he says as fact when it&#39;s clear that it&#39;s his opinion. I think it&#39;s pretty silly to say that he&#39;s some kind of disinfo agent though. People respond to news that&#39;s more sensational... thats the point of &quot;news&quot;. To exaggerate to get people on your side. I mean when you look at the bigger picture he&#39;s clearly on our side in most cases. Sure he has his own silly opinions I disagree with... but it&#39;s not healthy to agree with someone on everything... thats putting them on a pedestal as some kind of god (which his fans do, it&#39;s not his fault). I mean c&#39;mon, half of you guys complain that he doesn&#39;t exaggerate enough and blame Israel and Zionism for EVERY SINGLE PROBLEM IN THE WORLD, and the other half think he goes too far. I think you guys should have SOME appreciation for what he&#39;s doing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hate to say it but AJ is a Zionist shill plain and simple.
His Jewish wife is said to be his &quot;handler.&quot; AJ is connected to the (pretty) evil Bronfman family through his legal counsel. Worse yet is his boss, a Mr. Jeffrey H. Smulyan.</p>

<p>Mr. Smulyan is AJ&#39;s direct superior and <em>highly</em> influences what he says, how he says it, and what ads for shady gold dealers and water filter vendors go in between.</p>

<p>Mr. Smulyan is the owner of Emmis Communications. Emmis (Hebrew for &quot;truth&quot;) is ultimately in control of precisely what Mr. Jones has to say.</p>

<p>He names hispanics as the problem with illegal immigration. But when it comes to the banking problem, he calls them &quot;evil banksters&quot; instead of jews.  He is there to misdirect the anger of the awakening public away from jewish bankers.</p>

<p>Protip: His wife is jewish which means his children are jewish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know at first I thought he was awesome, but that was years ago..</p>

<p>Obama Deception, was an ok film. (at the time I thought it was fantasticly informative).. But after that he started being the one saying the government was using fear tactics to control us and providing us false information.. While now he&#39;s been caught using fear tactics to get people following him, while also being caught providing inaccurate information.</p>

<p>Two sides of the same coin? I don&#39;t know nor do I care.. I just stopped paying attention to anything with info wars on it.</p>

<p>I want things to be better because I love the world, I love everyone in it.. Not because I&#39;m terrified they are going throw me into a prison and force a Nazi regime upon us.</p>

<p>We are all part of one world, if we bind together with each others best interest in mind then we can&#39;t go wrong. Its only when the focus shifts to the self that things don&#39;t go as well for everyone else.</p>
