       Why are people in the Middle East angry at America?  Is it:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Because they're so ignorant, they think youtube videos and cartoons are a good reason to burn buildings, or
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Because Americans are so ignorant, we refuse to see all the myriad ways our aggressive foreign policy is crippling their countries?
      </p>
      <p>
       Which sounds more likely?
      </p>
      <p>
       On reddit now, we have a front-page article in
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       asking why Muslims are so touchy and violent (Washington Post).  There's a Brietbart article on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       suggesting that THEY are just nasty people and we are too lenient with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media spin that this is all about a movie is bullshit, from Hillary and Obama and Time-Warner on down.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is about US (and Western) foreign policy.  About decades of treating their societies as obstacles to commodity profits.  Drone strikes, military intervention, and covert operations to raise or topple governments.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would be angry too.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an American (or Westerner), the least I can do is look beyond the government/industry-sponsored bullshit and say, "No, they're NOT stupid and touchy.  I would be angry too if I was treated the way we treat them."
      </p>
      <p>
       We can't stop the media from spreading bullshit for the wealthy sociopaths.  But we can refuse to play along.

       Arab American here - personally I think Arabs and most Muslims have nothing against the US if it werent for our bias support to Zionism/Israel and our colonial foreign policy in the Middle East.
      </p>
      <p>
       Americans in the Arab World are mostly viewed as naive people that barely know whats going on in the rest of the world. Also, the majority of them believe tbe idea of Israel controling the US through AIPAC and others.

       5th Generation Euro American here, finally broke through 40+ years of Zionist brainwashing thanks to several years of research into 9/11.

       There is no doubt whatsoever that most Americans are brainwashed by Zionist control of the media. Many, many people are starting to wake up though.

       I believe all these muslim protests are being instigated by Israeli Mossad in cooperation with CIA to destabilize the region to be able to justify positioning of US forces around Iran in preparation for a full scale attack. WWIII is around the corner boys and girls, get your popcorn ready.

       To think that all of these protests and embassy stormings are to do with Muslims being upset about a film is so absurdly ignorant. They're people just as much as any of us. Not wild animals. Saying that they are doing all of this because of a film is an incredibly more ridiculous conclusion than anything that can drawn from a conspiracy theory.

       EXACTLY.  I'm really upset about this because there's a tone in the media lately like, "Aren't these people a bunch of stupid animals, to get so upset about a little cartoon or movie?"
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's covering up our Western aggression

        AND

       dehumanizing them at the same time.  Disgusting.

       Right. It may be naive to say that all of the current violence is solely a reaction to the film, but it is equally naive to think that Muslims are a tolerant people who are simply protesting American foreign policy. I think the truth lies somewhere in between: elements interested in disrupting American interests in the region have used the film to incite protests as a smokescreen. I think there are currently covert operations involved on both sides. Reminds me of the tit-for-tat events surrounding Operation Wrath of God.

       Yeah, and I'm saying that wasn't the full story THEN either.  But now the story seems even more ridiculous.

       Of course there's also anger over the (perceived or real) insults.  But the media (CIA?  White House?) is deliberately leaving out the context.

       On a level above perceived zionist plotting, it's the fact that the citizens of the Middle East are predominantly kept poor despite having a majority of the world's oil and gas, with most of the wealth going to the leaders of those countries, their cronies, and Western businesses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many governments in that part of the world have either been put there by the US (Iraq, Afghanistan) or are US-backed puppets, both in terms of military aid and support as well as an implicit blessing to continue their secular dictatorships, such as Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt under Mubarak (public pressure became too large for the US to continue supporting Mubarak, although they attempted to still back the Yemeni dictator Saleh before he was driven out of the country).
      </p>
      <p>
       This has created a citizenship that see secular and corrupt regimes backed up by a foreign power that go against the Islamic way of life and belief (Church and state being separate is an alien concept to many poor, uneducated and/or devout Muslims). To take the Saudis as an example, they hold sharia law and very strict Islamic 'code of conduct' over their own population, yet they themselves live in luxury hotels in London, with blackjack, and hookers.
      </p>
      <p>
       This mentality is expounded with a radical version of Islam being spread around the Middle East by madrassas paid for by the Saudis. Religion plays a role, but is not the most fundamental problem, rather US intervention in the region and their negative effects on the majority of the population there.
      </p>
      <p>
       This film, much like the Danish cartoons and other such events, are merely ulterior triggers for a deep-seated resentment, distrust and dislike. American intervention in that region is hated further due to their uncompromising support for the state of Israel.

       What the fuck ever man.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does the (CIA, White House) control all world media?  Europe, Asia and even Iran, Lebanon, Egypt?  Because a scan of those sources reveals talk of the movie and not much else.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only things I've been able to find is that the Libyan assault may have been planned to avenged the death of a Libyan militant.  The main protest was still probably about the movie though.

       What the two of you are saying are not mutually exclusive.  Perhaps only under the reign of an extremely dehumanizing foreign policy would their be years of consistent attacks on something so many Americans take so seriously, their religion.  At the same time, the Islamic world may be less willing to be so self destructive at these attacks if their was not already a fundamental problem they have with Americans in general.  It would appear to some of us that the islamic world is not set into a fit of rage over these videos, but rather they are living in a fit of rage with Americans and it is only when we decide to add insult to what they(and many of us) perceive as continued injury, that an actual physical manifestation of that rage emerges.

       Anyone else wonder why and how all of these countries have seen this movie before we have? I had never heard of the movie until this whole controversy started and I bet most of you are the same way. Not to mention the movie is in English and first shows up in countries that don't speak English. The whole thing is fishy.

       Out of the 2 choices you gave, I'd say the best is #2. Sure, we're trying to bully the planet, and failing miserably, but seriously, in the bigger picture, this is no different than when the US was trying to stir up shit about Cuba so that we'd hate people we've never even met. The repeated narrative is: Mistrust and hate Muslims. They are terrorists. Luckily I don't buy it either. But it's fun to watch them indoctrinate people.

       And as someone else said, the main focus shouldn't be on why they are angry at America - no Einstein needed to figure that out. What is important is to focus on who is behind all the crap, the root of the problem - not the product of it.

       How many times this type of situation has repeated ?

       Both Muslims and Americans are lied to by their leaders and media. They're taught to fear each other and it propels some to power. A lot of the angst is typical anti-imperialism and should be expected in the Middle East, which was colonized though much of the 20th century. After the European withdrawal from the Middle East after WW2, the US took a huge role. Through the Cold War, theUS and Societs jockeyed for support and tried to puppet the regimes. Much like the Chavez types in South America, there's a lot of legitimate disdain for America in the Middle East. There is also lots of disinformation.

       And the corporate governments work hard to keep this fear alive.  I can't speak for Middle East relations specifically, but in other cases where there is a lot of traditional fear and hatred, I've found that ordinary people on both sides can usually sit down and have very friendly conversations.

       Corporations like ARAMCO enormously undermined respect for Americans in Saudi Arabia.  Shell has done some pretty bad stuff to the coasts of North and West Africa.  The more we fight each other, the less attention we'll pay to the political and business leaders taking advantage of us and our ignorance.

       I read it.  And your talking point won't work, unless you can bury the issue with bullshit.  (But hey, so far that approach is working... but how embarrassing to be caught shoveling the shit.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's just look at how the spin works in the first few paragraphs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The title -&gt; the Arab world is inferior because it is too easily offended.
      </p>
      <p>
       First paragraph -&gt; Westerners are modern and superior because we tolerate offenses (except flag-burning, of course... our military history is like their religion)
      </p>
      <p>
       Second paragraph -&gt; Western criticism is benign, but these thin-skinned people just get their panties in a twist.  Silly people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third paragraph -&gt; Well OF COURSE they're touchy!  They're so far inferior (far from "greatness") that they hate themselves and everybody else.
      </p>
      <p>
       And so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       It a steaming load of racist bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       On edit:  and check out the top (socially-engineered?) comment:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Also because there's a plethora of unemployed, uneducated and unmarried men with nothing better to do than violently "protest" whenever their delicate ego feels slighted.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They're angry because they're so inferior!  And they have an inferiority complex!  That's the real problem.  Never mind that we're bombing their kids and financing the overthrow of their governments and taking all the profits from their natural resources.  Why would that even be worth mentioning?

       Now you are the touchy one. The article definitely had a pro-western society bias. I don't think that is spin. I think the article was attempting to tackle a very complex issue instead of just coming to a black and white conclusion like yourself.

       I sort of see what the OP is getting at, but he is coming off way too tinfoil-y. OP, stop commenting like a pissed off teenager. Why are so many Islamic people protesting now all of a sudden? The west has always treated the middle east (except Israel) like shit.

       Honestly, obviously our media is spinning something here with the video and protests. A new war, or invasion, by either Israel or the US in the coming months would not surprise me.

       I agree about the "straw that broke the camel's back" sort of thing.  But I'm guessing they see it as an insult on top of centuries of oppression.

       We see the same thing in US race relations.  We pretend that African-Americans are ridiculously sensitive about the word "ni**er".  But it's not the word itself, it's the history and the terrible oppression behind the word.

       Funny, that's the same condescending tone that I hear in the article and from the Democrat/Republican spin teams.  How nice of you to suggest there's something wrong with me, though.  Saves me the trouble of having to think through a reasoned argument.

I can't speak for Middle East relations specifically, but in other cases where there is a lot of traditional fear and hatred, I've found that ordinary people on both sides can usually sit down and have very friendly conversations.

       Human beings don't want to fight or rake extreme profits from each other.  It's just our "leaders" and media that lead us to this.
