<p>Tesla&#39;s free-energy concept was patented in 1901 as an &quot;Apparatus for the Utilization of Radiant Energy.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSsRXBckIY&amp;feature=relmfu">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSsRXBckIY&amp;feature=relmfu</a></p>

<p>Brooklyn Eagle July 10, 1932 Nikola Tesla states:</p>

<p>I have harnessed the cosmic rays and caused them to operate a motive device. Cosmic ray investigation is a subject that is very close to me. I was the first to discover these rays and I naturally feel toward them as I would toward my own flesh and blood. I have advanced a theory of the cosmic rays and at every step of my investigations I have found it completely justified. The attractive features of the cosmic rays is their constancy. They shower down on us throughout the whole 24 hours, and if a plant is developed to use their power it will not require devices for storing energy as would be necessary with devices using wind, tide or sunlight. All of my investigations seem to point to the conclusion that they are small particles, each carrying so small a charge that we are justified in calling them neutrons. They move with great velocity, exceeding that of light. More than 25 years ago I began my efforts to harness the cosmic rays and I can now state that I have succeeded in operating a motive device by means of them. I will tell you in the most general way, the cosmic ray ionizes the air, setting free many charges ions and electrons. These charges are captured in a condenser which is made to discharge through the circuit of the motor. I have hopes of building my motor on a large scale, but circumstances have not been favorable to carrying out my plan.</p>

<p>New York American November 1st, 1933</p>

<p>Device to Harness Cosmic Energy Claimed by Tesla:</p>

<p>&quot;This new power for the driving of the world&#39;s machinery will be derived from the energy which operates the universe, the cosmic energy, whose central source for the earth is the sun and which is everywhere present in unlimited quantities.&quot;</p>

<p>This is a diagram of Tesla&#39;s first radiant energy receiver. It stored static electricity obtained from the air and converted it to a usable form. Tesla&#39;s invention is a simple version of T.H. Moray&#39;s device. Moray&#39;s device used a unique rectifier (RE-valve) to efficiently capture the static electricity from the surrounding air. Moray&#39;s oscillator tubes (magnetron transducers) utilized this high-voltage energy to generate an internal secondary &quot;cold&quot; fusion reaction.</p>

<p>Stick an antenna up in the air, the higher the better, and wire it to one side of a capacitor, the other going to a good earth ground, and the potential difference will then charge the capacitor. Connect across the capacitor some sort of switching device so that it can be discharged at rhythmic intervals, and you have an oscillating electric output. T.H. Moray simply expanded on Tesla&#39;s idea to use high-voltage to create ionic oscillation.</p>

<p>Tesla was fascinated by radiant energy and its free-energy possibilities. He called the Crooke&#39;s radiometer, a device which has vanes that spin in a vacuum when exposed to radiant energy &quot;a beautiful invention.&quot; He believed that it would become possible to harness energy directly by &quot;connecting to the very wheel-work of nature.&quot; On his 76th birthday at his yearly ritual press conference, Tesla announced a &quot;cosmic-ray motor&quot; when asked if it was more powerful than the Crooke&#39;s radiometer, he answered, &quot;thousands of times more powerful.&quot;</p>

<p>In 1901 Nikola Tesla was one the first to identify &quot;radiant energy.&quot; Tesla says that the source of this energy is our Sun. He concluded that the Sun emits small particles, each carrying so small of a charge, that they move with great velocity, exceeding that of light. Tesla further states that these particles are the neutron particles. Tesla believed that these neutron particles were responsible for all radioactive reactions. Radiant matter is in tune with these neutron particles. Radiant matter is simply a re-transmitter of energy from one state to another.</p>

<p>Nikola Tesla Free Energy Conspiracy</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdOFAAgTUqo">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdOFAAgTUqo</a></p>

<p>Tesla, with the financial backing of famous financier J.P. Morgan, built a Transmission tower (picture above) which housed a resonating tesla coil. It was shaped like a pyramid and it&#39;s intention was to transmit energy around the world, from a single tower. </p>

<p>Morgan provided the finance as Tesla had successfully developed Alternating Current, and with the backing of Morgan had built the world&#39;s first Alternating Current Power station at Niagara Falls, in the U.S.A. Morgan was receptive to Tesla and thought that Tesla was onto something, having been impressed with Tesla&#39;s Alternating Current Power station. HOWEVER when Morgan found out that Tesla wanted to transmit FREE energy from the tower it was literally burnt to the ground, and Morgan would have nothing more to do with it.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards Tesla&#39;s lab was burnt to the ground, while Tesla was away, asleep in his home.</p>

<p>Edit: <strong>Shill warning</strong>. TomSwirlya is posting all over the place with a specific intent to distort the message. </p>

<p>Edit2: TomSwirlya holds patents. Yet his pattern of posts only leads to one conclusion.  That as a jockey he gets paid by the amount of BS. You decide. </p>

<p>Edit3: No-one is selling any book. The book Free Energy Generator is written by John Bedini and Lt. Col. Tom Bearden. </p>

<p>Edit4: Two equations are being thrown around as scientific arguments ( only now  )</p>

<p>I = P/A</p>

<p>and </p>

<p>E = hF</p>

<p>Bye now. I know you can&#39;t show me experimental evidence to your scientific poofs. </p>

<p>Edit5: Planks constant is only pseudo constant. Just like their junk science. </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant</a></p>

<p>&quot;The following list is based on the 2006 CODATA evaluation;[17] for the constants listed below, more than 90% of the uncertainty is due to the uncertainty in the value of the Planck constant, as indicated by the square of the correlation coefficient (r2 &gt; 0.9, r &gt; 0.949). The Planck constant is (with one or two exceptions)[18] the fundamental physical constant which is known to the lowest level of precision, with a relative uncertainty ur of 5.0×10−8.&quot;</p>

<p>also</p>

<p>&quot;There are both practical and theoretical difficulties in determining h. The practical difficulties can be illustrated by the fact that the two most accurate methods, the watt balance and the X-ray crystal density method, do not appear to agree with one another. The most likely reason is that the measurement uncertainty for one (or both) of the methods has been estimated too low – it is (or they are) not as precise as is currently believed – but for the time being there is no indication which method is at fault.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The theoretical difficulties arise from the fact that all of the methods except the X-ray crystal density method rely on the theoretical basis of the Josephson effect and the quantum Hall effect. If these theories are slightly inaccurate – though there is no evidence at present to suggest they are – the methods would not give accurate values for the Planck constant. More importantly, the values of the Planck constant obtained in this way cannot be used as tests of the theories without falling into a circular argument. Fortunately, there are other statistical ways of testing the theories, and the theories have yet to be refuted.[17]&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If all this stuff is true (and the more I look into it, the more this seems likely), how on <em>earth</em> has it been suppressed for 100+ years? Sure it&#39;s all starting to come out now, but even today the vast majority of the population is ignorant about stuff like this. </p>

<p>Even most of those who know Tesla&#39;s name only know him as the quirky inventor who challenged Edison, not the genius who (still) has the capability to revolutionize our civilization.</p>

<p>You got a lot of upvotes here - but your &quot;real knowledge&quot; is false.</p>

<p>The scientific method predates dialectical materialism <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method#History">by at least a century</a>.  Indeed, Marx was clearly inspired by science and makes no bones about it in his writing.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a socialist myself, but to claim that modern science is based on Marxism rather than the other way around simply not correct.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I drove in an electric car last night.  </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s pretty clear that automotive industry managed to suppress (but not completely prevent) work on an electric car for a while - but now we have electric cars and it&#39;s clear that there&#39;s a lot of work still needed there.</p>

<p>I really believe that if the electric car had not been suppressed when it originally appeared, it would have been a flop - because it could not have competed at the time with ultra-cheap fossil fuels.  That would have been a Very Bad Thing, because burning fossil fuels is destroying our planet, but it&#39;s pretty clear that <em>batteries</em> are the issue, and that battery technology at the time was primitive and that progress in battery technology is very slow.  Please note that most of the recent progress in battery technology comes from nanotechnology or -chemistry that simply didn&#39;t exist until the twenty-first century, but even then we still don&#39;t have batteries that make a car that&#39;s really as good as a gasoline-powered one.</p>

<p>The Manhattan Project is an excellent real-world example.  This was a focused military project during a war when secrecy was at its highest, and yet American scientists, German scientists and Russian scientists were independently working on this idea, and the concept was so well known it was being used in science fiction stories years before it was revealed publicly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No offense, but Paul Pantone is a bit of nut and I don&#39;t think he would be a good example. He claims that he &quot;received from an angel&quot; the plans for the GEET engine, which supposedly enables &quot;...clean exhaust...also double or even triple the gas mileage...&quot; by &quot;superheating the vapor so that...electrons are spun off...the rest of the molecules go through the device to the engine as a much cleaner, hydrogen-based fuel. Even when running on...toxic waste, the only thing...out of the exhaust pipe is clean, fresh air..&quot; Witnesses claim that a GEET-modified engine will run on &quot;a little gasoline, water, <strong>cat urine(!), Coke, and pickle juice</strong>&quot;.</p>

<p>Also, he was arrested for swindling investor money, he scammed hundreds of people into a get-rich-quick free energy device that pretty much does nothing: <a href="http://merlib.org/node/5820">http://merlib.org/node/5820</a>  </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there have been inventions that were bought up by large corporations in fears of competition. However, I would say it is rare that they don&#39;t implement the technology they buy, because if there&#39;s money to made in something that puts them ahead of the competition, there are very few companies who won&#39;t jump on the opportunity to put themselves ahead of everyone else. </p>

<p>It&#39;s more likely that companies find ways to steal patents, than the other way around. There are countless examples of companies seeing an inventor&#39;s invention and then turn around trying to figure out how to do it themselves for free. Some of the worst of offenders of this are the car companies. Example: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kearns">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kearns</a> </p>

<p>Abstract: &quot;A pyramid electric generator for harvesting the vibrational energies of Earth&#39;s atomic oscillators according to the present invention comprises: (1) an antenna/waveguide that is geometrically optimized; (2) a coil wound with an insulated conductor on a nonconductive coil form, the coil being connected at its top lead to the conducting surface of the antenna/waveguide such that the coil is connected near the point at which the electric field contacts the antenna/waveguide, the antenna/waveguide serving as a quasi-capacitive series element to provide a specific resonant frequency; (3) the bottom lead of the coil is connected to a driver operating in the LF or ELF bands. In another mode of operation, a secondary coil is positioned coaxially within the first coil acting as a resonant step-up transformer winding. The generator resonantly couples into specific frequencies of Earth&#39;s atomic oscillators and extracts electric energy thereof.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;1. An electric generator for harvesting the energies of atomic oscillators comprising: (a) an antenna/waveguide that is geometrically optimized having a conducting surface; and (b) a coil wound with an insulated conductor over a non-conductive coil form, the coil being connected to an AC or AC-DC driver at its bottom lead and, to the conducting surface of the antenna/waveguide by its top lead near the point where the electric field contacts the antenna/waveguide, with the antenna/waveguide serving as a quasi-capacitive series element to provide a specific resonant frequency; wherein the generator absorbs impulses from Earth&#39;s electric oscillations; and wherein the attracted energy manifests as high voltage sinusoidal waveforms in the coil, representing harvested electrical energy of atomic oscillators and measurable on the leads of the coil.&quot;</p>

<p>Newman&#39;s &quot;motor generator&quot; only worked if it was hooked up to the mains or to external batteries.  If it was really the case that it produced more energy than it consumed, why couldn&#39;t you just hook the output up to the input and have it run closed circuit?</p>

<p>Same problem - inability to demonstrate actual energy production.  I note that this is the same Grandics who claims to have a completely new theory of cancer, which also hasn&#39;t actually been shown in empirical testing...</p>

<p>Adam Trombly New Energy Device Demonstration Fact: Adam Trombly had been invited to demonstrate one of his generators at the United Nations and the U.S. Senate, but these events were constrained by the first Bush administration. Then the device itself was taken in a government raid.  </p>

<p>Former Canadian Ambassador, James George, details the series of events in his book, The Little Green Book on Awakening. In 1981, Adam Trombly filed an international patent application (WO/1982/002126) for his and Joseph Kahn’s co-invention of the “Closed Path Homopolar Machine”, a zero-point energy device. In 1983, Trombly was issued a gag order by the U.S. government to stop development of the “Closed Path Homopolar Machine.” Then sometime before 1989, Trombly’s gag order was dropped and he developed another zero-point energy device with David Farnsworth, called the Piezo Ringing Resonance Generator.  In June of 1989, Trombly was scheduled to demonstrate a small version of his Piezo Ringing Resonance Generator at the UN in New York, but at the last minute he was forced to do it at a church down the street.</p>

<p>Afterwards Trombly gave a speech in Dag Hammarskjöld Auditorium at the United Nations in front of an international audience. A few days later, Trombly was scheduled to demonstrate the same device at the US Senate Banking and Finance Committee in Washington. Only Senator Carl Levin and a “handful” of staff were in attendance because the Senior Bush Administration called hundreds of Senators, Congressional Representatives and their staff members for an “off-the-cuff” discussion of the Clean Air Act at the exact same time as Trombly’s demonstration.  Thus, the Bush administration successfully diverted attention away from the technology in an effort to censor Trombly.

<p>John Bedini New Energy Devices Fact: Inventor John Bedini began working with Tesla’s theories of “radiant energy” decades ago and has produced an assortment of battery-charging devices that generate more energy than it takes to run them. He announced that he was going to start offering them at low cost. Soon after that, he was attacked in his lab, and warned not to produce the machines. For his own safety he had to let go of marketing free energy devices.  </p>

<p>Inventions by John Bedini in the field of “radiant energy” were reported to operate at over 800% efficiency. This document from 1984 reports Bedini’s initial intentions to market such devices.

<p>John Hutchison Lab Raids Fact: Canadian John Hutchison not only created some free energy batteries, but also used Tesla&#39;s theories to counter gravity, to make objects float. This could revolutionize the field of propulsion. His lab was raided and equipment was taken by police and government officials in 1978, 1989, and again in 2000.

</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s nothing in principle wrong with the idea of broadcasting power - indeed, an hour and about $10 worth of parts will let you build a crystal radio which will let you pick up radio stations without a power source.</p>

<p>What I and most other people are objecting to is the &quot;free energy generation&quot; - which <em>is</em> theoretically impossible.  </p>

<p>So why are you suddenly changing the topic to power transmission?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Meyl also presents a small version of his wireless transmission of energy, carrying electrical energy without losses to the other side of the table with an &quot;impossible&quot; 1.5-times the speed of light. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If Meyl could demonstrate that, he&#39;d be guaranteed a Nobel Prize, a huge place in the history books, and be able to work wherever he wanted, or never work again if he wanted that.  People would respectfully examine all his other work, including his energy broadcasting work...</p>

<p>And this is 2012.  Nanosecond time differences are quite easy to measure.  If he was claiming that he was 0.1% faster than the speed of light, that&#39;d be tricky to check out.  But 50% faster?  You could perform an experiment for a few hundred dollars that would be incontrovertible.  Heck, I&#39;m no experimental physicist but I could set this up in a few weeks for very little money.</p>

<p>So why isn&#39;t he doing this?  A few weeks in the lab and vindication and eternal fame could be his!  Why he is not jumping on this?</p>

<p><em>Because he&#39;s a total bullshit artist,</em> that&#39;s why, and anyone with the slightest skepticism should see this immediately. </p>

<p>Edit: **Shill warning*. TomSwirlya is posting all over the place with a specific intent to distort the message.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s <em>Mr.</em> Swirly (no a) to you!  But I&#39;m no shill.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a 50-year-old engineer and musician (and amateur magician), and I&#39;ve been interested in alternate energy sources and anomalous science for almost 30 years. I&#39;ve read papers, I&#39;ve gone to demonstrations, I&#39;ve talked to countless individuals.</p>

<p>And I believe in <em>some</em> &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;.  Absolutely.  But I don&#39;t believe not just people, but whole countries, doing things that are completely against their best interests.  I certainly believe in small groups of people hiding information - but I don&#39;t believe that all of physics for the last century has been this way.  I believe that there will be major discoveries in physics in the future that will revolutionize the field - but I don&#39;t believe that physics has just been wrong for a century, but just like, say, relativity or quantum mechanics, this will explain known anomalies at extremes while still being consistent with the <em>millions</em> of scientific observations we have to date.</p>

<p>The fact is that you&#39;ve refused to engage any of my arguments and you&#39;ve made extraordinary claims for which you have provided no concrete evidence whatsoever, which require whole countries to act against their best interests, which requires a super-competent, world-wide conspiracy for a century involving literally millions of individuals from all walks of life, and yet one inept enough that, apparently, these deep secrets are patented, publicly available for anyone to read.</p>

<p>I have quite a bit of experience with the idea of &quot;something for nothing&quot;.  I have friends and informants who&#39;ve worked in boiler rooms, done street grifts (like three card monte) or internet pump-and-dump schemes, and all of these have the same thing in common - there&#39;s always a good excuse as to why at the end you have nothing to show for it.</p>

<p>The history of perpetual motion machines is almost 900 years old.  They all seem to have two things in common - they never actually demonstrate anything you can take home and play with, and their supporters never admit that anything is wrong.</p>

<p>Fresnel invented a radical new lens for his doctoral thesis.  As he was giving the thesis defense, he looked up to see most of the physics department leaving the room - which included some of the great lights of physics of all time!  You have to believe he was sweating bullets but he kept on answering questions.</p>

<p>Just before the end of his talk, they all tromped back, and give the thumbs-up to the examiner - Fresnel got his degree.</p>

<p>What had happened was that they were very skeptical as to whether his lens would work, so they all went up to the lab and made a rough model, saw that it did work, and went back down to give him his degree.</p>

<p>That&#39;s science.  Ten minute YouTube videos where some guy in a tent points to a wheel and talks double-talk to a group of completely unskeptical, non-technical individuals is not science.</p>

<p>Show us.  You have these incredible claims - prove them.</p>

<p>(You should get that hostility looked at, you know, before you attack someone close to you in real life.)</p>

<p>Let me again assure you - I&#39;m no shill, nor have I have been paid by anyone, particularly the scumbag energy industry.  I am, however, someone with some scientific training, and someone who doesn&#39;t suffer fools gladly.</p>

<p>If the world were going well, I frankly wouldn&#39;t care if morons wasted their time trying to get something for nothing - the quest for free energy has been going on for almost 900 years, it&#39;s a hallowed tradition by now!</p>

<p>But the fact is that things are going very badly.  The US has a government that has declared it is above the law;  innocent men are tortured to death in prison camps or left to rot without ever getting a chance to defend themselves;  people, including women and children, are murdered by drones thousands of miles away.</p>

<p>You want to see a conspiracy?  Look no further than the global financial crisis.  Trillions were sucked from the US Treasury - why aren&#39;t any investment bankers cooling their heels in jail?  Why aren&#39;t MOST of the investment bankers there?!</p>

<p>This ridiculous theory that all of physics is a hoax and all the countries in the world are conspiring to prevent free energy from just pouring out distracts us from the real issues - they being the permanent war state, the surveillance state and the flouting of the Rule of Law by the 1%.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re looking at it from a national perspective instead of a haves and have nots perspective. </p>

<p>The same billionaires and even millionaires that are profiting from owning Federal Reserve shares and fortune 500 companies/banks that received bailouts from the fed ESPECIALLY profit from oil companies that export to Japan as well as the rest of the world. Owning oil company stock is incredibly lucrative, especially in this day and age.</p>

<p>If Japan were for example to mass produce a free energy system that truly relieved their dependence on oil imports it would only be a matter of time before the genie got out of the bottle so to speak and the technology was exported to the rest of the world. </p>

<p>This would destroy the dollar as the world reserve currency as nations would no longer need to maintain dollar reserves to trade in oil, because oil would no longer be necessary for most tasks. It would create hyperinflation in the United States economy, and create true energy independence for the world, two things that the elite do not want for obvious reasons, particularly the energy independence part. </p>

<p>It is easy to control nations when they are buying energy from you. Release that monopoly and the battle against the elitist bankers is halfway won. They do not want that. It is not a matter of nations. It is the people of the world, and the owners of the world, that is the issue at stake here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, while I&#39;m very open to conspiracies as a motivating force, and while I&#39;m a huge fan of Tesla, I flat out don&#39;t believe this.</p>

<p>There are two main issues - scientific and political.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start with the science.  Tesla was a wizard, no doubt - but he was also a wizard working a century ago with tools that are extremely primitive by today&#39;s standards.  </p>

<p>The claim is that the sun emits mysterious &quot;radiant particles&quot; that give &quot;free&quot; energy.  In one way, this is completely true - these particles are called &quot;photons&quot; and this is called &quot;solar energy&quot;, a field which as you know is experiencing scientific growth by leaps and bounds - but this isn&#39;t by any means &quot;free&quot; energy, it is in fact still more expensive in most cases than fossil fuels (though not for long, I believe!)</p>

<p>In order for these claims to be true, there has to be some other &quot;radiant particle&quot;.  This means that the sun works in a completely different fashion than science believes, but more, the whole of physics has a massive hole in the center, one that was detected by a single worker a century ago.</p>

<p>This is as implausible as postulating a &quot;lost continent&quot; somewhere on the surface of the Earth in 2012.  The Earth has been heavily mapped.  There are going to be geographic discoveries in the future, for sure, and some of them are going to challenge &quot;conventional&quot; geography and history - I&#39;ll bet there are whole civilizations that have lived and died with no historical trace! - but there simply isn&#39;t <em>room</em> for a whole new continent, and you&#39;d have to believe that all geographers, Google Earth, and all the airline companies had gotten together to produce a massive and silent conspiracy.</p>

<p>While science isn&#39;t &quot;finished&quot;, the idea that there&#39;s some vast but suppressed source of free &quot;radiant&quot; energy that could have been easily tapped a hundred years ago is ridiculous.  You have to believe that 99% of the physicists who ever lived, including Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg and Feynman, have conspired to hide this, and both sides in both World Wars continued this deception (why would the Nazis not have capitalized on this?)</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the social part - what&#39;s in it for the conspirators?  Sure, I can see that in the West companies like Exxon and Shell are huge controlling factors - but why would the Japanese cooperate to keep this hidden?  This is a tiny, very nationalistic country with almost no domestic energy production - a country that has consequently invested a lot of money into alternate energy production, sometimes very very alternate like cold fusion.  Why would Japan conspire to keep itself at the mercy of the energy producing countries of the world?  If you know anything about the history of Japan, this is inconceivable.</p>

<p>Or look at China.  China&#39;s so large that they really don&#39;t answer to anyone else.  While they have many more energy resources than Japan, it is absolutely still clear that they are deeply concerned about their energy future - and now they have a serious scientific program.  Why would China cooperate in this matter - when not cooperating would result in their dominating the world?</p>

<p>Finally, I&#39;d like to point out that there are serious problems with the story as written above.  </p>

<ul>
<li>There is certainly a potential difference between the ground and the high atmosphere - but it&#39;s tiny, not enough to power a single computer.  If there were really such a huge potential difference, you&#39;d know it the first time you were in an airplane (which would probably be your last...!)</li>
<li>&quot;Moray&#39;s oscillator tubes (magnetron transducers) utilized this high-voltage energy to generate an internal secondary &quot;cold&quot; fusion reaction.&quot; This off-hand detail requires us to believe a second miracle!</li>
<li>The story about J. P. Morgan and the lab is not consistent with the timeline.  Tesla&#39;s lab in Manhattan burned in 1895;  J.P. Morgan started to fund Tesla in 1900, causing the Wardenclyffe Tower lab to be built; he stopped funding Tesla around 1905;  Wardenclyffe was still in operation until 1907, foreclosed upon in 1908, and abandoned in 1911.</li>
</ul>

<p>I read this patent.  It says nothing about how much energy is generated.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did J.P Morgan stop funding this obviously sound technology supported by patents ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re assuming what you&#39;re trying to prove!  This technology is not &quot;obviously sound&quot; or else we&#39;d not be arguing.  No one argues whether internal combustion technology is &quot;sound&quot; or not.</p>

<p>This technology would be &quot;obviously sound&quot; if someone produced such a motor.</p>

<p>The reason that J. P. Morgan dropped this technology is simple - something you could have found out in a few seconds.  There was a big stock market crash in 1901 - and Tesla&#39;s work was not making Morgan any more.  After a few years, he lost interest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s not an argument. It&#39;s rhetoric or merely conjuncture.</p>

<p>No, your story now requires us to believe TWO separate conspiracies - that someone demonstrated free power from radiant energy a hundred years ago that was suppressed, and that someone demonstrated cold fusion a century ago and that was also suppressed.</p>

Oh really, maybe you should look into why Thomas Moray&#39;s free energy devise was denied patent even though it was proven over and over to work.

<p>The USPTO has made an official policy not to grant patents to free-energy or perpetual motion devices without either a sound physical explanation of the energy source or proof that the laws of thermodynamics are invalid. =) This was due to crank after crank wasting the patent examiners&#39; time with shoddy ideas, and using a patent as &quot;proof&quot; to sound more credible when bilking investors.

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like you aren&#39;t familiar with the US patent process. I have two patents to my name. In neither case were operational prototypes required to be shown to a patent inspector: just drawings and diagrams. A working prototype is not a prerequisite to obtaining a patent; just the idea is enough.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking for examples of egregiously bad patents, 7379286 is the first that comes to mind. And before you ask for evidence that it doesn&#39;t work, well, absent any evidence that it does, I&#39;m afraid the burden lies on you to prove it actually works. The nice thing about patents is that because the descriptions lie in the public domain, any old fool could replicate the device in question; if patent infringement were the largest barrier to free energy devices, well, China wouldn&#39;t be running coal plants, would they?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>THE SECRET=       The simple antenna setup was just to prove it existed. He later made a usable devise, as did Thomas Moray. Tesla and Moray both say the earth is in a sea of vibration waves from the cosmos that can be tapped into. Tesla and Moray both made a radio receiver tuned to the universe (very high frequency). My guess is 160.2 GHZ (the back ground radiation of the universe). Tesla used a tesla coil to get tuned into that high of frequency and Moray used special vacuum tubes for capacitor back-rush oscillation. So radio receiver made around a tesla coil tuned to 160.2 GHZ then another tesla coil later in the circuit as a step down transformer. ALL energy is vibration= heat, electricity, magnetism, radiation, light. We are in a sea of vibration. A generator pumps this vibration into electricity. The Tesla Moray method creates a more efficient resonance siphon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aside from the realization that a Tesla coil could never resonate within four orders of magnitude of 160GHz, if you are referring to the cosmic background radiation, you should recognize that it took a receiver of extraordinary sensitivity, cooled in liquid helium, and hooked to a state-of-the-art, large-aperture horn antenna, simply to <em>detect</em> the CMB, let alone extract <em>energy</em> from it. That&#39;s why <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_of_cosmic_microwave_background_radiation">the discoverers got themselves shiny Nobel Prizes</a> -- because it&#39;s so faint that in order to accurately map it we had to <a href="http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov">send a probe into space</a>.</p>

<p>There simply isn&#39;t enough energy out there, at any wavelength, to meaningfully extract, besides the obvious (the Sun). You can verify this yourself with a radio receiver, if you were interested.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just pointing out that you&#39;re wrong.  A radio does not necessarily need batteries.  As yellowsnow2 said, &quot;When you tune your radio to a station you are drawing power from that source.(no input power even needed)&quot; and that is a fact for a crystal radio.</p>

<p>The simplicity or complexity of the circuit is not the issue, it is total draw.  Of course, an average antenna sucking down radiated electromagnetic energy can not provide tons of power.  However, people have built crystal radios that can receive power from what you might call static, or zero-point energy, or cosmic rays, or whatever.  In this case, the difference between a crystal radio drawing power from a frequency without transmitters and a free energy device is totally in the realm of semantics, and in reality they are the same thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I can&#39;t preclude the idea of people drawing large amounts of energy out of thin air.  Basic electronic experimentation is something that is rarely done now, and most of those doing it are simply following directions and wouldn&#39;t know an anomaly if it bit them in the ass.  It&#39;s certainly true that there are sources of broadband electromagnetic energy which are not being exploited, and I think that it&#39;s quite possible that some wizards have figured out how to call this energy into a useful form through what one may call magic, or for the less mystical, technology.  I&#39;m also sure that this technology is disruptive enough to garner significant resistance from above, even to the point of arson or assassinations.  However, I think that this is largely unnecessary as well, because most people will simply read from the news that it&#39;s impossible and leave it at that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ergo, you don&#39;t know what make them or how they are stable. You wasted money on school john. </p>

<p>Look up how protons have spin and how they the energy levels can be escalated or de-escalated with the added bonus of energy release using frequency modulation or field modulation. Basic physics mate. From the 1950&#39;s. </p>

<p>&quot;For a particular magnetic field strength, the (resonant) frequency of precession can be calculated via the Larmor equation. The Larmor equation may be derived using classical physics or quantum mechanics. It links these two descriptions of nuclear magnetic resonance, and is fundamental to MRI physics. The Larmor equation is</p>

<p>ω0 = γ B0&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.revisemri.com/questions/basicphysics/larmor_eqn">http://www.revisemri.com/questions/basicphysics/larmor_eqn</a> </p>

<p>This is the basis of MRI. </p>

<p>&quot;<strong>Energy Levels</strong></p>

<p>To understand how particles with spin behave in a magnetic field, consider a proton. This proton has the property called spin. Think of the spin of this proton as a magnetic moment vector, causing the proton to behave like a tiny magnet with a north and south pole.</p>

<p>When the proton is placed in an external magnetic field, the spin vector of the particle aligns itself with the external field, just like a magnet would. There is a low energy configuration or state where the poles are aligned N-S-N-S  and a high energy state N-N-S-S. </p>

<p><strong>Transitions</strong></p>

<p>This particle can undergo a transition between the two energy states by the absorption of a photon. A particle in the lower energy state absorbs a photon and ends up in the upper energy state. The energy of this photon must exactly match the energy difference between the two states. The energy, E, of a photon is related to its frequency, , by Planck&#39;s constant (h = 6.626x10-34 J s).
E = hv</p>

<p>In NMR and MRI, the quantity  is called the resonance frequency and the Larmor frequency.&quot;</p>

<p>For the good folks here who claim this is bogus. The experiments </p>

<p>&quot;CW NMR Experiment</p>

<p>The simplest NMR experiment is the continuous wave (CW) experiment. There are two ways of performing this experiment. In the first, a constant frequency, which is continuously on, probes the energy levels while the magnetic field is varied. The energy of this frequency is represented by the blue line in the energy level diagram.</p>

<p>The CW experiment can also be performed with a constant magnetic field and a frequency which is varied. The magnitude of the constant magnetic field is represented by the position of the vertical blue line in the energy level diagram&quot;</p>

<p>E = hf if you think you could draw significant power from the universe&#39;s background radiation then I&#39;m afraid you have misunderstood basic physics. Here&#39;s a hint, h is a very, very small number.</p>

<p>edit: you&#39;re in the radio/microwave wave frequency --- low energy. radio/micro waves are low frequency. just because it has a G in front doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s actually large. this is less energy than visible light.</p>

<p>&lt;/QUOTE&gt;</p>

<p>Energy of a photon is related to Planck&#39;s constant (albeit not determined accurately). </p>

<p>Are Photons same as cosmic background radiation ?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are both practical and theoretical difficulties in determining h. The practical difficulties can be illustrated by the fact that the two most accurate methods, the watt balance and the X-ray crystal density method, do not appear to agree with one another. The most likely reason is that the measurement uncertainty for one (or both) of the methods has been estimated too low – it is (or they are) not as precise as is currently believed – but for the time being there is no indication which method is at fault.</p>

<p>The theoretical difficulties arise from the fact that all of the methods except the X-ray crystal density method rely on the theoretical basis of the Josephson effect and the quantum Hall effect. If these theories are slightly inaccurate – though there is no evidence at present to suggest they are – <strong>the methods would not give accurate values for the Planck constant</strong>. More importantly, the values of the Planck constant obtained in this way cannot be used as tests of the theories without falling into a circular argument. Fortunately, there are other statistical ways of testing the theories, and the theories have yet to be refuted.[17]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No offense, but Paul Pantone is a bit of nut and I don&#39;t think he would be a good example. He claims that he &quot;received from an angel&quot; the plans for the GEET engine, which supposedly enables &quot;...clean exhaust...also double or even triple the gas mileage...&quot; by &quot;superheating the vapor so that...electrons are spun off...the rest of the molecules go through the device to the engine as a much cleaner, hydrogen-based fuel. Even when running on...toxic waste, the only thing...out of the exhaust pipe is clean, fresh air..&quot; Witnesses claim that a GEET-modified engine will run on &quot;a little gasoline, water, <strong>cat urine(!), Coke, and pickle juice</strong>&quot;.</p>

<p>Also, he was arrested for swindling investor money, he scammed hundreds of people into a get-rich-quick free energy device that pretty much does nothing: <a href="http://merlib.org/node/5820">http://merlib.org/node/5820</a>  </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there have been inventions that were bought up by large corporations in fears of competition. However, I would say it is rare that they don&#39;t implement the technology they buy, because if there&#39;s money to made in something that puts them ahead of the competition, there are very few companies who won&#39;t jump on the opportunity to put themselves ahead of everyone else. </p>

<p>It&#39;s more likely that companies find ways to steal patents, than the other way around. There are countless examples of companies seeing an inventor&#39;s invention and then turn around trying to figure out how to do it themselves for free. Some of the worst of offenders of this are the car companies. Example: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kearns">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kearns</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aside from the realization that a Tesla coil could never resonate within four orders of magnitude of 160GHz, if you are referring to the cosmic background radiation, you should recognize that it took a receiver of extraordinary sensitivity, cooled in liquid helium, and hooked to a state-of-the-art, large-aperture horn antenna, simply to <em>detect</em> the CMB, let alone extract <em>energy</em> from it. That&#39;s why <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_of_cosmic_microwave_background_radiation">the discoverers got themselves shiny Nobel Prizes</a> -- because it&#39;s so faint that in order to accurately map it we had to <a href="http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov">send a probe into space</a>.</p>

<p>There simply isn&#39;t enough energy out there, at any wavelength, to meaningfully extract, besides the obvious (the Sun). You can verify this yourself with a radio receiver, if you were interested.</p>
