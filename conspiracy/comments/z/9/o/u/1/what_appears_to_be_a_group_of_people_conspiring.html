       In another thread I mentioned something about joining a lodge. I considered it.

      <p>
       "To be one ask one."
      </p>
      <p>
       I asked. I wasn't impressed.

      <p>
       The action is not at the local lodge so, to me, it's a waste of time.

       In order to prove or disprove, we would probably need more screenshots. As an active member of EnoughPaulSpam and a former mod of
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       , I can tell you right now I've never heard of such a forum.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it exists, then it has to be like 10 people. However, considering all the
       <a href="http://www.skepdic.com/woowoo.html">
        language Woo
       </a>
       , I'm thinking the whole thing is bullshit. Invented to stir the pot.

         The "whistleblower's" account has never existed:

          According to the OP he received this 7 day ago from u/XeX9EI0. If that account existed ever at some point, it would still be google cache

         Only one screenshot. Shouldn't he have more? Wouldn't you at least want to verify if it was true and not a troll?

         The "whistleblower" fails to provide a domain, because it would be "illegal". Sorry, what? How does that make sense? If I found a super secret forum of people conspiring against Reddit I would take as many screenshots as possible and blow it wide open. Why is it
         <em>
          still
         </em>
         a secret?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why just the one post? Why not screenshot the whole thing? Why just post the conversation from two people the OP just happens to hate very much?

       Because robotevil is a lying, cowardly drama queen who uses subterfuge to game other subreddits.  Here he is just today giving his pals a seminar on creating fake screenshots to be used as false evidence against other redditors.

       Robotevil then went on to try to troll
       <a href="/r/nolibswatch">

       with his phony "screenshot" evidence and a sockpuppet "holymoley" two hours later.  He's got serious psychological problems.

       I think you need to be less convinced about your own opinion, honestly. I don't care either way, but you seem way too adamant about something either one of us cannot prove. The difference is that I know for a fact I don't care, and you feel like your beloved circlejerk of a subreddit is being affected in some way.

       This particular subreddit is getting unbearable. To blame it on conspiracy instead of idiots wanting upvotes is ignorance, when you consider reddit as a whole. This post is just the icing on the cake. The moderators are part of the issue, not the solution. For frequenting a conspiracy subreddit, you have too much faith that the moderators would fix anything.

       Yeah, no offense, but I don't really trust you or your information, TheGhostOfDusty and CowzGoesMoo. As a
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/socialism">
        socialist
       </a>
       , I'll always be against Ron Paul and his right-wing "Libertarianism". So I don't really appreciate anti-Ron Paul sentiment being smeared through false flags, if that is indeed what you're doing here. Maybe you're not, I don't know. But I just know that the only people to ever attack me on reddit are people who hate so-called "EPS trolls" (which I was labeled as, because I simply hate Ron Paul and am a socialist). I had a downvote-bot ruin my reddit account for about a month. Maybe that was a false flag attack, too. I don't know. But I don't trust any of you anymore. I wish y'all would go back to Digg, where you came from.

       I like little semantic differences in language that crop up from time to time.  For example, the difference between bad posting and badposting.  It's not simply lazy typistry.  A bad post is just a thing created by a bad poster.  However, a badposter is engaging in the activity like it's his calling in life.  There's a whole qualitative difference there.

       First of all I was never on Digg. Secondly you being a socialist has nothing to do with fighting corruption that is happening in Washington. I don't care what party Ron Paul lies with as long as he just speaks the truth.

       "Libertarianism is the enemy of all racism, because racism is a collectivist idea that you put people in categories. You say, well blacks belong here, and whites here, and women here and we don't see people in forms..or gays. You don't have rights because your gays, or women or minorities, you have rights because you’re an individual. So we see people strictly as individuals. We get these individuals in a natural way. So it's exactly opposite of all collectivism and it's absolutely anti-racism because we don't see it in those terms. "

        Exhibit B: Ferociously Insists that Courts and The Death Penalty are Racist
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       “That’s a pretty good question. Because people, somebody asked me yesterday, "When was the last time you ever changed your opinion? And I said well, it's been a while since I've had a major change of opinion, but I try to understand and study and figure out how things work you know and become better at economics and all.
      </p>
      <p>
       But on that issue (the death penalty), I did have a change of opinion. And I stated this in the debates last go around, they asked…they asked a similar question, ‘when did you change your opinion last?’ And uh, and it, that was just not overnight, but I, my position now is, that since I'm a federal official and I would be a U.S. president, is I do not believe in the federal death penalty and in my book “Liberty Defined”, I explain in it more detail , but basically I make the argument for, uh, against the death penalty but I would not come and say the federal government and the federal courts should tell the states they can't have the death penalty anymore. I don’t go that far.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no, I just don't think the uh ..with the scientific evidence now-
       <strong>
        I think I read an article yesterday on the death penalty, and 68 percent of the time they make mistakes. And it’s so racist, too. I think more than half the people getting the death penalty are poor blacks. This is the one place, the one remnant of racism in our country is in the court system, enforcing the drug laws and enforcing the death penalty. I don’t even know, but I wonder how many of those, how many have been executed? Over 200, I wonder how many were minorities? You know, if you're rich, you usually don't meet the death penalty.”

       <strong>
        Exhibit C: Stubbornly Refuses to Deny That Government Legalized Racism is Cruel and Unjust
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       “No form of political organization, therefore, is immune to cruel abuses like the Jim Crow laws, whereby government sets out to legislate on how groups of human beings are allowed to interact with one another.
      </p>
      <p>
       Peaceful civil disobedience to unjust laws, which I support with every fiber of my being, can sometimes be necessary at any level of government. It falls upon the people, in the last resort, to stand against injustice no matter where it occurs.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the long run, the only way racism can be overcome is through the philosophy of individualism, which I have promoted throughout my life. Our rights come to us not because we belong to some group, but our rights come to us as individuals. And it is as individuals that we should judge one another.
      </p>
      <p>
       Racism is a particularly odious form of collectivism whereby individuals are treated not on their merits but on the basis of group identity. Nothing in my political philosophy, which is the exact opposite of the racial totalitarianism of the twentieth century, gives aid or comfort to such thinking. To the contrary, my philosophy of individualism is the most radical intellectual challenge to racism ever posed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Government exacerbates racial thinking and undermines individualism because its very existence encourages people to organize along racial lines in order to lobby for benefits for their group. That lobbying, in turn, creates animosity and suspicion among all groups, each of which believes that it is getting less of its fair share than the others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, we should quit thinking in terms of race—yes, in 2008 it is still necessary to say that we should Stop thinking in terms of race—and recognize that freedom and prosperity benefit all Americans.”

       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       “But in order to attract Latino votes, I think, you know, too long this country has always put people in groups. They penalize people because they’re in groups, and then they reward people because they’re in groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       But following up on what Newt was saying, we need a healthy economy, we wouldn’t be talking about this. We need to see everybody as an individual. And to me, seeing everybody as an individual means their liberties are protected as individuals and they’re treated that way and they’re never penalized that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you have a free and prosperous society, all of a sudden this group mentality melts away. As long as there’s no abuse — one place where there’s still a lot of discrimination in this country is in our court systems. And I think the minorities come up with a short hand in our court system."

       Today, I think inner-city folks and minorities are punished unfairly in the war on drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, Blacks make up 14% of those who use drugs, yet 36 percent of those arrested are Blacks and it ends up that 63% of those who finally end up in prison are Blacks. This has to change.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don’t have to have more courts and more prisons. We need to repeal the whole war on drugs. It isn’t working. We have already spent over $400 billion since the early 1970s, and it is wasted money. Prohibition didn’t work. Prohibition on drugs doesn’t work. So we need to come to our senses. And, absolutely, it’s a disease. We don’t treat alcoholics like this. This is a disease, and we should orient ourselves to this. That is one way you could have equal justice under the law."

       Allowing for states’ rights here would surely be an improvement, for the states could certainly do a better and more sensible job than the federal government has been doing if they were free to decide the issue for themselves. And although people studying my record will discover how consistent I have been over the years, they will uncover one major shift: in recent years I have dropped my support for the federal death penalty.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a dangerous power for the federal government to have, and it is exercised in a discriminatory way: if you are poor and black, you are much more likely to receive this punishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       We should not think in terms of whites, blacks, Hispanics, and other such groups. That kind of thinking only divides us. The only us-versus-them thinking in which we might indulge is the people—all the people— versus the government, which loots and lies to us all, threatens our liberties, and shreds our Constitution.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s not a white or black issue. That’s an American issue, and it’s one on which Americans of all races can unite in a spirit of goodwill. That may be why polls in 2007 found ours the most popular Republican campaign among black voters.”

       <strong>
        Exhibit G: Openly Admits That Skin Color should be Irrelevant in Society. That Racism is a Sin.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       “Racism is simply an ugly form of collectivism, the mindset that views humans only as members of groups and never as individuals. Racists believe that all individuals who share superficial physical characteristics are alike; as collectivists, racists think only in terms of groups. By encouraging Americans to adopt a group mentality, the advocates of so-called “diversity” actually perpetuate racism. Their intense focus on race is inherently racist, because it views individuals only as members of racial groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conservatives and libertarians should fight back and challenge the myth that collectivist liberals care more about racism. Modern liberalism, however, well-intentioned, is a byproduct of the same collectivist thinking that characterizes racism. The continued insistence on group thinking only inflames racial tensions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The true antidote to racism is liberty. Liberty means having a limited, constitutional government devoted to the protection of individual rights rather than group claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Liberty means free-market capitalism, which rewards individual achievement and competence, not skin color, gender, or ethnicity. In a free market, businesses that discriminate lose customers, goodwill, and valuable employees- while rational businesses flourish by choosing the most qualified employees and selling to all willing buyers. More importantly, in a free society every citizen gains a sense of himself as an individual, rather than developing a group or victim mentality.
      </p>
      <p>
       This leads to a sense of individual responsibility and personal pride, making skin color irrelevant. Rather than looking to government to correct what is essentially a sin of the heart, we should understand that reducing racism requires a shift from group thinking to an emphasis on individualism.”

      </p>
      <p>
       “Worst of all, the left has gotten away with using “extreme” as a code word for “racist.” The exceedingly thin “evidence” given for the racism allegation is that Ashcroft once voted against the nomination of a federal judge who happened to be black. Never mind that more than 50 other Senators voted with Ashcroft; the left is all to eager to assure us that the only conceivable rationale is that Ashcroft is a racist. This type of smearing, aided and abetted by a complicit media, is at the heart of the left’s efforts to demonize conservatives who dare oppose their unconstitutional agenda.”

       “One of the worst aspects of the census is its focus on classifying people by race. When government tells us it wants information to help any given group, it assumes every individual who shares certain physical characteristics has the same interests, or wants the same things from government. This is an inherently racist and offensive assumption. The census, like so many federal policies and programs, inflames racism by encouraging Americans to see themselves as members of racial groups fighting each other for a share of the federal pie.”

Within days, Congress had passed emergency legislation calling for costly new security measures, including a controversial “screening” method which calls for airlines to arbitrarily detain passengers just because the person meets certain criteria which border on racist and xenophobic.”

        Exhibit M: Hates Foreign Aid to African Dictators Who Turn Aid into a “Power to Impoverish” their People
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       African poverty is rooted in government corruption, corruption that actually is fostered by western aid. We should ask ourselves a simple question: Why is private capital so scarce in Africa? The obvious answer is that many African nations are ruled by terrible men who pursue disastrous economic policies. As a result, American aid simply enriches dictators, distorts economies, and props up bad governments. We could send Africa $1 trillion, and the continent still would remain mired in poverty simply because so many of its nations reject property rights, free markets, and the rule of law. As commentator Joseph Potts explains, western money enables dictators like Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe to gain and hold power without the support of his nation’s people. African rulers learn to manipulate foreign governments and obtain an independent source of income, which makes them far richer and more powerful than any of their political rivals. Once comfortably in power, and much to the horror of the western governments that funded them, African dictators find their subjects quite helpless and dependent. Potts describes this process as giving African politicians the “power to impoverish.”

       “With the election behind us, our country turns hopeful eyes to the future. I have a few hopes of my own. I congratulate our first African-American president-elect. Martin Luther King, Jr. certainly would be proud to see this day. We are stronger for embracing diversity, and I am hopeful that we can continue working through the tensions and wrongs of the past and become a more just and colorblind society. I hope this new administration will help bring us together, and not further divide us. I have always found that freedom is the best way to break down barriers. A free society emphasizes the importance of individuals, and not because they are part of a certain group. That’s the only way equal justice can be achieved.”

      <p>
       “After 200 years, the constitutional protection of the right of the individual to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is virtually gone. Today’s current terminology describing rights reflects this sad change. It is commonplace for politicians and those desiring special privileges to refer to: black rights, Hispanic rights, handicap rights, employee rights, student rights, minority rights, women’s rights, gay rights, children’s rights, student rights, Asian-American rights, Jewish rights, AIDS victims’ rights, poverty rights, homeless rights, etc. Unless all the terms are dropped &amp; we recognize that only an individual has rights, the solution to the mess in which we find ourselves will not be found. The longer we lack of definition of rights, the worse the economic and social problems will be.”

       The word is "y'all", not "ya'll". The latter doesn't even make sense. There's no a in the word 'you'. "Y'all" is a contraction of the words 'you' and 'all'.

       If I've been here longer than a mod, I have more right to be here than they do, so I don't see what your point is.

       A shortage of money doesn't just kill through starvation. It kills through a lack of access to clean water, sufficient shelter, adequate healthcare, clothing.. the list goes on and on. Not only that, it ruins all our lives by making us miserable, so it's kind of killing

       Our lives? I'm sorry to hear your miserable not everyone else is though. But even if you are miserable and looking for something easy to pin all your woes on (capitalism and us dastardly libertarians ruining reddit) your words. You still didn't address the issue of democide, I think you'd find being "dead on the inside" is a lot better then being actually dead on the floor of a gulag.

       This "more government"/"less government" analogy isn't an accurate way to talk about what's going on. If more health care programs are made available to the people, how does that equate to killing innocent people with drone strikes? That's a complete scare tactic.

       Nope. Both are utopian because none would work with greedy people in place right now. Like I said before I live in the real world where we're dealing with corrupted politicians which is why I supported Ron Paul in the first place not being corrupted like the rest...

       You're pretty gullible if you don't think Ron Paul is corrupt like the rest of them. Or at least a pawn of theirs. It's no coincidence that his philosophy would benefit the rich. Do you really think he got popular from grassroots support? Yeah, right. If he was proposing something that wouldn't benefit rich people, he wouldn't get any publicity whatsoever. His cult status is intended (by the business establishment) to popularize right-wing capitalist ideology amongst your generation. I say this as a Texan who used to have a Ron Paul bumper sticker on my car.

       This just shows how ignorant you really are about the whole process and the election season. Ron Paul was being ignored by the main stream media and being treated like shit in the debates. He only got 90 seconds to talk one time as well in a 90 minute debate. Seriously, do your research first before you start spouting none sense. Which is why I pegged you a teenager since you don't follow jack shit from what I can tell in this conversation.

       Nothing is wrong with Capitalism. The only thing that's wrong with what we have right now is CRONY capitalism dumbass when the working man bails out big banks and wall street.

       The only troll here is the one who thinks that Ron Paul isn't corrupt. He gets donations form Bilderberg, and nearly all his of his vocal supporters are conspiracy loving idiots.

       I didn't actually read the post. Now that I've read the post I think the guy's a dipshit. He thinks that by simply repeating a lot of stuff and nonsense he can get others to believe it. He thinks that by repeating "Jews blow" he can get everyone to repeat that. Which is retarded. No amount of repetition can change my mind that racism is ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah. The guy's using propaganda techniques. And not very well at that. Fortunately he didn't seem too interested in spamming this site. That said, he's clearly going to target smaller sites and fuck with them. Which sucks. The guy is obviously a douchebag and if I saw him I'd tell him to his face that he's acting like a douche and should probably stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Verdict: don't give a shit.

       Do you honestly have such little faith in yourself that you think that they could "shift opinion in the group" and turn it into some sort of hate fest?
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole "conspiracy" seems like the idea of a bored 12 year old, who has a way too naive concept of how things work.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the biggest problem with his "plan" is that for one, there is no group opinion on r/conspiracy. At least there doesnt appear to be. You cant "shift" the direction of something that doesnt exist.

        Exhibit A: Vociferously Supports an Anti-Racist Agenda
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Libertarianism is the enemy of all racism, because racism is a collectivist idea that you put people in categories. You say, well blacks belong here, and whites here, and women here and we don't see people in forms..or gays. You don't have rights because your gays, or women or minorities, you have rights because you’re an individual. So we see people strictly as individuals. We get these individuals in a natural way. So it's exactly opposite of all collectivism and it's absolutely anti-racism because we don't see it in those terms. "

        Exhibit B: Ferociously Insists that Courts and The Death Penalty are Racist
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       “That’s a pretty good question. Because people, somebody asked me yesterday, "When was the last time you ever changed your opinion? And I said well, it's been a while since I've had a major change of opinion, but I try to understand and study and figure out how things work you know and become better at economics and all.
      </p>
      <p>
       But on that issue (the death penalty), I did have a change of opinion. And I stated this in the debates last go around, they asked…they asked a similar question, ‘when did you change your opinion last?’ And uh, and it, that was just not overnight, but I, my position now is, that since I'm a federal official and I would be a U.S. president, is I do not believe in the federal death penalty and in my book “Liberty Defined”, I explain in it more detail , but basically I make the argument for, uh, against the death penalty but I would not come and say the federal government and the federal courts should tell the states they can't have the death penalty anymore. I don’t go that far.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no, I just don't think the uh ..with the scientific evidence now-
       <strong>
        I think I read an article yesterday on the death penalty, and 68 percent of the time they make mistakes. And it’s so racist, too. I think more than half the people getting the death penalty are poor blacks. This is the one place, the one remnant of racism in our country is in the court system, enforcing the drug laws and enforcing the death penalty. I don’t even know, but I wonder how many of those, how many have been executed? Over 200, I wonder how many were minorities? You know, if you're rich, you usually don't meet the death penalty.”

       <strong>
        Exhibit C: Stubbornly Refuses to Deny That Government Legalized Racism is Cruel and Unjust
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       “No form of political organization, therefore, is immune to cruel abuses like the Jim Crow laws, whereby government sets out to legislate on how groups of human beings are allowed to interact with one another.
      </p>
      <p>
       Peaceful civil disobedience to unjust laws, which I support with every fiber of my being, can sometimes be necessary at any level of government. It falls upon the people, in the last resort, to stand against injustice no matter where it occurs.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the long run, the only way racism can be overcome is through the philosophy of individualism, which I have promoted throughout my life. Our rights come to us not because we belong to some group, but our rights come to us as individuals. And it is as individuals that we should judge one another.
      </p>
      <p>
       Racism is a particularly odious form of collectivism whereby individuals are treated not on their merits but on the basis of group identity. Nothing in my political philosophy, which is the exact opposite of the racial totalitarianism of the twentieth century, gives aid or comfort to such thinking. To the contrary, my philosophy of individualism is the most radical intellectual challenge to racism ever posed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Government exacerbates racial thinking and undermines individualism because its very existence encourages people to organize along racial lines in order to lobby for benefits for their group. That lobbying, in turn, creates animosity and suspicion among all groups, each of which believes that it is getting less of its fair share than the others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, we should quit thinking in terms of race—yes, in 2008 it is still necessary to say that we should Stop thinking in terms of race—and recognize that freedom and prosperity benefit all Americans.”

        Exhibit D: Refuses to Deny that Courts Discriminate Against Minorities
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       “But in order to attract Latino votes, I think, you know, too long this country has always put people in groups. They penalize people because they’re in groups, and then they reward people because they’re in groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       But following up on what Newt was saying, we need a healthy economy, we wouldn’t be talking about this. We need to see everybody as an individual. And to me, seeing everybody as an individual means their liberties are protected as individuals and they’re treated that way and they’re never penalized that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you have a free and prosperous society, all of a sudden this group mentality melts away. As long as there’s no abuse — one place where there’s still a lot of discrimination in this country is in our court systems. And I think the minorities come up with a short hand in our court system."

        Exhibit E: Refuses to Back the Unfair Punishment of Minorities
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       "A system designed to protect individual liberty will have no punishments for any group and no privileges.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, I think inner-city folks and minorities are punished unfairly in the war on drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, Blacks make up 14% of those who use drugs, yet 36 percent of those arrested are Blacks and it ends up that 63% of those who finally end up in prison are Blacks. This has to change.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don’t have to have more courts and more prisons. We need to repeal the whole war on drugs. It isn’t working. We have already spent over $400 billion since the early 1970s, and it is wasted money. Prohibition didn’t work. Prohibition on drugs doesn’t work. So we need to come to our senses. And, absolutely, it’s a disease. We don’t treat alcoholics like this. This is a disease, and we should orient ourselves to this. That is one way you could have equal justice under the law."

        Exhibit F: Vehemently Insists that Drug Wars Harms Blacks and Other Minorities Disproportionately
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       “…the federal war on drugs has wrought disproportionate harm on minority communities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Allowing for states’ rights here would surely be an improvement, for the states could certainly do a better and more sensible job than the federal government has been doing if they were free to decide the issue for themselves. And although people studying my record will discover how consistent I have been over the years, they will uncover one major shift: in recent years I have dropped my support for the federal death penalty.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a dangerous power for the federal government to have, and it is exercised in a discriminatory way: if you are poor and black, you are much more likely to receive this punishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       We should not think in terms of whites, blacks, Hispanics, and other such groups. That kind of thinking only divides us. The only us-versus-them thinking in which we might indulge is the people—all the people— versus the government, which loots and lies to us all, threatens our liberties, and shreds our Constitution.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s not a white or black issue. That’s an American issue, and it’s one on which Americans of all races can unite in a spirit of goodwill. That may be why polls in 2007 found ours the most popular Republican campaign among black voters.”
