    <div class="md"><p>there are a ridiculous number of reasons to keep living.</p>

<p>for one, suicide makes life a living hell for everyone who knew you- family, friends, even coworkers. not to mention whoever has to clean up after you when you bleed out and empty your bowels all over the place. also, what if you fail? things will be so much worse, and you&#39;ll never get another shot. even guns don&#39;t always work.</p>

<p>but more importantly, i bet you haven&#39;t even travelled outside the country in search of a solution. until you do that, suicide shouldn&#39;t even be an option.</p>

<p>the world has so much awesome shit in it- places where you don&#39;t need money, where you have something that people need, where you can experience things that your depressed mind won&#39;t even allow you consider.</p>

<p>if you&#39;re gonna die anyway, why not rob a bank and distribute the money in handfuls behind your getaway car? why not buy a deer rifle and take out a few goldman sachs execs? </p>

<p>see if making the world a better place changes how you feel about suicide.</p>

<p>Yes, you still need some start-up money. But that&#39;s mostly for electricity + running water. If you can manage to settle near a spring, and do everything the analog way, you really don&#39;t need to worry about it.</p>

<p>You really need to have strong survival instincts, however. And possibly have a gun for back-up. You know: because bears.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> ...or find a community of people already living this way, and integrate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you seen the movie the Grey? It deals with this subject. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry you have suffered so much. These are extremely hard lessons to deal with. You don&#39;t have to fear death. Your physical body is temporary. You soul will live on. It is eternal and indestructible. The best and brightest in you remains untouched, unscathed in all this. I hope you can know this. You have power enough in you now to make a difference. I know i&#39;m in no position to give you advice in this, you will make your own choices but i suggest you go on living until your time has come and serve as an example and testament to human will. Have you tried yoga or meditation? Medication is supposed to heal the body (this is not always so). Meditation will heal the spirit. Every time. </p>

<p>Also i commend you in your honesty. You may still have part to play in all this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Make sure you fairly and judiciously examine your quality though, could be your judgement might be impaired. Also states of mind and body are very transitory so in that it&#39;s a bit like Kansas weather, if you don&#39;t like it wait a minute and it will change.  Now I know that it takes more than a minute but in the whole grand scheme of things it&#39;s closer to a minute than anything else.    </p>

<p>By the way I too am pro-choice when it comes to suicide but I&#39;m sure glad I didn&#39;t do it when it was a very powerful thought in my mind since shit changed and continued to for decades.  Strength comes and goes in different forms and sometimes you have to wait it out to get another round. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my experience that doesn&#39;t quite add up, but correct me if you have a decent source. Weed firstly enhances emotional sensations (and physical too), and secondly focuses the mind internally so you will be forced to ruminate over any stresses in your life heavily for the duration of the effect. As someone who suffers from depression and anxiety, I&#39;d consider weed the very last thing to consider as treatment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to tell you: I just spent over an hour writing a thoughtful and impassioned reply, only to have it blotted out by a software glitch. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll keep it short and to the point: I&quot;m guessing you&#39;re 25 or so. 
I&quot;m 53.
Now I&#39;m not going to go all &#39;You young pussy&#39; on you at all. But I want to raise two points:</p>

<ol>
<li>You are probably going through &#39;poison(mercury) and drug (anti-psychotic) withdrawl/shock&#39;. Probably not a good time to make life-ending decisions.</li>
<li><p>You are going through, and especially AFRAID, that this period could go on for a long time - a year, two, five...</p></li>
<li><p>You are afraid it&#39;s permanent.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>To address these things: 
1. In all the above situations, nearly all drugs/poisons  damage will reverse over time. Yes, you are afraid of mercury fillings. DId you get them at infancy? If not, you are probably not terribly damaged. (I got my first at 13 - and I&#39;m a college professor now)
2. I mentioned earlier that I thought you were around 25 - here&#39;s the deal: Wait until 50. You will look at the worst case scenario, say 5 years of &#39;getting back to normal&#39; as a blip in your history. Really. &quot;Oh yeah, 25 years ago I was really a mess - until 30!&quot; In the past 20 years I&#39;ve HAD A BLAST...&quot; </p>

<p>And of course,
4: If you are just some idiot posting this as a troller, 
DIE A SLOW, EXISTENTIALLY HORRIBLE DEATH.</p>

Its been able to cure a very wide verity of illness. If your gonna off yourself, you might as well try everything first. It would help if you knew exactly what was wrong with you. If its just a mood thing then try working about, eating healthy, and smoking pot. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>often people with schizophrenia will think their meds aren&#39;t helping, when they actually are. schizophrenia is consistent with fixating on being poisoned as a possible cause for your feelings.</p>

<p>the number one thing i would tell you is what i mentioned before- get your mercury levels checked, endocrine function checked.</p>

<p>if those two things are normal, you are NOT being poisoned. you&#39;ll need to consider other possibilities. and being suicidal, you&#39;re simply not in any condition to be figuring that out for yourself. maybe you could get placed as an inpatient? you&#39;ll need intensive meds AND talk therapy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hey man, been there, went manic depressive for about six months. Found out i&#39;m bipolar. At the same time though, i never bowed in, as i came up with a really depressing fact.</p>

<p>The subjective labeling that created these terms and the need for medication is just a method to route out traits which influence free will, rationality, and thought. You are living proof of a theory of mine, as i am also proof that this theory holds true. I call it the stupid coefficient. </p>

<p>For generations since mass media has existed, a mold has been set in what is &quot;normal&quot; and what type of eccentricity is beyond that. We created a need for medication, and started viewing these eccentricities as a problem. They are a gift and a curse. They are part of our personalities. Ain&#39;t nothing really wrong with us, but we are instilled with the thought that something could be, creating self doubt, and making enemies for ourselves when there need not be.</p>

<p>This is where the stupid coefficient comes into play. When people find out they have a &quot;problem&quot; they become self conscious about it. These people are usually intelligent. Moreso than the typical tsa worker, or the average guy. Three things can happen, they can try to fit into societies mold and adapt to characteristics that are more desirable as deemed by our moronic peers, you know the type, celebrity gossipers, believers of our current form of democracy, people who watch tv basically, or take up pointless menial tasks like a sport or some other non consequential matter. By fitting in to what society wants with medication and the like, we give up the fight, and become apathetic, no longer caring to suffer from the truth of the matter, that shit is fucked up and we can&#39;t change it on a whim, that hard work and co-operation are the only ways to fix it.</p>

<p>With that said, the three options for this great stupid coefficient proceed as follows. You can become a stereotypical member of society and be apathetic and non consequential. </p>

<p>You can continue down the path you take of wanting to know the truth to two outcomes, either you learn to deal with it and see the truth as a rational being, or you progressively get crazier and your logic starts to slip. Either way, if you learn how to deal with it while remaining rational, many will still consider you crazy because again, they are ignorant cunts and can&#39;t bother to learn said truth or are just too beaten down by society themselves that they gave up the fight years ago and learned how to live with a dose of apathy, leading us back to option 1, molding ourselves into what other people want us to be.</p>

<p>Or option three, when we dip off into the crazy or just give up on the fight, no longer willing to mould ourselves to be another stereotype in society, and no longer willing to continue learning the truth about said society, we as intelligent beings more often then not commit suicide, thus removing these undesirable traits as deemed by pharmaceutical companies but which have existed in human beings since the dawn of man for some reason (thus proving through evolution that these traits are a part of society for a reason, since evolution dictates that these traits would have been rid of a long time ago if it was the case)</p>

<p>Now, where it gets funny. This subjective labeling in the past couple generations has lead to a lot of self doubt on the part of the intelligent people, allowing the dumb to flourish. Smart people don&#39;t get laid as much unless they have confidence in themselves. We breed less, and pass off less of our genetic material through to the next generation of earth. Perpetuating the problem. If this persists, people like you and me won&#39;t be around as skeptics to give a damn about society. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t let the stupid people win. No need for that shit. Death becomes of us all eventually regardless. If you really want to rush it, start smoking like i do. I&#39;m not even trying to shy away from cancer, and i can&#39;t wait until i die. I think of it every day. I&#39;m excited to find out about my own theory on death. But i realized this simple fact, that stupid people have been able to outbreed intelligence. And that scared me about death. I fear that if i die, so too will part of the human element that is absolutely essential in these dire times. I&#39;ve applied george carlin&#39;s philosophy of just being an outside observer to the issues i am passionate about, and utilize a healthy dose of schadenfreude. I got a tattoo that reflects the sad reality. We all die eventually, no need to rush it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure i&#39;m right with this stupid coefficient though, this theory has existed for a very long time, other people have their own variations on it, and the deterioration of our education in our respective nations is definitely of consideration when an application such as this postulation becomes accepted as more than a theory. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t give up your voice. Live for the small things. The flowers, the smile on a childs face, the sunrise and sunset. Live for the birds chatter, the breeze as it carries those floral aroma&#39;s. Meditate, work past the insanity that you are driven to. Realize it&#39;s not your fault, you are merely a mortal, but you are doing the best you can for your community, your friends, family, to promote the aspects of life you see as fitting. We can&#39;t change the world alone. We have to do it together. And i&#39;d loathe to add you to my stupid coefficient&#39;s third option.  I need your help, the world needs it. You will get your peace of mind in time, no need to rush it. Look for the peace of mind that is readily available, and do not let this manic world drag you in to it&#39;s shenanigans. Call bull shit, laugh, and move on to listening to the birds, watching butterflies, and being a socially responsible adult. We need more of these traits present in humanity, not less. People need to learn how to think again, what education is, not shy away from it because the truth hurts. Apathy, my first option, is healthy as a defense mechanism, but i prefer schadenfreude. Pain heals and chicks dig scars man.</p>

<p>I got a tattoo to live with that pain, and remind me of it. It cries a tear of blood for humanity, for my stupid coefficient. It signifies the sadness that comes with the quest for knowledge. I don&#39;t want to have it changed to include a pool of blood to signify you and the millions of others who chose the easy way out. I think it&#39;s good enough with a tear drop.</p>

<p>If you already know you have hypothyroidism, that&#39;s a start. you&#39;ve probably already seen a doctor about this, but see one more. don&#39;t give them previous medical records to bias them (except labs/imaging). get hormone levels checked, can get mercury checked, can tell them to check endocrine function (BPA is endocrine disruptor). i bet they&#39;ll find that you don&#39;t have mercury poisoning at all, but that your hypothyroidism/hormone levels and organic depression is what is causing this.</p>

<p>fixating on mercury poisoning when mercury is cleared by the body in under a month is not productive. neither is contemplating suicide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you self diagnosed yourself with mercury poisoning. The fact that you think the symptoms were there as soon as they were removed should be telling... </p>

<p>Mercury/silver fillings aren&#39;t the best (and should be banned, but anyway), but it&#39;s highly unlikely that you were &quot;poisoned&quot; by them, unless you literally took them out and vaporized the mercury and then inhaled it all. The amount that leaches from a filling is less than you get just from breathing in air, or eating (particularly fish).  </p>

<p>And now you think you are being poisoned by you composite fillings. It sounds like you have some other paranoid issues that&#39;s causing you to fixate on something. Like you thought mold was causing it before hand then you discovered that there was mercury in your fillings. </p>

<p>You have issues, but it&#39;s not caused by the stuff that&#39;s in your mouth. You likely had these issues long before you had any fillings.  You really sound like you&#39;re more of a hypochondriac. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your response.  I&#39;ve already tried the whole detox process but haven&#39;t had any real success.  Except I did get that &quot;mercury rash&quot; several times when attempting to detox.  I was sitting in my bathtub full of epsom salt feeling like I was dying as the mercury was being excreted out of my skin.  The mercury is concentrated now in my brain though and I&#39;m not sure how to get rid of it.</p>

<p>I will withdraw from the anti-psychotics slowly to avoid any complications.</p>

<p>When I get the anxiety I sit it out. I always feel better after a banana, a sandwich and some milk. That sounds ridiculous, but I assure you it&#39;s not ridiculous to me. I get them frequently and it&#39;s rarely a joke.</p>

<p>Speaking of which I had a one month-long anxiety attack ealier this year. That was horrible I woke up in adead panics almost daily. I ended up pacing a lot and trying to sleep it off. No kidding I think my cat helped me a lot with my mental state. I don&#39;t have a dog, but my kitty is pretty tight. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just saying that you might be in a bad spot as of this moment. But look two moments into the future. Now ten. Now a few thousand. You will not always be in a bad spot. You have the possibility to move to a better spot. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you have people in your life that love you?  Suicide is a very selfish act...  If you feel like you have nothing to loose (and I would imagine you feel this way if you consider suicide) then you should spend your time fighting against the things in your life that have wronged you. A noble cause for your life...  to help and protect others that may be in your situation.  The positivity that can come from such a cause can help others and also work toward healing you. It can give you focus and positivity in a sea of negativity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you got your fillings removed did you get a gas mask from your dentist? And did you take heavy metal binding supplements months before and after the removal? If not, that was a big mistake and you poisoned your nervous system with mercury. That is for sure.</p>

<p>Did you try spirulina and chorella to bind mercury? Starting with low doses and constantly increasing the dose of chorella so you do not throw up even if you take 80 chorella pills a day? Wood garlic and cilantro make mercury move but you need high concentration of chorella in your body to bind the heavy metals and detox them naturally out of your body. You need also to drink a lot of clean water to help the detoxification process.</p>

<p>There are heavy metal detox programms out there that work and help repair your nervous system by providing high doses of omega 3 (eg. salmon oil capsules) and suplements with all essential minerals your body needs. After six months of such a programme you will be a different person and your brain activity will increase. You will not feel smarter, but you will feel that other people are increasingly dumber. That is the same effect when you run faster than others. You do not feel that you run faster than before but you can see that others are slower than you are, because the lack of direct relative comparison.</p>

<p>Next step is to get rid of the fluorides from your antipsychotic drugs.</p>

<p>Your natural state of being is having a reaction to this world.  All the drugs and shrinks and experts are just helping people stay integrated into falsehood.  </p>

<p>I am opining, but man the more people I talk to the more I realize that everyone knows that the matrix is complete bullshit and everyone is afraid to live without it.</p>

<p>What kind of work have you done to clear your chakras?  Have you pursued many meta-physical options?  Having your soul cleared of any bound spirits?  </p>

<p>There is a lot of joy, truth and understanding that can come from meta-physics.  </p>

<p>Please know that many many people care about and love you.  Most of them you have never met.  Perhaps just being patient and allowing these things to play out will bring you to greater peace.  Find and stick with people who offer patience, tolerance, kindliness and love.  Avoid and disengage all others. </p>

<p>Hang in there brother, the mid 20&#39;s are a great mindfuck.  You should wait until your at least 35 before making life and death choices.  Just survive through this tough time and more will be revealed later down the road.   </p>
