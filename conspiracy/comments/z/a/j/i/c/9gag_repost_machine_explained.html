       These are things I've observed in the last weeks, even months. I've been looking very closely at how, when and which submissions 9GAG steals. Today, I present my results.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        UPDATE
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I've edited my entire post. The 9GAG Administration is reacting to my creation and are observing the Hot / Trending page very carefully. They copy fewer submissions from reddit and give their copies realistic post times. The
       <a href="http://9gag.com/trending">
        Trending
       </a>
       and
       <a href="http://9gag.com/">
        Hot
       </a>
       page is being updated very slowly, which is very strange. Unless they are now missing the copies/reposts they usually take from other sites. Looks like I've caught the attention of the 9GAG bosses!
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       <strong>
        OBSERVATIONS
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        9GAG does indeed steal submissions from other sites everyday. Sometimes up to 90% of the Hot or Trending page are reposts from reddit, their main source.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       You should know this one by now.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        9GAG does not have automated scripts which steal your submissions. Everything is done by humans.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I don't know who came up with that idea that they made scripts, because it's just wrong. They have hired people to browse the biggest subreddits (such as
       <a href="/r/pics">
        /r/pics
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/funny">
        /r/funny
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/gaming">
        /r/gaming
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/wtf">
        /r/wtf
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/aww">
        /r/aww
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/f7u12">
        /r/f7u12
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/adviceanimals">
        /r/adviceanimals
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/videos">
        /r/videos
       </a>
       ) and steal content. Day for day.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        9GAG staff visits sites like tumblr.com, funnyjunk.com, reddit.com and 4chan.org in order to identify threats and react correctly.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       They are reading this right now. They do this since
       <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sites/9gag">
        4chan attacked their site
       </a>
       . This will make most my links to 9GAG lead to 404 or redirect you to their index page.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        When 9GAG steals a submission (from reddit), they rename the title and remove watermarks.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Proves that actual people are stealing our content. They have become pretty good at removing the reddit alien watermark from our rage comics and they will change our submission titles to "9GAG appropriate" ones. For example, they will replace the word "reddit" with "9GAG". Or rename "I have made this awesome cake" to "Awesome Cake" and "Look what I've found in Paris!" to "Genius graffiti from Paris" (they cannot be all over the world at the same time).
      </p>
      <p>
       Bots cannot do this task. Only humans can.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        reddit is not the only site they steal from.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I have noticed they steal from other sites like tumblr and pinterest as well. Probably there are even more websites.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        9GAG fakes the submission times of stolen posts in order to make it seem like 9GAG is the original source.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Let's take a closer look at this one.

       Now, it seems like it was posted on 9GAG before reddit! This is a witty trick from the 9GAG Administration. Let's find out by how many hours their post time has been manipulated. For this we take a look at the next post:
       <a href="http://9gag.com/gag/5259341">
        http://9gag.com/gag/5259341
       </a>
       . Obviously this has been posted before
       <a href="http://9gag.com/gag/5259343">
        http://9gag.com/gag/5259343
       </a>
       because the submission number is smaller. But when we look at the submission times, we see this...

      <p>
       When it should be reverse! Oh dear, what is this? Wizard magic? Or proof that 9GAG invented the time machine?!
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        9GAG does not want their users to notice that their community is very restrictedly ruled by admins.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       They're pretty good at hiding this. Their commenting system will automatically hide your comment if it contains the word "reddit" or "reddit.com", for example. It is only visible for yourself. Sign off Facebook and your comment will be gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have taken other steps to make sure their users don't notice that most of the top 9GAG posts are stolen. They have removed the submission times from Hot / Trending, they have removed the Likes from user pages (except your own) - because bots can easily be spot since they have 0 likes - and they have removed comments from user pages because people would point out bots.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        9GAG "repost accounts" are easy to spot. If you know they exist.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Example "repost account":
       <a href="http://9gag.com/bananabirdie">
        http://9gag.com/bananabirdie
       </a>
       (
       <a href="http://www.freezepage.com/1346729220AUQKGLLSTG">
        Screenshot
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a look at his posts. Nearly every single one reached the Trending or Hot page (indicated by the high number of comments and likes). This is impossible, regular accounts look like this
       <a href="http://9gag.com/loninox">
        http://9gag.com/loninox
       </a>
       (
       <a href="http://www.freezepage.com/1346729338BXUQEHUZXM">
        Screenshot
       </a>
       ) and don't ever reach the Trending / Hot page. Not to mention with every single post.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        9GAG staff does look out for people who point out "repost accounts".
        <a href="http://i.imgur.com/8tAi1.jpg">
         I have listed some in my post before.
        </a>
        Nearly all of them are gone now. Once they see a "repost account" mentioned, they will not delete it - but change its name.
        <a href="http://i.imgur.com/4f2Re.jpg">
         Proof here.
        </a>
        <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:dtDM5NAafUwJ:9gag.com/ossaan+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=es&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=mx&amp;client=firefox-a">
         more
        </a>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Seems like they really don't want to make this go public. They also want to keep the stolen content. Everytime a "repost account" is discovered, they give it a new name. Repeat ad infinitum.
      </p>
      <p>
       At first I thought they have created a script that automatically changes the accounts name after a certain amount of visits (let's say 100) use the referrer reddit.com (or 4chan.org, tumblr.com...). But I shouldn't give them ideas.
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/4f2Re.jpg">
        The account I've mentioned in this image
       </a>
       has been changed as well, so there are definitely people changing the accounts names. I have never linked it anywhere, nor has anyone else. The referrer is i.imgur.com and not reddit.com.
      </p>
      <p>
       "repost accounts" usually have two words in their names, maybe one or two underscores, some random numbers before or after the name. They have made a name generator script only for this purpose.
      </p>

        CONCLUSIONS
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The fact that 9GAG has to constantly steal content from other sites is only proof that 9GAG has the worst community ever. Even though
         <a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/9gag.com">
          9GAG is the 268th most visited site on the planet
         </a>
         their users cannot come up with their own funny content.
        </p>
       </li>

        <p>
         <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20101217111413/http://9gag.com/">
          9GAG seems to be based upon the idea that the administration steals content from other sites, as this old screenshot shows
         </a>
         . It looks like they have always been stealing. Check how many posts have been posted by a user called "reddit". But now they have decided to hide the fact that they take their content from reddit.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         9GAG does not want people to know this. They've done several things to make their content theft go unnoticed.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       <strong>
        FURTHER PROOF

      </p>
      <p>
       If you still don't believe it, check out these administrator accounts. Look how all of their posts got massive votes and comments - something that is impossible to achieve without cheating the system.

        WHAT WILL HAPPEN NOW
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Either 9GAG stops stealing content from other sites using their evil system they have developped over time and leaves the content creation to their userbase
      </p>
      <p>
       OR
      </p>
      <p>
       they will make it even harder to detect stolen content, add more protection mechanisms and cover their tracks even better.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recommend you go for the first option, dear 9GAG Admin who is reading this.

       Reddit does give submissions without author's consent, Reddit also at times does not give the source of the content, Being fair, 9gag doesn't either but that doesn't make them the 'bad website'. Also, 9gag doesn't have 'bots' that filter content from reddit. These are just people.

       Lol i wasn't talking about filter bots. (That had to change after 4chan's attack, i lul'ed so hard) but account bots that are acounts that do most of the reposting. let me be clear. I'm ok with a repost, But when watermarks are removed. That's kinda bullshit..

       What if I told you that users posted 9gag, not admins. Would you honestly believe 9gag is some evil company, sifting through content on various websites 24/7, removing watermarks, adding theirs, and then have a  group maniacal laugh? OR just users posting funny pictures/rage comics they saw that day on reddit or funny junk on to 9gag.

       To people claiming that "this is how the internet works" and citing that sharing and resubmission are just a part of things, I'd just like to point out that it's one thing to teach, for example, that Watson &amp; Crick discovered the double-helix structure of DNA. It would be another thing entirely if my lecturer tries to claim that he discovered it. The issue is not in the reposts, it's in the suppression of evidence giving credit outside 9gag.

       Louis CK is a comedian.  He says things that his audience thinks are funny to get people to pay him money.  You, however, are either accusing the administrators of 9GAG of being homosexuals, or you are conflating homosexuality with ill-reputed members of society.  Stand on a stage and use the word "faggot" as a punchline in a joke and it will be obvious that you are using the term humorously.  Use it in a normal sentence without any context indicating otherwise and it will be assumed you are using it derisively.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are plenty of other words that can be used to convey your sentiment.  There is absolutely no reason to use that word, which has the disadvantage of reduced clarity of meaning, when so many others would much more eloquently and precisely convey the contempt you feel for the subjects without conflating it with their sexual identity.  I personally do not agree with Louis CK on the subject and despise that joke of his, even while enjoying almost every other bit he has done.  He may be a good comedian, but he is human and has bigoted and misplaced beliefs just like the rest of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, are you saying that they are homosexuals or are you just saying that their behavior is as reprehensible to you as that of homosexual behavior?  Kat Williams calls all sorts of people "niggers" but I don't hear you calling the 9GAG admins "niggers".  How is that derisive epithet any different?  Pawning off your choice of words on someone else is immature and shows little responsibility for the impact your words have on others.  You are not Louis CK, you were not performing stand up comedy when you said this, formulate your own defense.

       That's like arguing that black people can use the term "nigger" without reproach (i.e. the writers of South Park are avowed homosexuals).  And, to continue my previous point, it's a cartoon which implies satirical intent.  There was no context surrounding the use that would have indicated satire or humorous intent.  It was a comment within a serious discussion and the use was unwarranted and confused the subject under discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using derisive language, no mater how noble one's intent, is still using derisive language.  There was no reason to bring their sexual identity into question, nor to inadvertently disparage homosexuals by equating them to the 9GAG administrators.  Being aware of the meaning of one's words, and responsible for the impact, is a sign of maturity.  South Park would be an example on the other end of the spectrum, and furthermore tends to undermine your position on the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       So far the only thing we have determined in both rebuttals to my comment is that using "faggot" incorrectly is perfectly acceptable in the context of humor (an assertion I wholeheartedly disagree with).  The comment in question was not intended, from any reasonable person's assessment, to be humorous.  Even the other words in that very sentence have specific and intentional meanings.  The word "faggots" seems misplaced and unnecessary in order to convey the meaning of the writer's message, and in fact it seems to detract from the overall message.

       It has nothing to do with sexual identity, how are you not getting this? It's a word being used in a different context. The word "faggot" isn't always referencing a homosexual. The actual definition is a bundle of sticks. There is no need to get offended.

       I think my point about being responsible for the impact of your words being a sign of maturity was either lost on you, or you were just proving my point for me.  If you want to be painted as immature and insensitive feel free to use the word "faggot" to your heart's content.

       Oh, I'm sorry, I though this was America, i didn't know we were in socialist kakzanistan. I though i had the freedom of speech. World war 2? The civil war? Ring any bells?

       Sorry to disappoint you. This is the internet, specifically - reddit.com (located on the internet), accessible on a (mostly) global scale. No - this isn't America. You have a freedom to say whatever you want, but that does not mean that it should be said. You're bringing solely an opinion into a conversation that is revolving around pointing out inconsistencies and backing them up with proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       World War 2 was not about 9gag nor freedom of speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       I assume you are referring to the Civil War of the United States, in which case yes; that was about freedom of speech and escaping taxation. It was not about 9gag or stealing content. Actually - fun fact for you, the declaration of independence was modeled after other British documents so that it could not be blatantly rejected as being 'uneducated propaganda'.

       You might want to check your facts about that internet bit. The historical development of it was essentially a joint effort. Regardless - it does not matter where it was invented, as that is irrelevant to both this conversation and the modern internet today (as it has adapted so much since it's 'creation'). You might find

       video interesting to watch, as it may clarify a bit of what I'm saying in the event that it does not make sense.

       Bringing me to my second point. I never said who overcame who in what war(s). It looks like you're confused about where I am in the world, as shown by your "we kicked your ass" comment. I was born, raised, and still reside in Florida, thank you very much.

       Ok then, in that case you should be so unamerican. The fact is that America invented the internet, it was called the arpanet, which became the internet, only England and France helped a bit but that's was only basic stuff, like Alfred helping batman. So you can't claim we didn't invent it. P.s. I respect your opinion to.

       people to reposts content from various websites to their website, removing watermarks and such - Do you know what reddit was founded on? People posting funny articles, stories from other websites and forums.

        You should know this one by now. 9GAG does not have automated scripts which steal your submissions. Everything is done by humans.

      <p>
       Perhaps you should touch up on those reading skills, no where in OP's conspiracy does it actually 'prove' that 9gags 'hires' people. OP just shows that content on reddit is being posted on 9gag with watermarks removed. Who I am to kid, I'm arguing with someone on r/conspiracy. The tin foil companies owe you great service for your loyalty.

       People complain about their memes getting stolen while they're downloading the latest Avengers bootleg.  I would have never heard of 9gag if it wasn't for 4chan complaining about it.  Really who cares.

       I've never met a pirate with a differing set of views from mine.  I've very rarely encountered people who buy software, then pirate it to get around obnoxious copy protection, but never the pro-IP pirate.

       Getting things for free is preferable to paying for them. This is the central premise of piracy.

       I always used to browse 9gag. It was a change, a new place, a fresh experience. But when you start seeing shit that you saw on /b/ four years ago you start to think that the place is a little shit. It's a reddit for people who cannot be arsed to CLICK. a mass meme massacre on a daily basis, slaughtering memes over using them and most of the time posting shitty rage comics about trivial shit that no one should give a shit about but then when it's online... WAIT I GIVE A SHIT ABOUT THAT! SMILEY FACE BUTTON THAT SHIT! and lo and behold 9 gag becomes something of legend.
      </p>
      <p>
       I must admit, the 9gag army, or so they're called are pathetic. The site is a shambles, but then again who cares? It's an internet site just the same as any other in some respects.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why can't we just let them have "our" content. Why can't we let them steal and use what redditors have created? Because they're not stealing it? No they're not just doing some mad shit with some computers to STEAL images and links from the face of reddit and relocate them on 9gag. They're copying. And sharing. Just the same as every single person on this site (I'm pretty sure I can make that assumption) has done with media such as music, movies, TV shows and games. Don't be hypocrites guys. Be happy you're making something good enough that people want to "share".
      </p>
      <p>
       ....To make it clear I respect the research 9FAG_EXPERT has done and I am not trying to defend 9gag or reddit. But there is a line we need to draw when people are taking credit for your creations but still what can you do? You can't track them down and beat them into submission.

       This is B.S. Reddit doesn't have a 'right' to any content. Those who argue that 9gag is 'stealing' from reddit are hypocrites.

       I love the community here, especially the
       <a href="/r/askscience">
        /r/askscience
       </a>
       - but most content in reddit are links to other websites. There isn't anything 'exclusive' to reddit - the users who posts pictures/videos here are posting it on the internet, a medium of free information. What if I told you that some redditors are 9gaggers?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Downvote me all you want, but you guys are fucking morons to think that reddit has any intellectual property over rage comics and pictures.
