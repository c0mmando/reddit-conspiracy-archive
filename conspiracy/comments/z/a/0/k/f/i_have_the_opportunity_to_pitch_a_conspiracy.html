        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Long time lurker, first time poster. Pardon my throwaway.</p>

<p>I have the opportunity to present a conspiracy themed show to a major network. I have done the initial pitch and now they have come back with strong interest - but they are curious to know how to frame this show  - and what topics will be covered.</p>

<p>What I need to create is a show with a point of difference. Perhaps pick up where Jesse Ventura left off or explore elements he failed to analyse. 
The backbone of the show will be fact based - we don&#39;t want to venture into wild Ancient Aliens territory.</p>

<p>So I guess the question I am asking is -  in the best case scenario, what type of conspiracy themed show would you like to see? How would you like to see ideas presented. What topics have not been dealt with adequately?</p>

<p>What type of content would impress you? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say something that is now actually admitted and/or declassified. </p>

<p>You could cover for example the death of Martin Luther King, a court ruled that the US government killed him. </p>

<p>You could cover operation Ajax or Gladio, I think its very important to explore previous &quot;conspiracies&quot; that are now proven and declassified. </p>

<p>From there you can move on to something that is still unproven. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>TV news guy here.</p>

<p>Just some suggestions-</p>

<p>To frame the show start with man on the street interviews, asking what people know about individual subject and then give them more info as the interview progresses. Then you can intercut these throughout the show as the thesis develops cutting back to them as you reveal more information to see if you can change their minds. Play their reactions off against the material being presented.</p>

<p>Go back and forth between current / recent events and historical. The October Surprise with Carter and Reagan then back to the Bavarian Illuminati. Jim Marrs book RULE BY SECRECY does this very effectively. The timeline in his book starts at the present day and works backwards to the roots of ideas explored in previous chapters.</p>

<p>Cut out the Jesse Ventura hyperbole, fake strategy meetings and fake confrontations.</p>

<p>Show more resources and actual documents and video. Let these speak for themselves. In news we like natural sound / interview packages where the sources tell the story themselves with just a little linking track by the narrator / host.</p>

<p>Get a less controversial host, someone with enough skeptic credentials so your audience won&#39;t be just the lunatic fringe but not so X-FILES Scully that true believers won&#39;t tune in.</p>

<p>If you are going to use re-enactments dial the cheese factor back as far as your budget will let you. Light on the shakey cam unless someone is being chased. Perhaps you could switch from traditional documentary style to straight movie style re-enactment and back again letting the action tell the story.</p>

<p>When shooting interviews stick with one or two angles. Stay away from jazzing them up with effects or distracting cutaways.</p>

<p>Subjects - </p>

<p>FEMA</p>

<p>Kennedy</p>

<p>911</p>

<p>Election scandals and election rigging around the world</p>

<p>Oil, solar, power production</p>

<p>Wikileaks</p>

<p>Freemasons</p>

<p>Nuclear power</p>

<p>Fluoride</p>

<p>UFO&#39;s</p>

<p>Surveillance and data mining</p>

<p>Fake Moon landing including Kubrick</p>

<p>If you&#39;re taking resumes let me know. I love the subject matter, I can produce, write, shoot and edit.</p>

<p>It would be great if there were Levels of Confirmation.</p>

<p>Like &quot;conspiracy probable&quot;, &quot;conspiracy confirmed&quot;, etc.</p>

<p>Another idea would be to do like they did on that British show (was it QI?), where you ask 100 people if they believe in XYZ conspiracy, then present all the evidence and ask them if they believe now. The show I&#39;m thinking of did it with normal debate topics.</p>

<p>Finally, I have several awesome show ideas. Not conspiracy shows, I mean totally different show ideas all together. We should connect.</p>

There is no reason not to in this day and age. Release free episodes on the internet. Not doing this will lead your show to ruin, really. For the love of god, comrade, we&#39;re all here, don&#39;t do this alone!</p>

<p>Also, what everyone else said. No out-of-place intense music, no flashy graphics, don&#39;t fucking pretend like you&#39;re doing research in some kind of situation room with secret agents. Do not give in to the temptation to place drama where it wouldn&#39;t normally be in an attempt to make the piece more appealing. DO encourage dramatic feelings, but where it comes naturally, lest you become a news show. </p>

<p>Also, talk about and analyze the effects of social conditioning that television has on a populace. Kinda mandatory, really. =P</p>

<p>Make it your goal to get assassinated with this. We&#39;ll totally Jesus you. &lt;3</p>

<p>&quot;The House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded that &quot;scientific acoustical evidence establishes a high probability that two gunmen fired at President John F.

<p>More people should know that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with several other posters.  Stick to conspiracies that we know happened.  MKUltra, USS Liberty, Bay of Pigs, Mena Arkansa, CIA&#39;s involvement with the 60&#39;s counterculture.  I&#39;m sure you have ideas.  I think BCLaraby&#39;s suggestion of then linking it to something new that hasn&#39;t been proven to be a conspiracy is a good way to go.  But overall, stick with the facts.  The facts are way too often, in favor of conspiracies.  Good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is this straight news or docudrama style about past or present conspiracies?  How about a show centering on a loose-knit team of international diplomats tasked with spinning difficult situations.  They may not know the entire truth about an event, just a few facts, and they have to concoct fantasies to feed the private, public, and government in key demographics and regions. One of the main characters (as suggested elsewhere) is the uninitiated who is selected to work there.  Then, a la Newsroom, conspiracy-oriented events could be presented with as much known info as possible, dramatized by presenting it as being covered up by the secret news club without necessarily arguing one way or the other about whether the conspiracy genuine.</p>

<p>It would go something like this:</p>

<p>Present conspiracy as it is widely known</p>

<p>Look at different parts of the conspiracy, attempting to judge their validity using facts. Correct any glaring inaccuracies, and point out things that are most certainly true.</p>

<p>Then come to one of many conclusions, such as:</p>

<p>It turns out this conspiracy is true</p>

<p>This conspiracy is most likely true</p>

<p>Not enough information known to make a good judgement</p>

<p>Probably false, but still not enough info</p>

<p>Definitely False</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what i personally  would love to see is a conspiracy-themed animated show with a good voice over., it would be nice to see something cover a different conspiracy theory each episodes (like jesse ventura) but divide itself into two distinct separate parts so as to allow different opinions. one cold-blooded scientific rational skepticism. the other more of a open minded spiritual tin-foil hatter. all left/right brainy themes as not to discredit either. above all provide as much information as possible for both sides and let the viewer decide for himself, avoid being biased towards a certain opinion, cover both sides of the arguments. wile being as thorough and entertaining as possible.</p>

<p>animation is an intensely powerful medium for something like this
check out &quot;Reagan&quot; by killer mike for a good example.  youtube.com/watch?v=6lIqNjC1RKU</p>

<p>i&#39;m working on a conspiracy related animated project if your interested.... or if you need an animator  ;) youtube.com/watch?v=qXvNAS6nSiU </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think teaching people that Vietnam was started entirely for zero reason, literally a &quot;mistake&quot; would not only surprise people, but be pretty fun to watch too. You have the whole hippie movement to work with, also MK Ultra. Yeah, do a 60s themed show. That&#39;s been out of the collective unconscious for a while, the hivemind loves novelty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Gulf of Tonkin.... &quot;eager, inexperienced radar kids&quot; accidentally thought they had been torpedoed.... but they were wrong. oops. sorry about that. The DoD was itching to fight the war, all they needed was this &quot;accidental&quot; sighting of torpedoes and the rest is history. War is profitable. The Spanish-American war was an accident too. As was Iraq and it&#39;s WMD. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Television is a far reaching medium. That is undeniable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are under the impression that the television is a medium where people can freely express themselves, which is not reality. The only thing people see on tv is what the corporations who own tv want them to see. If your show was picked up by a channel, it would end up being a joke like everything else on tv.</p>
