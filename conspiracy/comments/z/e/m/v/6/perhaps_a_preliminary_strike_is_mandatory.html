       It only took me 7 minutes to backtrack your ip address to the Chicago FBI field office.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on the subnet internal ip, I have determined the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       You are agent Jim dormandy - agent for two years and assigned to the cyber crimes task force.  After a stint in the army you joined the FBI and you now have the terrible job of managing fake social media accounts to ensnare true patriots in fabricated plots. It is entrapment and it is disgraceful.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the future, I recommend you at least have the sense to use a proxy. This is middle school level covering of your tracks!
      </p>
      <p>
       In short - nice try FBI.  Better luck next time.

       I don't think he's is an FBI agent. Look at

        this
       </a>
       . It is possible though that he could be working as an informant. He has said some pretty interesting

        things
       </a>
       . But after looking at all of his
       <a href="https://pay.reddit.com/user/hellscrusifixxxx">
        history
       </a>
       I'd say it seems unlikely.

       He is a Pro!  Do you think the NYPD who infiltrated the Occupy groups and "sold" them illegal devices didn't have a backstory?  Do you think the FBI agents that sold those fuckers explosive devices didn't prattle on about how the US is shit?

       Yeah, it is possible that he is but you can't trace IPs off here either. If you can tell me my IP address I'll believe you. It's an anonymous proxy so no worries about posting it.

       If he were an FBI agent you'd think he would type like an FBI field agent instead of a teenager or young adult with bad grammar. He's an idiot for suggesting that we kill members of the government and corporations, and you're an idiot for suggesting he's an "NWO FBI shill".

       Yes, because that's how undercover works.  Do you really think that fed agents trying to ensnare patriots on social media sites "talk like FBI?"  I'm sure you think that when they are trying to infiltrate terror cells they wear FBI windbreakers too.  Wake up and smell the roses!  The point is for good people NOT to know we have traitorous NWO operatives among us!!!!

       I'm a bit of an amateur typing analyst (I haven't heard a better term for it yet) and to me it seems as if he is legitimately a young adult, possibly around 16-19 years old, rather than an FBI agent posing as one.

        Preventive war
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        A preventive war or preventative war is a war initiated to prevent another party from attacking, when an attack by that party is not imminent or known to be planned. Preventive war aims to forestall a shift in the balance of power[1] by strategically attacking before the balance of power has a chance to shift in the direction of the adversary. Preventive war is distinct from preemptive war, which is first strike when an attack is imminent.[1] Preventive war undertaken without the approval of the United Nations is illegal under the modern framework of international law,[2] though Robert Delahunty and John Yoo from the George W. Bush administration maintained in their discussion of the Bush Doctrine that these standards are unrealistic.

       <strong>
        Preemptive war
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        A preemptive war is a war that is commenced in an attempt to repel or defeat a perceived offensive or invasion, or to gain a strategic advantage in an impending (allegedly unavoidable) war before that threat materializes. It is a war which preemptively 'breaks the peace'. The term: 'preemptive war' is sometimes confused with the term: 'preventive war'. The difference is that a preventive war is launched to destroy the potential threat of an enemy, when an attack by that party is not imminent or known to be planned, while a preemptive war is launched in anticipation of immediate enemy aggression.[1] Most contemporary scholarship equates preventive war with aggression, and therefore argues that it is illegitimate.[2] The waging of a preemptive war has less stigma attached than does the waging of a preventive war.[3] The initiation of armed conflict: that is being the first to 'break the peace' when no 'armed attack' has yet occurred, is not permitted by the UN Charter (see 'Legality' below), unless authorized by the UN Security Council as an enforcement action. (Some authors have claimed that when a presumed adversary first appears to be beginning confirmable preparations for a possible future attack, but has not yet actually attacked, that the attack has in fact 'already begun', however this opinion has not been upheld by the UN.

       I don't think he's is an FBI agent. Look at

       . It is possible though that he could be working as an informant. He has said some pretty interesting

       I'd say it seems unlikely.
