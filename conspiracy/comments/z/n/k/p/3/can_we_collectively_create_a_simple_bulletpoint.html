       This isn't a list containing long explanations or sources. Just simple facts to get people going "WTF". Then we can reach out to whoever respond/reacts with more info.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Again, I just want short, quick points to share with people tomorrow. If people ask for sources, I will deliver them. People tend not to pay attention to long, wordy opinions. Also, NOT providing sources will cause people to maybe Google for themselves. Which is ideally what I'd want them to do: FIND OUT FOR THEMSELVES.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT#2: A lot of my sources are from the ones you've posted below. Some of them come from here:

      <ul>
       <li>
        Osama bin Laden was NEVER officially a "wanted" criminal for the 9/11 attacks.
       </li>
       <li>
        7 of the 19 hijackers were found alive post 9/11. They were never on the planes.
       </li>
       <li>
        A passport of one of the hijackers was found in near-perfect condition in the rubble of the twin towers. That hijacker was then found alive in the middle east, surprised to hear his passport was found.
       </li>
       <li>
        Both WTC buildings and WTC 7 collapsed in a "free fall" which coincides to destruction from controlled demolition.
       </li>
       <li>
        In 1975, an extremely hot fire at the World Trade Center burned for 3 hours over 9 floors. "It was like fighting a flame thrower" said one fire fighter. Fire was at or exceeded the temperature of the fire on 9/11. No floor collapse.
       </li>
       <li>
        Active Thermitic material (used to cut through metal) was discovered in dust from the World Trade Center collapse. 9 physicists published their findings in a peer-reviewed Physics Journal.
       </li>
       <li>
        118 on-site firefighters gave testimony to hearing or seeing multiple explosions before each tower collapsed.
       </li>
       <li>
        1,500 architectural and engineering professionals have called for an independent investigation into the collapse of the World Trade Center towers.
       </li>
       <li>
        WTC 7 was hit on the south side from burning debris from WTC 2. However, a large fire soon erupted on the north side of WTC 7, on floors 12 and 13... the 2 floors which housed offices of the SEC and thousands of documents investigating Wall Street companies such as Enron.
       </li>
       <li>
        In 1997, the PNAC - Project for the New American Century (headed by Dick Cheney among others) said that convincing American citizens to support their policies would be difficult unless "some catastrophic catalyzing event â€“ like a new Pearl Harbor" occurred.
       </li>
       <li>
        On Sept 10, 2001 $2.3trillion is reported to be "missing" from Pentagon accounts. The next day, Sept 11, the Pentagon accounting office gets struck, all records are lost.
       </li>
       <li>
        Rabbi Dov Zakheim, Pentagon Comptroller responsible for the missing $2.3 trillion, dual US/Israeli citizen, PNAC document signer, former CEO of SPC, manufacturer of aircraft fly-by-wire systems
       </li>
       <li>
        It took 411 days before the government's official investigation began. And they appointed Henry Kissinger to head the investigation. A man with direct ties to the Bin Laden family.
       </li>
       <li>
        The Bush Administration had received 20 warnings of an imminent attack from 14 foreign intelligence agencies and did nothing.
       </li>
       <li>
        Flight 77, which reportedly hit the Pentagon, flew off course back towards Washington D.C. for 40 minutes without being detected by the FAA's radar or the even superior radar possessed by the US military.
       </li>
       <li>
        Not a single person has been fired, penalized, or reprimanded for incompetence, misjudgement, or failure to respond on 9/11.
       </li>
       <li>
        Sibel Edmonds, a former FBI translator who claims to have knowledge of advance warnings, was publicly silenced with a gag order requested by Attorney General John Ashcroft and granted by a Bush-appointed judge
       </li>
       <li>
        George W. Bush's brother Marvin sat on the board of the Kuwaiti-owned company which provided electronic security to the World Trade Center, Dulles Airport and United Airlines.
       </li>
       <li>
        Live BBC News coverage reported WTC 7 had collapsed... 23 minutes before it actually happened.
       </li>
       <li>
        Michael Springman, State Department veteran of the visa bureau, has testified that the CIA ran his office and issued visas to Al Qaeda members so they could receive training in the United States.
       </li>
       <li>
        Boston tech company Ptech, founded by a Saudi financier, was placed on Americaâ€™s Terrorist List in October 2001. The 2 years leading up to 9/11, Ptech had access to the FAAâ€™s entire computer system.
       </li>
       <li>
        The military protocol for shooting down hijacked aircraft was altered on June 1, 2001, taking discretion away from field commanders and placing it solely in the hands of the Secretary of Defense. After 9/11, this protocol changed back to its previous status.
       </li>
       <li>
        Attorney General John Ashcroft stopped flying on commercial airplanes in July 2001.
       </li>
       <li>
        Hani Hanjour, the supposed pilot of Flight 77, could not fly a small Cessna plane in August, but in September managed to fly a 757 at excessive speed into a spiraling, 270-degree descent and a level impact of the first floor of the Pentagon
       </li>
       <li>
        Able Danger, a classified military planning effort led by the U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), identified 2 of the 9/11 cells, including ringleader Mohammed Atta. One office tried to warn the FBI of the terror cells in 2000, but the meeting was blocked by the Department of Defense.

       You almost have to thank them for that. We know that if there were sinister parties involved on our side, those people would not have been touched. They would have had to fire a bunch of scapegoats, effectively sending however many people they wanted away from their jobs believing that they played and integral part in all of those deaths that occured on 9/11. It would be a merciful flaw in the cover up, I'd say.

       The only way this list will be worth anything to anyone is if you cite every bullet point. Not arguing with the info, just saying that it would be much better if you had a source right next to it.

       Agreed. Especially for the skeptical crowd, proper sourcing is a must; it's really just good practice IMO. Too many 'tidbits' of fractured truths are passed around, further muddling the murky waters of information.

       Reading through YouTube comments is really annoying though &gt;_&gt; one of the 'top' comments:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Toï»¿ not question the government after this coincidence means you are a weak pussy that refuses to even accept that there is a possibility that you been lied to your entire life go head and live your life as a sheep.
       </p>

       Not sure if this assertion is correct: "Thousands of scientists and physicists have done discovered the existence of demolition materials in the rubble of the world trade centers."
      </p>
      <p>
       More questions:
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did the head of the CIA, and other high level US officials, have breakfast meetings on 9/11 with the guy who allegedly paid the hijackers?

       I would say that it's helpful to put source links for any assertions. Ideally the source is a mainstream news outlet as folks will be more likely to trust the info (although some stuff is ignored by the mainstream so there's no way to do that).

       ABLE DANGER - a DIA data mining operation from 1999 - 2001 which identified 2 of the 9/11 cells, including ringleader Mohammed Atta. One office tried to warn the FBI of the terror cells in 2000, but the meeting was blocked by DoD officials. After numerous whistleblowers came out in 2005, the DoD smeared those individuals and revoked their security clearances. Over 1 TB of data was destroyed by the DoD, files sent to the 9/11 Commission were "lost" and other documents kept by the whistleblowers went "missing."

        Officer Says Military Blocked Sharing of Files on Terrorists

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        WASHINGTON, Aug. 16 - A military intelligence team repeatedly contacted the F.B.I. in 2000 to warn about the existence of an American-based terrorist cell that included the ringleader of the Sept. 11 attacks, according to a veteran Army intelligence officer who said he had now decided to risk his career by discussing the information publicly.
The officer, Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer, said military lawyers later blocked the team from sharing any of its information with the bureau.

       I'm not a fan of Tarpley, since I think he's an official honeypot, but some of the accurate info mixed into his book includes details about Able Danger &amp; Able Warrior, the sister operation to Able Danger which never gets mentioned.  Tarpley's conclusion is that Able Danger &amp; Able Warrior were, in fact, the actual operation to shield the 9/11 patsies.

       make sure to mention the "remember the maine" incident that it cites, as it was a catalyst for the spanish american war. Not that we needed a catalyst for that one. It's very dubious that it was mentioned in northwoods, as the remember the maine, to hell with spain, as it was, was a conspiracy itself. Page 11 of 15, section 3. A. I quote,

       A "remember the maine" incident could be arranged in several ways

       Also, these tactics have been in use for thousands of years, ever since sun tzu's art of war. It's kind of funny that they unclassified this conspiracy that never went through, which proves that a previous suspicion of a conspiracy was true. This alone in northwoods is worth gold. The fact that history repeats itself and the use of sun tzu's art of war is no mere coincidence either.

        BBC reports WTC 7 fell 23 minutes too soon
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        BBC reporting on the collapse of WTC Building 7 over twenty minutes before it fell at 5:20pm in the afternoon of 9/11. The incredible footage shows BBC reporter Jane Standley talking about the collapse of the Salomon Brothers Building while it remains standing in the live shot behind her head. How did the BBC know that it was going to collapse? And why did they report the collapse when it is clearly standing in the background?

       I have nothing to add except, please make the list correct. (Just facts, no speculations.)

       Make it appealing to the greater mass and make it easy to read. Easy so even a child would understand. Add color and time-frames in a pedagogical way. This list can go viral if it is presented in the right way. Think like the company to outsmart the company.

       Exactly, and then post it everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Done right, people will share it and it will spread on it's own. And then, maybe, if enough people knows of this list (it becomes common knowledge) then it must be true. And if it must be true then there must be consequences. But first, the list must change the common view of 9/11, it must change to a situation that people feel dumb for believing it was an Al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden planned attack. When a former "fact" is made as "old news" or a "trick for kids lie" then people has a tendency to step back from that statement and look for what others think to fit in. To not be called an idiot. This phenomenon is called "a movement".
      </p>
      <p>
       All of us who seeks the truth in things must represent the truth as for what it is for those who doesn't seek it or even denies it. Mass-media made the lies "cool" and this is what we all should do. As I wrote before, we must think like the company in any aspect. Who are your friends, what do you work with, who do you know, what are you good at? Think of all this things and implement the truth in everything, if you live the truth, speak the truth and believe the truth, people will listen. 
All big speakers had one thing in common whatever agenda, they all spoke about their business as they really believed it, like it was the core of everything. They could talk about anything and people believed it, they spoke with such passion and authority that everyone knew that this is it, this is real.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm rambling, I'm sorry. But I believe that there are a lot of intelligent people out there who knows a lot of stuff but just not know how to share it in a way that the common man would listen to. We all need to speak about things like this like it was show business. Present the truth like it's the greatest show in the world.
Amuse people, make them feel dumb for not laughing at the lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's all i have to say about that.

       I'm going to casually debunk these. I will note where I cannot. Here we go. My debunkings have ** before them.

       <em>
        Osama bin Laden was NEVER officially a "wanted" criminal for the 9/11 attacks. *
       </em>
       He wasn't on the most wanted list. Big deal. Why would the FBI leave a clue to his supposed innocence by not bothering to put him on the list? This theory posits that the government was competent enough to carry out the attacks but dumb enough not to publicly charge him. Simpler explanation: They didn't put him on the list because his guilt was taken as a given.
       <em>
        7 of the 19 hijackers were found alive post 9/11. They were never on the planes.
       </em>
       * People with the same names were found alive, leading to confusion. That's all. Where is the evidence that they weren't on the planes? They were seen at airport gates. Unsupported claim.
       <em>
        A passport of one of the hijackers was found in near-perfect condition in the rubble of the twin towers. That hijacker was then found alive in the middle east, surprised to hear his passport was found.
       </em>
       <em>
        A passport was discovered on the ground. It survived the fires. Big deal. Lots of items did, and it was found because it was an intact item among the debris. The person in the middle east had the same name. Big deal.
*Active Thermitic material (used to cut through metal) was discovered in dust from the World Trade Center collapse. 9 physicists published their findings in a peer-reviewed Physics Journal.
       </em>
       <em>
        Nope. The Thermite material that Truther physicists refer to is iron and other debris from the buildings. No peer review study was ever done by any reputable journal. Sorry, no and no.
*1,500 architectural and engineering professionals have called for an independent investigation into the collapse of the World Trade Center towers.
       </em>
       <em>
        So? There have to be at least 1,500 people calling for an investigation into vampires. Both groups are wrong.
*On Sept 10, 2001 $2.3trillion is reported to be "missing" from Pentagon accounts. The next day, Sept 11, the Pentagon accounting office gets struck, all records are lost.
       </em>
       <em>
        Nope. The records were NOT all destroyed. Do you think the Pentagon would keep all their records in one building, let alone one database? You're right that the Pentagon "lost" a ton of money. This means it was stolen, wasted, spent on crony contractors and black ops. No link to 911 here, move along...
*It took 411 days before the government's official investigation began. And they appointed Henry Kissinger to head the investigation. A man with direct ties to the Bin Laden family.
       </em>
       <em>
        Again, you're arguing that they were smart enough to orchestrate the attacks but dumb enough not to cover it up from people with internet access. 411 days for a government investigation? Sounds about right. And Kissinger has ties to everyone. He's a war criminal. He's powerful. No conspiracy here.
*The Bush Administration had received 20 warnings of an imminent attack from 14 foreign intelligence agencies and did nothing.
       </em>
       <em>
        Yes, they did receive warnings. They did not conspire to ignore them. They simply did. Because they were corrupt and incompetent. No mystery here.
*Flight 77, which reportedly hit the Pentagon, flew off course back towards Washington D.C. for 40 minutes without being detected by the FAA's radar or the even superior radar possessed by the US military.
Not a single person has been fired, penalized, or reprimanded for incompetence, misjudgement, or failure to respond on 9/11.
       </em>
       <em>
        So you're positive nobody you maybe haven't heard of lost their jobs? Dubious claim at best. As for Flight's 77 uninterrupted flight...so? The common Truther idea that it should have been intercepted immediately is simply not reality. Sorry, planes go off course. All. The. Time.
*Sibel Edmonds, a former FBI translator who claims to have knowledge of advance warnings, was publicly silenced with a gag order requested by Attorney General John Ashcroft and granted by a Bush-appointed judge
       </em>
       <em>
        Has anything she's claimed been confirmed by anyone? So she was gagged. She knew classified material. Advanced warnings? How general were they? Anyone confirm this? Or maybe she was a former government employee who proved politically inconvenient? Happens all the time. She's hot, though.
*George W. Bush's brother Marvin sat on the board of the Kuwaiti-owned company which provided electronic security to the World Trade Center, Dulles Airport and United Airlines.
       </em>
       <em>
        Wait, so you're implying that W. called up his own brother had told him to F up the security because the Bush administration was gonna attack the buildings he provided security for? That's. Insane.
*Live BBC News coverage reported WTC 7 had collapsed... 23 minutes before it actually happened.
       </em>
       <em>
        There is no way of knowing the circumstances around the broadcast, including when it was recorded and what erroneous information they were working on. They were wrong. Big deal. 
*Michael Springman, State Department veteran of the visa bureau, has testified that the CIA ran his office and issued visas to Al Qaeda members so they could receive training in the United States.
       </em>
       <em>
        So? Al Qaeda were intelligence assets from way back in the 70s. Our government tends to train and fund their assets.
*In 1997, the Project for the New American Century (headed by Dick Cheney among others) said that convincing American citizens to support their policies would be difficult unless "some catastrophic catalyzing event â€“ like a new Pearl Harbor" occurred.
       </em>
       <em>
        Sigh. PNAC wanted a new Star Wars system and all kinds of crazy shit that they never even tried to get after the attacks. Are you suggesting they carried out the attacks and then failed to capitalize on them to advance their stated goals? Read PNAC. Nothing they called for was implemented. Nothing.
*Boston tech company Ptech, founded by a Saudi financier, was placed on Americaâ€™s Terrorist List in October 2001. The 2 years leading up to 9/11, Ptech had access to the FAAâ€™s entire computer system.
       </em>
       <em>
        Confirm this. Please. That's ridiculous.
*The military protocol for shooting down hijacked aircraft was altered on June 1, 2001, taking discretion away from field commanders and placing it solely in the hands of the Secretary of Defense. After 9/11, this protocol changed back to its previous status.
       </em>
       <em>
        So the protocol was changed, the new protocol failed horrible and then was quickly reversed? Thank goodness.
*Attorney General John Ashcroft stopped flying on commercial airplanes in July 2001.
       </em>
       <em>
        So what? He started flying private. So. What?
*Hani Hanjour, the supposed pilot of Flight 77, could not fly a small Cessna plane in August, but in September managed to fly a 767 at excessive speed into a spiraling, 270-degree descent and a level impact of the first floor of the Pentagon
       </em>
       *Yes. Yes he certainly did.

       Here's a suggestion.  Instead of a list, make a diagram showing all the connections between the various elements.
      </p>
      <p>
       Show how the interests of like five different groups all managed to converge on 9/11 to produce the terror attack that they had literally put on paper, wishing it would happen, and how each of them profited directly from it.

       Call it something like "web of betrayal".

       Wait, so all 19 hijackers on the official list were indeed involved in hijacking the places that day? First I've heard of that. The passport of a dude half way around the world found in pristine condition in the rubble has an explanation? Thousands of scientists finding thermite in the rubble never happened?

       EDIT: Downvotes are fine. But I'd like someone to tell me how the 3 points I mentioned are "explainable". Because I've never heard a single good explanation.

       Are you willing to entertain a "good" explanation, or will you simply dismiss it out of hand?    Because I suspect the latter, and I won't waste my time if you're not willing to have a moderately open mind.

       Saying "every bullet point has been debunked" is an empty statement. You'll sound more convincing if you at least provide some material to back it up.

       The second bullet point, the "magic passport", for example: please explain how that was found intact.

       How exactly is this explainable?
      </p>
      <p>
       I could see a case of mistaken identity once, maybe twice. There are something like five confirmed "hijackers" alive today though!
      </p>
      <p>
       And how to explain the Pentagon? I was in Crystal City VA on 9/11 virtually overlooking the entire Pentagon complex and there simply
       <em>
        was no airplane
       </em>
       . Granted I did not see the (missile?) hit but I saw the aftermath less than 10 minutes later. Unless the body, wings, tail, and engines mysteriously liquefied or something I'm pretty sure of what I did
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       see.

       I can't imagine a worse fate for someone than having no soul, no hope and only hate and anger in their heart and their future. I prayed to Jesus for you and I hope God can heal your brokenness. If it's any consolation I think I know a little of what you feel, but I refuse to turn away from my faith.

       If you believe only maggots await you after death it's very hard to reconcile this life. This world is not the end. We have a soul that does carry on. And that is the hope that can save you from destruction. God bless you
