<p>Reminds me of all of those commercials I used to see on TV, back when I had TV. </p>

<p>Month 1: Videos of happy, carefree, white people, joyfully experience life in meadow with butterflies and such, while the narrator tells you about the new pharmaceutical for social anxiety disorder (we&#39;ll call this &quot;happypill&quot;), with a fineprint disclaimer at the bottom that no one can read telling all of the horrific side effects which include: nausea, abdominal cramping, blah blah blah, and possible death.</p>

<p>Month 2: Ambulance-chasing lawfirm advertisement recruiting people for a class action lawsuit against said pharmaceutical company specifically pertaining to deaths resulting from &quot;happypill&quot;.</p>

<p>The Psychiatric profession, in concert with Big Pharma, has been one of the most barbaric institutions when it comes to experimentation on human subjects. They still use electroshock therapy... on children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This title and most of the laymen interpretation on these studies are invalid.</p>

<p>The study about lowering IQ is actually helpful in demonstrating the need for legalization. If I remember correctly, it said that upon persistent use, IQ decrease is seen in users who started before adulthood. However such a change is not seen in those who start 18+. So if there was legalization, it would become harder for minors to get it, or at least as hard it is to get alcohol as a minor. Which IMO is better than having dealers who you go to school with. </p>

<p>Even the testicular cancer issue is misleading:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2012/09/10/marijuana-use-may-raise-risk-of-testicular-cancer/">Men who reported long-term usage of marijuana did not face greater risk, she said. The findings suggest &quot;early experimental use,&quot; which would be short-term, may trigger increased cancer risk.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are mistaken there.  A person who legally purchases alcohol is far less likely to commit a crime by selling/providing alcohol to a minor.  A person who is already committing a crime by possessing marijuana is more likely to provide it to another person without any qualms over legality.</p>

<p>Even when you get into legal medical marijuana...The punishment for providing medical marijuana to a non patient is bad enough.  A patient getting caught selling to a non patient minor would get the book thrown at them by the DA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>specifically, cannabinoids were shown to trigger an extrinsic (receptor tyrosine kinase/RTK)-mediated apoptosis pathway in cancer cells, as well as intrinsic apoptosis pathways (so-called &quot;cross-talk&quot;, as well as normal cell membrane traversal - highly lipophilic compound):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15978942">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15978942</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.cellsignal.com/reference/pathway/Apoptosis_Mitochondrial.html">http://www.cellsignal.com/reference/pathway/Apoptosis_Mitochondrial.html</a> &lt;-- known apoptosis pathways here, specifically, the translocation of Bcl-2 associated death promoter (&quot;Bad&quot;) to the mitochondria,  as well as the FADD-&gt;caspase-8-&gt;BH3 interacting-domain death agonist (&quot;Bid&quot;) pathway, terminate in a caspase cascade, which destroys the surrounding cell, allowing lysis to begin (breakdown of the cell into its components, which are then, in so many words, selectively processed and removed from the body).  </p>

<p>that site is great for explaining the actual pathways (chains of reactions) culminating in cell death - but, for those unwilling to sit through that, it&#39;s enough to say that cannabinoids selectively provoke cell death in cancer cells, and that our cells naturally have ways to relatively non-disruptively kill themselves, but generally require some kind of moderating influence, such as NK, TNF-alpha (cachexin), Apo3L or Fas ligand reception (which also induce extrinsic pathways of apoptosis, but, at least generally, insufficiently to effectively upregulate apoptosis of malignant cells).   the clinical use of d9-THC and other cannabinoids is to selectively augment this process by reacting with compounds specifically expressed by cancer cells to create chemicals that promote that &#39;cell suicide&#39; process.</p>

<p>all i can compare it to is vitamin C curing scurvy.  it&#39;s a matter of established knowledge that pathways exist,  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid#Cannabinoid_receptors">in the nervous system, immune system, and elsewhere</a> (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid_receptor_type_1#Expression">type 1</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid_receptor_type_2#Expression">type 2</a>), specifically to accommodate cannabinoids, and now the evidence is piling up that they&#39;re natural anticarcinogens, on top of all the well established antioxidant, vasodilatory, appetite-restoring, non-polar compound solvency (remember, cannabinoids are terpenophenolic compounds - as chemicals, they have the interesting property of being close to biologically inert - in the grand scheme of all chemical compounds, at least - while also sharing solvency with nasty &#39;tar&#39;-like chemicals), etc., effects (the same reason that they last in tissue, especially adipose tissue, longer than many other drugs).   </p>

<p>all of that strongly suggests that this plant is supposed to be a component of our <em>diet</em> - this sort of plurality of induction of regulatory functions is usually typical of major nutrients/vitamins, except that instead of regulating functions such as nerve signalling, anemia, immunodeficiency, or clotting, as in the case of other major dietary compounds, cannabinoids regulate, for one, cancer growth.  </p>

<p>its criminalization is like criminalizing willow trees, despite that they contain salicyclic acid (precrsr. aspirin), under the rationale that people could damage their lungs from smoking them. and pulmonary dysfunction doesn&#39;t even seem to be a significant side effect of  most cannabis use - some studies suggest the opposite (increased FEV and FVC).  so you basically have a virtually non-existent side effect profile, even with <em>smoked</em> administration of the drug, and everything from antioxidant to antitumorigenic/anticarcinogenic effects, indicating it as a top-tier treatment of cancer - plus, a good source of fiber, fatty acids, etc., when ingested as food, seeds and all. </p>

<p>bad government...bad research...bad pharmaceutical companies...bad dogma, in general.  leaves me with a nasty feeling every time i think about it - like somebody&#39;s poisoned a well and is gouging the price on the cure.</p>

<p>it&#39;s smart not to let politicians dictate anything about medical care to people.  at all.</p>

Fact is, the &#39;Marijuana Revolution&#39; is in full force. Attorneys General are having a hard time getting juries to convict marijuana cases all over the USA, too.

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is not cannabis itself, but how it promotes users to <strong>&quot;break-free&quot; from their social conditioning</strong> (a.k.a capitalist consumerism).</p>

<p>Other drugs, specially stimulants (caffeine) are highly regarded as they stimulate working-consuming social patterns.</p>

<p>The basis of our modern economy is based solely on consumption, where we <strong>middle-class are merely consumerist slaves</strong>, having no means of self-sustenance are forced to consume in order to live. </p>

<p><strong>Marketing and pharmaco-psychology</strong> (so closely related) enforce these mental patterns: 24/7 ads (&quot;They Live&quot;), and through &quot;treatment of anti-social mental disorders&quot; (DSM).</p>

<p>If people suddenly stopped consuming entirely, the system would collapse (2008 economic meltdown). Alcohol is &quot;tolerated&quot;, as its consumptions actually impedes <strong>deeper intrinsic analytical thinking</strong>, unlike cannabis, LSD, and other psycho-active drugs, while still promoting a sense of well-being and compliance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One could debate the short/longterm effects of smoking weed forever and ever, but as a long time user of pot, 15+ years, my personal observation is that i have NEVER waked up in the morning after a night of smoking weed wondering &quot;what the hell happend last night&quot; with a girl i dont remember beside me in bed, or with a black eye and bloody knuckles, with my car parked firmly inside a drugstore via the shoppingwindow (all true stories) </p>

<p>Putting the medical aspect aside for a minute, This kind of shit only happens when using alcohol, show me one case where someone has fucked up like this while smoking weed and only weed!! </p>

<p>Now the medical aspect weed contra alcohol/tobacco! I mean come on, there arent even a debate here, to debate something both sides need to have real evidence to back up there point, today there are no evidence that shows weed being more or even equally damaging to your body or mind as alcohol or tobacco, so stating weed should remain illegal while letting people continue dying everyday because of alcohol and tobacco is just straight up retarded!! </p>

<p>Im not stating that smoking pot is totally harmless. But as with everything you do in life, beeing food, sex or drugs: you can USE or ABUSE. Thats up to you!! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even by your exaggerated description I can find reason enough to at least wonder if small amounts of fluoride might have an effect on my kids&#39; cognitive development. What reason do I have to assume otherwise? No proof of harm is not the same as proof of no harm.</p>

<p>&quot;We saw a pattern of dose response that we didn&#39;t expect,&quot; Cortessis said. Men who reported long-term usage of marijuana did not face greater risk, she said. The findings suggest &quot;early experimental use,&quot; which would be short-term, may trigger increased cancer risk.</p>

<p>the most logical finding would be THEY AREN&#39;T FUCKING LINKED YOU FUCKING IDIOT. MORE CARCINOGEN = MORE CANCER is pretty much how it works. Not, well they smoked pot once and now they got cancer.... thats probably what happened... the pot gave them cancer... i give up... people are fucking insanely stupid. good luck to you all... every man for himself. the idiots/zombies have run amuck. it shouldn&#39;t be long now before they tear us to shreds. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The study was supported by grants from the National Cancer Institute</p>

<p>The former National Cancer Institute Director Samuel Broder said: “The NCI has become what amounts to a government pharmaceutical company.” And, as detailed in a Los Angeles Times article, Dr. Thomas J. Walsh, a former senior researcher at the National Cancer Institute, accepted fees from Pfizer and Merck, while leading clinical trials investigating Big Pharma drugs. Who is to say that this no longer happens?</p>

<p>Now according to the federal government, millions of people smoke marijuana regularly. By contrast, diagnoses of nonseminoma, which typically affects males between the ages of 15 and 34, are extremely rare.</p>

<p>How rare?</p>

<p>Nonseminomas account for fewer than one half of one percent of all cancers among American men.</p>

<p>Further undermining the study’s hypothesis is this: Since the 1970s, the percentage of American males smoking pot has climbed dramatically. By contrast, incidences of nonseminoma have risen only nominally during this same time period.</p>

<p>Of course, this is hardly the first time the mainstream media has jumped ugly on cannabis. Around this same time last year, news outlets from Reuters to Fox News declared that marijuana posed a greater cancer risk than cigarettes. Only problem was that the study they were reporting on actually demonstrated the opposite.  </p>

And let me ask you this...just because it (could) be argued that it might be a dumb decision to use marijuana to some level, does that then mean it&#39;s a criminal thing to use it?  The idea that studies show there&#39;s adverse health risks to it&#39;s use does not at all support making it, or keeping it criminal to use.  Otherwise the same could be said of a host of other quite legal products we use every day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, if you want to smoke pot... then smoke pot.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no need to be concerned with whatever position the government takes on the matter. People have a long history of ingesting whatever the hell they want to <em>regardless</em> of whether or not those items have been deemed &#39;officially safe&#39; by &#39;official sources&#39;.</p>

<p>If the concern arises from fear of repercussions due to the <em>legal system</em>... then, an understanding of one&#39;s <em>actual lawful inherent rights/jurisdiction of the private individual</em> vs. a <em>persons legal &#39;rights&#39;/&#39;obligations&#39; within government jurisdiction of the public</em> will remove any fear of potential ramifications that may stem from &quot;getting caught.&quot;</p>

<p>What the government doesn&#39;t want you to know regarding these matters is that people <em>already</em> have the right to do pretty much whatever they want (short of harming another or their property). They have simply obscured and <em>hidden</em> that right underneath an entirely fictitious system called the <em>&#39;legal system&#39;</em>... a system whose sole authority comes down to one thing: documents.</p>

<p>Are you a document? No? Then don&#39;t adopt the <em>role</em> of one.</p>

<p>I have never read a larger amount of bullshit than this in my entire life. I&#39;m coming up on 4 years of smoking, not constantly either, for about 2 years it was constant but after that it just became regular use with a few breaks for a month here and there. I know exactly what the blitzed out look looks like, because I&#39;ve seen it and felt it many times. I don&#39;t care if you&#39;ve been smoking for 10 years, you will NOT act (unless on purpose) or look like you&#39;re blitzed even if you&#39;re not high, maybe if you smoke a lot the following day or two will be kinda spacey but if you refrain from smoking for maybe 3 days you should be completely back to normal, I know it only takes me 2 days tops to return to 100% normal. And please don&#39;t patronize me and tell me I don&#39;t know what normal is or I just think I am normal but I&#39;m really not. I first smoked at 19 years old, I&#39;m a pretty professional person with average intelligence. Trust me, I know what normal is.</p>

<p>While what you say is true to a point, I have yet to find a single recorded death that was caused from marijuana use alone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even corn syrup causes problems. Artificial sweeteners cause problems. Food coloring causes problems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are comparing heavily processed chemical food ingredients to a natural plant.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Eggs cause problems. Meat causes problems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Organic free range/pastured eggs or meat free from hormones and antibiotics don&#39;t cause problems. If you are referring to them being higher in fat and thus causing obesity, heart disease or cholesterol the science behind that is very suspect.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cigarettes cause problems. Why on earth wouldn&#39;t marijuana cause problems?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because as it stands now marijuana does not contain the <a href="http://www.tricountycessation.org/tobaccofacts/Cigarette-Ingredients.html#list">599 approved additives and chemicals</a> many of which are carcinogens and many are there to make them more addictive.</p>

<p>You might notice a theme here: chemical additives, processed food and pollution are bad. Saying marijuana is completely safe is probably disingenuous. However comparing marijuana to everything above is absurdly disingenuous.</p>

<p>Pot is illegal for a good reason.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I used to be incredibly against marijuana. It was everywhere with friends, family and even people on the street openly smoking it. I hated it with a passion and wanted to find any evidence that it was harmful to your health and to society. The problem being that there is no evidence against it. The harder I looked the more I came up short. If you can show why it is illegal for &quot;good reason&quot; I&#39;m willing to listen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it helps with some vision problems</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It does a lot more than just help with &quot;some vision problems.&quot; For starters it helps with chronic pain conditions, glaucoma, arthritis, multiple sclerosis and many cancers. It helps with less serious problems like headaches, stress, insomnia and it has anti-inflammatory properties etc. That is just what is considered from the psychoactive portion. If you take the non psychoactive plant, hemp protein is a complete protein that is some of the easiest for your body to digest. For manufacturing the fibers are some of the strongest and most versatile in the world. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>it has been long known that pot can cause testicular cancer plus neural diseases</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So far this is false. Correlation does not imply causation. They have found a loose link in people with a family history, who are already strongly predisposed, having an increased risk of developing psychosis with psychoactive drug use. For otherwise healthy individuals the increase is .3%. Incidentally a healthy individuals chance for developing psychosis without marijuana is .3%.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In my country we are taught that from a very young age so we don&#39;t caught up in pseudo-science </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know what country you are from but it strongly sounds like they are spouting off the same propaganda that all other countries that are signatory to the UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. If you look deeper you will find what you have been taught is based on pseudo-science and politics.</p>

<p>What long term effects on the brain? If you mean short term memory loss then studies show mixed results. Some studies show it lasts for the duration of impairment at best. At worst some studies show short term memory loss has completely disappeared after 2-3 weeks. The answer is probably somewhere in the middle of that. Unless you mean the positive effects such as <a href="http://www.jci.org/articles/view/25509">anti-depressant properties and neurogenesis.</a></p>

<p>What? We&#39;re talking about marijuana here not meth. How on earth is something that is used to treat insomnia causing somebody to have a &quot;severe outburst beyond their control?&quot; This really highlights your lack of understanding about marijuana. </p>

<p>By this logic all junk/fast food and coffee should be made illegal. I won&#39;t even start on alcohol, tobacco and opiate derived pharmaceuticals.</p>

<p>I use facts and links to back them up and you dismiss them saying &quot;the best solution is abstinence.&quot; Tell me again how burning your books prevents you from finding evidence online? Go back to your cartoon porn because you are obviously an idiot or a troll. Personally I&#39;m going with the former. </p>
