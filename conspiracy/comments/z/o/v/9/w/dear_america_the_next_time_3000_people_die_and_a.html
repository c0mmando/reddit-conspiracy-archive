    <div class="md"><p>The thing of it is, this country still believes by and large that their media are here to inform them. What a lot of people don&#39;t know is that the media long ago became a for-profit entity, abandoning the notion of informing anyone. Gone are the days of Murrow and Cronkite. This trust in the media by the public is exploited heavily by the government, allowing all kinds of fun scares to reach the people: Ricin, various viruses, giant comets hurling towards earth, terrorism.. the list goes on, and so does the sham. A scared populace is easier to control.</p>

<p>Absolutely. We are trained through an orchestrated, yet individuated spectacle that operates subtly. Nevertheless, this subtle spectacle has enormous influence on awareness; in fact, for most people the spectacle IS the awareness. Getting to your point, it should be quite obvious to anyone paying attention that unnecessary fear, as promoted via the spectacle, is the prescription of the government which wants to give itself and its real constituents ever-more power. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll go so far as to say that any attempt at &quot;problem resolution&quot; and the marketing thereof by the US government is actually a fabian/round-about effort of maintaining and continuing to enthrone the status-quo Establishment and its various subsidiary economic-facets. Politicians and the pundits who promote their agendas may be so engrained into the mainstream political paradigm that they may not even realize their participation in the Establishment&#39;s matrix... </p>

<p>Speaking generally here, compartmentalization of the people, the ideas, and even the language we use encourages us to trust the spectacle, and even love the spectacle. We are so segmented in our thinking that we do not have the capacity to grasp more than a couple of contradictions at a time, and just when we receive a pinch of awareness, enter-tain-ment comes along and ensures our cognitive dissonance and confirmation biases will swaddle us back into our intellectual comfort zone. </p>

<p>It is a sham, indeed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well done there, and yes, as long as we don&#39;t get out of the 2-stage thinking process, we&#39;re exactly where we&#39;re supposed to be. Look at what dominates the airwaves: Scandal, shooting, celebrities doing all kinds of things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, and remember that the process of denial, and all the cognitive dissonance and confirmation bias that is at work here makes it very difficult for contrarian, albeit factual, information to actually make it into the person&#39;s mental frame of reference. People simply do not want to be disturbed, and would do anything to rid themselves of that creepy feeling of unknowing. So I think you&#39;re right, that although most people won&#39;t admit that they have been lied to about 9/11, it is important to continue to demonstrate the numerous examples of where they have been lied to and manipulated by the mainstream media--- hell, our entry into Iraq is probably the most glaring one that comes to mind, related to 9/11...</p>

<p>Also, as Alllie&#39;s 9/11 post yesterday kind of alluded to, it&#39;s not really necessary to KNOW exactly what happened on 9/11 to KNOW that the &quot;official story&quot; has glaring contradictions within it. This whole attempt at showing someone a more holistic view of what is going on is kindof like attempting to reveal a picture to someone, one pixel at a time. So they may admit that, yes, more investigation needs to be conducted about X,Y, and Z of 9/11, but they may be completely oblivious to the hundreds(thousands?) of other examples where the mainstream spectacle has manipulated them... </p>

<p>It seems to me that if showing someone about an obvious government conspiracy (think Iran Contra, the mena connection, feds drug+gun running for example), and pairing that with known US govt documents (like operation northwoods or mockingbird), the subject may have more context, which would make it more likely for them to see that the official story of 9/11 is full of contradictions and suspect underpinnings. At this point, it would be great if most people could at least understand this context as to why we would question the &quot;official&quot; events, instead of just spitting out nonsensical ad hominem and straw-men arguments. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We will fall for it again. Because when one is afraid, angry, broke, stressed and fed up, an enemy is a welcome sight. An easy target to funnel all that pent up rage and frustration into. Quick way to unite us all, to make all feel courageous, useful, part of something greater. </p>

<p>The diminishing liberties, the mistakes, the collateral victims will be overlooked as long as there&#39;s a funny sitcom on TV, a beautiful actor couple in the news, porn on the net and something to blur it all at night. Because there&#39;s the enemy, hidden in the shadows, and all sacrifices can be justified.</p>

<p>Until, well, that black-bagged stranger happens to be a relative. Until we are the ones stopped at customs and mistaken for someone else. Until we get a visit from black-suited men asking about that donation to an overseas charity, about that silly tweet or post, about that protest we attended or that FOIA we submitted or that webcam chat were we said a few weird things.</p>

<p>Then we will be re-classified as part of the enemy.</p>
