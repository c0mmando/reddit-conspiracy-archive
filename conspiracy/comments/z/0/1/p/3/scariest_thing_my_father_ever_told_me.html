       I was raised in a small southern town, by parents with small southern town beliefs and principles. Religious, Conservative, Jeff Foxworthy type people. I was always a bit more open-minded, and when I went off into the world to attend a University, I learned. I'm not saying I was dumb or sheltered, I just flat out was asleep to what was actually, or could actually be going on. The very idea that everything (or at least a large portion of everything) we know is a lie.  Discovering the truths of 9/11, the Bilderbergs, and the reasons behind the financial crisis we are in, along with the possibilities of the Illuminati, HAARP, chemtrails and the like were eye-opening to say the least. When I first started learning about conspiracies, the Illuminati were the first thing I was CONVINCED were true. I have many doubts now, but that's another topic.  Upon returning home for a holiday, I was excited about everything I had learned. I sat down and decided to bore my dad to tears babbling about some stuff I thought I knew. After talking for what seemed like 45 minutes or more, I finished telling him my theories on the Illuminati, Free-Masonry, brainwashing media and I'm sure I rambled about satanism in music. He listened the whole time without interrupting.  I asked him what he thought, and he just leaned forward and looked at me and said, "I know".  And he was not fucking with me.

       I don't think you mean scary, but rather bizarre or sad. It's bizarre that others don't even care in the slightest about what is happening around us. Sure I can understand that a lot of it we're powerless to affect, but we should still be aware of it. It's like we're all in a zoo and we don't want to recognize that everything around us is fake.

       American society is rather brillaint in that way (at least as far as those in power are concerned). We are self reporting, self policing tattle tales.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy is still a very dirty word despite mountains of evidence that the US not only engages in conspiratorial acts on a regular basis, but doesn't even do a great job of covering it up half the time.

       I have read several books about the music industry circa 1969 and at that point in order to be even signed to a label you had to be in with the gays.  Not trying to be a bigot here, just stating facts.  I just read David Bowie's ex-wife's autobio and she talked about all of the famous people that were around and how they were either gay or had to suck dick to get signed.  People like Elton John, Jagger, Bowie, etc.  and that a good portion of them had done satanic rituals as well.  There is a notable story:

       Today's rap seems more government sponsored than the rap of 20 years ago.  In the 90's, rappers were rapping about oppression, today rappers are rapping about having millions, and pissing away those millions on self-indulgence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their audience identifies with this (sort of how lower-class identifies with rich Republicans).  They hear tales of rags to riches and believe if they continue to work their shitty jobs, maybe someday they'll catch a break and collect their millions as well.  Little do they know that our world is ran by family corporations.

       I'm from the south as well. Tennessee. Myself, and a couple of my friends have very open eyes and try to do what we can to show the people around us in our small towns what is actually going on, but are usually just brushed off. Just know that not everyone down south is in the dark. A good portion ONLY care about taxes, gay marriage, and abortion....but those are far from the only issues. We're here....we're just few and far between it seems.

       Holy shit, you mean that multiple in a populated area have had similar experiences? Well fuck me.

      <p>
       All kidding aside, it probably isn't that uncommon. No different than a kid that grows up listening to the same music as their parents and then one days decides to listen to something else entirely.

       When I was pretty new to all of this, I believed a lot of what I read without doing further research. For a while I bought into the satanic influences of music, hip-hop all the way back to the blues. Presently I have concluded that most of that is bogus, but music is very open to interpretation and VERY influential.  The hushed whispers of a rap Illuminati are enough to boost sales of records and merchandise that cash in on the dark themes.  But I highly doubt Jay-Z is part of some global satanic conspiracy to usher in the Antichrist.

       I grew up in a very religious household, and remember watching a religious TV show, where they were demonizing popular music. They played a bunch of different lyrics. Including Alice in Chains, and the line :
      </p>
      <p>
       "Jesus Christ, deny your maker."
      </p>
      <p>
       And used this as evidence of how satanic Alice in Chains was.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was older I heard the whole song. The next lyrics were :
      </p>
      <p>
       "He who tries, will be wasted"
      </p>
      <p>
       I knew right then, who the real deceivers and manipulators were.
I dont know if there is a god or not, but i do know one thing, the bible? Jesus? the Koran? The Torah? They're all fucking bullshit. The oldest, most profitable and least scrutinized conspiracy of all time is religion.

       The religious views of satanic messages in popular music are definitely ridiculous. All of that is just a business, but I've seen many "logical" arguments for it, regardless of the religious text.  The evils at work are often described as the devil or satanic, yet not necessarily the Judeo-Christian Lucifer.

       I'm not going to show you any logical arguments, because no matter how logical, they aren't true. They aren't factual, and I realized this a little while after reading them. They are logical and appealing, but I'm pretty sure you can google and read for yourself.

Only you do and youre projecting your beliefs, yeah they do use a whole lot of mediums to achieve a lot of heinous things, one of the ways the elites control you is through RELIGION, its been their primary control method for a long damn time.

       dude, are you completely retarded? I never said it was fact, I was pointing out what it says in the bible because it relates to the satanic influence in music conspiracy. I wasn't trying to point out facts I was giving you the biblical context because you said "WTF are you talking about?" to lucifer commanding heaven's choir. Please tell me you do, no-one is really this retarded.

       Conspiracy does not exist without secrecy. What good has come from it, I don't know, but it seems pretty obvious that secret societies have shaped many things throughout history. If nothing else, they boost members of their groups to positions of authority and power just by membership in their secret clubs. If you can not truly realize this, you are simply ignorant of what is in plain site, or you are a shill.

       There are no masonic secrets, they do have private meetings. That's not really the same as secret. What good comes of it? Nothing intrinsically good come from secrecy but then again nothing bad either.

       Patently wrong.  Why do they have levels if there are no secrets?  What is their handshake?  Why is Albert Pike of great importance to them?

       Wrong again, secrecy breeds conspiracy which at very least, is illegal for anyone in a position of power.

       handshakes. Albert pike is the father of modern free masonry, he literally wrote the book on it after researching ancient masonry it's called morals and dogma. About the secrecy thing, mormons do it, college frats do it, just because we don't openly say what it is doesn't mean we want to hurt you or take over the world. Our secrets are stories that is it really.

       Everyone's account is 16 days old at some point. Yours was, so was mine, so was the account of everyone else in this sub. Doesn't mean anything. Now, if these are his only posts 6 months from now, maybe you are on to something. Of course, maybe he just got bored and left for a while. I did that with this account when I first made it.

       They certainly did have a hand in the starting of the country, just differently than you think. Freemasonry originally was a way for people of high stature to interact with regular people on the level. Then a lot of business men joined and when that happened politicians joined because they saw people that could help them further their goals. Symbolism is in the eye of the beholder and will always be, I see what I want just like you do. Free masonry is dead in america its basically a social club now.

       At the lowest levels, masons are good people.  Problem is the connections &amp; power can be abused (and is most often).  In Canada it's out in the open most judges are members, and that is being

       We have a bad rep because people assume that we sacrifice goats and worship the devil. But it is just one of those conspiracy theories that will never go away even if we did everything in the open and invited people in. I say go to your local lodge for dinner and ask them what they do, if they scare you just walk away, if you find out they are just nice guys that want to get away from their wives once a week then you'll know for sure.

       A degree is basically a play that the candidate is put through. We have a book that outlines what to say and has stage directions. We do everything from memory so we practice together to do it well. Each degree is meant to teach the candidate a moral lesson of some sort. Like the first degree is to teach you that you shouldn't value a person based on their worldly wealth and status but on their character and actions alone.

       I'm only active in the blue lodge and it's been a couple of years since I've even gone to scottish rite. The book "a bridge to light" can answer almost any question you have about the degrees. I'm not really one for the degrees I go for the brotherhood, for me it it a social club.

       But how do you know?  I know we are stupid to believe the media, but how do you know for a fact these things are conspiracies?  Wouldn't too many people know that 9/11 was an inside job and someone would blab?  I watched enough X-Files to realize the government is capable of doing some sneaky stuff, not necessarily with aliens, but isn't there a mainstream way to get this information legitimized?

       OP here, I'm no nut. I can't prove the Illuminati exists, but if there really were an organization as powerful as them, we wouldn't know much about it.  As for free-masonry? I don't think there is anything wrong, it's just very deeply rooted in our history, and it kind of got me started on conspiracies. I honestly believe they are a bunch of men doing good deeds in their spare time and using their spare money wisely. And if you need proof that media is brainwashing you, read this.

       There are no masonic secrets, they do have private meetings. That's not really the same as secret. What good comes of it? Nothing intrinsically good come from secrecy but then again nothing bad either.

       I'm not going to show you any logical arguments, because no matter how logical, they aren't true. They aren't factual, and I realized this a little while after reading them. They are logical and appealing, but I'm pretty sure you can google and read for yourself.

       Conspiracy does not exist without secrecy. What good has come from it, I don't know, but it seems pretty obvious that secret societies have shaped many things throughout history. If nothing else, they boost members of their groups to positions of authority and power just by membership in their secret clubs. If you can not truly realize this, you are simply ignorant of what is in plain site, or you are a shill.

       I'm glad that you believe me. I will gladly and honestly answer any questions about masonry by the way(obviously you know a bit) except that which is private to us, for that stuff check out duncans rituals it's fairly accurate.

       Sure, why not? I for one always find in interesting to learn about the beliefs and systems that other follow, I honestly think that many others in the sub feel the same way.
