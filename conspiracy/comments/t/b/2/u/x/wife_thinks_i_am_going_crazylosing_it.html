I try not to bring it up to much but some times i hear a story on talk radio/some media and i lose it and i go on a short mild rant about how shitty it is becoming. Then she goes off on how i am paranoid and how i need to get professional help then i tell her she&#39;s living a life with blinders on. what can i do to shower her how ignorant she is.maybe a book or documentaries that dont come off to strong.
EDIT: I want to thank you all for your help and input I going to take it easy on going on rants &quot;and just smile&quot;. I should have respect for her beliefs and if she ever comes around to my side i will be ready for her. </p>

<p>Driving along in the car he hears propaganda from the sycophant syndicate media. He finds himself expressing his concern in a way that makes his wife think he is going crazy.

    <div class="md"><p>1) You can never win an argument with ignorance; in fact you can never win an argument, period. Each person has a unique perspective, which means their reality is unique.  Respect this fact.</p>

<p>2) You cannot force a mind open, you will encounter equal and opposite force.  Everyone has the right to know, and equal to that right is to <em>not know</em>.</p>

<p>3) Everyone is at a different phase regarding personal development (and open mindedness), so use it as an excuse to exercise and develop your own patience.</p>

<p>Edit: Remember, when you do present this knowledge recognize that you are taking a sledgehammer to the pillars of a persons reality.  Once one pillar falls it means they must question everything, causing the rest to fall.  Most people will fight to keep those pillars standing because it&#39;s &#39;safe&#39;.</p>

<p>You need to explain the laws that were before NDAA and how they all tie up together and how it ties up with new laws like the ACTA, CISPA, the no protesting bill, assassination of US citizens with no due process by the president, etc...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that you say in your post &quot;how do I show her how ignorant she is&quot; is incredibly insulting. It gives me the impression that you do not respect your wife or her views at all. That is not the way to behave in a marriage, or in any relationship. I&#39;m not sure if this post is going to fall on deaf ears but I&#39;m going to give it a shot. I&#39;m going to try to give you a perspective of someone who lives with a conspiracy theorist. </p>

<p>My mother lost her job and ended up in the psych unit because she lost her shit at work and went on a rant about 911 and how the government was going to create marshal law at any moment. The police were called and she ended up in the hospital. </p>

<p>I felt bad for her so I allowed her to move in to our home because she could no longer hold down a job and support herself. </p>

<p>The next four years while she lived with us were a nightmare. She ranted and raved at us constantly and called us ignorant and &quot;part of the problem&quot; because we did not see the world as she did. She blared her conspiracy videos at max volume all day long even though all we asked of her was to turn it down and close her door.</p>

<p>I had videos and books thrown at me.  (not figuratively, literally) I was being screamed at and ranted at all day long. She pulled out a butcher knife and put it to her own throat and said I was &quot;killing her&quot; by refusing to &quot;wake up&quot;. She did this in front of my child. My mother took my girls to the park and became so engrossed in her latest book on 9/11 that she failed to notice that my children had wandered down to the river. They were 5 y/o. When I came to the park looking for them my mother had no idea where the were. They could have drowned and she couldn&#39;t be bothered to even check on them occasionally. She told my 6 y/o daughters that we were going to be in concentration camps and live under marshall law if her parents refused to &quot;keep them safe&quot;. She had loaded guns in her room and refused to lock them away because she needed them &quot;when they came for us&quot;. My children had nightmares and suffered severe anxiety. We had to ask her to leave our home for our own safety. </p>

<p>I watched my mother completely lose her life and family to this obsession. I&#39;m at the point now where I no longer have a mother and my children no longer have a grandmother. It is very sad for all of us but we were left with no other choice. There is no way I could ever trust her around my children again and admittedly I&#39;m angry at her for the hell she put me and my family through. </p>

<p>I guess what I want to say is that I didn&#39;t have a problem with my mother having different views than me. It was her behavior towards me and my family that was the problem. No one wants to be called stupid and ignorant just because they see the world differently than you do. No one wants their children terrorized and made so fearful that they can barely function, or to have their personal safety put at risk. </p>

<p>If you can&#39;t respect your wifes views and boundries then you will lose her. It is frightening to watch a loved one being completely consumed by an obsession. She will have a breaking point. Is it more important to be &quot;right&quot; or to live a fulfilling life with your family? There is a difference between a passion and an obsession. You can feel passionate about an issue with out letting it consume your every waking minute and robbing your loved ones of time with you. </p>

<p>I have no idea if you are at them same place as my mother. Probably not, she was quite a handful. But, I just wanted to offer my perspective so you can look at things from your wife&#39;s point of view. </p>

<p>&quot;In other news, Fukushima&#39;s Reactor, which I know nothing about, could kill you and your entire family, more news at 11.&quot;</p>

<p>Folks, get OFF the information welfare put forth by the media. Do your own research. No amount of getting info from second hand sources will get you to question the reality paradigm we live in. You have to research on your own, have a healthy dose of skepticism, and connect the dots. It&#39;s not hard. Trust your own instincts. There is plethora of data out there for one to connect the dots. Trust yourself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes when human beings under extremely stressful conditions they can have a verbal or mental breakdown in their ability to communicate clearly, shock is usually a proponent. It is not always necessarily that they are crazy, but can sometimes be that they are made  crazy by REAL and TRUE observations which are very difficult to get to grips with. For instance, something like a conspiracy against the population of the planet, is probably enough to cause you to miss words, sentences, and what people might call &quot;regular&quot; Bullshit head nodding activity.</p>

<p>For the rest of us though it&#39;s work 9-5, just so we can live without dying, and stay inside the house that we&#39;re allowed to keep, so long as we work 9-5. And those that do not afford that luxury, well, they are busy working to maintain their money mountains, whilst the rest of us attempt to build one.</p>

<p>Sometimes problems are more obvious than they seem, because obviously a human being called it a problem to start with, and that is where the difficulty began.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have had this issue before...I think we all do at some point.  The problem is you&#39;re operating at two different world views.  You need to find out what conspiracy seems plausible within her world view, convince her that this is not a conspiracy but is true, and then move on to the next subject.  Example:  If you use the word &quot;illuminati&quot; she will probably shut down...but if you use the word &quot;Banker,&quot; she might be more open to what you have to say.  It&#39;s a balance - you are going to come into more information than you will know what to do with, it&#39;s all about understanding the information internally and then being able to translate it into a sentence that a person operating from a different perspective can understand.</p>

<p>Perhaps take a break from the conspiracy stuff for a bit, even if only to let your mind and body digest the information and your situation. </p>

<p>Breathe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went through that four years ago. We were observed and she did not take it too well, when I told her. Now my wife could explain a lot of conspiracies that the normal population does not grasp and she loves me for being how I am.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When you are new to the whole world of conspiracies you will get emotionalised and you tend to confront people with your emotions. Don&#39;t. Try not to direct your anger and your emotions towards your partner. Maybe your are strong enough to handle this, but not everybody is like that.</p></li>
<li><p>For a certain amount of time do not talk at all about politics or conspiracies with her. Try to avoid it and enjoy life and every single moment with her. </p></li>
<li><p>Some years after that with experience and confidence you will see that certain topics do not get you out of your mind and ranting when you hear them, because you are used to hear them. When you are with friends or even strangers you talk about conspiracies that are 100% proof able and you introduce them to new thoughts that enrich their life without being arrogant. If they attack with their redundant talking points you will keep calm and thoughtful and explain them things without making them feel stupid or uninformed.</p></li>
<li><p>After the years observing you talk like that and seeing that some predictions have come true she will have confidence in your rationality. She will start to ask you about certain topics and you will explain to her very slowly from scratch what your opinions are. Do not think this is a fast process. It may take you 2 to 3 years to get to this point.</p></li>
<li><p>Then someday watching a movie or news you will drop your insight and a conspiracy theory and she will agree, because she knew perfectly well what you are talking about and she had the time to come to the same conclusions by herself, because she thinks for herself not because you told her so.</p></li>
<li><p>Win.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not know if a spouse will ever take your political views too seriously. I have had similar discussions with my wife and her response is &quot;there is nothing you can do about it&quot;. As much as I hate to admit it, she is absolutely right. </p>

<p>The vast majority of humanity will welcome a one world government, RFID chipping the entire population, and being dragged around by the nostrils. Getting your ass locked up for your views this early on in the &quot;battle&quot; for the hearts and minds of the sheeple will not do you or your family any good. I have given up on the vast majority of humanity. I am teaching my children about thinking for themselves and being strong enough to acquire and keep their integrity. </p>

<p>This sort of politics in action has actually seen my wife become more attracted to &quot;the cause&quot; and much less critical of my politics. I have come to discover that she actually thinks that the US government is involved in ignoring the warnings or are hiding facts. I think women need to see something in action and not be preached at - especially, by the &quot;shithead she is married to&quot; who can rarely remember to take the garbage out to the curb.</p>

<p>PS: We saw a documentary on the CBC a couple of years ago about 9/11, which was quite critical of Bush and his administration, showed the money motives of war in the Middle East and educated her about Cheney&#39;s military and defence industry connections. IMHO, experts will be more skilled at presenting facts than a spouse. This 90 minute documentary changed her mind about many things ... my rants about how fucked up the world was prior to this seemed to just crystallize her opinions. Honestly, this is where we are at <a href="http://bit.ly/rxeQhi">http://bit.ly/rxeQhi</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I use the 9/11 issue in my spousal conflict story because it was my personal awakening about statism, the financial chess board of humanity and it&#39;s grip on all of us - humanity.
