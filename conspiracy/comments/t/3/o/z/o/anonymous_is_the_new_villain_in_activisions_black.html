       Looking at who the developers are using as a consultant, Oliver North, and his "Nightmare Scenario" about a group of hackers who take over Drones and fire on US civilians.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand that this is a video game and it skirts around many "real life" issues, but this feels like a direct attack on a group of people who have been trying to clean up their image in the past year.

       If Ollie North can walk about free and direct the thoughts and ideologies of young Americans without deafening outrage, there is virtually no hope of witnessing justice in our lifetimes.

       Just watched the trailer, the game actually looks terrible.  I would have expected more (yeah, I own a few COD games) for the follow up of Black Ops.  Certainly not getting this one.

       Go for it buddy, but do your due diligence and read up on Ol' Ollie.  I've got mixed emotions about the man, but several things he was privy to where seriously screwed up.

       I think everyone has mixed emotions at the man. There are still some who refer to him as a junior officer simply given too much responsibility and made privy to information that allowed him to make some poor decisions. Not that I feel this way but I've heard that sentiment echoed before.

       If you can't blame video games for the Norway kid killing people, or any other kids who played violent games and went and shot up a school, you can't go to the extreme other side and say that this game will make them do that.

       How am I flip flopping?  I'm gonna feed the troll here and say this...  I said that this game is propaganda, just like many other popular games of the past, hell, take a look at

       .  I didn't say that playing this game is going to make kids want to kill hackers, but this can certainly be construed as disinformation (or at the least bending imaginations).  Video games are not to blame for people blowing a head gasket, taking a rifle, and sniping off students on a campus.  What is to blame is the culture as a whole, including the inability to treat people with mental problems effectively.  Our music, mass media, entertainment industry, schools, glamorization of war, social bigotry, and refusal to except people who are differ from our points of view are all reasons why kids go nuts, take Daddy's pistol to school to shoot their favorite teacher.

       Yeah, I've played some violent games, and I've lived some real life situations, the two are totally different.  Any well adjusted, mentally healthy, and rational human being can understand that.

       People who play video games like CoD don't play the games for their 'awesome story line' they play them because they're the newest FPS games and they know millions of other people will be playing them.
      </p>
      <p>
       They aren't going to say "This is just like real life, I now hate whoever this game hates."
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems like a lot of sarcasm and hyperbole coming from you though, so it's tough.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know why I even bother, I got called a shill for pointing out that someone else misread an article, because I must be on "their side" for pointing it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, the gigantic enormous unbelievably huge majority of people are not looking at this as a propaganda technique, they're playing a video game.

       I'm not trolling at all. I guess I just shouldn't enter this subreddit because one in every hundred posters doesn't just assume the most gigantic crazy outcome out of every situation. I come here because I like the idea of legit conspiracies, not reading way too hard into something and then assuming it's something so much bigger than it is. Like every other post in this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Numerous posters notice it when they come in here, and they just bow out because they know there's no hope.

       I was called a shill and down voted to hell because I pointed out that some guy who made an extremely sensationalist thread, was simply misreading the article he was quoting.

       its not about violent video games influencing violence in children, its about laying the foundation for inception by making it comfortable or normal to see an anonymous hacker type person as a threat to a free civilization.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't be surprised if in a couple years the common enemy would be this stereotype (used to be the Soviets or nazis, its currently middle eastern "terrorists") and I believe this is a propaganda tactic to label the anonymous hacker into the sub-conscience mind as "the other."

       I think you guys are grasping at straws here. There are only so many times they can make Russia and the middle east the enemy before its over played.  They basically make this game every year, eventually they gave to make a new enemy

       It's tougher when people express views that are a direct result of conditioning.

       And toughest when you realize no words can sway these minds for as time moves on, I seem to believe more and more that these minds cannot be swayed with simply words.

       Knowing it is propaganda negates it's effect for me, so I just enjoy the play without being conditioned. But they are really after the kids, and it's important we tell them about this part of it.

       Iran contra was an operation undertaken by the us government to sell cocaine in the Americas in exchange for weapons to be used to overthrow the Khomeini government in Iran in the 1970's. Basically the government raised weapons and funds to launch on overthrow of Iran via the cocaine trade.

       You keep saying that "massive impact on kids" how?
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than that they play them, among many adults, how does it have a massive impact?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because kids playing this will see the 'enemy' at the end of the game, and they will think that's their enemy?
      </p>
      <p>
       So then are you under the impression that it's okay to blame video games when a kid who only played WoW commits murder?

       No one cares about the story of the COD franchise. They buy it for the rehashed online play. My question is however... Couldn't they be sued for using copyrighted imagery? I'm pretty sure Warner Bros owns the rights to the V masks. Also, just wait for the DLC pack that includes masks to wear for online play. If anything, it'll just make Anonymous look like 12 year olds that call each other faggots all the time.

       The legitimacy of Anonymous has become very controversial as of late, these 2 videos go into an in-depth analysis of it and its newly-theorized leaders. If you've ever noticed the professionalism in the making of the Anonymous videos on YouTube you can see the amount of special effects and high-quality production are eerily typical of cleverly disguised propaganda like Kony 2012.
