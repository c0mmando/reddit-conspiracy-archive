        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>With it becoming more difficult to hide the radiation cloud <a href="http://www.politicolnews.com/fukushima-wave-of-radiation-heading-for-the-usa-west-coast/">headed towards the West Coast</a>, and the already known <a href="http://offgridsurvival.com/governmentplanningtoevacuatechicago/">plans for evacuation of Chicago</a>, I was wondering if there may be another &quot;False Flag&quot; attack planned for Chicago.  Now, a <a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2012/04/30/raw-reports-nuclear-threat-from-germany/">500 kiloton hydrogen bomb has gone missing</a>, and NSA/MI6 were involved.  Am I looking too deep into all of these dots to connect?  Thoughts... ideas?  Please, discuss.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I lived in Chicago (IN chicago, not in the burbs) for all of 2008. Here are some observations:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Extreme racial segregation. Huge issue no matter what political bend you has. It is stunningly visible - blacks/latino/poor in the south, white/money in the north. There are a few exceptions, but the overall trend it undeniable. A difficult issue to solve.</p></li>
<li><p>Extreme corruption. Chicago really does have a &quot;machine&quot;. They don&#39;t call Chicago &quot;the windy city&quot; because of the wind, it is because of the politicians (this is true). The blagojevich debacle and the subsequent rise of Rahm are evidence and result of this whole mess. No matter what you think about Obama, he is connected to this group, and his puppet masters are thereby connected etc etc. </p></li>
<li><p>A slowly dying economy. Chicago is pretending, really really hard, that it is not the next detroit. It is. In spades. It will make detroit look like a minor fluctuation in population. With the way trade is moving globally, Chicago is becoming less and less important. The majority of the wealth in Chicago was gained/maintained because Chicago was a major transit and shipping hub for the continent for so long; to go west one <em>had</em> to hit chicago. And pay fees. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>If I were a lizardperson/illuminati/bilderberg I would stage an event, &quot;evacuate&quot; Chicago (meaning all those able to leave quickly: those with cars/planes/boats; those with money...not minorities. Katrina x 1000) and <em>then</em> have the rogue nuke go off. </p>

<p>Pass GO and collect insurance money on a city worth of buildings that would otherwise be useless in 20 years. </p>

<p>Is it better to burn out or to fade away?</p>

<p>Yeah, there is still money there, but what is <em>keeping</em> it there, in the long run. Like I said above, I am looking at a 20 year game. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tech scene is strong</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is mostly because business is still using Chicago as a prime location. I predict this is changing before our eyes, and will continue to change.</p>

<p>Yes and no, I had a great paying job, but the girlfriend left me. You know the story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This subreddit has gone bat-shit insane---in order to convince the public of this they would have had to start this narrative months if not years ago.</p>

<p>oh fuck they did. It began in the in April 2011 when the Feds started feeding the greatest propaganda machine ever created, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/wikileaks/8472810/Wikileaks-Al-Qaeda-plotted-chemical-and-nuclear-attack-on-the-West.html">wikileaks</a>, with &quot;leaks&quot; confirming that Alciada would <a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/alqaeda-threatens-nuclear-hellstorm-if-osam/780992/">nuke</a> the US if we ever killed their dearly beloved leader who definitely wasn’t already dead. </p>

<p>The former PM of Pakistan blew the secret in 2007 about OBL already being <a href="http://english.pravda.ru/world/asia/15-01-2008/103426-benazir_bhutto_osama-0/">dead</a> but luckily for the American war machine she was assassinated within 6 weeks. It was the most botched autopsy since JFK.</p>

<p>A week or two after the nuke leaks, Obama decides to finally release his long form birth <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/27/obama-birth-certificate-r_n_854248.html">certificate</a>. A hogwash conspiracy I never believed until what happened next.</p>

<p>Every reporter and journalist was about to scour the photo shopped birth certificate, but within 48 hours, the news story of the century happened: public enemy # 1 was <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-201_162-20058777.html">killed</a>. The names of the men who “killed” him were not released, then the entire seal team 6 unit was killed within 6 weeks and all evidence of the kill raid was lost or destroyed.</p>

<p>America cheered about the former CIA asset who was murdered without trial. Rest assured, there will be a star in Langley for the  fallen Tim Osman. His sacrifices will never be forgotten.</p>

<p>Come the one year anniversary of the killing, the Obama administration now on their 3rd version of events that day, and it becomes a 2012 campaign <a href="http://www.metro.us/newyork/national/article/1141942--obama-osama-romney-what-if">issue</a>. </p>

<p>If the Osama story doesn’t fade over the next few weeks/months, time to get scared. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they&#39;d love to nuke a US city simply because that spectacle would have people lining up voluntarily outside of DHS office buildings to be tagged so they can feel safe.  However, they&#39;d have to blame someone and the number of entities in possession of nuclear weapons is very small and highly risky to poke with an accusation.  They could use a &quot;stolen nuke&quot; narrative, but would it be believable?  They already have carte blanche for the Middle East judging from the amount of apathy the American people have when confronted with another Mid-East/African country being attacked from our Peace Prize President.</p>

<p>*edit: Also, remember Obama&#39;s lackey Rahm has been running the city for a while now.  If they were preparing something, they&#39;d need to have an inside man to make preparations.  He fits the bill in more ways than one.</p>

<p>*edit2: The psychological effect of an attack would be a boon for Obama since he&#39;s from Chicago.  He could play the victim times 2.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well obviously no mainstream news organization is going to go to the level of a conspiracy focused website. But if you look at the coverage of chicago by cbs and abc, it is kind of weird. I&#39;ll link to just a few of their current articles about Chicago.</p>

<p>No fly zone enacted: <a href="http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/05/02/no-fly-zone-to-be-enforced-by-shoot-to-kill-order-during-nato-summit/">http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/05/02/no-fly-zone-to-be-enforced-by-shoot-to-kill-order-during-nato-summit/</a></p>

<p>An article where cbs claims the red cross has told it of evacuation plans, as have other unnamed sources. Here is a specific blurb from the article for those that are too lazy to read it, but please do cause their is more:</p>

<p>It said the NATO summit “may create unrest or another national security incident. The American Red Cross in southeastern Wisconsin has been asked to place a number of shelters on standby in the event of evacuation of Chicago.”</p>

<p>here is the actual link to the article: <a href="http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/04/29/nato-summit-security-chicago/">http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/04/29/nato-summit-security-chicago/</a></p>

<p>An article claiming the recent bridge bombers were planning to attack Chicago: <a href="http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/05/01/men-who-plotted-to-blow-up-cleveland-bridge-had-eyes-on-nato-summit/">http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/05/01/men-who-plotted-to-blow-up-cleveland-bridge-had-eyes-on-nato-summit/</a></p>

<p>references to removing post boxes because of fears of protestors: <a href="http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/05/01/post-office-to-remove-mail-boxes-before-nato-summit/">http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/05/01/post-office-to-remove-mail-boxes-before-nato-summit/</a></p>

<p>another red cross related link that seems to share some text with the earlier one: <a href="http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/04/25/milwaukee-red-cross-told-to-prep-for-chicago-evacuation-during-nato-summit/">http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/04/25/milwaukee-red-cross-told-to-prep-for-chicago-evacuation-during-nato-summit/</a></p>

<p>&quot;red zone security&quot; <a href="http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news&amp;amp;id=8643105">http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news&amp;amp;id=8643105</a></p>

<p>national guard supporting summit: <a href="http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/local&amp;amp;id=8626896">http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/local&amp;amp;id=8626896</a></p>

<p>at the end of that article: &quot;There will be a National Guard training exercise the same weekend as the NATO summit. The guardsmen have not been tapped for crowd control, but hundreds of guardsmen will be nearby if needed. &quot;</p>

<p>regarding buildings: <a href="http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/local&amp;amp;id=8630573">http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/local&amp;amp;id=8630573</a></p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m just a crazy nutter, but all of this seems really weird. And this is just what is sneaking through to the approved media companies, like cbs and abc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the substantive response. Much of this stuff doesn&#39;t seem all that strange to me- but then again I was in Honolulu during the recent APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) conference. Freeways were shut down between the airport and waikiki while the world leaders arrived. National guard were stationed at overpasses and snipers were seen near my workplace overseeing the situation. The entire waikiki area was turned into a high-security zone where people had to go through makeshift checkpoints to get in. </p>

<p>So the fact that there are national guard near by, even the fact that the red cross was prepared for the aftermath of a possible attack just seems par for the course for a large conference where important world leaders will be arriving. </p>

<p>Now who knows I could totally be wrong, but none of the stuff I&#39;ve seen reported is surprising or terribly suspicious to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting to hear from someone who was at a similar conference, thanks for sharing. I guess the point you make about world leaders could well be right. </p>

<p>The main reason it really bothers me though, is because I&#39;ve never seen such a large deployment of security forces in the United States before in my life.</p>

<p>I mean, I&#39;ve seen plenty of cops/the odd national guardsmen with M16s/canines in Penn Station after 9/11, but nothing on this scale. I guess that&#39;s why it is bothering me so much in a nutshell. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I say if it does happen, be ready to expose false flag operations. </p>

<p>We now have the historical facts, we have the public documents, we have more and more people open to the possibility and it would be easier to expose false flag no matter where it happens or when.</p>

<p>Also remember Ron Paul also warned of a false flag attack in one of his recent speech, so maybe something is brooming up. Whether false flag in Chicago or some attack between Iran and Nato, we need to be ready to expose it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay so the hydrogen bomb article has already been discussed in this sub:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/t36n1/500_kiloton_nuke_bomband_subgo_missing_from/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/t36n1/500_kiloton_nuke_bomband_subgo_missing_from/</a></p>

<h2></h2>

<p>The radiation wave article is just laughable, but I guess if your motto is to not trust anybody, you might as well trust some fear-mongering article from some random website.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>The Chicago evacuation is something that for some reason is being heavily discussed in this sub, but this isn&#39;t the first time they&#39;ve staged any sort of evacuation in Chicago. They do evacuations for major U.S. cities every year, if not every couple years, which involves using medical personnel and police to make sure they respond correctly to any sort of emergency.</p>

<p>They are obviously taking it a step further because of the NATO summit, but I still think people are reading way too far into it. I really think people on this sub are hoping for this stuff to happen, instead of saying, it could happen. But having an emergency plan in case of a gigantic attack in one of the most populated and condensed cities in the U.S. really isn&#39;t that far-fetched, especially because of the NATO Summit happening.</p>

<p><em>The largest pure-fission bomb ever constructed had a 500 kiloton yield, which is probably in the range of the upper limit on such designs. Fusion boosting could likely raise the efficiency of such a weapon significantly, but eventually all fission-based weapons have an upper yield limit due to the difficulties of dealing with large critical masses. However there is no known upper yield limit for a fusion bomb.</em></p>

<p>fireball would be around 35 km radius. Can somebody make projection on map ?</p>

However, Rahm Emanuel is mayor of Chicago and they wouldn&#39;t hit a bro, but London is too close to the City of London, heart of the Zionist finances in Britain. So I will say neither. Maybe the West Coast, because it is already radioactive and will have to be written off soon. So a nuke would be an easy choice. Los Angeles probably not get hit because of the Zionist-owned media there, would lose too much money. Up north then? SF?  LIberal bastion, undefendable perfect target on the Bay.  But SF too close to Silicon Valley, vital region. Seattle unlikely due to Boeing but you never know, Portland... hmmm....</p>
