       The mainstream media has a narrative to which they all adhere. Anything that doesn't fit the narrative is labeled conspiracy theory, lunatic fringe, terrorism, racism, extremism, and then it can be dismissed as though it didn't exist. Their reporters exist in a hall of mirrors and do nothing but bounce back and forth the same canned talking points that they've been told they are permitted to speak.

       All we're doing here is exchanging words ... and the elite can't stand it. They want us killed, or in prisons, or drugged to the gills, or otherwise silenced by any means necessary. The entire "war" against supposed terrorism has been a campaign to limit individual freedoms. It never had anything much to do with terrorism. Terror was just the excuse to control and oppress.
      </p>
      <p>
       I liken out situation to a woman who is being violently raped, and who starts to struggle and scream. What's the first thing the rapist does? Right. He puts his hand over her mouth. If she keeps it up and cannot break free of his control, eventually he may strangle  her to keep her quiet. That's us, people. We better keep on struggling, and make sure we break free.

       Unofficial statement from a mod who's been observing this account. It appears to be a bot/novelty account which supplies supplemental information to messages which are on target. Sometimes it posts its own root comment, other times, it responds to an existing comment. Odds are (just from my observation) you won't get a response.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr: I'm sure that whoever is operating that account caught your sarcasm. The comment wasn't
       <em>
        addressed to
       </em>
       you, rather it was posted
       <em>
        in support of
       </em>
       you. I'll probably watch this thread to see if I'm right.

       It may just be that there are a growing number of "conspiracy theory sites" that I'm unaware of. I just seem to see this as a more common initial point of "debunking" (discredit the site, rather than the content).
      </p>
      <p>
       I realize some sites
       <strong>
        are
       </strong>
       conspiracy theory sites: all of Alex Jones' sites, godlikeproductions, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is any site that references the NWO now considered a conspiracy theory site (despite the fact that Kissinger introduced the phrase and Reagan, Bush1, Clinton, and Bush2 have all referenced it in public speeches)?
      </p>
      <p>
       I won't give a long list, but the one that drew my attention to this was truedemocracyparty.net. Is it a conspiracy theory site? Or is it being labeled as such solely for the purpose of discrediting it?

       While true, Kissinger was the one who introduced it into mainstream media, while he was Secretary of State under Nixon. He was the one who made it acceptable for subsequent Presidents to use the phrase in that same media environment. I wasn't claiming he invented it.

       Honestly, there are just so many conspiracy sites growing it's insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex Jones, David Icke and crew have shown how much of a cash cow conspiracy sites can be, so people are taking advantage.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm starting to believe that some of those guys said something a long time ago, realized how many people followed them, and now just keep it up because if they stopped being so radical, they'd make far less money.

       Yeh, and nobody ever acknowledges that these sites in themselves are being conspiratorial producing the news they deliver(MSM or Alternative). The term conspiracy is a non-issue, we have all just been conditioned to believe if it is used, it means something wacko or crazy. Everyone of us participates in a conspiracy everyday. It is inevitable, whether it is in our jobs or pursuing an education.

       Jesus guys, get a fucking grip. No! In fact people mostly click Facebook links, and believe whatever they read, which is also awful.
