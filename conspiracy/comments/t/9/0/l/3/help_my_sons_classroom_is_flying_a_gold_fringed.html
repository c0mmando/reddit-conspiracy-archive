        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My son&#39;s in 6th grade at a public school and his social studies teacher is a big time believer in the UN/one world government stuff. She tries to disguise it as &quot;human rights,&quot; but my son has been doing a good job challenging her on this throughout the year from what he tells me.</p>

<p>The wife and I got called into a parent-teacher conference today after school, and I looked up and saw a gold fringe flag hanging. The teacher said my son&#39;s disruptive and not doing well in the class and that it might have consequences for him making it to 7th grade.</p>

<p>I feel like he&#39;s being railroaded, and I&#39;m worried about what the presence of the gold-fringe flag could mean. Are her statements binding under martial law? Are they going to use this as a loop hole to keep my son back?</p>

<p>I&#39;m very proud of him for standing up for his beliefs, but I&#39;m worried the system is going to punish him for it.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Some information I forgot to mention that has come up in the comment: My son does his homework by the book and had received mostly Bs throughout the year (and a handful of Cs, but no Fs). He brings up his views on the UN whenever his teacher talks about it and how UN rights trump US rights. He&#39;s never had any disciplinary issues in school, and none of his other teachers this year have ever brought it up. </p>

<p>I know parents sometimes look past their own kid&#39;s faults, but that&#39;s not what this feels like.</p>

<p>As for the flag, it looked new, not like one that had been hanging for a long time and passed down from teacher to teacher as often happens. There was also a UN poster on the same wall that the flag is displayed on. I peeked in a few other classrooms on the way out, and none of the other flags had gold fringe on them.</p>

<p>I&#39;m concerned she&#39;s singling my son out only for his point of view, and that because his grades and behavior are good, the gold fringed flag will allow her to hold my son back in violation of the law and school code because the flag means martial law.</p>

Considering that your child doesn&#39;t know the difference, and IIRC you said &quot;teacher&quot; and not &quot;judge,&quot; the type of flag presented in a classroom changes NOTHING of the legal or judicial instances that must be observed in the classroom.

    <div class="md"><p>The gold fringed flag is a <a href="http://www.tonyrogers.com/news/gold_fringed_flag.htm">sign that martial law applies</a>. My concern is that this teacher is big time into UN stuff, and my son routinely challenges her on it. Now suddenly, she&#39;s claiming he&#39;s &quot;disruptive&quot; and threatening to illegally hold him back a grade. </p>

<p>I&#39;m concerned the gold fringe flag will empower her to do this in violation of all laws and school codes. Does anyone have experience with this?</p>

<p>There is no &quot;it&quot; for the principal to be in on.  As I said above, no wonder your kid is disruptive in class if you believe that his teacher is involved in some sort of conspiracy based on the flag that happens to be displayed in class.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The gold-fringed flag doesn&#39;t <em>actually</em> mean anything. There are no laws regarding it, only that the gold is allowed if you want it basically. So that&#39;s completely irrelevant.</p>

<p>Since we don&#39;t know anything else pertinent about the situation, the only advice I can give is to talk to a lawyer if you think something weird is going on, unless you&#39;re going to divulge information about your kid&#39;s life to strangers on the internet, which I wouldn&#39;t do, we can&#39;t really help confirm or deny any allegations of whatever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you might be using this as an excuse for your son not doing well in school. </p>

<p>Your teacher has said that your &quot;son&#39;s disruptive and not doing well in the class and that it might have consequences for him making it to 7th grade.&quot;</p>

<p>Thats hard for any parent to hear and a reflex reaction is always to look for others to blame &quot;he&#39;s too smart for the class and he gets bored&quot; is the usual one which every teacher hears and your version of &quot;I&#39;m very proud of him for standing up for his beliefs, but I&#39;m worried the system is going to punish him for it&quot; is a variation of this.</p>

<p>Being a parent of course you are always going to be biased towards your child (thats human nature) but when you say &quot;but my son has been doing a good job challenging her on this throughout the year from what he tells me.&quot; Is he really challenging her? Is he really contributing to the education of the class? or is he actually just being disruptive and acting out as many children do when they struggle in an educational setting. </p>

<p>You have to give the teacher more credit and take into consideration that children wont always tell the absolute truth about what they get up to and yes believe it or not the teacher probably does know more than your son. </p>

<p>Do you honestly believe there is a conspiracy in the school system to keep your son back a year because he questioned the one world agenda  of a teacher? Or maybe your son is just having a little bit of trouble grasping a subject and as a result is lashing out with disruptive behaviour then justifying to you as not to get into trouble. </p>

<p>My advice look at your sons education, make sure he is doing his homework right, maybe look into tutoring or extra classes, talk to him about what he finds hard in school and what he enjoys. Try and be objective and look at the bigger picture. Jumping to conclusions will get you no where. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your concern, but my son is very smart about this. He always does his homework by the book. He only challenges her in class discussions. I&#39;ve seen his test scores in social studies, they&#39;re almost all Bs with a C or two mixed in. Just like all his other classes. Why would he be at risk of being held back if he&#39;s pulling a B average unless something else is going on?</p>

<p>Why is a gold fringe flag only in her class room?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For what it&#39;s worth I don&#39;t think the gold fringe means anything.  If your son get&#39;s passing grades on all work and she tries to fail him there are ways to challenge her. Keep notes and records. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As others have said, the gold fringe flag doesn&#39;t mean anything.  I mean, it&#39;s obvious that our rights are taken away as time goes on, but wouldn&#39;t it make sense for <em>the powers that be</em> to do this under the radar and not advertise it by changing the flag?</p>

<p>It&#39;s fine that hes challanging the teacher, but how is he doing it?  Blurting things out in class can actually be disruptive.  Raising your hand and voicing a concern is different.  I had success by just raising my hand phrasing it like a question like, &quot;but what about...&quot;</p>

<p>I think interrupting class to make a statement, even if the statement is virtually identical, wouldn&#39;t have gone over as well for me.</p>

<p>As for your child it will take years for him to understand the world. The most you can do is set up the best context you can. He will get hurt and he will suffer slings and arrows. Nothing can be done about that. However, if he leads a generally happy and supportive life he&#39;ll be able to manage without too many problems.</p>

<p>I say this as an anonymous text message; I don&#39;t know you and you don&#39;t know me. Please understand that I only mean the best. Your son is very likely too young to have fully formed and comprehensive ideations about the U.N. - particularly the implications of centralized government. I&#39;m not saying he&#39;s stupid or anything of the sort. I&#39;m only sayig that I, as a thirty+ year old, have only just recently been able to understand the full significance of global politics. As where your son is in junior high. If you&#39;re telling you son some of this stuff it could easily turn into indoctrination. Please understand that I&#39;m not trying to tell you what to do in any way. This is not an attack and I nunderstand that you&#39;re living your life the best you can. I understand and respect that. I&#39;m just telling you what an outside observe might see.</p>

<p>I wish you the best and sympathize. My own home town has Agenda 21 propaganda all over the place. I&#39;m in the same boat as yourself and also struggle to deal with it in an emotionally productive / positive way. If nothing else you&#39;re awake enough to know that something is up and worth thinking about. You&#39;re a step ahead. This is good news and as such I think you&#39;ll do just fine.</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If your son goes to a school that was constructed decades ago, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the flag has just been passed around from classroom to classroom over the years without any sort of meaning or reverence.</p>

<p>That said, your son is being disruptive in class and you&#39;re focusing on a flag&#39;s fringe instead of coming up with compromises and solutions with his teacher? Why is that?  While it is important for parents to ensure that their children think critically and question authority (when necessary), it is also imperative to you show you son how to operate within the construct.  They have to learn how to play the &quot;game&quot;.</p>

<p>The flag means nothing.  You only have one month left to get your son&#39;s shit together so that he doesn&#39;t fail.  Good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest, I&#39;d assume that he&#39;s spouting political ideas that you think sound reasonable but probably sound borderline paranoid to most people.</p>

<p>If you disagree with something the teacher says, the time to challenge it is <em>not</em> during class in front of everyone else - it&#39;s after class. </p>

<p>The whole obsession with &quot;one world government&quot; is almost certainly in your head.  I doubt the social studies teacher really cares much one way or the other as long as the kid learns the curriculum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since home schooling and private schools aren&#39;t an option I think its time for you and your son to have nightly talks about what went on in class today. Basically, he needs to pretend that he is being indoctrined while at school and he will receive the correct lesson from you in the evening. Explain he just needs to make it through this one semester so he can move on.  If you think of a good way to explain this without alarming him too much, let me know. I assume I&#39;ll have to do something similar one day myself, although my wife does seem to be interested in home schooling. </p>
