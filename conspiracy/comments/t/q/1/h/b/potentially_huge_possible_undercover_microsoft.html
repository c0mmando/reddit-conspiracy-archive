       Today I was in r/gaming and XBOX lives terms of service came up in the discussion, I commented on how their terms of service are bull shit. I was confronted by two redditors who were being highly Irrational, I received a slightly unusual amount of downvotes (considering the context)
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway I was about to go to a different subreddit when I noticed that one of the gentleman who confronted me possibly divulged in another discussion (of a different topic with a different user who is not related to the first discussion in any way) that he actually might be working for Microsoft.
      </p>
      <p>
       Very bizzare, and yes I know I was kind of being a dick, but the way they were arguing was very abrasive to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Link to the thread:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/tp0c1/i_turn_on_my_xbox_and_this_is_what_i_see/c4onmr9">
        http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/tp0c1/i_turn_on_my_xbox_and_this_is_what_i_see/c4onmr9
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, as you can see one of the gentleman even brought up lawyers and we started (basically) arguing about legal definitions of words. This alone means not much at all but considering that he may work for microsoft (and he omitted this possible fact), it's now a little different.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, if Microsoft has been deleting accounts for years with out those account holders breaking the terms of service, this could potentially look really, really bad for them (and maybe cost them money).
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the post that contains the possible divulgement, take note that he knows how the company works in great detail. The last lines are especially telling though.

       Lol are you serious? Your argument in r/gaming is by far the worst argument I have ever heard in my life.  I am now dumber for having read that.  The fact that you are able to operate a computer right now amazes me.

       So your conspiracy is that you dont like that you cant make offensive usernames on Xbox Live and the Xbox Live terms of service allows them to tell you to change it and if you don't they get rid of your account?

       You obviously don't work at a decent sized company because they attach an NDA to everything they can.  I've had to sign an NDA for an interview before.  He may work for Microsoft but the down voting is because your points are ridiculous not because they are somehow hurting Xbox and he is protecting them.  If you made valid points and were still down voted then you may be on to something but your idea of taking an offensive name and changing a number at the end to somehow subvert the Xbox live terms of service is idiotic.

       It's not subversion, it's following their request to a t. It's a name change. If Xbox doesn't like it they need to change their ToS.

       considering his knowledge of the inner workings of xbox live and his NDA that covers that knowledge, I believe there is a damn good chance he does.

       I really hope you are trolling because if not you truly are an idiot.  If you have an offensive user name (say it's pussyfart12) and you get a warning and you are so dense that you think they want you to change the number 12 because its offensive and thus change you name to pussyfart32 then you deserve to be banned.  I actually think Microsoft is letting you off easy.  They should be able to come to your house and blow up your Xbox so you can no longer even use it

       i agree with you, as i probably should have kept this all in private messages.

       i personally don't see any "conspiracy theory" going on with what this person is saying, and what i've said is pretty much all i need to say. if they wish to continue, he/she can send me all the private messages he/she desires.

       You have to admit this is all a bit dramatic.   What I would like to know though is, was the name which was banned klulakan?   If so I dont see why it was banned.   Although you were technically right with regards to adding a number is changing it, realistically though, if a name is deemed wrong then adding a number is not going to wash.  Id really like to know if they found klulakan offensive though.  I understand how you might have though desynch was an employee as hes said 'dealt with you kind before'

       In that thread someone actually said that their gamertag klulakan (sp?) was banned (without warning?) because Microsoft probably thought it said klukluxklan. I might have murdered the name though, it was very close to  'klulakan'. Also the whole klulakan1 thing was just my invention.

       My point is that adding a number does not violate their ToS, I know it's not viable to keep contacting the same user over and over and over, I think they should just make their ToS less vague.

        actually, adding anything to the end of the gamertag wouldn't be changing it, it would appending it. if the initial report was for the name "futtbucker" and you simply added "69" to the end of it, you're still using the original name that was reported (futtbucker), and it still has to be changed.

        by "your kind", i mean the same screaming 15 year olds using the xbox live service that try to explain how "ilovepussywillow" is an acceptable name because "i'm referring to the flower, bra!". it's got the word "pussy" in it, therefore it is not allowed on the xbox live service.

       as for the "the policy enforcement team isn't stupid, and they expect people to at least have an iq higher than a toaster oven" line, well, i think that really speaks for itself. if one were to actually go back and read the thread, (which i believe it starts making sense
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/tp0c1/i_turn_on_my_xbox_and_this_is_what_i_see/c4oo7t2">
        right around here
       </a>
       ), you'd start to understand. basically, it comes down to the same thing in my previous quote (where i mention the name 'futtbucker', and adding numbers to the end of it) still being against the code of conduct, as the original complaint is for the name in question, and appending numbers to the tail end of it still leaves the unchanged name that had the original complaint filed on it. therefore, the request to change said name hasn't been fulfilled.
      </p>
      <p>
       now, you and i both know (and i believe that other people would agree with me here as well) that if you're trying to get away with some silly and absurd name, adding numbers to the end of it doesn't really help your cause, as it's usually done to poke &amp; prod at and/or generally giving someone the finger. the person who had created that name knows what they had done, along with the policy enforcement team (hereby known as 'pet') and trying to add additional numbers/letters still leaves the infraction in place. it doesn't quite take a rocket scientist to figure that out.

       Besides what people are saying in here you're right. I've written negitive apple comments (I still like the company but the comments were legit) and have seen 100-200 up votes in about half a day. Then after the next few days I've watched in my user page those comments drop right down to 0 with no counter argument or reason.. Even continues when the story is long long gone from the front page.

       I barely ever play games or even visit r/gaming, so me visiting that sub was by  chance. Hell I don't even own an XBOX
      </p>
      <p>
       It was something about their abrasive rhetoric and obvious tag team method and repeated name calling that really got to me, if they were a little gentler in their rhetoric I would have abandoned the discussion way earlier.

       Looks like I stumbled onto something that I had no inkling I would stumble upon.

       Let's also note that when Microsoft deletes an account, you're* no longer allowed to play on XBOX live, a network which you are only allowed to use unless you give microsoft money. If your account is deleted, if one wished to play on line one has to buy a new XBOX live card, these range in the 20-60 dollar limit.
      </p>

       PS: there is probably gonna' be a downvote brigade in here really soon.

       microsoft doesn't delete accounts. if anything, access to the account is removed, and your gamertag (or zune tag) is removed from public view. at least, that's what i assume. but you know what they say about assuming things...

       true and false. true, you cannot access xbox live's online features (multiplayer gaming, party chats, certain marketplace content and other features that would require a paid subscription) however (the false part), you can still use a silver (free) account for basic usage. you can still message your friends, add people to friends lists, and communicate with them in private one-on-one voice chatting and play singleplayer games. that is, provided the gamertag hasn't been banned from the xbox live service.

       i've seen crazy sales on xbox live gold subscription cards. amazon usually has really good deals on these; a 3-month card i see they have priced at $19.80, and a 12-month card for $49.96. i've seen these as low as $15-30 before. you just gotta catch them at the right time.

       wtf.   what is the difference between deleting an account and denying access to an account. 'oh its ok , we didnt delete the account we have just permanently denied you access to it and removed the name' lol
