       In regards to information from Fulford, Wilcock, Drake etc: What we miss is the role of the commentator to stimulate discussion. Not to get it right every time but to persuade the rest of us to think the matter through for ourselves. Not like all are right; not like all are wrong. But it sure is stimulating to hear what all of them think.  Gives one something to come bump up against and form one’s own intelligent opinion.

       Most here in r/conspiracy disregard anything these gentlemen say but I personally like hearing it, for it helps give me a new perspective, sometimes far removed from popular opinion, to make my own conclusions about what's really going on in the world.

       Perhaps, but they are awakening everyone about the NWO, the control they exhibit on us, offering ideas for ways out, and giving us positive motivation for change. They're starting to motivate people to get off their butts and share some of this knowledge with people. Even if they are all dis-info agents, you can't deny that they're awakening people and getting really good discussions going about real positive changes to our planet.

       I don't think they are motivating anyone to "get off their butts". To the contrary their advice has been to sit back and not get involved when the "mass arrests" begin. If a platoon of national guard or phalanx of cops in riot gear appear I suggest you get the hell out of there* and not watch in joyful fulfillment as they arrest everyone (including you).

       How could the plot of the "white-hats" in the government be known to Fulford  et al and unknown to their adversaries? How could such a conspiracy be published on the internet without serious consequences to everyone involved? How long should we wait for the Ninjas of the White dragon society to start eliminating the known and located "sabbateans"? I think it is a better idea to engage in microeconomics and "occupy" activities than to wait for the next exciting episode and remember to not interfere.

       Good to see you again bud.

      <p>
       I'm saying, they're telling us to spread the word about "the existence of the NWO, the control they exhibit on us, offering ideas for ways out, and giving us positive motivation for change." Right now,
       <strong>
        most of us are only in a position to talk, and spread the word
       </strong>
       . Most of us don't have the kind of connections to
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       make changes happen. For most people, talking about it with more people is how you get off your butt and make things happen. Sorta like what occupy is doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone such as Drake is saying that we should talk to our neighbors, know who they are, get everyone talking, and localize to in order to take care of each other. Less separation/fighting amongst ourselves, more unifying together and realizing we're all made of the same stuff of the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a more physical sense, also to prepare a some survival supplies, some weaponry, become self sufficient, and help others who need it.

        completely
       </em>
       disagree.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fulford, Wilcock and Drake do not have any special knowledge. They do not have any "special connections". In my opinion they are so late to the game that they are providing a retrospective of known events rather than a prospective of what is to come. Fulford has been talking "illuminati" for years and advancing the plot of his uncovering the secret workings of the world government. Wilcock used to be all about Psychic phenomena but realized there was more money in conspiracy theory. Drake is a low level military victim of ptsd who is trying to find a higher purpose for his wasted life.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of these people are breaking new ground. We have youtube and vimeo, alex jones and Mike Rivero, Twitter and facebook so most of us are well beyond discovering or spreading the word about the nwo. The prepper movement is big business.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of us
       <strong>
        do
       </strong>
       have connections to really make things happen. The idea that we have to wait for "the white hats" or "the white dragon society" to take over as our new masters is repugnant.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mass movement that is now taking shape (and in my opinion will need another 3-5 years to come to fruition) is philosophical, spiritual and scientific. It needs time to organize intellectually, time to reflect and time to test its conclusions. This is happening NOW in real time on a worldwide basis. The occupy movement is the physical embodiment of this process.
      </p>
      <p>
       The challenge for everyone, IMO, is to find a niche in a nwo of their own creation. Most of us live at least partially dependent upon or within the matrix. This makes it difficult to imagine let alone move to a life outside. We will have to give up so many things that define who we are (e.g. religion, nationalism) that it is hard to imagine who we will be and sometimes who we are.
      </p>
      <p>
       So rather than wait for the latest news or further instruction we must, each and everyone, look for a new way to live and be happy.

       That is precisely my point in this thread. These "informants" are acting as someone "to come bump up against and form one’s own intelligent opinion." They're stimulating more of us to organize intellectually by being given new viewpoints on the world, so we have time to reflect and time to test our own conclusions.

       Drake, for example, is doing just that. If you've been listening to his broadcasts, he's been giving us
       <em>
        at least one idea
       </em>
       about a
       <em>
        potential
       </em>
       new way of life outside of the matrix. If you've been following him, or any of the blogs that post this type of information (such as the 2012 Scenario I've linked at the top) you'd see that we're encouraged to no sit and wait for instruction, but to undergo your own personal worldview revolution to "look for a new way to live and be happy."

       Even giving them the benefit of the doubt, one thing I find quite disturbing is that they are encouraging us to rejoice at the replacement of the secretive Illuminati criminal cabal with a just-as-secretive Asian one. I'd rather not meet the new boss, thank you.

       And then there's that whole ends-justify-the-means thing; I don't see how good can come of a fraud; it doesn't work for AGW, which is really about global enslavement and control; and it doesn't work for this either, because it boils down to the same ulterior motive.

       I don't think they are really awakening people, at least not to the whole picture.  It all reminds me of the Zeitgeist bull.  Oh no the NWO, come live in our "perfect" world.  Where food is distributed to you, where no one has to work.   It sounds like the same shit Alice Bailey, HG Wells, HPB, etc.  have been telling us is the plan all along.

       if you don't already recognize this and it will quickly become clear. We are not on the same side, the spirits/aliens (some call them aliens) are the true villains who are intent on deceiving the entire human race. They tell us all this stuff about the NWO and "waking up" because their intention in reality is to wake us up. All this NWO stuff fits into their scheme. The "storyline" is that the "elite" have been ruling us for ages with the assistance of secret occult knowledge and technology, and the reason they have been so successful is because they have this power to themselves and keep it secret. This is true, but it's also a manufactured story, it's designed and made popular to make room for the supposed "solution" - giving this occult power and technology to the common people, aka "waking them up." All of this is completely planned. The end goal is not the NWO - the NWO will be defeated with the assistance of this power, it's all theater. The true end goal is to have this occult power widespread throughout the world. In reality there are only two sides, there's the side of these teachers like David Wilcock which is the same side as the spirits and the devil. Then there's the opposite side which is the love of the truth, which will eventually lead to God and Jesus Christ. If you do your research, I swear this is where it goes. If you don't, well, you've already chosen your side. It's as simple as that.

       If you would rather subscribe to whatever sounds good because it identifies itself by pretty messages and looks easy, devoting yourself to its mission and spreading it as though it is good and true, without doing the work to discern for certain its sources are trustworthy, its message is consistent, and its role on this earth is not harmful, your goal is self-enabling and self-exalting rather than utilitarian and you are no better than those who encounter the demons and believe them.

       What does it matter what the source is? If it's ultimately making you a more loving and peaceful person, then I say who cares. Isn't peace, love, kindness, and hope ultimately what God is about?
      </p>

       Obviously if one of these sources starts saying things to make you fearful or hurtful to yourself or others, then that should tip you off not to listen. You should think for yourself apart from what any source would tell you because you know better.

       That's true. The reason I say they are evil is because I know they reject the one God, and I understand that what they offer to the world also predisposes a person to reject this same God. I do not believe humans are capable of goodness by any means apart from the spiritual reparation which comes from obedience to the one God, so, to me, it is clear that human empowerment by demonic means will only further empower the evil of those who deny God.

       The church existed before the Bible, but not before the teaching. The church went on to change dramatically, while the teaching, first with Jesus, then afterward with the Bible, stayed the same. Biblical Christianity is the teaching of Jesus and his apostles, all of which corroborate one another, all of which we can be sure are legitimate if we accept the premise Jesus was legitimate. The church has none of that. In many cases it's full of shit; in others it's just lost.
      </p>
      <p>
       Call it what you want, I call it biblical Christianity. I would simply call it Christianity, but unfortunately that name has already been taken by an establishment that seems to do little beyond trivializing Christ. So, biblical Christianity it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, the Bible certainly did not sanction two millennia or even two minutes of violence, nor change its dogma.

       Didn't sanction violence? There are very significant portions peddling themselves off as history where "god" not only explicitly commands the razing of entire cities, he punishes any reluctance to follow through.

       From what I've read/listened to/watched, spirits/extra-terrestrials/extra-dimensionals/Jesus Christ are all sort of the same thing. Beings not from this planet, and not even from this dimension. And from the many channelings I've read, they all seem to believe in the existence of a God, or some kind of divine creator, and manifested as love and truth.

       I happen to agree.  I think there is an underlying lie that all of these people have either been led to believe or led to spread to the masses.  I am not sure if it's willful deception on their parts or if they are just being deceived.    Now I still subscribe to Bill Cooper's view, "Read everything, listen to everyone and don't believe anything you can't verify with your own research."

       No doubt. Willful can have many meanings - while I doubt many of these teachers intend to lead us directly to hell by way of lies, I'm sure they do intend to benefit themselves with shortsighted power at the cost of what is good while acting as mastheads for shallow movements with mass appeal, or else they would not have been fooled.

       Bill Cooper had a lot of things right. Keep searching for what is true and good.

       Has anybody here experienced what David Wilcock teaches?
      </p>
      <p>
       The dimension we exist in is shit. Look at it. We are slaves and we poison ourselves and our planet, yet upon realisation we still beg for more. I am only still here because we have to maintain a spiritual/physical balance.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to think esoteric teaching was all in the mind until I experienced it. It taught me how to love my fellow man, for we are all one collective consciousness. It also taught me how to leave the physical body that we inhabit, and experience life in higher dimensions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe we live our lives in fear, always worry about something (money) but that is all due to change. A conscious shift is upon us, a 'DNA upgrade' if you will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im just adding my 2c to the discussion, I am ok with downvotes. I'll still love you =P
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT - Also, the western idea of 'God' (christian,catholic etc) is actually the devil. Look how smart he is at making you think I am crazy for saying that. God exists within us, but its difficult for 3rd dimensional life to comprehend, as we are basically retarded as far as universal knowledge goes.

       If you've been following this, you'll know this is not true. Listen to some of Drake's shows for example.

       How could the plot of the "white-hats" in the government be known to Fulford  et al and unknown to their adversaries? How could such a conspiracy be published on the internet without serious consequences to everyone involved? How long should we wait for the Ninjas of the White dragon society to start eliminating the known and located "sabbateans"? I think it is a better idea to engage in microeconomics and "occupy" activities than to wait for the next exciting episode and remember to not interfere.

       If you would rather subscribe to whatever sounds good because it identifies itself by pretty messages and looks easy, devoting yourself to its mission and spreading it as though it is good and true, without doing the work to discern for certain its sources are trustworthy, its message is consistent, and its role on this earth is not harmful, your goal is self-enabling and self-exalting rather than utilitarian and you are no better than those who encounter the demons and believe them.

       The church existed before the Bible, but not before the teaching. The church went on to change dramatically, while the teaching, first with Jesus, then afterward with the Bible, stayed the same. Biblical Christianity is the teaching of Jesus and his apostles, all of which corroborate one another, all of which we can be sure are legitimate if we accept the premise Jesus was legitimate. The church has none of that. In many cases it's full of shit; in others it's just lost.

       Call it what you want, I call it biblical Christianity. I would simply call it Christianity, but unfortunately that name has already been taken by an establishment that seems to do little beyond trivializing Christ. So, biblical Christianity it is.

       Either way, the Bible certainly did not sanction two millennia or even two minutes of violence, nor change its dogma.

       Well, he sanctioned it in those instances. What I mean is later violence committed by Christians was not sanctioned.
