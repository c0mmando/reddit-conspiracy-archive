       I keep running into these completely inaccurate stories on here, and the top comment always points out all of the flaws, and that is that. But the upvotes! So many upvotes for completely wrong, paranoid rubbish with conclusions drawn from carefully picked and manipulated information. No wonder no one takes this subreddit seriously.

       If we can accept that there are "bots" and "shills" which downvote, naysay, and detract from an intellectual dialogue, it must also follow that there is a possibility that intentionally inaccurate stories are posted and upvoted in order to destroy hard earned and well fought credibility.

       It defies conventional logic: the idea of such a widespread and easily identifiable conspiracy puts most people in an uproar.
Not justifying totally blowing the theory off, also not buying it completely.

       Manipulation of the masses is more easily achieved through corporate media and early education systems. Teach the sheep to stick with the flock while they're young and, no matter where that flock heads, they're sure to come tumbling behind.

       I think 9/11 qualifies pretty well for the first part of your comment. Why not poison us too, who's going to stop it? The sheep and/or lemmings? As if they would believe it..... A section of Maxwell Igar's film Trance-Formation presented evidence of it in a way that finally made it seem reasonable to me. I don't know.

       Yes, I'm watching them form right now.  I don't know anything about Hitler's atomic bomb but I do know the story on him is greatly distorted.  Not a fan of his by any means but I'm pretty sure Uncle Joe was much worse.

       posts are just total lapses in logic, not any real factual issue. It's not an issue of providing "misinformation", it's an issue of pointing out that the theory/story makes no fucking sense even

       There are so many articles in this sub that are bullshit and it's why people make fun of this sub so much, which is disheartening.. But you've got people like t0tttt who just spew racism and get upvoted for it, it's sad.

       If it's a first run of a submission (i.e., not a repost) and it is a link to an article that is in error, the discussion debunking it is as important as any article in my opinion. So, these inaccurate stories where the top comment is pointing out the flaws... If they're a first run submission, there's a chance that I upvoted them so that people would see the comments and be prepared to bury that shit next time someone submits it. (prime examples are the links to the FBI vault. Has it been vetted? If not, let's vet it and get it done - and the vetting is what is getting the upvotes, not the garbage content in the link.)
      </p>
      <p>
       reddit is as much about the user input/commentary as it is about the articles being linked. Links to shit articles which have great conversation explaining precisely why it's shit are, in my opinion, as important as good articles.

       The fact that this subreddit actively attempts to sort out the contradictions from the truisms makes it all the more valuable. The posts disseminate hearsay(or factoids) of corruption/fraud, covert acts, and coercive manipulations. Such information needs to be thoroughly researched collaboratively by the community itself so that information can be rinsed of its contradictions, and true integrity can shine.....This

       Yeah, this. Taking the air out of bogus junk, and pointing out why it's ridiculous is a good service to people who care about conspiracies. I think debunking lies and unfounded speculation is important for people to see.

       If someone post an article that isn't accurate, and the community post information that refutes the claims of the OP, it seems to me everything is functioning perfectly.

       As someone that often finds flaws in the stories posted and posts replies its pretty common to just be downvoted to the point of being hidden within an hour.  Too many people here aren't interested in the truth but only in supporting their own warped views of the world.

       SauerJosh "Tyrone" is saying he doesn't like the stories that r/conspiracy upvotes. Maybe SauerJosh"Tyrone" just doesn't like alternatives to the

       Yes it was. The bot supposedly looks for negative comments and threads about Paul. I made a negative thread about him (which, if you read my comment in that thread, you will see it's a play on words)

       The 1% of signal is still interesting enough to outweigh the 99% noise.  Better to stay and try to improve quality then just jump ship when the cost of staying is so low.

       I would like to see some examples of what you are speaking of.  Because, I suspect  you are saying anything which is not mainstream is illogical, irrational or unproven.  Furthermore,  upon a close inspection much that is mainstream does not hold water.  Of course, if someone is caught making these kinds of inspections we can brand them with various buzzwords which cause conditioned discounting of them.  That is how we do it.  Not true discernment by any means.  I would like to see where you stand.
