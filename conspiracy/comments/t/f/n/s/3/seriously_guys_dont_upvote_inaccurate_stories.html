Not justifying totally blowing the theory off, also not buying it completely.</p>

<p>Manipulation of the masses is more easily achieved through corporate media and early education systems. Teach the sheep to stick with the flock while they&#39;re young and, no matter where that flock heads, they&#39;re sure to come tumbling behind. </p>

<p>But yeah, properly reading a paragraph versus taking out the part that makes it look evil is certainly &quot;manipulated misinformation.&quot;</p>

<p>There are so many articles in this sub that are bullshit and it&#39;s why people make fun of this sub so much, which is disheartening.. But you&#39;ve got people like t0tttt who just spew racism and get upvoted for it, it&#39;s sad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it&#39;s a first run of a submission (i.e., not a repost) and it is a link to an article that is in error, the discussion debunking it is as important as any article in my opinion. So, these inaccurate stories where the top comment is pointing out the flaws... If they&#39;re a first run submission, there&#39;s a chance that I upvoted them so that people would see the comments and be prepared to bury that shit next time someone submits it. (prime examples are the links to the FBI vault. Has it been vetted? If not, let&#39;s vet it and get it done - and the vetting is what is getting the upvotes, not the garbage content in the link.)</p>

<p>reddit is as much about the user input/commentary as it is about the articles being linked. Links to shit articles which have great conversation explaining precisely why it&#39;s shit are, in my opinion, as important as good articles.</p>

The posts disseminate hearsay(or factoids) of corruption/fraud, covert acts, and coercive manipulations.

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to see some examples of what you are speaking of.  Because, I suspect  you are saying anything which is not mainstream is illogical, irrational or unproven.  Furthermore,  upon a close inspection much that is mainstream does not hold water.  Of course, if someone is caught making these kinds of inspections we can brand them with various buzzwords which cause conditioned discounting of them.  That is how we do it.  Not true discernment by any means.  I would like to see where you stand.</p>
