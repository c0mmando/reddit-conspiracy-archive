       thats because making everyone else poorer enriches the smallest few with substantial wealth...because their money is worth more to other people, so they have a disproportinately upper hand in market exchanges. so poverty is good for the richest people in the short run. and in the long run, theyd be better off maximizing utility by reducing poverty

       This  notion has a strong history in the individual liberties movements:
      </p>
      <p>
       Also known as "Social Credit" or "National dividend" It is  a way to maximize the power of the individual and make sure societal systems serve the individual rather than the individual being forced to serve ineffective societal systems.
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Social Credit is an economic philosophy developed by C. H. Douglas (1879–1952), a British engineer, who wrote a book by that name in 1924. Social Credit is described by Douglas as "the policy of a philosophy"; he called his philosophy "practical Christianity". This philosophy is interdisciplinary in nature, encompassing the fields of economics, political science, history, accounting and physics. Assuming the only safe place for power is in many hands, Social Credit is a distributive philosophy, and its policy is to disperse power to individuals. Social Credit philosophy is best summed by Douglas when he said, "Systems were made for men, and not men for systems, and the interest of man which is self-development, is above all systems, whether theological, political or economic."
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Douglas, the true purpose of production is consumption, and production must serve the genuine, freely expressed interests of consumers. Each citizen is to have a beneficial, not direct, inheritance in the communal capital conferred by complete and dynamic access to the fruits of industry assured by the National Dividend and Compensated Price. Consumers, fully provided with adequate purchasing power, will establish the policy of production through exercise of their monetary vote. In this view, the term economic democracy does not mean worker control of industry. Removing the policy of production from banking institutions, government, and industry, Social Credit envisages an "aristocracy of producers, serving and accredited by a democracy of consumers."

       Very informative, thank you. I was, to put it simply, staggered that such an idea was advocated by Friedman of all people. Perhaps if the guaranteed income had been a component of neoliberalism/shock doctrine around the world it might have actually worked or not been as bad.

       I think Friedman's advocacy of "guaranteed minimum income" was (1) a red herring designed to coyly introduce "flat tax" into the national dialogue, and (2) an artifact of 1962's very liberal atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that people born after 1980 can't really conceive of how different a place the U.S. once was:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        there was no right-wing hate radio
       </li>
       <li>
        there was "equal time for opposing viewpoints" required by law, which meant "public affairs rebuttal segments" from citizens in boring TV spots that were usually run off-hours like Sunday morning
       </li>
       <li>
        there was widespread belief that "Big Government" was an overwhelming force for good
       </li>
       <li>
        there were zero "spending cuts" or "austerity measures" to pay off WW2 debt, which was the greatest debt in U.S. history, far bigger than today in 2012 dollars or as a debt-to-GDP ratio.  Instead, from 1945-1973, deficit spending &amp; printing money was used to SPEND our way out of debt by creating infrastructure, building a shining America that didn't exist before, and expanding a middle class tax base that never existed previously, which raised tax revenue that "paid off" the WW2 debt
       </li>
       <li>
        the middle class expanded every year
       </li>
       <li>
        "two income households" required to raise a family were not the "norm" like today
       </li>
       <li>
        blue collar jobs like plumbers made income equal to professionals
       </li>
       <li>
        lawyers &amp; doctors advertising was illegal, because those professions were considered "above commerce"
       </li>
       <li>
        hospitals were non-profit
       </li>
       <li>
        Truman (Democrat) &amp; Eisenhower (Republican) had a top tax rate of 91% on the wealthiest.  JFK reduced it to 70% but effectively kept it at 90% by closing loopholes.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       In the 1962 atmosphere, Friedman had to advocate something gigantically liberal just to get his other crazy far-right ideas out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even in 1972, Nixon said "We are all Keynesians now" which was a repudiation of Friedman publicly, even as Nixon shoved Friedmanism down Chile's throat at gunpoint with his Pinochet dictatorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       But as Nixon's VP Spiro Agnew said before he resigned in disgrace, "America is going so far right you aren't going to recognize it."
      </p>
      <p>
       And now, 50 years after 1962, Obama could never say "We are all Keynesians now", and he skimped on the stimulus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Incidentally, right-wingers are all anti-Keynes &amp; pro-Friedman
       <strong>
        except when it comes to military spending
       </strong>
       .  Then Republicans are suddenly socialists and stimulus spenders.  "Don't close any military base!  It will hurt the economy!"  But Democrats are traitors who refuse to slam Republicans on this hypocrisy, and they all deserve trial &amp; execution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neoliberalism/shock doctrine opposes the "guaranteed income" by definition, because Neoliberalism/shock doctrine is Neofeudalism.

       Wow, lot of thought provoking info in your response. I agree about the paradigm shift that happened in the 80s. If you didn't live through it (and I did) you don't understand, but I imagine people who lived in the 60s feel the same way and with good reason. Thanks for the info.  Actually rereading this I think you should at least make a post dealing with the info you presented here. I'd like to see it anyway. It's important.

       Basically you are simply refunding what society ALREADY pays in both taxes and fiat money.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only difference from all other alternatives is that by refunding it directly to individuals as a social dividend directly and without government intervention, it puts control of production back into the hands of individual consumers by their purchasing power.
      </p>
      <p>
       (It makes the economy more of a free enterprise consumer driven economy.)
      </p>
      <p>
       It therefore grows the economy and wealth (which quickly outstrips any program costs and without tax subsidies which often cause huge economic misdirection like the 1980's real estate tax commercial property collapse or the home mortgage deduction causes))

       The most difficult part of getting this to work in the US will be disguising it from the segment of the population that won't understand it and will think of it as people mooching.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way you do it is to create a program that requires a few layers bureaucracy to get to. Anyone can qualify but different demographics have different points of entry. Then, make sure any benefits people get are called tax credits or something else innocuous. Having the word tax in the name is a good starting point because it camouflages it from dumb people. i.e. don't say entitlement say earned benefit. Remember this is all about tricking people who don't understand how money flows through the economy, so it doesn't have to be that tricky. Just as long as they don't think someone's "gettin somethin fer nothin" or "livin off my hard earn'd money."

       It used to be called a grain dole, as in "bread and circuses." It was largely responsible for the decline of the Roman Empire.

       Interestingly, most people believe that the malaise you cite as being caused by not having to work for a living and being distracted by superficial entertainment measures was actually caused by the influence of Christianity and people being content to "wait for heaven's reward" as opposed to working for one now.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the fall was more likely caused by a number of things in concert:  A military too large to support, the use of barbarian mercenaries to ineffectively police their borders, and disease caused by an inability to keep public works up.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, there are a 1000 reason to speculate about the decline of Rome, but your "grain dole" is not on the short list.  The bread and circuses soundbite always makes people sound smart though.  Maybe you can double up and call me a "sheeple" now.  That would be cool.

       I think there is far more evidence that civilizations who stop subsidizing  innovation and who have a huge percentage of their population excluded for materially participating in their economies fall for THOSE reasons.

       Ie french revolution.
In fact the number for wealth participation has even been quantified or estimated at around 90% wealth control.

       You people are really absurd here. You understand that there are limited resources on earth right and even if there were unlimited resource, having this apply globally would just mean prices keep on rising all the time, until one day we are buying bread for billions of dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah sure it can probably work in some small town, I'm sure even full socialism can work in some small town, where 90% of stuff is imported and outsourced elsewhere, but this can't work on a large scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all it is going to actually destroy real productive jobs, meaning people will still get money and the expenditure will be the same, but productivity is going to go down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second since everyone has a minimum pay that would mean all products with cheap prices will get higher, there would be no incentive to keep prices lower, when everyone can afford it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second of all what stops people from quitting their job and enjoying life, traveling around the country, knowing he'd be getting payed no matter what.
What happens if enough people quit their jobs, it reduces productivity, it causes work shortages, coupled with the rising inflation it actually causes lower standard of living and due to the entitled nature to get payed, you'd have reduced productivity, meaning a lot of shortages of products.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may sound good and noble, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions, what we can do is allow for unlimited freedom and let people take care of themselves. It provides for the maximum amount of wealth, it provided for the maximum amount of happiness, it provides for the maximum amount of research and breakthroughs.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: And there can still be few things like pensions and state schooling if one nation so chooses.

       Automation and production measures improving, coupled with population growth as a result of advances in medicine and such, leads to one end result:
      </p>
      <p>
       Fewer jobs for labor, with more people who need jobs.  This is unavoidable.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the welfare state is going to get bigger no matter what as me move forward, short of a major population check.  This cannot be averted.  If robotics ever moves to the point where people think it could go, this will be an exponential adjustment when the technology hits.  So, we have a few choices.  Beat each other to death in an Ayn Rand meets Mad Max struggle for resources, or reevaluate our notions of economics and resource allocation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way you describe inflation and productivity are incorrectly reasoned, archaic, and will soon be irrelevant.  I would also assert that your thoughts on maximum research and breakthroughs are utterly wrong, given the trend in innovation and research in the US when compared with other, more regulated, countries today.

       You are living in a dream. That can never work and its not about the system, its about human behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus if everyone can afford large number of goods and resources, with limited resources on Earth how long do you think we'll last?
      </p>
      <p>
       Many elitists want to take down our number to 1 billion people, with the case the OP is making it would literally need to be done, 5 billions would have to die, in order to exist in such a system. Not to mention that its still not going to work, due to basic human nature.
