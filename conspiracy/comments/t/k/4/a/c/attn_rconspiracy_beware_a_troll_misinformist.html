       USER: bigglesxyz, has only been a member of reddit for 14 day and has been called out NUMEROUS times in that short period for both trolling and trying to downplay peoples posts as being extremist or some kind of wacko idea.

        A quick overview of this guys comment history will show that this is true

       Ugh.

      <p>
       If r/conspiracy were consistently more interested with facts instead of storytelling this wouldn't be an issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes submissions are upvoted just because they make for a "good story" and are compelling the same way a good sci-fi movie or a thriller is. And then you click on the link and in the article there's no citations, no facts, no evidence, no internal logic. Or the submission headline is just a total fabrication.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if someone notes that a conspiracy isn't supported by evidence, they are attacked as "troll misinformists". If someone brings in contrary evidence, that's just dismissed as a paid shill. Orwellian shit, ironically enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best conspiracy theorists are historians, looking through primary sources to present non-sensationalized
       <em>
        history
       </em>
       . The worst conspiracy theorists are novelists, constructing a plotline around the most "interesting" set of characters and tropes.

       The "attack" on Sir Bigglesworth wasn't because of a single post. I agree that things should be questioned and yes, not everything on this sub-reddit is true nor believable. But when your single purpose is to troll MANY different posts and that is all you do....then yes...he is a troll and tries his best to make peoples posts look stupid and non-factual without provided information based on facts as to WHY he says what he says.

       Well, you should really post an example if that is true. You're doing
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       what you claim he's doing ("make peoples posts look stupid and non-factual without provided information based on facts as to WHY he says what he says"). So, the examples I've seen show the opposite of what you say. Is there a better one?

       I'll just post this here since you deleted your comment about my username being a throwaway and trying your best to troll me about not providing information.
      </p>
      <p>
       I told you where to find your information you want. If you don't like that, then that is your problem. Other people have taken a stroll through his comments and come to the conclusion that he is a troll. But like i said, if clicking a link and looking at someone comments and how they respond to numerous posts is to hard for you, then feel free to come up with some other bullshit reason to defend him. I am actually using this account because i got tired of fuckers like you and deleted the account i had for 2 years. I made this account a while back as a joke for r/doctorwho and only used it now because i happen to see ANOTHER post by mr. biggles were he was doing the exact same thing i have seen him do in the past short period of time he has been submitting comments.

       I never once implied in my post that you are or were a troll, but from this response I can see the rumors are true. =) Racism is vile indeed, but banning people based on ideology is not our style. They should be downvoted, and the majority of users do downvote blatantly racist comments and posts. We have a free speech policy, and we don't ban based on things like racism. Sorry.

       I'm just unbelievably confused. This sub seems to be just full of those who believe that if you don't agree with their position, that you're a shill, or you're on their side..
      </p>
      <p>
       It's crazy because when I see people speaking so negatively about /conspiracy in politics, news, worldnews, etc, it really frustrates me, because conspiracies do happen, and major ones have been found even in just the last couple decades.. but then I see how people act here, almost like a cult, where you're shunned if you even question the status quo, it's really weird to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, you couldn't possibly be someone who believes that conspiracies happen and are happening, but not everything is a conspiracy.

       You are generalizing the people here. If these people make you angry, then you have a problem that has nothing to do with conspiracies or conspiracy theorists. Why do you allow the ignorance of other people to make you angry? Sounds like a miserable way to live.

       I'm just saying if other peoples ignorance bothers you, that must suck for you. Patience is a virtue, especially in this regard. You must learn to accept that other people have very different ideas and go from there.

       It's not everyone here, and personally, it's hard to not reply to people who attack ME for saying I say. It's unbelievably frustrating for someone to read 3 paragraphs and come back with, "you're just a shill." That is either trolling, or beyond ignorant, to believe that anyone who disagrees with you must be paid to do so.

       I understand it's a gigantic sign of immaturity, but it's frustrating.

       Listen man, I know this post has cut pretty deep. What i want you to realize, and what you SHOULD already have realized, is that how you conduct yourself...even in an anonymous way where you can act any way you want, will effect the people who read your statements and will obviously label you in a certain light.
      </p>
      <p>
       If i was new to reddit and decided that a majority of my comments are going to be, ONE: super negative, TWO: saying that a certain subject is wrong without providing any details as to why OR proof as to why, THREE: I only did this in sub-reddits where it is known that people are trying to spread some tiny bit of truth in the midst of battling lies from main stream new media.......You can sure as hell bet that people are going to call me a troll.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you aren't a troll, but your approach to commenting on peoples posts sure does reflect a trollish mentality. Kinda like the Dave Chappelle joke about the lady wearing slutty clothes and getting pissed off when people accuse her of being a slut, "you might not be a slut...but your wearing a sluts uniform".
      </p>
      <p>
       Also want to say sorry for the Cheetos comment, although slightly funny, it was out of line.

       I think the biggest issue so far for me is that people read it, with the assumption that I have an underlying opinion, or an underlying meaning behind everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, because I'm playing the other side, I am totally against what they're saying, or am totally against them. The only issue I bring up is with completely misinformation in articles, or any fear-mongering article like Alex Jones, where he takes something that "could" be an issue, but makes it seem like it's the most threatening issue to mankind, in every single article.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing that only really gets to me, or under my skin I guess, is that people keep telling me what I mean, telling me what I'm truthfully saying, instead of realizing I'm only against certain parts. no11113 or whatever his name is was a prime example, I pointed out I didn't like a generalizing part of his post, so he assumed that I didn't like his entire post, and I understand I could have worded it better, he understands he could have understood what I was saying better, and we moved on.

       "this in sub-reddits where it is known that people are trying to spread some tiny bit of truth in the midst of battling lies from main stream new media."
      </p>
      <p>
       MSM is pretty crazy right now, but "Main Stream" conspiracy sites are the same way. Infowars especially is flooded with sensationalism, and the Yellow Journal crap to me I don't think belongs on either side. I don't think MSM, or what I call the main conspiracy sites, I don't think either one needs to try to scare their viewers into listening to them.

       See, this is a prime example; Alex Jones is well debunked and passed off as a waste of time and a fear monger here, and yet you cite him as the seminal example of who we are and what we are interested in.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Since you didn't recognize that, I think it's important to mention that infowars is his site...so utterly useless examples to your statements.

       How is what I just said trolling? I've been around the gaming community since '97 and I've never seen the word used so loosely.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Racism is vile indeed, but banning people based on ideology is not our style. They should be downvoted, and the majority of users do downvote blatantly racist comments and posts. We have a free speech policy, and we don't ban based on things like racism. Sorry."

      <p>
       Is something I totally get, I actually mentioned that in a couple posts when people ask about that guy. It's a forum, the guy has the right to say whatever he wants, and I understand that. Reddit is a giant pool of different subs, I find new ones every day that excite me, and make me shake my head, but I also have the freedom to not look at them, I understand 100%.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you couldn't see that you posting your comment, in this thread which is directed completely towards me, that it would have an implication that you're agreeing with the topic? Maybe it's the defensive nature I've procured from the thread itself, but I do think if you look at this non-objectively that your comment could be seen as an implication that you agree with the topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also don't see how my comment "confirms a rumor" unless I'm drastically underestimating what the term troll has turned into..

       Your behavior is what gives you the title troll. Just relax man. You are waaaayy too uptight. If you don't agree with what those users say, downvote them. Don't come at me like I have kind of moral responsibility to keep their opinions in line. I don't play that game. I personally despise racism. But to deny a person their right to speak freely here about it isn't very cool. We allow you to express your opinions here too, so that freedom does go both ways. He is free to say he doesn't like this type of person and you are free to call him a bigot and downvote him. Case closed. Don't implicate me in other peoples racism.

       That is pretty much half of the people that reply to what I say, people who respond to stuff in that nature/context. So I'm the troll for replying (somewhat) sarcastically to it?

       From reading this comment in particular I can see where the conspiracy minded would find a huge hole in your logic, and it is this: Anti war at all costs. If you condone military action for any reason you will usually be downvoted and verbally assaulted here. Their intentions are good, but it's hard to debate these subjects unless we meet in the middle first and work outwards from there.

       The wording on his topic was extremely vague and suggested, to me, that Kony was debunked, not the film and filmmakers, so I asked that..

       If anything, as someone who has actually been to Uganda, I would prefer no military action whatsoever because many of the innocent there would have no where to go..

       A statement was made by the moderator. A 100% contradictory statement was then made by the moderator. Were there other reasons? Maybe. If there was another reason that person was banned, it wasn't given by the moderator. Is "degree of racism" a factor? Maybe. That wasn't part of the moderator's comment(s).
      </p>
      <p>
       Moderators can do what they like. But pointing out inconsistencies in their rationale is something this subreddit should do more often, maybe, given it's nature...

       9000sins is nothing more than a hypocrite. If you disagree with somebody then you're basically called a "troll" in here by the mods like sunshine-x,homegrownterran and 9000sins. Also, love how 9000sins says he doesn't censor people where there's been countless times of them trying to censor others.

       I've been called out because I hang out in this subreddit and don't agree with a lot of the random obvious bullshit stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who do you think is going to defend me over here? Someone like you, who thinks I'm being paid by someone to come in and disagree with reddit? As if anyone could actually change your mind if they tried.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is now the second time you said you've written to the moderators about me, and do you know why they're not taking any action? Because I'm not doing anything wrong.. It's an internet forum, why are you so bent out of shape because I want to share MY opinion? If anything comes on here that you don't agree with, it has to be reported?
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously man, you're not a conspirator, you're just paranoid, and that is evident.
      </p>
      <p>
       A real conspiracy theorist enjoys people challenging what they say, that's how most of us got to where we are right now, by challenging what is said.

       If you simply can't be bothered by anyone possibly showing you another side to your claims, do you even consider yourself a CT, or do you just consider yourself crazy?

       Here's a quote FRESHLY made from you:

       "You're probably sitting in your lonely basement rubbing your orange covered dick while you stuff Cheetos in your fat mouth just because you get off on trolling these boards. Is distracting people from reading about possible truth the only way you can get yourself off these days?"

       Way to take my quoted post out of context. As i have said before, you DO NOT post comments to strike up any type of debate or bring awareness. You straight up attack threads...non stop. You like playing this "I'm just and innocent conspiracy theorist like the rest of you" card. FUCK THAT!! You are here for one reason and one reason only and that is to do what i have posted about here in this post. You've been caught man, give up.

       I note that biggles uses terms like 'tin-foil hat' and 'sensationalist', and typical troll disparagement statements like 'don't take it so personally' to deflect that his comments ARE attacks.  This troll persona positions himself as a 'just-folks' type but he sure comes across as a pro wearing a mask. He could certainly just be someone with a superiority complex but I have a funny feeling he's not just that, he feels like a shill with a cover persona. From his pro-nuclear posts in Fukushima discussions, deflecting criticism of nuclear utility and government, I suspect him as a right-wing oriented troll or a hired gun for use on social media. They are thick and heavy in r/conspiracy, trying to dampen all sorts of discussions.

       Nice try.

      <p>
       I quote you directly:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         According to everything I've looked up (which is obviously a huge plot to keep everyone in the dark) that scenario is exaggerated by people who don't understand science.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So you're more of an expert than the number of scientists who've commented on the effects of release of Fukushima radiation on the world, if the fuel pool collapsed and reaches fusion state? And you know more than the people who are desperately trying to keep the pool from overheating and fusing?  And you disparage people who are worried about the genuine possibility of a global disaster?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you're not a shill, you behave like one. You want a fight, I'm patient and loaded with ammo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Added: okay, you wanted this:  in effect you're calling Senator Ron Wyden, who VISITED the site and discussed it with scientists, a liar and alarmist who doesn't understand science like you do. I think he has far more credibility than you. Let's see your nuclear technology credentials. MIT? Nope. Caltech? Nope. DeVry? Not even DeVry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's not argue credibility any more.

       I never said that..

       "So you're more of an expert than the number of scientists who've commented on the effects of release of Fukushima radiation on the world, if the fuel pool collapsed and reaches fusion state?"
      </p>
      <p>
       This comment, is what I said is exaggerated. It's basically playing out all the WORST case scenario circumstances happening.. It's the equivalent of knowing that at any point we could get struck by a humanity-wiping out asteroid, and being worried about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       They know Fukushima is in a fucked state, and they know they need to fix it, and they're being heavily pressured from numerous regions around the world to act quicker.
      </p>
      <p>
       I said everything everything I've looked up says that the scenario that people are saying is the "end of humanity" is an exaggeration. Care to prove me wrong? Because that's all I said.
      </p>
      <p>
       "And you disparage people who are worried about the genuine possibility of a global disaster?"
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't disparage people who are worried about the genuine possibility of a disaster, I disparage people from looking into sites that intentionally scare and fear-mongering people into worrying about it as if it is a likely outcome. That's the difference, which I don't know how isn't being portrayed, as it is what I've stated probably close to 100 times at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not backtracking at all, I've been saying the same things the entire time, people just read a couple sentences and deduce what they will from the rest of my post.

      <p>
       "You want a fight, I'm patient and loaded with ammo."

       I would also like to note that I did say in my post, and once again will say, that I do not disagree that there are posts among mine that I simply discredit what someone says, or don't leave much open to discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm saying is, having some posts like that, what makes that unique to me? HomeGrownTerran is a well known poster around here, he even made an entire thread about people making bullshit posts.. It's not uncommon to see the highest rated comment in a thread, something that disagrees with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       To say that "every" one of my posts is that is extreme and if you really think I don't ever have any discussion with anyone, you should really look through my post history instead of making sweeping claims based on your personal feelings towards me.
      </p>
      <p>
       So please, don't just ignore parts of my post and continue to attack me, it's getting really old. And for someone who is so distraught at the fact that you think I don't enjoy civil discussion, you should really look at how you're posting to me, and how I'm posting to you.

       Because the typical users who come out with racism/anti-semitism were out and about, so as a disgusted viewer, I made my plea. That can be seen as aggressive, but is that unique to just me? Not even close, as even 9000Sins has admitted that there are posters who are aggressively racist all over the place, but as a moderator, you can't really do anything about that.

      <p>
       We have the TSA thread, where I had plenty of civil discussion with whom I believe is a veteran, where we actually just discussed both sides of our views, and I learned quite a bit from him, as I'm sure he did from me.. So that being my next thread, surely can't be it.

       I'm not going to disagree with you heavily here. I don't like sensationalist and nonsensical posts in this sub, not many people do. If I see something that rings the bells that it is most likely bullshit, I will happily say something against it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not "playing a card" by saying I'm a CT, I just think there's a large difference between being a CT, and just being aggressively paranoid, which is why I think you are.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are certainly threads where I just attempt to dismiss what others are saying, but, find me a user that doesn't do that. You're certainly guilty of that, and by golly are you guilty of just blindly attacking someone for disagreeing with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can go through every single post in my posting history if you want, and I'm positive you will find posts where I just downright disagree with someone and don't leave much open to discussion. But again, that is not something that is unique to just me, and certainly not unique to just me in this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to make such ignorant comments like "I never agree with anything, and I disagree with everything" once again, quoting you.. That is incredibly daft. You can not state that "everything" I do falls under a category, if I can within seconds provide you examples of what I do that doesn't fall under that category. I think you're just a little too upset with this whole situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind with things like this: "NUMEROUS times in that short period for both trolling and trying to downplay peoples posts as being extremist or some kind of wacko idea."
      </p>
      <p>
       And topics where "There isn't much to debate" duly note that I'm typically just in a one on one engagement with one other person.. Similar to today, which caused you to make this thread. I saw an article that looked like bullshit, on a website that looked like more bullshit, and then you and someone else both started attacking me, not trying to discuss anything but just from square one calling me a shill. You will notice that in my posting history, there are many threads like that where I simply don't have anything better to do, and will have a long back and forth with one person, not unlike what we did today:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Is a thread similar to our situation here, I strongly recommend you read our conversation but how it ended, as oppose to how you have chosen to have things escalate between the two of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because I disagree with you, doesn't mean I'm on a different side, it just means I disagree with YOU.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please, stop taking things so personally.

      <p>
       Also, just out of curiosity, what am I taking out of context with:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Way to take my quoted post out of context."
      </p>
      <p>
       This?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because I said a fresh quote from you, and it was this:
      </p>
      <p>
       "You're probably sitting in your lonely basement rubbing your orange covered dick while you stuff Cheetos in your fat mouth just because you get off on trolling these boards. Is distracting people from reading about possible truth the only way you can get yourself off these days?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Did I take that out of context somehow? Please, let me know the proper context you meant with that.

       Well I just read a few days of biggle's post history and I'm ready to give my analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bigglesxyz is a real person, not a paid shill. He is also kind of a douchebag and he is fond of appealing to the unknowable nature of reality in the same paragraph that he pronounces it's actual nature. He sees himself as the voice of reason and thus each denial feeds his own ego. That makes him insufferable to some people here for obvious reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, he is also correct sometimes, and does a good job of keeping composure. This does makes for a very good troll and I should know ;). He is a smart person, but not quite as smart as he thinks! For the record dude I am cool with you and I'll be happy to spar it out some day if we end up on different sides of an issue I care about. Cheers!

       Well, in your exchange with him over Kony/Uganda/warmongering, he was the one who made sense in comment after comment, whereas you were just making accusations about things he never said or implied.

       How is what I just said trolling? I've been around the gaming community since '97 and I've never seen the word used so loosely.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Racism is vile indeed, but banning people based on ideology is not our style. They should be downvoted, and the majority of users do downvote blatantly racist comments and posts. We have a free speech policy, and we don't ban based on things like racism. Sorry."
      </p>
      <p>
       Is something I totally get, I actually mentioned that in a couple posts when people ask about that guy. It's a forum, the guy has the right to say whatever he wants, and I understand that. Reddit is a giant pool of different subs, I find new ones every day that excite me, and make me shake my head, but I also have the freedom to not look at them, I understand 100%.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you couldn't see that you posting your comment, in this thread which is directed completely towards me, that it would have an implication that you're agreeing with the topic? Maybe it's the defensive nature I've procured from the thread itself, but I do think if you look at this non-objectively that your comment could be seen as an implication that you agree with the topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also don't see how my comment "confirms a rumor" unless I'm drastically underestimating what the term troll has turned into..

       I'm just unbelievably confused. This sub seems to be just full of those who believe that if you don't agree with their position, that you're a shill, or you're on their side..
      </p>
      <p>
       It's crazy because when I see people speaking so negatively about /conspiracy in politics, news, worldnews, etc, it really frustrates me, because conspiracies do happen, and major ones have been found even in just the last couple decades.. but then I see how people act here, almost like a cult, where you're shunned if you even question the status quo, it's really weird to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, you couldn't possibly be someone who believes that conspiracies happen and are happening, but not everything is a conspiracy.

       Listen man, I know this post has cut pretty deep. What i want you to realize, and what you SHOULD already have realized, is that how you conduct yourself...even in an anonymous way where you can act any way you want, will effect the people who read your statements and will obviously label you in a certain light.
      </p>
      <p>
       If i was new to reddit and decided that a majority of my comments are going to be, ONE: super negative, TWO: saying that a certain subject is wrong without providing any details as to why OR proof as to why, THREE: I only did this in sub-reddits where it is known that people are trying to spread some tiny bit of truth in the midst of battling lies from main stream new media.......You can sure as hell bet that people are going to call me a troll.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you aren't a troll, but your approach to commenting on peoples posts sure does reflect a trollish mentality. Kinda like the Dave Chappelle joke about the lady wearing slutty clothes and getting pissed off when people accuse her of being a slut, "you might not be a slut...but your wearing a sluts uniform".
      </p>

       A statement was made by the moderator. A 100% contradictory statement was then made by the moderator. Were there other reasons? Maybe. If there was another reason that person was banned, it wasn't given by the moderator. Is "degree of racism" a factor? Maybe. That wasn't part of the moderator's comment(s).
      </p>
      <p>
       Moderators can do what they like. But pointing out inconsistencies in their rationale is something this subreddit should do more often, maybe, given it's nature...
