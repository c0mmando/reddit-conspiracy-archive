       My friend linked me to some somewhat popular posts about my uncle Ben in r/conspiracy just wondering if anyone has any questions about him or whatever.  I'll take a pic with him if anyone needs proof, lol pretty sure r/conspiracy will demand proof.  It's hella weird reading people's comments about my family history and shit, I can set the record straight.  I'm his younger brothers son fyi..

       I suspect that your uncle is being toyed with by paid actors employed by intelligence forces. Because they know your uncle is physically harmless (a man of peace, although a very agitated and serious one), they can hire actors from any country in the world to play the role of liaison from "Gnostic Illuminati sect of Country X", legitimate heir -in-hiding of country Z.

       How carefully has he vetted the identity of this guy Alexander Bullshitterov, anyway?

       Look I have no idea, I always tell ben I beleive what I sees and he says thats a good policy.  Really though? How many paid actors would actually be working for intelligence forces?  Anyway I have some video editing shit to do at the moment.  I didn't realize this would get so many responses, I'll take a pic with him today with a peice of paper saying reddit on it or some shit lol.

       Can you ask him why these all-powerful organizations can't afford even remotely decent video equipment? It seems that if they are who they claim to be they are almost intentionally making themselves look illegitimate. I can't show any videos of Fulford's to anyone even remotely skeptical or else they bust out laughing.

       his weekly internet show is done in a pretty decent little studio,  he's more a writer than a video guy.  I understand why people might laugh at some videos of his, but homeboy can speak fluent japanese spanish and french and is learning cantonese i believe and he has published like 30 books here in japan.

       I think i speak for many who are interested in this subject matter. We love the optimism of the "mass arrest" notion of the elite, and at the same time we are waiting for it to come to its fruition. When and how will we know that this is true, and how do we know Ben isnt being fed false info to serve the elite through pacifying those of us who want real change?

       well it may be only in malaysia, but its something.  He told me that on the surface things will seem to be at a stalemate for the month of may.  Look at banking news, some weird shit is definitley happening, a US bank was recently put into control of a state owned chinese bank for the first time ever.

       Yeah that's what I was talking about. I meant that the Chinese bank would be taking over the US bank. I think the way you worded it in your previous comment was a bit confusing. Would you mind looking at my other post in this thread and answering some questions?

       I x-posted for you. Assuming you're not a hoax, it's about all I can do for you and your uncle. See:

       The rest is up to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Assuming your uncle is going to let you follow through answering some of these questions, I'm going to assume you can figure out how to deal with that on your own - you appear to know reddit well enough. Feel free to contact the moderators if you need any assistance, or whatever. A lot of assumptions, I know, but... at some point I have to turn you loose to the pitchfork bearing mob, if you get my drift. Good luck. - Peace.

       Having given this sufficient thought, the only thing that is going to convince me that you are who you say you are is if Ben mentions it in his blog in the next few days, as an after-the-fact verification.

       What would make it truly spectacular, in my opinion, would be if he'd actually let you answer some of the questions here. I'm still thinking Alexander Myassimov.

       Please verify this with a photo and ask him to do an official IAMA here! I have been following you uncle's work for some time and would absolutely jump on the chance to get things "straight from the horse's mouth" so to speak. Reddit has a lot of people on it, and an interview here would really solidify some people around what he's been saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       My immediate question is in regards to the army of ninjas that are currently at ready, and what it has to do with Daikaku Chodoin. Were these claims meant to be literal or were they hyperbole? I know someone who was married to a world-classed kick boxer for a while and she claims Chodoin is pretty much a guy in charge of a bunch of for-profit "belt factories" I would like some verification to his credentials. It would help clear up some doubts I have about other claims that are made.

       I don't think he's gonna do an ama, when he's not here writing his blog or another book, he's out meeting all sorts of characters, I'll ask though. I think you're right though, he's a lot more articulate when answering questions one on one.

       He is best known among the public for his claim that HAARP was the cause of the Japanese earthquake and tsunami along with his claim that the same technique would be used to erupt Mt. Fuji with a specific date attached. I've long wondered what lead him to the conclusion that a radar array could affect seismic shifts. Also, seeing as how nothing happened on the appointed day with Mt. Fuji (or since) could he walk us through the evidence he used to make that assertion?

       I will ask him first thing in the morning.  What he told me is that some sort of nuclear device was drilled into the ocean floor.  I have met one of his contacts (an ex-smuggler) who told me that he actually saw this bomb or whatever it was being smuggled into the country (in a shipment of drugs if I remember correctly) and that he went to the police to tell them he had seen a nuke being smuggled into the country and they arrested him for saying this.

       Oh and ben said that they countered the threat of erupting Fuji by saying that they would sink the african island la palma if Fuji was forcibley erupted.  Sinking la palma would cause a big ass tsunami that would hit the US.  He tries to promote peace and diplomacy, but you can't reason with mass murderers.

       Yeah, I would like to talk to Ben Fulford about R.C.A and Tesla's L.M.D and the military government intervention in 1914 before World War I.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure if Fulford is the man he appears to be (prophecising nuclear fallout in Japan, it seems.....) then he will be able to answer my questions, and in general, help the cause of the R.C.A Eric Dollard Bolinas Suppression.

       Alright I'll ask him in the morning. One thing I know is that the Fulford family mansion where my grandpa grew up is a very cool place.  It's in Brockeville Ontario and I've been there many times (it was made into a historic site/museam dealy by my great uncle). Prime minister mackenzie king used to have sceances with his dead mother in one of the rooms.  I'm broke as a joke so it kinda hurts walking through this mansion with all this ridiculously expensive shit, but it is really really cool.  The spookiest thing is the graveyard in Brockeville, every 3rd gravestone or so has a freemason compass on it and there were also a lot of graves of members of some secret society called the something something fellows (can't remember exactly).  Brockeville used to be a hub for canadian high society.  Seeing those gravestones was a serious wtf moment for me, like, holy shit here's proof etched in stone that influential rich people actually do belong to secret societies.

       I can tell you and your uncle what the compasses represent. The compass on the grave is to detect magnets. They are part of the ancient mysteries and they believe they are emitted into outer space when they die. The compass represents this secret ;)

       I have a site called conspiracy co if you want to see more about this sort of thing. A real wonderful thing to have ran into you :) I cannot emphasise the importance of RCA and Eric dollard/Tesla suppression to Fulford, and humanity as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
       He must know a lot about the Tesla suppression given what happened to his grandad right? Why doesnt he speak about it more!! So important!!! :) Thanks again , so great. I promise with every fibre of my being that R.C.A eric Dollard and Tesla suppression is a very important subject to Fulford, and his family history, I am sure he must be somewhat aware :) Would

       I see more things being reported that point towards bad things happening rather than good. I see an imminent financial collapse with the situation in Greece causing the Euro to fall, followed by the dollar, followed by massive civil unrest, followed by the opening of the FEMA camps for pretty much everyone that makes any sudden moves. What does Ben think about that? I know he claims a lot of the mass arrests are going to happen soon, but when are we going to be hearing about it on TV? I'm very anxious for something significant to happen before financial doom. Also, please ask him about the NATO summit in Chicago and things happening around that date. The military drills of Russian troops in the US in Utah and Colorado will be happening at the same time. I've heard that they may be taking over Denver Int'l. Airport and a CIA base or something. And what is his position on Putin? He seems to have a less-than-friendly feeling about the US lately, which is worrisome. Finally, what does he think about UFO disclosure? I'm sure that if his claims are true that all will be revealed after the mass arrests. What are some of his other predictions for the future? What will happen after the arrests? After the new currency? After the new technology is revealed? What does he think will happen when people learn that they have been oppressed and lied to for centuries by sociopaths? How does he think the world would react to such news?

       You got a lot of questions there.  What I know is that key factions of the CIA have basically said they are sick of corruption, torture and murder and they have gone "rogue".  Many of them have decided to start working for the greater good of humanity.  I've been told that there are also key people in the Pentagon who are basically good guys.  I think you can relax a bit.  Nobody's getting sent to any FEMA gulags.

       Thanks for the response, I've heard about these Pentagon insiders elsewhere as well. 
If nothing happens of any significance in the coming months, would that effect your opinion of your uncle in any way?

       Significant things have been happening,  I always used to take ben with a lick of salt and a shot of tequila so to speak, but recently strange things have been happening.  The media is less opposed to criticism of Israel, Latin American leaders have said they will no longer support the American war on drugs, the leader of the IMF resigned earlier this year.  Even if his timing is off, I still think that ultimately things are changing for the better.  There are more young and well-informed people than there ever have been, somethings gotta give.

       Why are there so many conflicting reports about what he is saying regarding radioactivity in Japan as compared to the rest of the majority of alternative media? What is his take on this "Drake" character? Does he know about CAFR's?

       He says the radioactivity is being played up by the media, I'm inclined to believe thats true.  The people who were concerned bought there own geigo meters and nobody has found radiation in Tokyo, I'm sure there is some radiation in fukushima, but i think the idea was to make japan seem like an irradiated mess to curb tourism and fuck with its economy a bit.

       Word, can you ask him about Drake? Or ask him if he thinks anything is going to go down at the NATO meeting in a week. Bill Woods recently came out with a video saying that something huge was going to happen in Chicago next week, but really, who the fuck is Bill Woods?

       It seems they relate a lot.  I've been told it's the Chicago mob that ultimately decided on Romney as the next President.  I don't think they are taking orders from anyone in Italy, but I don't know.

       Yes good question.  People here who are noid have been buying geigo meters like hot cakes, there's no radiation here at least, certainly not a good reason to not come to japan.  I've been eating microwave rice from fukushima, so if my fingernails fall out I'll let you know.

       Not sure how to say this without seeming rude.  Is there any chance that your uncle is being targeted in some way. The reason I ask is that he does not look healthy in his eyes?  Perhaps this is easily explainable in the context of pressure and stress he encounters but just the same I was wondering.
