       A few weeks ago, somebody on here pointed out an obvious conspiracy here about how there are people on this site trying to portray George W. Bush as a good guy, today another new user (hours old account) posts this brocolli shit about his dad and everybody is eating it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something smells bad, and it isn't the brocolli.

       I think I've posted 2 times asking about this. Nobody really has any answers other than it's because they are gonna ease Jeb into the main stage pretty soon, which isn't, by a long shot, the craziest notion I've ever heard.

       I grew up in FL, a lot of the time that he was there. Weird shit happened all the time. I can't remember anything specifically, but I do remember thinking, "Huh...that's fucking odd." I was young and not invested in politics that much

       I was thinking the same thing as well.  The way I see it, as a Poli Sci major (in a simplified and somewhat hyperbolic manner):
      </p>
      <p>
       GOP: "Well, Romney got most of the delegates, but he really isn't that electable.  The people see him as the rich and out-of-touch douche he is and let's be honest, he won't be able to defeat Obama.  Now, people saw W. as the kind of guy they'd like to have a beer with--he was much more relate-able to the masses.  Therefore let's get another Bush in the Whitehouse.  Jeb could portray himself as distancing from his brother's ideals, but we'll know the truth."
      </p>
      <p>
       I dunno if that's exactly what's going to happen, but that's JMHO.

       I didn't notice shit. I thought the love affair was with Obama. If he appeals the federal judge's decision to block the NDAA, I wonder what the liberals who think he

       You have to wonder if they are trying to boost the bush family image. I read an article recently based on a Russian foreign ministry paper about kissenger and Jeb bush's visit to china where kissenger apparently told the Chinese president that Jeb bush was to be the next us president.

       It is a concerted effort to portray the family as a force of good, when in fact, the Bush family is responsible for the enactments of illegal wars and theft.
      </p>

       It is subtle conditioning, massaging the mind to accept these corrupt and evil people as "one of us".

       So most people opposing the thread  have saved their time by simply clicking downvote and walking away. Probably to do something more constructive, rather than write in the comments. But by looking at those figures you can tell just under the majority of people do not like stories about Bush and broccoli

       I couldn't stand the man while he was in office, but having worked in the humanitarian sector, I appreciated his strong convictions and line on AIDS in Africa.  Believe it or not, he and his wife are probably personally responsible for breaking the back of the disease.

       Okay seriously, is there a sub that discusses real conspiracies? This one almost seems like almost some run-on joke about who can make the craziest story about some of the most non-conspiracy related story.

       I've also noticed the pro George Bush articles lately.  Its a bit strange when he was close to universally loathed and then he is suddenly cool because of simple anecdotal commentary.  We had years to form our opinions that he is a mother fucker.  Now there are these clever little things about him that we didn't know that are being brought to our attention in quick succession.  Sounds bullshit to me.

       Agreed. There is definitely right-wing subversion afoot. The Bush make-over is to try and soften the peoples memories of a war-crime committing goofball in hopes they forget what his party caused (Bush was an electable face - his cronies are the ones with real decision making power - and when they're not in power they mosey over to Fox News to try and scare people into voting for their guy again). I'm personally of the opinion that illumanati "the left and right are all the same paradigm" conspiracies are conservative voter suppression/radicalization propaganda funded by the military industrial complex, big banks and certain elements of the religious right to suppress  change to the system and continue milk every dollar possible out of the peons.

       So who decides what conspiracies are "real"?  I think this is a totally legitimate conspiracy, since I have 'un-programmed' myself from the traditional (loaded with bias) meaning and adopted the actual definition.

       Thing that should scare everybody, these "manipulative" posts are not done by fools. They are well engineered. There is no chance we can catch them all, as many will be much more subtle. I'm not so worried about conspiracy being infiltrated (due to constant questioning) but most of the other sub's are saturated.

       I am pretty sure Jeb Bush and his team doesn't care about reddit and I doubt they would spend time trying to court your vote. Conspiracy's paranoid self-importance is comical. There is no conspiracy and even if there was they wouldn't care about nobodies like everyone posting here including myself.

       You must be one of them, with your quasi-intellectual, seemingly objective, obviously ultra right wing propaganda agenda! Why do you question our suspicions? What have you got to hide?

       I don't understand why you're just kidding.
A conservative propaganda campaign is much more plausible than half of the crackpot shit on this board.

       If you want to take the Internet by storm then reddit is ground zero for the assault.  I don't know if you have noticed but there have been many articles written about the power of reddit.  Many people (not just on reddit) attribute the defeat of SOPA in large part due to the reddit community.

       Agreed. There is definitely right-wing subversion afoot. The Bush make-over is to try and soften the peoples memories of a war-crime committing goofball in hopes they forget what his party caused (Bush was an electable face - his cronies are the ones with real decision making power - and when they're not in power they mosey over to Fox News to try and scare people into voting for their guy again). I'm personally of the opinion that illumanati "the left and right are all the same paradigm" conspiracies are conservative voter suppression/radicalization propaganda funded by the military industrial complex, big banks and certain elements of the religious right to suppress  change to the system and continue milk every dollar possible out of the peons.

       Beware of people preaching the value of God, Guns and Gold. These are people that profit off of fears of the apocalypse...
