<p>A few weeks ago, somebody on here pointed out an obvious conspiracy here about how there are people on this site trying to portray George W. Bush as a good guy, today another new user (hours old account) posts this brocolli shit about his dad and everybody is eating it up.</p>

<p>Something smells bad, and it isn&#39;t the brocolli.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking the same thing as well.  The way I see it, as a Poli Sci major (in a simplified and somewhat hyperbolic manner):</p>

<p>GOP: &quot;Well, Romney got most of the delegates, but he really isn&#39;t that electable.  The people see him as the rich and out-of-touch douche he is and let&#39;s be honest, he won&#39;t be able to defeat Obama.  Now, people saw W. as the kind of guy they&#39;d like to have a beer with--he was much more relate-able to the masses.  Therefore let&#39;s get another Bush in the Whitehouse.  Jeb could portray himself as distancing from his brother&#39;s ideals, but we&#39;ll know the truth.&quot;</p>

<p>I dunno if that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s going to happen, but that&#39;s JMHO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow thanks for the tips on how to get votes, off to lick <em>Bush</em></p>

<p>But on a serious note here are the figures at midday (GMT) Friday on the thread</p>

<p>9,143 up votes 7,622 down votes</p>

<p>So most people opposing the thread  have saved their time by simply clicking downvote and walking away. Probably to do something more constructive, rather than write in the comments. But by looking at those figures you can tell just under the majority of people do not like stories about Bush and broccoli </p>

Its a bit strange when he was close to universally loathed and then he is suddenly cool because of simple anecdotal commentary.  We had years to form our opinions that he is a mother fucker.

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. There is definitely right-wing subversion afoot. The Bush make-over is to try and soften the peoples memories of a war-crime committing goofball in hopes they forget what his party caused (Bush was an electable face - his cronies are the ones with real decision making power - and when they&#39;re not in power they mosey over to Fox News to try and scare people into voting for their guy again). I&#39;m personally of the opinion that illumanati &quot;the left and right are all the same paradigm&quot; conspiracies are conservative voter suppression/radicalization propaganda funded by the military industrial complex, big banks and certain elements of the religious right to suppress  change to the system and continue milk every dollar possible out of the peons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. There is definitely right-wing subversion afoot. The Bush make-over is to try and soften the peoples memories of a war-crime committing goofball in hopes they forget what his party caused (Bush was an electable face - his cronies are the ones with real decision making power - and when they&#39;re not in power they mosey over to Fox News to try and scare people into voting for their guy again). I&#39;m personally of the opinion that illumanati &quot;the left and right are all the same paradigm&quot; conspiracies are conservative voter suppression/radicalization propaganda funded by the military industrial complex, big banks and certain elements of the religious right to suppress  change to the system and continue milk every dollar possible out of the peons.</p>

<p>Beware of people preaching the value of God, Guns and Gold. These are people that profit off of fears of the apocalypse...</p>
