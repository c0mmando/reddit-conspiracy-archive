       What a crock. I have been keeping up with the likes of Fulford, Wilcock, this new goon Drake etc since they basically started writing (minus Wilcock) and the new theme is that there are mass arrests that will free humanity that will happen in the next "few days". In fact, Bill Wood (who, in my personal opinion, is the most full of shit) said that the arrests were to happen at the NATO meeting that just passed, which obviously did not happen. There is always something that is going to happen in the next week or month or 90 days that never, ever happens the way they promise their "intel" told them it would.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I just needed to rant about these complete disinfo-mongers who have fooled me for the last time. Does anyone else have similar revelations regarding this situation? Does anyone even know what I'm talking about?

       I agree about Ben Fulford.

       Let's keep in mind that he believes we'll be saved by an army of ninjas.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will not be saved by some outside force.

       We have to save ourselves. We have to take a stand sooner or later.

       Fulford and company are continuing a scam that has been  being played since the year 2000.
      </p>
      <p>
       This early version was called NESARA, the  National Economic Security and Reformation Act. A secret law that was to be  announced any day now.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main spokesperson  for NESARA was Shaini Goodwin  who called herself the Dove of Oneness
      </p>
      <p>
       She has died
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.thenewstribune.com/2010/06/15/1227110/dove-of-oneness-has-left-our-earth.html">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a picture of her here.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       She spent years promising arrests of world power players, debt forgiveness, which would produce massive prosperity  and the discontinuance of corrupt corporate, banking and governmental  practices. She always kept the events she promised just out of reach.
      </p>
      <p>
       She'd say NESARA would be announced  in the next few days, next week, we are having technical difficulties but they are just going to last a short time....
      </p>
      <p>
       Rinse and repeat, for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       In her absence Fulford and friends have adapted the same game with a new smell.
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't seem to think it matters that Shaini Goodwin The Dove of Oneness, died broke.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they can do it better.
      </p>
      <p>
       To show a connection between the NESARA scam and Fulford all I have is this Fulford article which has a prominent ad that mentions The Dove of  Oneness and NESARA.
