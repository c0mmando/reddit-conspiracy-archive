       Congratulations, you figured it out. Debt slavery has all sorts of benefits for the banks and the government. It insures that young people don't become political radicals -- they can't afford to, they need to get a job to pay off their student loans. It insures that the population of a region stays in that region -- when you get a good job you can't afford to casually give it up, especially because of the health benefits you would be losing. In short, it insures that you will become a worker bee in the establishment hive from the day you leave college until the day you retire (unless you die of stress first). And I should add, it insures that you never have any saved money, which means you need to borrow from the banks for any major purchase, and you run up credit card debts as well, being always short on savings. Did I mention that the people responsible for the present system of debt slavery should all be burned alive?

       I didn't say there weren't still very real grievances regarding British rule in Ireland or that people shouldn't rise up against their slave masters.  I'm just saying that historically, unrest often occurs after a relative loosening of repression and improvement in material conditions.  If you want to ignore history that's fine, but this isn't some theory I just cooked up, there are whole books written about this issue.

       Stability isnt solely improvement, it can also mean non recessionary times, little growth little decline, after the famine the home rule period began in Ireland which was ultimately the cause of the rising, and the home rule movement was inspired by....you guessed it....the very very harsh conditions during the famine (which interesting enough is speculated as a really old psyop if you beleive Karl Marx but that's a whole other issue all together)
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is you can read all the books you want proving something they initially set out to prove but it doesn't make it fact, i really don't beleive you done research on the point i made and i don't blame you, but that's also besides the point because i was realistically just being snide originally, but yea i just got a little annoyed when you said you done research which backs your point cause its my history, my heritage and my culture and i know it inside out
      </p>
      <p>
       (Im guessing your American so a little analogy for you, picture telling an angry black man his own history wrongly, its exactly the same as telling an Irish man his history wrongly)
      </p>
      <p>
       But yea, revolutions could generally occur during a time of improvement but revolutions aren't spontaneous and the roots always go back to the time the really harsh times

       Marx was discussing capatalism and he breifly mentioned that the British empire didn't support us and let us starve in order to keep us demoralized and subservient but personally i don't know maybe the British just didn't have enough food to share.....so pretty much half the country died or emigrated, this is in his manifesto, i probably didn't get his point accross very well its been awhile since i read it

       The narrative of history certified by the elite is seldom the reality of historical events. I wonder if the French Revolution took place during a period of improving conditions as well? I wouldn't doubt it.

       Some would argue that the French Revolution represented the rising to prominence of the bourgeoisie merchant class which was only possible because of the erosion of feudalism.  So yes, they were able to revolt because they were no longer successfully repressed serfs, there had been an increase in freedom and prosperity since the late middle ages.

       The problem is usury, not debt.  A dollar bill, even if it isn't issued into existence with interest like the federal reserve does now, is still a system of "credit" (or debt) wherein the holder expects to be able to exchange it for something of value.
      </p>
      <p>
       The exchange system breaks down when you introduce usury.  That's where you get these people saying things about "mathematically impossible" to pay off, etc.  The opposition to usury from Christianity to Islam to Confucianism - most people through much of time - is very well founded indeed.

       The problem is both usury and debt. There is almost always a measure of usury involved in debt, and if you avoid debt, you avoid usury.

       kids in this country (and all over hte first world) are brainwashed from birth that career = life.  And to acquire said career, you MUST go to college.  Talking kids into signing the next 10+ years of your life away at age 18 is disgusting in my opinion

       Yes.  They train you in public school to be an obedient learner and worker.  Then they ship you off to college, tell you to incur debt, which you then need to work to pay off.

       Our money is debt.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Federal Reserve defines the dollar notes they distribute  as  'debt instruments' and they are correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       They loan out each and every dollar at interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually they collect much more than a dollar for each dollar loaned but that interest is never created so it can't be repaid,   interest money can only come from more loans,  therefore  ever increasing debt is assured.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, consider this, If each dollar loaned out by the FED  is spent on average around once a week the total taxes collected on each dollar far exceeds  a dollar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just considering state sales taxes  of  perhaps 7%, the state sales taxes  on each individual dollar  would come to  $3.64 a year.

       Left school in 98.  Have not willingly paid a dime.  Was garnished for a year in 2004 (left job) they caught up with me again in 2010 and had me for bout a year before that loan was paid off.  The most that's going to happen is that they will garnish up to 12% (i believe) and will take your tax return. Adjust your w4 exemptions so that you break as close to even or owe them, better you owe them a small amount than them take yours.  They will not put you in prison.

       Its your fault. You can't blame someone offering you a loan, for you taking it.
      </p>

       You can blame the fractional reserve banking for contributing to the situation, but ultimately you took the loan, you made the decision, you bear the consequences.

       Taxation is real slavery.
The government will take a percentage of someone's income forcefully, income some person worked for. Imagine they took 100hours worth of money that person got for working. That's 100 hours of slave labor. Also imagine if that person got to keep all of his income, he might not take as many loans as he previously might have because he'd have more money.

       We pretty much are screwed and want turned me more towards radical politics like Anarchism after seeing that governments and capitalist have none of the people's lives as their priority. So I say we overthrow the whole system and start a new one based on our modern morals. Trying to get reforms and negotiate with the ruling class has never worked.

       Very true, but I do get enough in federal grants to pay for my tution and classes both. The loans are necessarily required people are just stupid at that age and take the loans and blow it not caring about or thinking about the consequences.

       My Dad and Step-mothers salaries were taken into account (despite neither of them actually contributing) when deciding if I could get grants, because I lived at home. I was not elligible because they made too much (again:despite them not contributing any of this money). So, not everyone is in your shoes. It's not as simple for everyone as you would apparently like to believe.

       That has nothing to do with what I was saying. My point was their salaries made it so I was unable to get grants, therefore I had to get loans If I wanted to further my education. Also, Step-mom payed for Step-sisters Schooling. I had a free roof over my head (which I always appreciated), but payed for everything else I consumed myself.

       it think it's much cheaper to steal somebody's identity than to try to pay off your student loans.
      </p>
      <p>
       im writing a hollywood script of a dark horror comedy where a guy finds a suicided guy and steals his identity to escape the horrors of having to pay back student loans,  only the catch is that the suicide guy killed himself for a reason, to escape the mafia's death threats toward his family regarding a much larger gambling debt he owes.
      </p>
      <p>
       and dark hilarity ensues when the mafia members go after the original college debt burdened guy....over a mistaken identity, kinda like that movie big lebowski.

       Sounds like a good plot. I wish you good luck placing your script. I can see this idea being made into a pretty interesting thriller. A word of advice -- it's not wise to talk about writing projects before they have been completed and sold. Not only can someone else use your idea, but the universe conspires to insure that any writing project talked about before it is sold never gets sold. But maybe you'll  beat the whammy.

       Although its not voluntary anymore. You pretty much have to take a loan to get something like a car because majority of people are underpaid an overworked to save. The ruling class has trapped the people into a system of debt and it's exactly how they like it.

       Much of debt slavery is driven by false expectations created by advertising and various forms of propaganda. We have all been trained to
       <em>
        expect
       </em>
       to spend our entire lives in debt. That conditioning is hard to resist, although it can be done.

       That is still voluntary. You don't have to go to college. You don't have to buy a car. I have neither and make plenty of money, enough to buy a car now outright. Yes, it is more difficult, but still voluntary. Calling it slavery is quite the stretch and a disservice to actual enslaved people around the world.

       So you are choosing slavery?

       I dont know what your trying to say. You made a choice to accept bad loans for college. There are many ways to pay for college and cars. If you cant afford something and need a loan dont accept a bad loan you know will cost you more in the end. 
You have accepted that you wanted that debt, should have made wiser decisions.

       No what I am saying is nobody has a choice to choose whether they take loans or not or what society they live in. You automatically told to accept an evil state-capitalistic political economy in which all people are subjected to having to sell your time, body and labor to a ruling class in order to survive. That's hardly freedom. And things that are necessary and cost so much you have to take loans out, it's predatory capitalism and it's how the ruling elite want it. To have everyone trapped into a system of debt.

       You're forgetting the brain-washing that goes on to train everyone to accept the inevitability of large debt and heavy interest payments. Almost nobody can resist that brain-washing, and almost nobody has. To blame them for getting into debt is similar to blaming people for smoking in the 1940s when every billboard urged everyone to smoke.

       I am willing to bet you are right. But that doesn't mean debt isn't necessary at this time.

       Can you even theorize another way? Nobody before you has formulated a successful way to replace debt + money in society, and i doubt anyone will.

       You've drunk the Kool-Aid. Usury is not necessary. Muslims don't use it. Predatory interest rates are certainly not necessary. The Federal Reserve system is not necessary.

       Are you daft? I'm well aware these things aren't necessary. But I'm telling you now, from a practical standpoint, debt is absolutely necessary for how society is structured however fundamentally flawed that structuring may be.

       How exactly do student loans keep someone from becoming a political radical?

       Yes.  They train you in public school to be an obedient learner and worker.  Then they ship you off to college, tell you to incur debt, which you then need to work to pay off.
