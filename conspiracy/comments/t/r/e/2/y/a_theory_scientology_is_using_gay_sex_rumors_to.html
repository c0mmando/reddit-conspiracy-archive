<p>IMO, he is gay and the events with masseurs have happened, but he&#39;s managed to keep them a secret. Now that he wants to leave the church because of many things, his son&#39;s death stand out as a reason, the church is trying to smear him/his career. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Defendant began screaming at Plaintiff, telling Plaintiff how selfish he was; that Defendant got to where he is now due to sexual favors he had performed when he was in his Welcome Back, Kotter days; and that Hollywood is controlled by homosexual Jewish men who expect favors in return for sexual activity. Defendant then went on to say how he had done things in his past that would make most people throw up.&quot;</p>

<p>Defendant explained when he started that he wasn&#39;t even gay and that the taste of &#39;cum&#39; would make him gag. Defendant also said that he was smart enough to learn to enjoy it, and when he began to make millions of dollars, that it all became well worth it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Defendant further explained that the high class in this world always favor same-sex relationships; that sex with beautiful, fit men is actually more intense; and if Plaintiff would just be open-minded enough to let it happen, he would experience the best fucking of his life.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Something that outrageous is likely either totally made up or totally true. LoL! I&#39;m not interested in his sexuality but the assertion that Hollywood success depends on sex has been around a long, long time. It would be great to finally know the low down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aside from the actions depicted that border on rape/assault, the thing is, it really doesn&#39;t matter what he does or prefers sexually. If this testimony is true, it seems he&#39;s really comfortable with his sexuality, and that&#39;s kind of awesome. (Aside from being kinda rapey about it) The only issue seems to be that since he&#39;s not open about it to the general public, it&#39;s kind of his &#39;dirty laundry&#39; that the CoS can use against him. If he came out, it would not give them that leverage, and he could be a great role model. Of course though, he doesn&#39;t have to come out, it&#39;s his life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think they would smear him until he&#39;d actually left permanently, because pre-smearing would certainly not do him any good and hence it would weaken his usefulness to them. AS a threat to keep him from leaving, wouldn&#39;t it make an enemy rather than a tool?</p>

<p>As to whether he&#39;s bi or gay, there have been enough publicized things that it&#39;s clear he is one of those. and in some bathhouse incidents specifically seemed to sexually prefer guys with dark skin. I&#39;d hate to think that Kelly Preston was wasted as a &#39;beard&#39; though.  But so what if he&#39;s gay; leave him alone. Every human deserves to try to be happy as long as they don&#39;t actively harm others. Amd apparently he genuinely loved his son, so it&#39;s not like he&#39;s a heartless soulless jerk</p>

<p>But speaking of jerks, as for David Miscavage, he&#39;s an A-1 psycho son of a bitch and capable of anything, including physical harm to others. He&#39;s living proof Scientology can&#39;t cure douchebags,</p>

<p>I agree, but it&#39;s possible that they are releasing these slowly to keep him from leaving. One of the masseurs has just &#39;settled&#39; his case, maybe that&#39;s because travolta has caved to the scientology leaders in a way, and they are cleaning it up a bit. I hope that makes sense, and I see what you&#39;re saying too. But I just think it&#39;s possible that they are doing this to keep him in scientology, to show him that that his is under their control. </p>

<p>Where there&#39;s smoke, there&#39;s fire. But of course, it doesn&#39;t matter what he is. It&#39;s sad to see that he&#39;s uncomfortable with being honest in regards to his career, but who cares what he prefers? And yeah, it&#39;s super sad for his wife and son, and he does seem nice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but here&#39;s the thing; obviously, he doesn&#39;t want the general public to know he&#39;s gay (or bi.) So, perhaps scientology is using this against him because he wants to leave. I&#39;m just speculating of course, but maybe if he was openly gay, the church would have nothing to use against him. </p>

<p>Or it could be he&#39;s just a rich perv who thought he could buy sex from whoever he wants. Both are possible, but I do know it has been explained by many CoS insiders before, that the organization uses personal foils to manipulate members into staying. The &quot;auditing&quot; process is as much about uncovering and documenting them, as anything else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, this is precisely what I mean. Who knows what&#39;s really going on, but it&#39;s possible that after his son&#39;s death he wants out, and they are airing these things out for the world to see. The CoS is very shady, and has had quite a few unexplained deaths occur under their watch. It&#39;s also crazy to read the accounts of children raised in the church, that later escape. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the church is making it up, I think that (some of) the rumors are true, and he wants to keep it reasonably quiet from the average middle american movie goer; and now, since his son&#39;s death, he wants to leave the CoS, and they are using this &#39;dirty laundry&#39; of his against him. It could be a total coincidence, but the CoS has done some very sinister things to people who try to leave the church, or speak out against their beliefs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, thanks! Yeah, and imagine if he spoke out against them? It would be awful for their PR. They make so much money preying on vulnerable people - to have one of their most famous members say bad things about them, would ruin them financially. Interesting to consider, there are tons of celeb scientologists, and I&#39;ve never read an account slandering the CoS by one of them. The only people exposing the dark side of CoS are former (civilian) members. Paul Haggis, a director, famously spoke out against scientology, but he doesn&#39;t quite have the same &#39;name&#39; that cruise or travolta have. It would be awesome if a more well known person, came out against them, hopefully with time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have heard from people for years that Travolta has a preference for men.  One of my best friends is an audio/video technician and he did sound for a party John threw at a hotel in Monterey (CA) once.  Definitely gay, according to my friend...who saw much.</p>

<p>I also used to work at the adult bookstore in Monterey and the owners had their own Travolta stories, which I will not repeat here.</p>

<p>Lastly, up until 2003, I had a longtime gay friend who then died of AIDS and its complications (after 14 years with it).  He was very active in the gay community and always had illuminating things to say about celebrities, many of which fell under the &quot;Oh PLEASE!  Of course s/he&#39;s GAY!&quot; umbrella.  Travolta was one of those, even back then.</p>

<p>I personally don&#39;t care what sexes anyone prefers.  May as well bitch about what kind of ice cream they call favorite...it takes all kinds, ya know?  But I don&#39;t think this is scientology-driven at all.  He&#39;s just gay...and really likes the massages to have happy endings.</p>

<p>A friend of mine is a costume designer with credits on several movies Travolta has been in.  She&#39;s told me several amusing stories about his bath house antics and his preference for hispanic and middle eastern men.  She&#39;s also told me his reason for secrecy about his orientation is a combination of it ruining his image and appeal with female audiences, and Scientology.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I was not surprised when these lawsuits emerged.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally agree, and there&#39;s nothing wrong with his orientation, but I get the feeling that he doesn&#39;t want the general movie-going audience of america to know. He&#39;s married to woman, and carrie fisher outed him, so it seems like it&#39;s something he&#39;s trying to keep on the DL. Again, this is all just wild speculation, but maybe he wants to leave the church because of (many reasons) his son&#39;s death, and since he&#39;s a powerful ($$$) member, the church is airing his dirty laundry to keep him in check. </p>

<p>Yes, exactly! <em>Maybe</em> because this is his dirty laundry, the CoS is using it against him for trying to leave. Or maybe it&#39;s just a coincidence, who knows. It would be great if he came out though, it would be progressive and he could serve as a great role model for the community. </p>

<p>Sidenote: it would be AWESOME if Travolta came out, it would be such a great platform to show that you can be gay and be a rich, working actor in hollywood. It would also help people struggling with their sexuality, to show them that there&#39;s nothing wrong with it. And maybe if more and more people came out in support, AIDS could be even more of a priority to treat and research. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My friend, Dave, was one of the first cases and nowhere near rich, so he got to be one of their fucking guinea pigs, new &#39;cocktails&#39; every year at least.  I have heard they &#39;cured&#39; it about 6 times since he died, but like all good medicine, TPTB keep suppressing such treatments.  I miss him terribly, but at least he died on a cloud, holding his mom&#39;s hand, saying &quot;This is how I want to go&quot;...as he went.  After all his suffering, he was still a wonderful and amazing person.  He was not predisposed for the post-9/11 world, though.  Especially with me as his best friend.  :D  I study too much.  ;)</p>

<p>I still recall walking into his home on 9/11/01 and having him tell me another building collapsed!  Say what?  Yeah, building 7 or something just collapsed like the others.  We had both been watching all day, though, and decided to turn it off, worship the bong and play some Magic, pretending the world was still right for the rest of that day.</p>

<p>R.I.P., buddy.  You are still well-missed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see what you mean, but if he did it right, he could be hailed as a progressive member of the glbt community. Look at Robert Downey Jr&#39;s comeback, I could see Travolta&#39;s coming out going as well. It could even open up new opportunities for him. Glbt civil rights are a huge issue right now, and I think it would be the perfect time for him to come out publicly. Of course I highly doubt he will, but it would be a great move. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, there&#39;s nothing wrong with it, and it would be great for him to be an openly gay powerful hollywood actor. But perhaps he&#39;s closeted, and because he wants to leave the church, this &#39;secret&#39; is leverage to use against him. Although, you could argue of course that he&#39;s never hidden it, because he seems to be quite open around masseurs. But the fact that he&#39;s married, and the fact that Carrie Fisher outed him, makes it seem like he doesn&#39;t want the public to know. </p>

An interesting one that strikes at the heart that is the evil of the Church of Scientology, but there is zero evidence for any of your claims.  Sure, the CoS has in the past blackmailed people, but people have been claiming John Travolta is gay/bi for years.  There’s tons of photos of him kissing men outside of planes and what not.

<p>I&#39;m 100% with you on this, it doesn&#39;t matter at all. </p>

<p>I&#39;m only trying to discuss the possibility of the CoS using his &#39;dirty laundry&#39; against him, because he wants to leave the church. The CoS has done nasty things to people who defect; since he&#39;s a very rich and high ranking member, it&#39;s possible they&#39;re afraid that he would speak ill of them, it would be awful for their PR. </p>

<p>But I totally agree with your general sentiment, this is all wild and inconsequential speculation, it&#39;s just kind of fun to gossip about stupid things, and let your brain fart for awhile. It&#39;s just like candy, and you gotta know when to stop and go back to more meaningful things :) </p>
