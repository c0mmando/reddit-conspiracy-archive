       I browse this Reddit for news and different views from people on varying subjects but there seems to be mass concern over fluoride and the pineal gland. What do you believe the gland does and what do you think fluoride does to it that's so bad?

       It has to do with astral projection. Your pineal gland releases DMT apparently (still theoretical where exactly it is released. Unless someone has undeniable proof that DMT is released strictly from the pineal gland), but DMT is released in the body, plants, other mammals. It is said that your brain releases small doses of DMT every night when you sleep, although, I do not have scientific data to back this claim up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a a little 10 min excerpt on DMT. (Dr. Rick Strassman, University of New Mexico)

      <p>
       Entheogens contain DMT as well. (ayahuasca, for example, a combination of plants brewed as tea)
      </p>
      <p>
       Examples of what you see in this 'realm.'

      </p>
      <p>
       Johns Hopkins is studying the use of entheogens and it's relationship with spirituality

       Another resource on DMT (it's relationship with the pineal gland) and meeting entities (Benny Shanon's Antipodes of the Mind, Hebrew University, Oxford University Press) You can download the book in it's entirety in PDF format online. Google search is all you need.

       If you're interested in using DMT, you can buy the parts here:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       FYI, DMT is a class schedule II drug, so having it in it's completed form is a felony. Buying the plants is no problem though. And no, DMT is not the same experience as LSD. Some participants in the UNM study saw instructive visions that boggles the mind. Can't write it here as I will be downvoted as to what they saw since it's so utterly fantastic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually, why don't I let the pros let you know what the pineal gland/DMT connection is.

       FYI Psychedelics do not contain DMT - DMT in it's produced form is classed as a psychedelic. Also the mushrooms and the cactus species you listed do not contain DMT.

       I meant to say entheogens. Apologies.

       Amanita muscaria and peyote (psilocybin) do have similar effects to DMT. I'm no pro as to the differences though.

       It's possible that Da Vinci was aware of entheogens and meeting 'entities.' If you look at the 'Last Supper' and zoom in on the left-most mural, you will see what looks like mushrooms encoded in the mural.

       Da Vinci was definitely into entheogens. Psilocybin and many other such plants, etc were widely used in Europe amongst artists and the like. The Philosopher's stone may have actually been a mushroom or plant. This is what alchemy was actually all about.

       Not sure if the term was used in this context or not, but a lot of people refer to sclerota (sp?) as philosophers stone. Basically instead of growing the mushrooms to fruition, you just grow the mycelium and eat that.

       Hmm. I've seen an odd variety of Mushroom, Muscaria I think, called the Philosopher's Stone. I have also heard there is a leaf that makes you see in 2D with the same title. I dunno, there may've never been agreement, there may be many such 'stones'. But I bet it wasn't a rock.

       You're a dope. Alchemy had nothing to do with drugs. Alchemy is analogous to Freemasonry. The chemistry can be compared to stoneworking -- it's just a craft as a metaphor for transformation. On the microcosm level, transforming the self, on the macrocosm level, transforming the society, AKA the Great Work. It's about magic. Not about drugs.

       I have a perfectly good understanding of learning. The fact that you label me "dismissive" is another example in your never ending string of egotistical projections... making it quite clear why you seem to think mind altering substances are so inconsequential, as you have clearly gained nothing from your own.

       Calling me a dope was the
       <em>
        first
       </em>
       thing you did. Stating the obvious about learning is nothing but condescending and assuming. One comment about what you find to be the true nature of such broad topics is definitely an opinion. Claiming something is incorrect does not qualify as "explaining in exact detail." Take your own advice about reading previous comments. The fact that you see your comments as adequate and everything I said as foolishness is yet further evidence of your blind, egotistical, and argumentative nature.

       You guys both seem to know a lot about the occult.
      </p>
      <p>
       From my personal research, Freemasons do use entheogens quite frequently to conjure 'entities.' Now, feel free to correct me and what not, but isn't Freemasonry essentially the same as the Kabbalah?

       What's your take on the theory that elite levels of government (illuminati) are involved in witchcraft (occult practice), and are actually Luciferians? I do have tons of evidence that they include occult symbolism in both music and movies.
      </p>
      <p>
       And when I mean the illuminati, I'm talking about the Rosicrucians, Jesuits, Freemasons, Vatican, among others.

       I think it's much older than "Witchcraft" and even "Lucifer" himself. Look into the Mystery Schools of ancient Egypt. These practices definitely involve plant rituals and "communing with spirits(see shamanism)." This was long well understood and kept secret, and the Vatican and their kin would have you burned as a witch because they tend to prefer to keep folks soulless and compartmentalized. Use of entheogens can be a shortcut to the kind of "higher consciousness" that is sought through eastern "spiritual" practice. It has been said that the link between the conscious and the unconscious mind lies in the breath... hence yoga(~Union)[To me it makes perfect sense, as breathing is the most important thing we do and most of the time it is not done consciously]. Using plants to achieve a calmer mind, less enslaved by lack of understanding and control of normally unconscious mind activity seems to me to be the true basis of all western religion. The outward exoteric version for the masses seems to be essentially keeping everyone else away form this realization. Witches were often seen as such for practicing very interesting uses of psychoactive herbs and the like... Hence "Christians" killing them. They'd prefer folks stay drunk and angry and never ask why or how to alleviate or even realize their plight.

       Lucifer and the Garden of Eden illustrate this perfectly. I think the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil(how could anyone claim its a bad idea to gain this knowledge) was actually a psilocybin mushroom(see John Marco Allegra and Terence Mckenna - "Stoned Ape") They want to actively be gods, so they blame it on Eve(Misogyny is key) listening to a snake(Lucifer), and then claim we all are born sinners. Lucifer challenging god's claim to singular superiority is another parable created to keep everyone else in the dark.

       From my understanding, the Vatican killed Christians that did not follow 'Roman Catholicism' version of Christianity. An example would be the persecution of Hussites during the Inquisition.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is actually my firm belief that the upper echelons of the Vatican are engaged in spirit worship, and hide this knowledge from the masses. In essence, they are actually anti-God. Couple that with Bishops coming out now saying 'ET' life is real, and I get the notion that the Vatican are malevolent. I mean c'mon, worshipping saints? worshipping mary? holy water? how is that any different from worshiping demi gods of the past.

       Aren't Freemasons and Kabbalists considered malevolent? Meaning they do hide certain knowledge from the masses. Couple this with occult symbolism implanted in various movies/music. Why are they doing this?
      </p>
      <blockquote>

        As one who is very learned, I strongly recommend against any spirit contact and any dabbling in any mysticism. All spirits are demons but the one Spirit of God. All occult power is a covert arrangement that compromises the bearer.

       I don't want poltergeist activity in my house. So no, I will not be contacting familiar spirits. But here's the thing, the elite are practitioners of spirit worship. So why are the elite involved in this activity, but keep the masses in the dark about this hidden knowledge?
      </p>
      <p>
       And FYI, I am a born again Christian, from finding out the deception that is being enforced by these secret societies.

       The reason they think it is released by the pineal gland, is that DMT is essentially slightly modified melotonin, which is the pineal's bailywick; and like melatonin, it is secreted directly into the pineal gland's own special network of fluid filled chambers, which gives a nearly instantaneous brainwide effect that endocrine glands relying on the circulatory system cannot manage; like a rocker switch that toggles between realities.

       Since no one has answered OPs question about fluoride, I'll give it a shot. I'm not an expert, but I do know what other claim about it.
The idea is that the pineal gland is prone to calcification, and many people I've listened to claim that fluoride is involved in this process.
I remember David Wilcock also said something about the pineal gland being used as a "personal stargate", which would basically be something like Alice in Wonderland. Your own personal universe...
Basically the conspiracy I've been following is that the public is blocked from this realm to keep them from meddling with it.
All of it sounds like stuff from a bad sci-fi novel, so I'm still not 100% on board with them, and yet as they keep explaining the science behind it, I become more and more intrigued...

       It makes kind of sense in a very deranged level. Forget about stargates, if this area promotes a kind of communications and heightened sense of awareness it would very much make sense for those trying to keep the masses under control (or at least 'quiet' or unable to get satisfaction from within) to promote something that helps them.

       I'll add to this that if you have had difficulty with fluoride building up in your pineal gland, monatomic gold powder is an excellent remedy, as it strengthens the pineal gland and helps to open the third eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is some evidence that the ancient Israelites, in their 40-year exile in the desert, ate bread laced with monatomic gold (which they unknowingly called "manna") in order to cleanse themselves of the aftereffects of their long period of slavery and bring themselves closer to God/Source/the Divine. Modern use makes sense if you think about it - helping us to free ourselves from psycho-chemical slavery...

       It is possible, but you will find it more difficult. The pineal gland is an important part of what connects monkey brain to astral plane, if you'll excuse the bad rhyme. Restricting your fluoride intake is a start, and you should  avoid mobile phones, mobile phone towers, and wifi as much as possible. If it's within your budget, homemade orgnoite helps a lot.

       Ajna is said to exist between the eyebrows at the optical-atlas junction, with the associated meridian being Yintang 1 (this is also sometimes called Gov 24.5). The brow is said to affect a persons personality and it manifests as the pituitary gland, which is a master gland in the body. If any of the other endocrine glands are not secreting enough of their particular hormone, the pituitary gland will help out by secreting trophic hormone – which can lead to further imbalances such as headaches and migraines. Many texts incorrectly label the Brow chakra as the pineal gland, and the Crown chakra as associated with the pituitary gland. Working with Ajna can have significant affects on the bodies hormonal secretions (via the pituitary), which would otherwise be impossible by working with the Crown (pineal).
      </p>
      <p>
       This chakra is said to be associated with the 3rd eye, which is appropriate as it’s treatments are used in conditions of perception both physical and emotional. Ajna also plays a central role in the eye, where clairvoyance and intuition are also said to manifest (visions.. internal or external) here.  As the Pineal gland is not responsible for hormonal secretion, it is however, linked to the Pituitary gland through a process called the Circadian rhythm – which is kicked off by environmental lighting picked up by the the eyes. As recent as the early 1990′s, research in to the photoreceptors in the human eye has revealed that we also have non-rod, non-cone ocular photoreceptors located in the neural layer and has a different nerve pathway back to the brain[1] – which seem to be aligned to the Pineal body.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems our receptors for light and colour are intimately connected to our endocrinological system and furthermore is regulated by the Ajna chakra.

       The general belief is that the calcite structure inside the pineal gland transmits and receives signals of some kind (like the silicon crystals we use in radios and computer chips), and fluoride changes/interferes with this; people become perhaps
       <em>
        tuned into
       </em>
       something other than what they are supposed to be. Strong electrical activity in this gland when people are dreaming or tripping, so it's definitely up to something.

        what do you think fluoride does to it that's so bad?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Pineal gland aside since it seems to have been addressed. Fluoride is toxic when taken internally. It does not work from the inside and magically find your teeth, it only work topically and should be spit out.  It has never been tested, the only data is the correlation/causation type that keeps getting regurgitated.
      </p>

       check out this site:
       <a href="http://www.fluoridealert.org">
        http://www.fluoridealert.org
       </a>
       and please look at the countless studies they have linked done in numerous other countries that are not the US.  Also look at the data on which countries have the best dental health and do not use fluoride on their populations.

       It's been found that the pineal gland contains (amounts varying between people) piezoelectric crystals. That's significant in that it could explain sensitivity to electric and even magnetic fields. Has nothing to do with 'telepathy' or 'psychic powers', but could explain some disorders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Adding:  Googling "pineal gland piezoelectric" brings up a ton of discussion about this, some a little too New Age-y but some good for speculation.

       There is no problem.

       Hmm. I've seen an odd variety of Mushroom, Muscaria I think, called the Philosopher's Stone. I have also heard there is a leaf that makes you see in 2D with the same title. I dunno, there may've never been agreement, there may be many such 'stones'. But I bet it wasn't a rock.

       You guys both seem to know a lot about the occult.
      </p>
      <p>
       From my personal research, Freemasons do use entheogens quite frequently to conjure 'entities.' Now, feel free to correct me and what not, but isn't Freemasonry essentially the same as the Kabbalah?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are 3 requirements to contact the 'spirit' realm.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Knowledge in astrology
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Talisman
