    <div class="md"><p>Friend, I am a middle aged, married, parent and business owner. I couldn&#39;t give a flying fuck about getting down voted. I wear it as a badge of honour. </p>

<p>I gave up on concern for what people think of me long ago ... and I feel it has helped me to live a more balanced and happier existence. I live my life with integrity and an open mind, I have a lovely and smart wife who makes a difference in the world (RN), I am raising two great kids who think for themselves and I get to do a job that I enjoy. </p>

<p>Religion may have had a benefit to early humans; however, kings and popes have been conspiring against us for way too long. Thanks for the &quot;heads up&quot; ... I&#39;ll manage the onslaught of dissatisfaction from others. I wish you the best of luck in your journey.</p>

<p>PS: that is a great quote; do you recall who said it?    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you ever notice that all the media reports are about the national election, but you seldom see much about the local elections, even in your own area? This is because the individual can have an affect on the outcome of local elections, but is powerless to affect the outcome of national elections. The elite want all our energies focused on the races we cannot sway with our votes. They want the local elections run under the table, so that they can be quietly managed by a few insiders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a roommate, and he&#39;s so proud to vote. He puts the &quot;I voted&quot; stickers on his bed. </p>

<p>But once you think about it, you aren&#39;t really voting at all, especially when it comes to the matter of the president... I try showing him my truth sometimes, but he prefers his truth, and calls me crazy!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you&#39;re trying to survive and put food on your table, gas in your car and pay the rent voting often gets neglected. Holding elections on weekdays makes it tough for the working class to get to the polls.

    <div class="md"><p>This is one of the more bizarre modqueue items I&#39;ve had to deal with.</p>

<ul>
<li>A post which made it to our frontpage and sat there for a full day before the spam filter grabbed it and put it in the modqueue.</li>
</ul>

<p>That having been said, I see <em>why</em> it did it, just not why it did it so <em>late</em>.</p>

<p><strong>OP: Please don&#39;t use URL shorteners.</strong> </p>

<p>bit.ly and others are notorious covers for spam and malware sites. reddit&#39;s spam filter catches them all (posts or comments) and sends them to the modqueue (in fact, some days it&#39;s more than 20% of what we see in the queue).</p>

<p>Reapproved, but please edit your post to display the full URL. </p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
