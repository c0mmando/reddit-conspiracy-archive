       "Astroturf refers to apparently grassroots-based citizen groups or coalitions that are primarily conceived, created and/or funded by corporations, industry trade associations, political interests or public relations firms.  "Astroturfing," or whatever you want to call it, from all sides is turning Reddit into a shit show of which I do not wish to be a part of. If I cannot have meaningful conversation without downvote mobs being organized to attack specific comments, or disinformation agents responding, I do not want to be apart of Reddit. I will find somewhere better.

       The problem is simply that reddit is so large. It's presence is too conspicuous. Everyone knows about this site, and it's visited by everyone from grandpa on down to those who've only recently learned how to type. I'm not trying to say it's too mainstream and therefore is no longer cool. It's just a simple fact. Attempting to have an open discussion on any topic in this type of environment is almost futile. Aside from the multitudes of people there are also obviously present a myriad of people from many an alphabet agency. It seems to be how all forums evolve, and ultimately die.

       You are right.. I guess I should seek out a private forum or something. The thing I like about Reddit though is that it is comprised of so many different people from all walks of life. So many different opinions. But when I really think about it, who knows if a lot of these opinions are even legitimate? Are they just their opinions because that is what they are paid to say?

       Maybe they'll become disgusted with their influence and their job. Those are the ones who it is most fruitful to change the minds of, if possible.

       The Russian government does a lot of astroturfing on stories critical of President Putin (not so much on reddit, but newspaper websites).
      </p>
      <p>
       On reddit, the most obvious astroturfing occurs on stories relating Obama and his glaring lack of a (genuine) US birth certificate. Of course, some of the downvoters could just brainwashed idiots who have been told the issue is just a partisan "anti-Obama" smear.

       RT has nothing but great things to say about the man. He's even been portrayed as some sort of superman. Supposedly he fought off the Rothschild's controlling their central bank. I often wonder if it's all true, or if perhaps they are using a subsidiary, and Russia is nothing but controlled opposition.

       Nope. I don't "know" and neither do you. Stop pretending to know things like that with absolute certainty. He certainly hasn't proven it in any substantial way. Hell, even his own lawyers admitted in court that his birth certificate was a fake and should not be allowed as evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       "An attorney representing Barack Obama has argued in court that the long-form birth certificate image released by the White House nearly a year ago should not be placed into evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was April 10 at a three-hour eligibility hearing before a New Jersey administrative law judge that Alexandra Hill made the argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hill, legal counsel representing Obama’s re-election campaign, argued that New Jersey law does not require Obama to present a valid birth certificate to establish his qualifications under Article 2, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution and be placed on the New Jersey Democratic Party primary ballot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hill repeatedly explained to Judge Jeff S. Masin, “We do not believe the president’s birth certificate is relevant to this case.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Agreeing with Hill, Masin ruled in a written opinion the same day that New Jersey law does not require Obama to produce any proof he is eligible to be president to be placed on the primary ballot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Noting that New Jersey law allows a nominating petition endorsing a particular person for president to be filed without the consent of the person endorsed, Masin said, “There is no obligation upon the person endorsed to prove his or her qualification for office.”
      </p>
      <p>
       At the hearing, Masin prevented petitioner’s counsel Mario Apuzzo, who has argued a number of eligibility cases in court, from placing Obama’s birth certificate into evidence. Nor was Apuzzo allowed to call to the stand a witness willing to offer expert testimony that Obama’s birth certificate is a forgery."
      </p>
      <p>
       How sad. You pathetic scared little man. Go dig a hole and hide in it.

       Is there a source for that quote? I'm actually curious, because I didn't realize there was a legitimate argument that his birth certificate is fake. You'll forgive me if it's hard to trust an unsourced quote on the internet, though.

       There is LOTS of evidence that his birth certificate was faked, and not much evidence for the other claim except for "You aren't one of those fucking stupid birthers... Are you?

       "The attorney for the other side asks the Obama lawyer to stipulate that the birth certificate on the internet is not evidence in this case. She stipulates that because, quite plainly, it wasn't introduced into evidence in this case. The case wasn't about that document, it was about whether or not Obama was required to produce a birth certificate to the New Jersey Secretary of State. Obama didn't produce any birth certificate to New Jersey real, fake, online, hard copy, or anything. It isn't evidence in the case so when asked, Obama's lawyer had no problem stipulating that it isn't evidence in the case. At no point in the hearing does Obama's attorney state the birth certificate is fake. There are lots of right-wing blogs claiming she does make that claim, but not a single one can specify where this statement takes place.
      </p>
      <p>
       The lawyer tries to frame the stipulation in a way that benefits his side better, but the judge re-frames it before the Obama lawyer stipulates. He wants her to stipulate that it isn't evidence of his birth certificate. The judge clarifies that she is only stipulating that it isn't evidence in this case which is just plainly true."

       Your first link hasn't been copied correctly. As to the second link, basically some expert says it's real, some forum says it isn't, and there's a whole debate on the internet over it. After reading through some of the forums, like the one mentioned in that article, and watching a couple videos from Alex Jones and someone else, I'm not at all convinced it's fake. I don't know enough about this stuff to give a real opinion, but it seems like the optimization process that someone would use to shrink the image file would produce a lot of the effects people are finding with layers and such.
      </p>
      <p>
       But let's assume it has been altered. There's still an easy explanation: it's general government policy not to release a document that could be easily altered or counterfeited. So when they release pictures of passports, they'll put an "Example" stamp over it or something to make it hard to forge a passport. It seems pretty likely that when the Hawaii Health Department was asked for the certificate, they had to modify it a little because the certificates from 1961 were just black text on white paper, and they didn't want to release a document that could assist forgeries and such. So they added a background and possibly edited some of the text because the background made it hard to read. This could have been done at the White House too, I don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, so that's total conjecture. I've made a totally uninformed guess as to why the document might have been altered. The point is, assuming it was a forgery is total conjecture too. I don't understand why my conjecture should be less believable than yours. When the Hawaii Health Director confirms the documents are real, some Adobe expert confirms it's real, and a bunch of random photoshop users think it's real, why not believe it? From my perspective, it's questionable that the document was altered, and even more questionable that such an alteration could be a forgery.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am still interested in seeing that court case, though.

       I use photoshop all the time and I am experienced with many different models of scanners. I do not know of any scanners that do what this photoshop expert says the software does. The document in question was also released in illustrator format instead of just a scan of the original document.  Add this to the questionable selective service registration card and now you are starting to see the cracks in the story. I don't know anything about this with any certainty, I just have unanswered questions. I never once invalidated anyone's conjecture. I am simply stating again what I have found.

       The real question is, is it real until proven fake, or vice versa?

       Yes, it's real until proven fake. If you make a claim, you need to prove it. I've never heard about this selective service card, so I'll go look that up. I'd still like to see a reference to this trial you were talking about earlier. The link you posted to psyops didn't copy correctly or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Ok, so there seem to be only two "clues" with the selective service card. There's a really tenuous argument that his signature looks more like his modern one than his older, but they're so similar that it's basically a matter of opinion unless some handwriting expert comments. Second, there's this fact that it says 80 instead of 1980, and the forger couldn't find a 1980 stamp so they used 2008 and flipped the 08. Seriously? I guess it's a little unusual that it doesn't say 1980, but it's harder to believe that a forger wouldn't have been able to use eBay and get an older stamp, because they're on eBay. It's much easier to believe either the Hawaii office was issued different stamps or they just ended up using different ones or cut one in half for some other reason. There's no way anyone could be that incompetent in forging a document.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also saw a bunch of blogs all excited over the fact that his social security number is 042 and that's from Connecticut so there's no way he got it legitimately. I debunked that with like 3 minutes on Google. We can see the original SSN location codes
       <a href="http://www.usrecordsearch.com/ssn.htm">
        here
       </a>
       . As you can see, Hawaii was only given 2 numbers. Only odd numbers were used in the second part before 1965, so that's 49 possible numbers, and then I guess 9998 numbers for the third part. So that's 979804 possible numbers for Hawaii. I'm pretty sure they could have used up every number by 1961 and just switched to other available numbers. Or,
       <a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/birthers/ssn.asp">
        Snopes
       </a>
       mentions that his zip code was 96814 and 06814, so a typo or bad handwriting could explain the location code.

       I've got questions about Obama's legitimacy. It's not only the mysterious birth certificate which never seem to actually be presented. It's his name change, and his fake social security number, and questions about his parentage, and all the places he lived as a child. They guy has skeletons in his closet, and as yet they haven't quite come out.

       What I've noticed is that the degree of manipulation of a subreddit is largely determined by its size. When a subreddit has upwards of a million subscribers, Hasbara and other propaganda organs and advertising organizations start to put some heavy influence on it. In smaller subreddits, such as this one, the same degree of effort is not made.

       This would make sense. It's quite disturbing thinking about it. It basically means that there is no natural discussion, because at some point, someone being paid to persuade is going likely to chime in

       <a href="/r/rant">
        /r/rant

       and they both got like 5 upvotes and 30 downvotes. I think that
       <a href="/r/EPS">
        /r/EPS

       got mad that I linked them in it and sent their downvote brigade. They are all trying to convince me that I am crazy for believing that Reddit has been severely compromised. Lord_bumberchute was "psychologically attacking" me...his words. He was just trolling really. I don't think I am crazy for thinking that it is very likely that Reddit has been severely compromised and it kind of upsets me that I'm not even able to get a discussion going on it without people attacking me personally

       It doesn't mean there's no natural discussion; I'm only still on reddit because it still exists. There is just a lot of tripe mixed in, sort of like how newspaper letters to the editor consist of a few actual opinions and a lot of letters from company/government/religious/lobbyist spokespeople talking about how great their employer actually is despite what yesterday's story said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Letters to the editor are in a very public forum, so there's a lot of public relations BS; as reddit grows and becomes a larger forum, it inevitably comes to the attention of the PR guys and astroturfers. All you have to do is recognize talking points and downvote them, or argue them into oblivion if you have time. Astroturfers have a lot of comments to make; their strength is in quantity, not quality.

       is a small subreddit intended for people who are skeptical of "global warming". Probably less than twenty people comment regularly. Probably half of those actually promote "global warming".

       Atheists also disbelieve conspiracy theories at an intrinsic level. Not all of them, but they are quite smug and self aggrandizing in general. Find a naysayer here, and chances are they are also an outspoken atheist. Not generalizing, just relating my years of experience.

       Perhaps. No more (or less) than any other popular site. We're livestock and we're a valuable commodity. Whoever controls us and our opinions gets to wield immense power. If reddit can make Scumbag Steve relevant to thousands, imagine what a corporation, agency, or brilliant intellectual could do with that same potential.

       Reddit has always flash mobbed other sites to downvote the shit out of online polls that we didn't agree with. What makes you think the same kind of thing wouldn't happen here? If you don't wish the be apart of reddit anymore, so be it. Create us a new platform that's "shit show" free. This is the best, least "shit show," place we have here on the internet as far as most of us are concerned. Are you new to the interwebs?

       Yes, astroturfing is real. No, EPS are not astroturfers. Disagreeing with you =/= paid shill/astroturfer. Some Ron Paul supporters on reddit are using a bot/botnet to downvote anyone who disagrees with RP, however.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real problem with this subreddit is that any skeptics who ask for evidence or disagree are denounced as shills or the ever popular "disinfo agents". Meanwhile, posters like Ijob911, tttt0tttt, bumblingmumbling, and others routinely post anti-semetic and racist comments and are neither downvoted nor isolated from the conspiracy community. If you want
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       to be taken seriously, take care of those problems, not the semi-imagined threat of shills and astroturfers.

       Where did I say that? Oh right, I didn't. Of course, people like you damage any credibility
       <a href="/r/con">
        /r/con

       might have. You are racist and a white supremacist, and the proof is in your comment history. You essentially think "Jews control everything". No one in their right mind should take you seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, -4 karma? Did you sign me up for the Paulbot downvoter? Or do you and your brethren not understand the purpose of the upvote/downvote system? (Hint: upvote/downvote =/= agree/disagree)
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Should I even point out that racism isn't even against the rules in this subreddit? No wonder your small-minded opinions flourish here.

       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       <a href="/r/EPS">

       and
       <a href="/r/rant">

      <p>
       I have seen this happen three times with my own eyes. Three times to comments or posts that I made. One was a few days ago. I posted something in conspiracy and went to sleep with like 39 upvotes 3 downvotes. Next morning I wake up with something like 50 downvotes and 40 upvotes. I was then made aware of a post in EPS. The post was my direct quote that I made with +29 written beside it.
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughPaulSpam/comments/t49ze/reddit_has_been_infiltrated_by_massive_amount_of/">
        This one right here
       </a>
       . What do you know, after that was posted to
       <a href="/r/EPS">
        /r/EPS
       </a>
       , I received 50 or so downvotes in a few hours! Then, today I post on two different subreddits regarding astroturfers.
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughPaulSpam/comments/t5mbh/conspiracy_theorists_doing_what_conspiracy/">
        Someone then submitted a post to /r/EPS calling me out on that thread
       </a>
       . 
What do you know, my threads on astroturfing went from a neutral ratio, to 40 something downvotes! This seems highly suspicious. It may not be as organized as, "Ok, we are going to downvote this one," but it seems like it is common for yor subscribers to post links to other threads they disagree with and then have all your EPS people go and downvote it. Seems pretty black and white to me.

       How is it a conspiracy? It's a fact that astroturfing exists at the top levels of government. It's a fact that the government has hired agencies for the purpose of astroturfing. It's a fact reddit is the largest news aggregate. Wouldn't it seem reasonable for people in power to want to persuade opinion here? Did you even read any of the links I posted? Are you aware of Operation Mockingbird?

       Please educate yourself on the definition of the word "conspiracy". Then, educate yourself on the words "theory" and "hypothesis".
      </p>
      <p>
       When you make an assertion that "a group of people are conspiring to do &lt;x&gt;". You are, in fact, saying that it is a conspiracy. And, if you take it further and provide source references to back your assertioin, you are proposing either a hypothesis or a theory (depending on the quality and relevance of your source references and how well they support your assertion and such).
      </p>
      <p>
       And conspiracy facts are still conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of your lack of understanding of these terms, you have knee-jerk reacted to people calling you a conspiracy theorist.... when, in fact, you have proposed a theory about a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a conspiracy theorist. I am not ashamed of it, despite the fact that trolls and morons use the term as a pejorative (look that word up, too), because if that's all they can come up with as a retort (point, laugh, and mock the conspiracy theorist) then they've only proven their own ignorance (and, again, despite the circlejerk that inevitably follows such populist karmawhore comments).
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr: if you believe that people are conspiring to do [bad] things, you are a conspiracy theorist. sorry, that's the definition of those words.

       Whoa there. Trust me, I am aware what the word conspiracy means. I am also aware of the extremely negative connotation that are bundled with the use of the word. Hence why I make a point to use a different word other than conspiracy. You mention conspiracy fact, otherwise know as a fact. That astroturfing  exists is a fact. Sure you can call it a conspiracy too, but it is a fact, and I believe that's what I was referring to.

       No. I'm simply stating that you are living in denial about the difference between the definition of the phrase "conspiracy theorist" and its pejorative application. Take, for example, the word "scientist".
      </p>
      <p>
       In
       <a href="/r/science">
        /r/science
       </a>
       or
       <a href="/r/askscience">
        /r/askscience
       </a>
       , scientists are revered... unless they defy the approved mainstream narrative (
       <strong>
        Dr.
       </strong>
       Helen Caldicott, Arnie Gundersen, et al).... then they're "conspiracy theorists". However, this application of the phrase "conspiracy theorist" isn't accurate, because they aren't pointing out conspiracies. They're pointing out things that can (and possibly will) eventually kill millions of people. But, because it's a scary proposition, their ideologies have to be dismissed... with mockery and a pejorative label. And, conversely, when a Japanese "scientist" (notice I put quotation marks this time on that word) says that "smiling will prevent radiation sickness" and the whole scientific community turns a blind eye to that, the term "scientist" becomes a point of mockery.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not calling you a conspiracy theorist like it's a bad thing. You simply have that preconception. You interpret what I say through that preconceived filter. And, the fact that you continue to cry "conspiracy!" about a topic, while also denying that you're a conspiracy theorist is simply denial. It's all in your mind. And, it is your denial in this matter which makes you argumentative about it, constantly trying to debate your way into avoiding the pejorative application, despite the accuracy of the definition.

       I have been trying to get RobotEvil to respond to my last response to him, but it looks as if he cannot find anything to say because he knows I am right. He avoided and deflected all the question so far. Here is my final response.

       So what if the US Chamber of Commerce is a private lobbying agency? The fact that they contracted HB Gary to do some astroturfing should be enough for you to admit that there is a high possibility Reddit is compromised.
      </p>
      <p>
       Want more proof that the US government has contracted and is using astroturfers? Why don't you look at the other links I posted. The FBI one and the CENTCOM one. They are government agencies, right? How about the Air Force?
      </p>

       is some more proof.

      <blockquote>

        Years old article with shaky evidence at best. Do you have another source?
It's six years old. That does not negate its validity. How is the CENTCOM article shaky?
       </p>
       <p>
        And in 1975 we still had a working space program sending people to the moon. We had a much bigger central government, with less oversight in place. 1975, is not 2012. Our government operates entirely differently.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In 2012, we have probes at the outer edges of the solar system. We have landed on Mars. This has nothing to do with the US government having covert ops embedded in every news agency. That's a fact. Why are you trying so hard to discredit this proof? Wait, I think I know why. It can't be done. Explain how the government operates entirely differently? You mean entirely differently as in Operation Fast and Furious or entirely differently as in CIA plane with cocaine in it crashing in Mexico? Or entirely differently by lying us into the Iraq War. Or by killing 100,000 innocent civilians in Iraq and Afghanistan?

       Having trouble finding where it says that the whistle was blown by insiders almost immediately. Even if it was, that doesn't change the fact that the CIA was successful for who knows how long at infiltrating the media and consistently providing stories to all media outlets for publishing. You can agree that their covert abilities have only progressed exponentially, which would be natural, right?

       How is it a conspiracy? It's a fact that astroturfing exists at the top levels of government. It's a fact that the government has hired agencies for the purpose of astroturfing. It's a fact reddit is the largest news aggregate. Wouldn't it seem reasonable for people in power to want to persuade opinion here? Did you even read any of the links I posted?

       Nope. I don't "know" and neither do you. Stop pretending to know things like that with absolute certainty. He certainly hasn't proven it in any substantial way. Hell, even his own lawyers admitted in court that his birth certificate was a fake and should not be allowed as evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       "An attorney representing Barack Obama has argued in court that the long-form birth certificate image released by the White House nearly a year ago should not be placed into evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was April 10 at a three-hour eligibility hearing before a New Jersey administrative law judge that Alexandra Hill made the argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hill, legal counsel representing Obama’s re-election campaign, argued that New Jersey law does not require Obama to present a valid birth certificate to establish his qualifications under Article 2, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution and be placed on the New Jersey Democratic Party primary ballot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hill repeatedly explained to Judge Jeff S. Masin, “We do not believe the president’s birth certificate is relevant to this case.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Agreeing with Hill, Masin ruled in a written opinion the same day that New Jersey law does not require Obama to produce any proof he is eligible to be president to be placed on the primary ballot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Noting that New Jersey law allows a nominating petition endorsing a particular person for president to be filed without the consent of the person endorsed, Masin said, “There is no obligation upon the person endorsed to prove his or her qualification for office.”
      </p>
      <p>
       At the hearing, Masin prevented petitioner’s counsel Mario Apuzzo, who has argued a number of eligibility cases in court, from placing Obama’s birth certificate into evidence. Nor was Apuzzo allowed to call to the stand a witness willing to offer expert testimony that Obama’s birth certificate is a forgery."
      </p>

       I've got questions about Obama's legitimacy. It's not only the mysterious birth certificate which never seem to actually be presented. It's his name change, and his fake social security number, and questions about his parentage, and all the places he lived as a child. They guy has skeletons in his closet, and as yet they haven't quite come out.

       I try to influence even those who are paid to oppose my view.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they'll become disgusted with their influence and their job. Those are the ones who it is most fruitful to change the minds of, if possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if those persons persist, their views are made clearly impotent in the face of the clearer truth.

       Haha, funny stuff. Source? Also, explain the birth announcement from when he was born..... actually, don't bother. I'm not in the mood to read through a bunch of infowars and prisonplanet links.

       Is there a source for that quote? I'm actually curious, because I didn't realize there was a legitimate argument that his birth certificate is fake. You'll forgive me if it's hard to trust an unsourced quote on the internet, though.
