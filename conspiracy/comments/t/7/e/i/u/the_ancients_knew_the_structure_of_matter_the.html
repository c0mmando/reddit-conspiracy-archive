<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vybaO0bYM0U&amp;feature=relmfu">Spirit Science - The Math of God</a></p>

<p>Basically these videos explain some aspects of sacred geometry, mostly the fibonacci sequence, phi, and the flower of life.</p>

<p>The other day on reddit a post hit the front page of a man that <a href="http://neurobonkers.com/2011/05/16/jason-padgett/">see&#39;s the world in fractal shapes</a>, who works for MIT. </p>

<p><a href="http://neurobonkers.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/E-equals-MC2-crunch1.jpg">This is his depiction of a quantum cube.</a></p>

<p>Compare that to the depictions of the flower of life seen across cultures on wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower_of_Life">here</a></p>

<p>Strikingly similar, the same shape? How did the ancients know of this?  </p>

<p>If a near extinction level event occurred today in 10,000 years the only evidence that we were here would be the porcelain used in bathrooms and it is likely that the scholars of that future era would consider our toilets to be religious artifacts.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Plenty of evidence exists, however it rationalized away to fit the conventional wisdom.  The links in the OP present some evidence, items found in coal deposits, the mathematics used in the construction of pyramids &amp; other structures, vedic texts, ancient nuclear reactions and a lot of other evidence.</p>

<p>The evidence is abundant when one discards the notion that current global society represents the pinnacle of human advancement.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whats up nick?? How have you been dude. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think were talking super advanced like Internet/iPhone, but there is evidence that there probably was a sea-faring civilization that traveled the globe, keeping some of their culture and myth as they traveled. The similarity of the god-myths, the propensity to build pyramids, the similarity of statues on Easter Island to the Dogon/Mali people, etc. There is also some weirdness around the Dogon people, I don&#39;t take it as 100% face value, but apparantly they knew of the Star Sirius and knew it had an orbiting second star, and knew it&#39;s orbital length (the second star is in a non-visible wavelength.) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogon_people#Dogon_and_Sirius">wiki</a> </p>

<p>Puma Punku is incredibly hard to explain if we use the current archaeological model of civ basically starting 10k years ago, as its dated around there- but consists of extremely incredible stonework of multi-hundred ton stones, perfect right angles, drill holes, just impossibilities for stone tools. This almost absolutely needed machine tools to be made. </p>

<p>Gobleki Tepi is another mystery, as it being dated ~12,000 years ago, also having incredible stonework. The current accepted view is that hunter-gatherers erected it. There&#39;s no way. You need planning, mathematics, master stonework, etc. </p>

<p>India&#39;s written histories go back 30,000 years, Egypt has pharaohs going back 30,000 years which egyptologists claim are just myth. </p>

<p>The Spyhnx is most likely at least 10,000 years old due to rain erosion patterns on it. We can&#39;t date stone, so we look to pottery/etc around the sites of these places, which could have been re-populated many times. The orion correlation theory makes sense to me. Check out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ApMbhBe2a8">Revelations of the Pyramids</a>. It&#39;s an amazing doc, id like to see what you think. The main premise is that the 3 giza pyramids would point directly at Orion&#39;s belt, while the Sphynx is gazing at Leo, approx 10,500BC. The plateau would function as a giant astronomical analog clock, and it tracks the wobble of the earth (the procession of the equinox&#39;). It sounds insane but the evidence is pretty strong that the Sphynx at least wasn&#39;t built when mainstream archaeology says it was. </p>

<p>Stuff like the pyramid pointing north within 5/100&#39;s of a degree, Pi, Phi, are also built into the proportions of many dimensions of the pyramid, like the width/length of the kings chamber, the height of the pyramid/the width of the pyramid all come out to very important mathematical numbers. That stuff just baffles me. The Mayans also had incredible knowledge of astronomy, and also most likely correlated their pyramids with stars in the sky during their time. </p>

<p>So the belief is that we lost most information and structure of this and many ancient advanced civilizations when the mini ice age happened around 10k years ago. It would have flooded coastal cities, which are usually the more populated areas. The flood in most ancient religious texts is probably referring to this. </p>

<p>And yeah, for the ancient alien hypothesis... Well I&#39;m still on the UFO kick, so I started to look into the AAH.  Sky people, star brothers (native americans), Ezekiel in the bible, The mahabarata tells of a silver-metal chariot that came down, so many names for people that descended from the sky. It&#39;s almost every single culture. <a href="http://lithiumdreamer.tripod.com/ufoart.html">There are plenty of paintings with flying saucers from 1700s and before.</a> So to me, it didn&#39;t take much to decide that if ET is checking us out now, they probably have been for a long time. Suddenly religions makes much more sense. </p>

<p>haha tl;dr i still have way too much free time and aliens.</p>

<p>If you have any free time, this is a pretty cool doc of a dude that&#39;s been looking for evidence for like 50 years: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5DNvYMtkyk">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5DNvYMtkyk</a></p>

<p>I agree it&#39;s useless to descend into personal and emotional arguments if we&#39;re attempting to be intellectual about things, so please take my above statement as pure jest to highlight how circular such petty indulgences become.  I am truly interested to hear what you believe about the origins of knowledge that the ancients had with regards to high level physics and geometry.</p>

<p>I do this frequently, because citations and evidence are extremely important when discussing non-mainstream ideas. Just because something doesn&#39;t fit with a traditional scientific/mainstream narrative does not excuse it from factual analysis.</p>

<p>There is a tendency in this subreddit (as evidenced by this thread) to fall into a &quot;only question the mainstream&quot; mentality. Blindly accepting every youtube video just because it questions the mainstream is no different than blindly accepting the mainstream narrative itself.</p>

<p>Your de facto hypothesis is that our modern knowledge is complete and not missing any knowledges that our ancestors possessed.

<p>Where do you think the technology behind these artifacts originated?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From uniquely insightful individuals ahead of their time. Their ideas were unfortunately perceived as novelties (as radio was initially seen centuries later), nothing more because the majority of people lacked the insight to see how those singular ideas could lead to other leaps in technology.</p>

<p>For example in the 12th century a man created a well organised factory system by gathering together all the weavers in a village under a single roof and structuring their work load. When he died, the whole system fell apart again. (There was a renaissance of sorts in the 12th century, but it could have been far more.)</p>

<p>There was <em>nothing</em> to stop anyone from implementing the same system, and bringing forth an earlier mini-Industrial Revolution, but as I said - he was ahead of his time, and some ideas have to wait for the rest of the world to catch up with them.</p>

<p>Regarding your point about the building of the pyramid - how many stone workers and stone masons do we have today? A lot of knowledge in this area was lost, simply because it has become <em>obsolete</em> or was never recorded, and has been supplanted by other techniques. This wasn&#39;t necessarily &quot;high technology&quot;, just different tricks of the trade which would have been in daily use.</p>

<p>For example I train with swords. Despite advances in metallurgy, no modern sword I&#39;ve ever wielded has surpassed a 450 year old singlesword I handled in the Royal Armouries. Why is that? Were aliens helping us make swords back then? No! Obviously not - but there are techniques and highly specialist knowledge involved in such crafts.</p>

<p>If you ever go to <a href="/r/engineering">/r/engineering</a>, try telling them that we might not be able to create the pyramids today, and they will be highly amused by it. If we wanted to do it, then we could certainly reproduce these structures, and ones superior to the originals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Breifly, I don&#39;t believe in a subconscious. What I think is the case, is that at a fundamental level the universe is a singular substance that is neither truly physical, or mental in nature, but gives rise to both (neutral monism) and that this fundamental &#39;material&#39; is what consciousness is comprised of. This would mean that consciousness is a fundamental property of the universe and that all existent things in it are in some way conscious (this is the panpsychism part). What I mean by consciousness, however, is not a commonsense description, which is being awake, or aware. To me consciousness is not synonomous with awareness and is not something that our brain does; it is informational states that our brains take advantage of to produce awareness (phenomenological experience). As an example: a rock is conscious in the sense that it&#39;s subatomic particles and the other various structures that comprise it&#39;s form are in an informational state such that when perceived by us (humans) we experience it as a rock. The rock does not have an aparatus to percieve (be aware of) itself, but there is still informational states that I would term consciousness. It&#39;s a hard distinction to explain, but one thing to keep in mind when thinking about this is that consciousness =/= awareness (and there is no subconscious, only unawareness). A, perhaps long, but really good read on panpsychism can be found at <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/panpsychism/">this</a> site, if you&#39;re interested. Hope this kinda explains my thoughts on the matter. The difference is many of the positions talked about on that site and others argue for some form of dualism and I do not, but don&#39;t let that bother you, philosophy is full of ideas :). </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Uhh... both?  So it&#39;s found &quot;across culture&quot;... I could argue that pi is found even more frequently &quot;across culture&quot; than phi is, as well as plenty of other ratios.  Why are you so hung up on this one?</p>

<p>And &quot;can describe matter at the planck level&quot;?  Uhh link please?  Do you even know what you&#39;re talking about at all?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You cannot doubt that nature aims to replicate Phi in most of it&#39;s proportions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes I can.  It&#39;s found in a lot of places in nature, sure, but far, <em>far</em> from <strong>most</strong> places.  Again, many other proportions turn up frequently in nature as well.  Why are you so hung up on phi?  Because Dan Brown told you to be?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our blood vessels are indeed fractal, as well as the pattern in which heart cells fire/neurons fire. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>They&#39;re approximate fractals.  They show self similarity.  If there&#39;s any noteworthy consistency in nature, it&#39;s self-similarity.  But this doesn&#39;t make Spirit Science&#39;s or Jason Padgett&#39;s words any less of a giant load of sensationalist, candy-coated tripe for the desperately irrational mind.</p>

<p>Now let&#39;s look at that link you sent me... at the end of the introduction:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, an additional aspect to the symbolism is to be found in the fact that the geometrical structure of crystallized water is also the basic structure of the Flower of Life.[citation needed]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t expect that citation to come anytime soon.  This is a perfect example of the many, many face-palmingly incorrect failures of logic that pervade the Jason Padgett-type pseudoscience mysticism out there.  Let&#39;s take five seconds and google a picture of the crystal structure of ice real quick:</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice#Characteristics">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice#Characteristics</a></p>

<p>Whoops!  It doesn&#39;t look anything like the &quot;flower of life&quot;.</p>

<p>If you had paid attention in high school chemistry, or if you had even picked up a simple chemistry book at some point in the past few years out of curiosity, you might have been able to spot this humiliatingly inaccurate statement.  But you didn&#39;t.  </p>

<p>Instead, you&#39;ve somehow managed to convince yourself that you&#39;re educated in the fields of math and science without having to put any work in, aside from presumably watching a couple of totally awesome history channel specials and a handful of crude youtube videos that made extraordinary claims without providing any extraordinary evidence.  You latch on to these indefensible conclusions because they &quot;feel&quot; right; because they put the world into terms that you are ready to agree with, and because they satisfy your deep-seated desire to feel like you understand the workings of the universe in a way that few others do - in the easiest way possible.  It must be really convenient to be able to see the world that way.  </p>

<p>You&#39;d have made a great Christian.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I fail to see your point. The symbol can clearly be found in several ancient cultures inscribed into countless timeless artifacts/structures. </p>

<p>What does that tell us? They enjoyed drawing circles? Clearly importance was placed onto the symbol because of the vast amount of knowledge it held including mathematics, geometry, musical harmonics, etc. Many ancient cultures knew the importance of the symbol. They idolized it for it. To say that they didn&#39;t is idiotic to me. </p>

<p>But I guess because we have a modern children&#39;s toy that can replicate it negates thousands of years of archaeological evidence.</p>
