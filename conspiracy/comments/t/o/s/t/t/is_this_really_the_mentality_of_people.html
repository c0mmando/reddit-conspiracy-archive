        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>One of my facebook friends (yeah i know, i shouldn&#39;t be using facebook) said this today, which i am pretty sure is directed towards me because i posted the link to the article about Chicago and the possible False-Flag event. </p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m not going to go into a long rant about this, but if you think President Obama is a socialist, fascist, communist, preparing to make us a police state, the Anti-Christ, ushering in the apocalypse, or whatever bullshit, moronic statement that I keep hearing than not only do you not know what any of these terms mean, but you have the collective intelligence of a brain dead house cat. If you don&#39;t agree with his views or politics than so be it. But just because a politician has opposing viewpoints than you that doesn&#39;t mean he/she is going to destroy America. Accusations such as the ones made against him and others are what&#39;s destroying America. I can&#39;t believe that I even have to make this blatantly obvious post. For fuck&#39;s sake, people!&quot;</p>

<p>This was my response to him:</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, i am sure people who supported Nixon thought he could do no wrong either. People forget that Obama is a man and man is not only fallible but corruptible. You sound so positive that NOTHING is going on behind your back only because you support someone. Since he has been in office, there have been BLATANT changes to our national security and movements towards a policed state. If you can&#39;t see that, then i am sorry. Like i said, i am sure Nixon and his cabinet had supporters who would throw off anything bad being said about him because they believed in him and how he was a good person, and we see what happened with him don&#39;t we.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s pointless. He is saying that if the information comes from a blog then it is not true. I could show him all these links and he would not believe anything. He is so far gone up Obama&#39;s ass that he can&#39;t see the light. he called me a right wing nut job basically. I am neither right nor left....i am for truth and want the American people to be treated fair.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many of those links aren&#39;t &quot;blogs.&quot;  Some are even &quot;reputable&quot; progressive media that a typical Obama supporter should respect.  Atlantic Monthly. Huffington Post. Wired. New York Times. There&#39;s even a whitehouse.gov link in there. </p>

<p>However, If you posted the article that was from <a href="http://axiomatica.org/whats-happening-right-now/oligarchy/1555-obama-administration-to-stage-reichstag-event-as-trigger-for-martial-law-dhs-source-warns">axiomatica</a> that&#39;s on r/conspiracy today then I can see how and why he is attacking you. A lot of that has the rhetoric similar to tea party lines like &quot;The intensely close co-ordination of seemingly separate entities confirmed the suspicions of many that communist agents had infiltrated major institutions, organizations, and trade unions, and were working together to sabotage America.&quot;  The web is so far above communism or just Obama that that article seems very shortsighted.

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t post threads like this, in this sub, expecting people to disagree with you.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know who you are though, so I apologize that I&#39;ve offended you deeply enough that you make personal attacks on me, for offering a suggestion.</p>

<p>&quot;HEY BUDDY!!! You got any suggestions?&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah, my post was a suggestion. You&#39;re essentially asking a rhetorical question by posting this here, because you&#39;re targeting an audience that is typically on your side. If you want to know &quot;if this is really the mentality of people&quot; you should post this in multiple sub-reddits to see other opinions, and deduce your own reasoning from that.</p>

<p>Rather than take your own opinion, get a large majority of opinions that you know will agree with yours, and use that to further back up your disdain for your facebook friend&#39;s comment.</p>

<p>&quot;You don&#39;t want an answer, you want people to agree with you.&quot;. WHAT!!?? LOL,  dude you are funny. See the thing is that when i said HEY BUDDY!! i wasn&#39;t being angry..it was like when you see someone you know walking down the road (hard to get tone of speach through the PC, i know) and when i asked for suggestions, well, i wanted to know what subs you thought i should send it to. </p>

<p>But you lost me where you think that people can&#39;t disagree on this sub. maybe that is because of your own experiences and that is understandable. Also lost me when you tried to assume why i was posting this....if you can also tell me what color my eyes are then i might change my opinion of what i think you are to LEVEL: PSYCHIC. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For some people, i think it either is part of their comfort zone not to question and constantly obey and believe and also there is the fact that some people are staunch Democrat or Staunch Republican and can&#39;t see past that. It is like government has created segregation by use of political parties. I have said this before, but i feel that the government knew this when it created the political party system, they knew that even though it says &quot;A nation divided can not stand&quot; they created a way to divide us which makes it all the more easier for take-over or control.  This has been a military strategy for a long time....divide your enemy and it makes them easier to destroy.</p>

<p>I mean think about some of the things associated with both groups and what people assume if you said you were something. For instance, tell someone you have a firm belief in Christianity and they will automatically assume you are Republican...tell someone you support pro-choice, then you are automatically assumed to be Democrat. They have created clicks and then found items to push in order to cause even more division.  </p>
