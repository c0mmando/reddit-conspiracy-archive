    <div class="md"><p>I heard it on good authority that he really does believe - literally - in the blood-sucking-baby-eating-shape-shifting interdimensional lizard people. I was told by someone who met him [the person has yet to decieve me so I accept that he really did meet Icke] I was told that Icke got upset at the assertion that Icke might think of these in metaphorical terms. Icke became huffy and said that they were most certainly real.</p>

<p>Icke is either batshit crazy or a rube. Either way I don&#39;t really care. He unknowingly helped me through a rough time and I still feel like I owe him on some cosmic level. It&#39;s a little embarrassing to listen to him now and again, but at least he cares enough to talk about what he&#39;s interested in. I think that&#39;s fucking huge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find Icke very articulate and intelligent. Most of what he says, I agree with. As for the reptilians, Icke made one vital observation that few others in the Truth Movement ever reach ... he asked himself, if there really is a giant conspiracy leading to a New World Order, who is leading it? He looked around, and he couldn&#39;t find anybody who he could pinpoint as the supreme leader. He found a lot of officers, but the commander remained hidden.</p>

<p>His leap of understanding was the speculation that these supreme leaders are not human beings. Sure, human beings are carrying out the plan of the New World Order, but they are not the ones who devised this plan. Icke identified these leaders as reptilian, shape-shifting aliens, and this put a lot of people off.</p>

<p>He got this idea because reptiles figure so prominently as gods and devils throughout all of human history and mythology. The wise serpent, talking dragons, flying serpents, the oroboros, the  great serpent of chaos that encircles the world ... lots and lots of lizards or lizard-types in myths. Lots of lizard carvings, paintings, sculptures, and so on, all around the ancient world.</p>

<p>But Icke&#39;s focus on reptilians turned people away from his teachings. That was too bad, because most of those teachings are worth considering. Even the idea of reptilians is worth considering, if you think about it in the right way.</p>

<p>No, he got the idea because he channels spirits and &quot;ascended masters&quot; and this is part of the story they tell him, in their mission to deceive the human race. Just like David Wilcock, Michael Tsarion etc. Do your damn research.</p>

I can&#39;t say that I would make the connection in my own belief structure, though it is a &#39;fluid document&#39; of sorts...
The Luciferian cults and Royal bloodlines on the other hand, that&#39;s a dynastic match made in heaven.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He would say:</p>

<p>&quot;It ain&#39;t the Jews, mate.&quot;</p>

<p>Even if it were exclusively Jews at the very top (which he does not believe - and neither do I) they still need to get the rest of the population to bend to their whims. Which means all of the non-Jews must participate and endorse the views / plans / machinations of the Jews.</p>

<p>But, no, Icke does not believe it is limited to Jews any more than it&#39;s limited to white people, Christians, males or heterosexuals. All of the above and more are &#39;in on it&#39; if you think about it in terms of participation. By using their money you&#39;re participating in their scemes. Think about that.</p>

<p>The solutions are not in pointing fingers.</p>

<p>The solutions are in living a better life.</p>

<p>The bloodlines thing is very interesting to me right now. </p>

<p>Rh refers to the rheses monkey. People with a blood-type of Rh negative have the monkey gene turned off. This mutation / aberration is very strange as it does not occur in any other primate. And remember - this is a <em>turning off</em> of the monkey gene. 15% of humans have this genetic aberration. And guess where the majority of this occurrence is? Yes, white people. Europeans. With a high concentration inthe Basques in Northern Spain. The Basques, by the by, are where the Picts / Scots / Irish came from. I don&#39;t know if David Icke talks about this, but it&#39;s worth a look.</p>

<p>So far my favorite thing about this Rh Negative blood type thing is that an Rh Negative mother will often reject an Rh Positive foetus. Think about that. The system with the monkey gene turned off will attack the system with the monkey gene turned on. Like it was an alien or something. A buddy of mine is Rh Positive and his mother is Rh Negative. She had to go on special medication to keep him. Without modern medicine he would not be alive.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a hell of a thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Google: They Dare Not Speak Its Name</p>

<p>It&#39;s an excellent presentation by Icke in which he (during the first five minutes) cuts through the symbolic speech and clarifies precisely what he&#39;s been discussing. One of the things he states in that first five minutes is that he&#39;s not talking about things &quot;the Jews&quot; are doing, rather... that the Jews are actually victims of what&#39;s being done. I think it&#39;s about an hour long video, but I may be mistaken.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After watching &quot;Beyond the Cutting Edge&quot; with a friend, she made a good point to me. David Icke may be sprinkling some crazy into his presentations on purpose for the sake of staying on the fringe, because it&#39;s much safer there.</p>

<p>If he goes to explain how a 1984 type of society is unfolding before us (as it truly is) and how the upper crusts of political and financial power are controlled by a small number of long running dynastic families and pyramid schemes (as also certainly seems to be the case) the people he is talking about will be quite angry at the exposure. However, if he then goes on to wrap it up in absurd analogies regarding inter-dimensional reptoids, and trying to pass it off as LITERAL, he is just going to look like a crazy man.</p>

<p>I take the more insane parts of his presentations as a clever metaphor. He massages the info in a way that enables him to give out some extremely valuable messages that can stick with the public, and then metaphorically shits himself in public to seem like a lunatic who is of no real threat.</p>

<p>The closest he has come to explaining the reptoid stuff in a plain manner has been talks regarding the &quot;lizard brain&quot; and such. It&#39;s plain science and it&#39;s easy enough for average people to absorb. I admire the work he does, but I also understand why he would not want to go and spell it all out plainly and bluntly all the time and end up going the way of RFK or John Lennon. There is safety in obscurity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most amazing coincidence and insanely tuned variables in the known universe is right up in our sky every single day.</p>

<p>The sun is about 400 times the size of the moon. But it also happens to be about 400 times farther away, lining the two up from our vantage point on the Earth to make them appear exactly the same size on average.</p>

<p>The moon&#39;s orbit also happens to coincide with it&#39;s rotation in a way where only one side is ever facing the Earth.</p>

<p>I am not going to go so far as to say that this is all because the moon is some type of &quot;matrix transmitter&quot; akin to to television tower in &quot;They Live&quot; but it is an amazing set of coincidences. Of all the different ways natural satellites can form, orbit and rotate their parent planet, the fact that the moon&#39;s relation to Earth and the sun is the way it is seems astronomically unlikely to me.</p>

<p>Is the Earth&#39;s moon different from Jupiter&#39;s moons? Are they all secret hollow bases where our slave masters can watch us from?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can&#39;t say I&#39;d stretch it that far, but the formation of the moon is still undecided on in modern science. There are excepted theories, but as well all know, most theories remain just that. Like gravity. It&#39;s a law that governs us in a myriad of ways. 
But as to explaining &#39;why&#39; it exists, again: theory.</p>

<p>And look where theories have carried us? We have been able to construct the entire architecture for modern physics out of evidence that can either be denied or completely understood.</p>

<p>Without being open to wild ideas, we as a sentient species cannot progress.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to be careful when talking about theories in science. A theory is one of the highest levels you can achieve. Hence the theory of gravity. It will never be replaced. The theory of gravity precisely explains how gravity works, but not why. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He channels spirits and that&#39;s where a lot of his info comes from. Lots of other theorists are also doing this and their stories are all more or less the same. David Wilcock for example. I can&#39;t think of any others who are popular lately but a lot of these theorists are doing it, just search for something like &quot;(name) channeling&quot; or &quot;(name) ascended masters&quot; or whatever, you guys probably know the terminology already so just be vigilant and you&#39;ll see how widespread this is. These spirits or whatever they are (some call them aliens), they&#39;re in contact with everybody, all these teachers are just repeating the things they say, preparing people for 2012 or the new age or whatever their particular theory decides to call it, but it&#39;s all the same and they seem to be purposely using these teachers and stories to deceive/control the human race. Keep an eye out and you will notice this is true, it&#39;s impossible to miss if you&#39;re looking for it.</p>

<p>an agenda</p>

<p>i dont think aj does it for money either, he is there for a reason. he is a gatekeeper that only talks about certain things and not others. also he is to appear crazy so that anyone who talks about the same things can be dismissed as crazy as well. thats why david icke mixes the truth with aliens to discredit people who talk about this stuff. dont let him keep you in space, come back to earth so we can deal with the problems here</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Talking about aliens or Exopoliics as many might refer to it, is still considered passé, I will concur, but is it really that far fetched?</p>

<p>Whether it&#39;s &quot;channeling&quot; or being visited so to speak, these people believe they are getting insights from a higher source. I can&#39;t discredit them. Delusions or grandure? Maybe. Regardless, we can all agree there are forces behind the veil of reality that seem to guide circumstances or people(s) for many an age.</p>

<p>I dont think it&#39;s wise to discredit the mystical. I also don&#39;t think it wise to believe everything heard as complete truth.</p>

<p>I see his &#39;teachings&#39; as more of a stepping stone to opening up to wild possibilities.</p>
