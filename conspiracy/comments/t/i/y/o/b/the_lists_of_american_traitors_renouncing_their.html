<p>Update (February 2, 2012): Josh Gerstein of Politico notes that Anna Getty, an heir to the Getty oil fortune, appears to be on the latest list of expatriates. source <a href="http://intltax.typepad.com/intltax_blog/2012/02/number-of-expatriates-for-2011.html">http://intltax.typepad.com/intltax_blog/2012/02/number-of-expatriates-for-2011.html</a> )</p>

<p>&quot;In recent decades, a handful of members of the Getty clan are believed to have renounced their U.S. citizenship for tax reasons. At least seven, including Anna Getty&#39;s stepfather, obtained Irish nationality under an investments-for-passports type scheme that has since been abolished, according to Irish press reports.</p>

<p>The list of American taxpayers who have renounced citizenship is published quarterly by the IRS in accordance with a federal law passed in 1996.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I plan on renouncing mine some day.</p>

<p>I feel sick when I see exactly how much is taken out in taxes, when I know full well what it&#39;s going to.</p>

<p>Watching American media -- you see missiles being launched and bombs being dropped.  With the international media, though -- you see where they land.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to be part of the system that not only oppresses so much of its own citizens but also kills so many around the globe.</p>

<p>I know you guys would rather see people with similar feelings stay and try to change things, but other than raising awareness on the issues, there&#39;s not much we can really do.  </p>

<p>As we seen with Ron Paul, if we had a candidate who really was going to change things, they would never make it onto the ballot or into the debates of a general election.  Either they will be screwed over during the primaries, or relegated to a 3rd party run with no ballot/debate access.</p>

It&#39;s rare that a large fortune earned in the US did not take some sort of public subsidy along the way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whats wrong with renouncing your citizenship?  If you don&#39;t plan on living in the US then it makes very good sense to do so thanks to overreaching tax laws.</p>

<p>Also not a conspiracy and doesn&#39;t belong here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If America really was a free country, it would be very simple to completely renounce your citizenship. The fact that it isn&#39;t, should make you realise that although that you can physically leave the country, your soul belongs to the US government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These people for the most part are revoking their citizenship because they don&#39;t want to pay future taxes after they have enjoyed the protection and social benefits of earning and living in the country.</p>

<p>Here&#39; to hoping they all get captured by Somali pirates and they have to raise their own navy to get themselves rescued.</p>

<p>Also I nee no reason our military should be used to protect any of their foreign interests anymore. do you?</p>

<p>In fact as a now SEPARATE nation we should do everything in our power to figure out a way to seize those now FOREIGN ASSETS for the good of OUR country.</p>
