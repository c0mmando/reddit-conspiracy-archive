       Update (February 2, 2012): Josh Gerstein of Politico notes that Anna Getty, an heir to the Getty oil fortune, appears to be on the latest list of expatriates. source

       )
      </p>
      <p>
       "In recent decades, a handful of members of the Getty clan are believed to have renounced their U.S. citizenship for tax reasons. At least seven, including Anna Getty's stepfather, obtained Irish nationality under an investments-for-passports type scheme that has since been abolished, according to Irish press reports.
      </p>
      <p>
       The list of American taxpayers who have renounced citizenship is published quarterly by the IRS in accordance with a federal law passed in 1996."

       I plan on renouncing mine some day.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel sick when I see exactly how much is taken out in taxes, when I know full well what it's going to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watching American media -- you see missiles being launched and bombs being dropped.  With the international media, though -- you see where they land.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want to be part of the system that not only oppresses so much of its own citizens but also kills so many around the globe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know you guys would rather see people with similar feelings stay and try to change things, but other than raising awareness on the issues, there's not much we can really do.
      </p>
      <p>
       As we seen with Ron Paul, if we had a candidate who really was going to change things, they would never make it onto the ballot or into the debates of a general election.  Either they will be screwed over during the primaries, or relegated to a 3rd party run with no ballot/debate access.

       My guess is they did take some of your money.
It's rare that a large fortune earned in the US did not take some sort of public subsidy along the way.

       Whats wrong with renouncing your citizenship?  If you don't plan on living in the US then it makes very good sense to do so thanks to overreaching tax laws.

       Also not a conspiracy and doesn't belong here.

       If America really was a free country, it would be very simple to completely renounce your citizenship. The fact that it isn't, should make you realise that although that you can physically leave the country, your soul belongs to the US government.

       These people for the most part are revoking their citizenship because they don't want to pay future taxes after they have enjoyed the protection and social benefits of earning and living in the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here' to hoping they all get captured by Somali pirates and they have to raise their own navy to get themselves rescued.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I nee no reason our military should be used to protect any of their foreign interests anymore. do you?
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact as a now SEPARATE nation we should do everything in our power to figure out a way to seize those now FOREIGN ASSETS for the good of OUR country.
