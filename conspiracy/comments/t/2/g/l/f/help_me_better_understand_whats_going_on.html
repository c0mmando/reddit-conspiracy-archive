       So I've only recently stumbled upon the whole conspiracy thing. Before I was just another sheep. I thought 9/11 was an actual terrorist attack and so on. I wanna know what everyone else knows. Where can I get the most information. Not only the most, but also the info with sources and proof. For example, I just found out that our Federal Reserve is a private company. I'm wondering what else I'm ignorant of. So please, let me know any and everything you know about, well, about anything. 9/11, Bin Laden, Fema camps, HAARP, and the Bilderberg group to name a few. I don't know much about those either so please provide as much info and links that you can. Thanks for helping out a fellow conspiracist.

       Out of curiosity, what woke you up?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no single source for the answers to everything for you.  The more I learn, the more I realize I know very little.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recommend reading and questioning whatever you find interesting.  I am surprised how many people I know that are awake.  I didn't know they were awake until I woke up.  Try talking to close friends you trust.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am reading a very informative book about the Fed called "The Creature From Jekyl Island.". It is easy to read, but I warn it is massive.  About 800 pages, I believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck.  Share what you find with others.  I believe a massive worldwide awakening is underway.  You are now a part of it.

       Thanks for the advice. I wasn't even sure I would get any replies on this. And I actually woke up when my Gov't teacher required the class to do a project over a conspiracy. There was a list we chose from and I got the Illuminati. It was so interesting and intriguing that I had to learn more.

       Sounds like a cool teacher.  I am 30 yrs old now.  Was a naive young guy.  Have a poly sci degree from a good school.  Thought the gov't acted in the best interests of the people.  Hated GWBush.  Voted for Hope and Change.  Wanted peace and freedom.  Watched too much tv.  Read the papers front to back daily.  Realized too late Obama was no different from GWB once I saw him carrying out the same agenda.  Started looking for answers and fell into the rabbit hole.  Welcome.

       Yeah that sounds kinda like my dad. He was always very interested in news and politics as I was growing up, and as I'm finding out these same things I'll go and tell him what I learned. He says that he already knows everything I'm telling him but that we can't do anything about it. Sometimes I think he's right too.

       You can do something about it.  Inform people you care about.  Maybe someday, it will reach a tipping point once enough of us see what is going on and disengage from the false narrative.

       I am not even angry when I get laughed at.  I feel sorry for them.  Many people I know basically say, "I feel the same but was afraid to talk about it.". Or they feel helpless, so they keep their beliefs to themselves.  We need to come out of the shadows.

       Amen. I have been wanting to write stand up around to inform people. But I'm not funny and people just don't want to hear about it. I find planting seeds are the best way. Don't HAARP on about stuff just drop nuggets of knowledge into their worlds

       I always had a really bad feeling about Obama from the get go. I think maybe it was the way he talks that got me. For the longest time i knew of these conspiracies, but thought that's all they were. It was about a year ago I actually connected the dots and woke up. I look back and dont know how i could of been so blind with it all starring me in the face.

       Jose Escamilla has some awesome docs out there about ET's. Here is moon rising, but I suggest doing a search as he has a few others. Moon rising is my favorite.

       It's not fictional. I included it because few people realize how Hawaii came to be a U.S. possession. Most of it is her autobiography but the later chapters detail the greed and corruption of the U.S. business interests leading to the U.S. invasion.

       As an aside, I believe the creator of September clues admonishes the creator of loose change for a deceptive documentary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recommending them both together seems silly, I have seen both and September Clues is much more down to earth and less speculative; It simply analyses the news footage and dissects it, eventually declatring it fake.  IIRC, he does not strongly put forth a "gospel truth" of what happened on that day, merely an excellent review of what did NOT happen that day- demolishing the original story and leaving the rest to the audience.

       Wow I didn't know that. I don't know the politics behind the films but loose change is a nice general idea why the conspiracy exists in the first place. I found September Clues a few months ago, it think it perfectly caps the entire conspiracy. The only thing left of course is the money trail...  Honestly if I had only one movie to show to somebody, I'd show them September Clues.

       As you were looking into the Illuminati, I feel you should watch a couple of videos:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) David Icke: The Truth Behind Theology and Christianity
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WhbP3JHqJw">
        www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WhbP3JHqJw
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever you heard about Icke or whatever everyone may tell you about him, set it aside and make your own opinion - this also applies to everything you will encounter from now on.
      </p>
      <p>
       This video covers a lot of things, mostly the Sumerian/Babylonian origins of the major religions, and the dynasty that was and still is running things up to this day, and the symbolism they use.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Robert Morning Sky - The Terra Papers pt 01
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb0SOzYeRzs">
        www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb0SOzYeRzs
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       There used to be the whole video on Youtube once, try and find the part where he tells what he found about the Egyptian origins of the Rothschild and Rockefeller dynasties.
It starts with accounts of what ancient "gods" did in the past. They weren't gods, they were physical beings with an incredible ego.
      </p>
      <p>
       About the Rothschild and the Rockefeller: if I remember correctly, it happened during Ra's reing over Egypt. Perhaps you've heard of Louis XIV, aka the French "Sun King". Well, spoiler alert, he wasn't a deity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ra wasn't either.
Apparently he divided his power and money, I think it was his wealth to his children, the RA-KA'AM - Ra's children (RA-"of"-"children");, which later became RA-KAM, "Ra's shield")
      </p>
      <p>
       He gave his administrative power to the RA-KA-PEIRA or something. It meant in Egyptian "RA's Pharaohs." It became later the "RAKAPHARAOS".
      </p>
      <p>
       So basically around 8,000 years ago, the two most influencial families in the world were the Rakapharaohs and the Ra's childs. Rockefeller, Rothschild? ;)
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a lot more things to look up of course, but I felt those were really relevant. Happy hunting!

       dude, google goes along way, knowledge is worth more when it's earned, and why would you want someone to tell you what to think. do some research and learn to disseminate for your self. besides it'll help your critical thinking skills.

       Thanks for the advice. I wasn't even sure I would get any replies on this. And I actually woke up when my Gov't teacher required the class to do a project over a conspiracy. There was a list we chose from and I got the Illuminati. It was so interesting and intriguing that I had to learn more.
