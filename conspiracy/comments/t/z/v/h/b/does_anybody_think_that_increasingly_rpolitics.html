       Every single day now there are articles coming out on the mainstream subreddits that seem to be like a snapshot of what r/conspiracy was some years ago.  There is constant news of spying technology being implemented and the NWO legislations are hitting at an increased clip now.  On the street level I still find people to be only marginally more up to speed, but at least on the Internet it seems that the general world view that I have been holding for ten years now is becoming more and more popular.  It seems that people at least on reddit are really becoming aware of the stuff that is now present - the things that many of us were worried about 5-10 years ago.  Obviously our base here is cutting edge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even a few days ago I posted on r/politics about Zionism, CNN (ZNN) and I received 25 upvotes.  Some years ago that would have been extremely impossible.  Of course a few Jews came out and replied to me, but they were mostly cordial and did not down vote me.  As far as the extremist megaphone Zionist hive minder types, well it seems to me that they might be running a bit thin in numbers these days to keep up with all of the criticism.  There are not a terribly large number of them to follow all of the blogs and posting everywhere on the Internet.  They are trying to infiltrate everywhere but I don't believe that they are being successful now.  I'm sure that now they are trying to silence specific facts and highly strategic criticism but they really do not seem to have the numbers anymore to endless harass anyone who is merely critical.

       The Hasbara gang will only hit a subreddit if they can control the results of posts. If they sense that the general mood is strongly against Zionism, and their efforts to downvote posts out of existence are being met with solid upvoting, they give up and move on to a subreddit where they can control posts. They've pretty much given up trying to control r/conspiracy, because they've realized that they cannot control it.

       It is disquieting, to be honest it makes me uncomfortable. On the one hand, I see, more people than ever coming to understand the nature and function of the man behind the curtain, and on the other, I see his grip on power not waning but growing faster, steadily and uncontested. Nowhere is this better exemplified than
       <em>
        Occupy Wall Street's
       </em>
       use of
       <em>
        facebook

       I think that it is for now a positive thing that the elites are trying to push everything through at once.  They know that their window of opportunity is small because we are waking up.  The society was terribly asleep before.  We didn't actually have power.  If you follow it through that they could transform the visible part of the society this quickly then the "people" never really were in the strategic positions of power to begin with, at least definitely in any of our lifetimes.  We know that they have had Bilderberg and the Feds running things for a hundred years at least.  They just had other priorities than to shut our economy down and make our lives more difficult.  They didn't want that.  They wanted to grow.  Now they have most of what they want and they want everything to collapse.  So it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'm over here in Ukraine and every fucking person knows how to use bittorent to download movies and games, even chicks ;).  Its like email to them.  So (fucking coincidentally) around the same time that ACTA and SOPA were hitting hard the Ukrainian government decided to shut down some file sharing websites.  Next thing that you know the Ukrainian hackers (allegedly) were taking down the main governments servers.  They weren't able to do shit for days and days.  The hackers basically shut down the government!  So the government actually caved in to hackers and restored the download servers to operation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the US is much more wired up.  So they can't just shut the Internet down and the population isn't buying the copyright mafia bullshit (, whom I think are almost entirely functioning as Internet shutdown mercenaries for the elites).  Well they can't just go from this to full on chip in your ass so they are going to need to creep.  Fuck though then they have to juggle the exact speed at which the US economy collapses, because if it collapses too quickly then they can't pay for the US military and if doesn't collapse then you won't get their change.  So they have to go at this particular pace and it must be just maddening for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think about it from their perspective it would be nice to be able to complete their control grid along with chipping and all of that stuff with zero resistance. Well as they approached their end goal the level of intelligence, life experience, education and wealth needed to be capable of identifying the agenda has gone down considerably.  I believe that three years from now only the most inept, unintelligent, immoral and lazy people will unable to recognize that the society is approaching or has already arrived at economic desolation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that we need to keep pushing hard and making them show their hand.  If we were doing everything that they wanted already then it would all be very orderly.  We would just hand them our money and go line up (, well some did that at the Facebook IPO).  Its mostly not that easy for them.  When we apply resistance they are forced to show more people the ugly side of our civilization.  Fortunately at this stage we don't need to do anything other than refuse to be treated as property.  In the later parts there will be room for different tactics.

       I wasn't trying to detract from your post, or disagree with it. While what was once
       <em>
        conspiracy
       </em>
       becomes main stream news, the overall attitude of people on reddit (as well as those I come in contact with) seems to be one of acceptance and defense of the status quo. Take the "Gift for Troops" drive sponsored by reddit HQ. You've been a contributor to this community for years, would you describe that blog post as normal behavior? I found it to be really creepy, personally.

       I don't know about Gift for Troops, I'll pass though on buying a gift for them.  That sounds like it was created not by the community here but by some head in the sand executive.  This is run by a corporation.  Reddit itself is probably another example of how the power base can't just completely control things.  If they shut down this site or a particular community here then we would just go somewhere else.  So its better for them to watch and record us.  Its mostly silly though because its all publicly accessible words by nature.

       it became too easy to verify things independently. also, the idea that a cabal of assholes was destroying/running the planet seemed a little absurd to most people: why blame conspiracy when stupidity covered most of it?

       it is now commonly understood that people at the nodes of networks have great influence, and it is easy to demonstrate their influence by googling and way back machining, whereas in the Wilhelm reich days they just threw you in prison, discredited you in front of your peers, then chucked your effects into an incinerator. bac then, people would be like:'cool story bro'

       now: well, no shit they are assraping us with a piece of splintered balsa wood. in fact, they are raping us in ways we never imagined, and probably can't imagine. the surprise has worn off, and after the concept of viral marketing really got around, it is only llogical to assume it is a government plant. in fact, it is logical to assume i work for the govt, and vice-versa.

       Dude you have to keep your bio consistent. A few months back you posted that you were just 17 years old. Now you are talking about "the general world view that I have been holding for ten years now" and "the things that many of us were worried about 5-10 years ago". What happened to you at age 7?

       Nope.  I'm older than 17.  You must be confused.  I'm assuming that you are the same person as the old IamJulianAssange.  We messaged a few times and had a conversation in a posting.  So well, I'm older than that.  I'm trying to think of a number 17 that has any significance in my life and I can't seem to come up with one.

       Yes, this sub is the hipster master of the universe.

       You came up with all of this before anyone else, and the rest of Reddit should feel better knowing that this sub is here to let everyone know what to be afraid of in the future.

       Similar to the KONY thread that was made here a couple weeks ago, where people in here were trying to take credit for thinking that it was a scam, when PLENTY of non conspirators thought it was a scam as well.

       I was part of that thread and the point I tried to make, but which got mischaracterized just like ^ this ^ was:
      </p>
      <p>
       On the day that first KONY2012 video went viral,
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       it was posted to any other subreddits attempting to scam them, it was posted
       <em>
        here
       </em>
       first with a headline
       <em>
        identifying it as a scam
       </em>
       . And, I think this often gets overlooked about our subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       We were the first to have the scam video posted in our subreddit - and it was posted
       <em>
        as a suspected scam
       </em>
       , not as a "hey make this go viral" ploy. So, while the rest of reddit was arguing about whether or not it was a scam, we were discussing what, specifically, the scam was and sharing that info with mainstream reddit when they got hit with it hours later.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a very precise and specific example of how we don't get credit for what we do here. Sure, other people (non r/conspiracy subscribers) suspected it was a scam, but... my point was that we not only were the first to report it
       <em>
        as a scam
       </em>
       , but we did so
       <em>
        before it hit the rest of reddit
       </em>
       for them to even discuss.

       That should take you to the oldest posts in r/conspiracy about kony2012. Looks like all of them from the outset are "this is a scam" posts. Every. Single. One. i.e., it was never posted here "to scam", but only "reported as a scam".
      </p>
      <p>
       And, for what it's worth, I did this search once before, not restricted to just r/conspiracy, and there's now a post missing... it was the first posting of the video, before bokmal's and before Perignis' self-post... the very first posting of the video
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       in r/conspiracy, now removed for whatever reason, and I can't remember the username who posted it, but it was one of the recognizable long-timers who posted it here like Kranky_Old_Dude [not him, but someone like that].

       So you were the first ones to get the video, but no one gives you credit?
      </p>
      <p>
       Doesn't that kind of disagree with the notion that you guys aren't getting credit for what you do?
      </p>
      <p>
       And to me, I don't know, the whole situation is really strange.. A lot of the comments on the youtube video were about potential scams, everyone I know in person, or online, thought it was a scam.. Any research into Invisible Children revealed the idea of a scam..
      </p>
      <p>
       The only people who thought it was a super real thing to get concerned about were the same type of people who post bogus stories in this sub where someone talks in an ominous voice and tells them what to think.

       Not if it's one of our regulars, spotting it on the horizon and bringing it here. i.e., It wasn't delivered here by a KONY2012 shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       And while you can argue to discredit and trivialize what we do here all you want, those of us who've been watching the trends over the last 3-4 years know good and well that we get breaking news here and we break stories open here (amid all the other bizarre and edgy things we do). KONY2012 is just one example which actually has timestamps on the submissions and their titles (i.e., when and how it was submitted).
      </p>
      <p>
       Just curious, if you have such little appreciation for what we do, why do you come here? Seems like the only motivation, if you disrespect us that much, is to be a PITA.

       This sub seems to have every single possible thing that could ever be considered possibly maybe even potentially a conspiracy. That's fine, it's /conspiracy, but when things that are totally common, or not even close to a conspiracy, I don't know how those show up.

       This is not a rant. This is me standing my ground against an affront you have presented to the way this community has asked me to perform my moderator duties. This subreddit (you, apparently, being one of the 3 or 4 exceptions out of 60,000) has insisted that they be allowed to determine (via their votes) which submissions are relevant. Which means... we get a LOT of submissions that
       <strong>
        aren't
       </strong>
       ... which, in turn, has you complaining about
       <strong>
        those
       </strong>
       submissions.
      </p>
      <p>
       And while I didn't want to have to go this far, because it might possibly encourage you to look for the few fluke exceptions and shove them in my face... nonetheless... I want you to compare the "hot" tab to the "new" tab. You're bitching about the "new" tab, while the community is
       <em>
        creating
       </em>
       the "hot" tab. (and  yes, sometimes the "hot" tab actually has stuff in it being debunked - so the headline and/or story isn't being lauded, it's being shredded - By. This. Community.)
      </p>

       No. What I'm saying is that your complaint is tired. It's the same one that keeps recurring among new people (migrants from digg, 4chan, etc). You are either:
      </p>
      <p>
       a) new to reddit, or
      </p>
      <p>
       b) just bitter and like to complain.
      </p>
      <p>
       You completely dodged the point I was making.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is reddit. This is how reddit was designed from the ground up. Submit, vote, comment. Your message, no matter what words you choose to state it, is: I don't like what's submitted here.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you dodged the whole issue of
       <strong>
        how reddit works
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       PROTIP: I didn't get your PM (which your words claim you sent). If you choose to PM me, I'll have the opportunity to add you to my ignore list. (That's another new feature of
       <strong>
        how reddit works
       </strong>
       .) As long as it remains public, everyone gets to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, you are quite wrong about this delving off-topic. By staying true to the reddit format, pointing out shillery in our smaller subreddit, etc. we're having an influence on mainstream dialog, somewhat slowly and delayed. But we're having an influence nonetheless. And, all of this is happening despite the fact that some people (you, apparently being one of them) are only able to see what they feel are our shortcomings, which they then amplify as though they are life threatening, when in actuality they're just the chaff of reddit - It's like saying "damn, I love pomegranates, but I hate the seeds".

       I was in the process of PMing you when I got a phone call, my apologies.
      </p>
      <p>
       here's where I was in the middle of my sentence:
      </p>
      <p>
       "I don't read the new tab, it's frustrating. I read a lot of those comments and go, what in the hell?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe I'm just in the wrong sub, but I like to see legitimate discussion about actual conspiracies, a lot of the topics are flooded with misinformation and obvious racism, and I'm not the only one who has noticed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying anyone needs to be censored, and I find it slightly humorous that you say that because I just had a conversation with someone in PM last night about this, and this is what ANOTHER USER who posts in conspiracy a lot had to say;
      </p>
      <p>
       "Ugh. This kind of crazy eliminates the need for shills. You just point it out to any sane person and say "Hey, look at this." What's sad is it's still one of the better conspiracy forums. If I were a mod I'd delete so much of this crap they'd think I was satanist in the employ of every bugaboo in the book."
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand it's a free forum, and that it's Reddit. I FULLY GET THAT. I have said that in numerous comments, you could see that in my comment history..
      </p>
      <p>
       What I don't get is, why people are upvoting blatant misinformation, or stories that are easily proven false?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying I'm a genius, I'm saying the EXACT opposite. I'm saying that "
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously an incomplete thought, because, I was doing something else.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand how reddit works, I TOTALLY FUCKING GET IT. I have explained that I get it in numerous posts, including in this sub, to another moderator.
      </p>
      <p>
       My post isn't a complaint to YOU, or Moderators, my post is a complaint to all the people here who wonder why people around reddit think SO negatively about this sub, but still post misinformation and bullshit stories that are so easily debunked, that all you would need to do is do a google search, instead of coming in from that 10,000 view youtube video that's been online for 3 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       I post in threads I agree with, I post in threads that I think are bullshit threads, and I ignore all the other ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not dodging any point you're making, I don't understand why you feel you deserve any sort of actual response when you start off your statement saying:
      </p>
      <p>
       "But everything about the totality of what you says is more like this."
      </p>
      <p>
       When you start off a 'discussion' by putting words in my mouth, why should I respect your points? If you dance around mine, by saying I have some hidden meaning?
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy Theorist doesn't mean crazy, but many posters in this sub make it seem that way. This is one of the better conspiracy forums, but at times it seems no better than GLP, or ATS, or infowars..
      </p>
      <p>
       You keep saying that I'm the only one who thinks it, but are you sure I'm just not the only one saying it in the sub, because they don't give a shit about the karma system?

      <p>
       I most certainly qualify under "B" in your ultimatum, which really stems to what, every single person in the galaxy?
      </p>
      <p>
       People love to complain, everywhere, about everything. I am human, I also love to complain.
      </p>
      <p>
       I complain when I see people complaining.
      </p>
      <h2>
      </h2>
      <p>
       I get lots of pm's where people state that they stopped posting in /conspiracy because of certain topics that seem to always make their way to the front page,  I don't out those people, because they messaged me in private.. so I respect their privacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem to have a problem with ME specifically, as you ignore the idea that there are people who stop coming here and just aren't as outspoken about the threads.
      </p>
      <h2>
      </h2>
      <p>
       My point is simple, in every thread that I bring it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like conspiracies, I studied them in High School, in University, and now. I always leave my mind open for change, and when I see posts in this sub essentially being "rewarded" by being put on the main page, which can be discredited EASILY (I'm not saying by me, which is where you think this is an ego play, I mean by anyone) it makes people come to this sub, and be re-affirmed in their beliefs that everyone here must be crazy.

       Because you and your perspective on what is actually happening in this subreddit (which is tainted, by the way, by your predisposition - or at least it seems that way from the tone of your (one level up) long comment) are a recurring symptom, and I'm of the opinion that anyone else exhibiting those same symptoms might be influenced by this public discussion. It's not "just you" (and I won't dabble in jabs about your ego). It's the erroneous perspective you have. And I have repeatedly tried to explain to you why it is in error. In short, that explanation is: this is how reddit, not only was intended to work, but how it actually
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       work when people put effort into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, I'm going to offer one last item of "correction" here to help you get on the right track (to a fuller, richer appreciation for reddit and this subreddit in particular).

      <p>
       And there's the problem. (and I referenced this in previous comments)
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't "read" the new queue, either. But I do
       <strong>
        look at it
       </strong>
       ...
       <strong>
        and vote on the submissions
       </strong>
       . I upvote the ones that:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         I think people should be aware of (my peeve: pretty much anything to do with international finance and/or the US Federal Reserve),
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I would like to see discussed/vetted. (which sometimes means upvoting something that later turns out to be disinfo - but, it also means that next time I can downvote it)
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       and a third category...
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        are things I am interested in on the fringes of historical conspiracy (ancient civilizations and such).
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       My point: Instead of complaining about what you see, how about participating in what gets seen? (this is my whole point, by the way, is that you're complaining, rather than participating; and, I think you'd have a better appreciation for reddit if you participated just a little more deeply than commenting on things you like and complaining about those you don't).

       Someone once linked the study (which reddit has done), but perhaps this might change your perspective just knowing it as a point to ponder, even without me spending 6 or 8 hours digging up the citation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Votes in the early stages of a submissions life are far more impactful than votes later on (your one downvote isn't going to remove something from the front page once it's gotten there, but... your one downvote might prevent something from ever getting there in the first place if it's cast in the new queue).

        exact same point

       Sometimes the simplest points are the hardest to get across.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, what I've explained is (after 3 years of redditing) pretty rudamentary. I didn't understand it all on day one, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, sometimes, it takes a long interaction (like this one) to get to the heart of the matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       reddit is a gigantic shit sifter.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order for it to work optimally, everyone should take a few minutes, every time they login - either before or after surfing their favorite subs, to surf the new queue of those subs and influence the direction they're going (to combat those who are destroying it by submitting shit).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm glad we made progress. Maybe next time you see someone who doesn't understand reddit, you can help them "get it" a little better. (pay it forward, so to speak).

       Gotcha, I just think people (me included) get a little agitated at how many threads just make them facepalm :|

       Not sure where all those downvotes came from while I was asleep.

       However, as I said before, I think you (and those other people) come here with a predisposition ... a prejudice of some sort. This then taints your interpretation of every headline and every comment. You're
       <em>
        looking
       </em>
       for something to make yourself feel smarter, or better, or less crazy, or whatever,... than other people. This doesn't just happen in r/conspiracy, though. It happens everywhere. And, it's most common among new group members who haven't acclimated to the social climate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't worry... if you stay here long enough, you'll be saying crazy shit that other people facepalm about. It happens to pretty much everyone who comes here thinking they're "not as crazy as" what's going on here. Then, later, they find out (through some serious eye-opening discoveries) that they were crazy for mocking this data stream in the first place. (keep in mind what Clifford Stoll said about data, though: "Data is not information, information is not knowledge, knowledge is not understanding, understanding is not wisdom.")

       That should take you to the oldest posts in r/conspiracy about kony2012. Looks like all of them from the outset are "this is a scam" posts. Every. Single. One. i.e., it was never posted here "to scam", but only "reported as a scam".
      </p>
      <p>
       And, for what it's worth, I did this search once before, not restricted to just r/conspiracy, and there's now a post missing... it was the first posting of the video, before bokmal's and before Perignis' self-post... the very first posting of the video
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       in r/conspiracy, now removed for whatever reason, and I can't remember the username who posted it, but it was one of the recognizable long-timers who posted it here like Kranky_Old_Dude [not him, but someone like that].
