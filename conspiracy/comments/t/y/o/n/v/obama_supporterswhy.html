<p>Wrong. I am worried about much worse things. Factual things. My question to you is:</p>

<p>Why would you willingly support a President that: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Says he is pulling troops out the 3.5 trillion dollar Iraq war but only replaces them with Blackwater mercenaries, Haliburton and 20,000 US troops declared &quot;Technical Experts&quot;  ? <a href="http://americasfailureiniraq.com/2011/12/28/american-troops-in-iraq-blackwater-mercenaries-to-replace-us-soldiers/">Source</a> <a href="http://newsjunkiepost.com/2011/12/18/iraq-war-us-troops-are-out-but-blackwater-and-halliburton-will-stay/">Source2</a></p></li>

<li><p>Signed the NDAA bill into law that authorizes unconstitutional detainment or assassination of American citizens without trial or due process. All of which has been FINALLY determined unconstitutional by a federal judge. <a href="http://readersupportednews.org/news-section2/318-66/11475-focus-judge-rules-ndaa-unconstitutional">Source</a></p></li>

<li><p>Is expected to sign a bill authorizing over 30,000 spy drones to patrol domestic skies by the year 2020. </p></li>
<li><p>And much much more.....</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So why? Why on earth do you support this traitor? He is worse than Bush. Why do you not vote with the most essential liberties in mind when you go to the polls? Why do you support someone that pisses on our Constitution, invades our privacy, warmongers the globe and is so heavily supported by major corporations?</p>

<p>You might be surprised that a significant amount of my supporting sources come from a liberal-leaning news organization, the Huffington Post.</p>

<p>Just remember that Romney is not the only other alternative and if you are intelligent enough to care about the fighting the issues I have brought forth. You do not have to vote Obamaney this year. </p>

<p>This year.... end corporate tyranny... choose liberty. Lets quit being fooled and stop this bullshit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.  It&#39;s an illusion.  The mental retards on the left thought the &quot;right&quot; still supported Bush when was being booed at Nascar events.  In reality, only Fox pundits and such supported him.  The &quot;right&quot; thinks people on the &quot;left&quot; support Obama.  In reality, only MSNBC pundits support him.</p>

<p>90% of people don&#39;t post content to the net, 9% post infrequently, and 99% of content comes from 1% of people.  Most of this 1% are paid by the government to spam the left-right paradigm while normal people work and take care of kids knowing that all politicians are fucking them over.</p>

<p>Stop believing the spam.  Buy yourself guns and support revolutionaries.  Nothing else will work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, sure, there are Obama supporters.  I even see people with Bush stickers still on their car.  American society is structured in a way that makes life relatively easy for the mentally retarded.  We have lots of jobs that require no thinking whatsoever.  Mindless repetitive task, then go get McDonald&#39;s to feed you, then go turn on the TV and veg out until time for mindless repetitive task to be repeated.</p>

<p>The most recent polls put belief in the 9/11 fairytale at 45% or so.  The polls are always biased towards the left-right paradigm and combined with personal experience talking to people, I&#39;d guess it is closer to 35%.  That means about 1/3 of the population should be considered clinically retarded, because the only way you can believe the 9/11 fairytale is if you&#39;re not smart enough to do 10th grade algebra / Physics 101 with respect to Building 7.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Newton&#39;s law.  Free fall acceleration.  Acceleration is the derivative of velocity is the derivative of position as a function of time.  Building 7&#39;s roof fits a position curve with a constant acceleration of 9.8 m/s<sup>2,</sup> or free fall acceleration due to gravity.  Proof of controlled demolition.  Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth have covered this extensively.</p>

<p>The symmetrical collapse is also proof of controlled demolition.  Structurally damaged buildings topple over, not fall into their footprint, unless they are collapsing in controlled demolition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve been downvoted for sharing mathematical facts!  My hat is off to you sir.  Folks, believe it or not, derivatives are much older than you think - conventional wisdom thinks them to be ways to get rich on the stock market, but they have a basis in physics / calculus.  C&#39;mon ppl, Issac Newton knew this like 400 years ago lol.  And who would actually post a comment in this sub asking as if it&#39;s the first time he&#39;s heard something about building 7?  I mean, I know the MSM doesn&#39;t cover it at all but jeez!  heh /rant off</p>

<p>PS: The only thing that is not a &quot;pure mathematical fact&quot; is &quot;proof of controlled demolition&quot;.  Although that is slightly more debatable and complicated than a F=ma problem, it&#39;s not rocket science either!  However I don&#39;t know if I fully agree with your &quot;clinically retarded&quot; statistics either :) but have a good day!</p>

<p>A president has to decide whether he will work for commoners or the super rich.  Is he going to heavily regulate finance and industry catering to most people&#39;s interests of well being or is he going to de-regulate and help the rich get richer while lowering the common man to serfdom?   Libertarians, Republicans and even Ron Paul will do the latter.  Every back woods hick and Ayn Rand fan thinks they&#39;re going to be a tycoon one day especially if they cut social programs.  </p>

<p>YES. The president vetoing every single thing the Repubs want to get done would get everyday people to start caring about politics and wondering what the fuck is going on. There&#39;s no way the mainstream media would be able to avoid covering a story that big for long. That&#39;s why I&#39;m hoping Ron Paul gets elected and just tries to veto everything he possibly can. When constituents realize they are no longer being represented at all, we might finally be able to reduce the corruption in our government.</p>

<p>It&#39;s two shades of grey (or a baby shit green.) My &quot;support&quot; for Obama is more implicit than explicit. He&#39;s the shade of baby shit green that I like a bit more. I guess I have a glimmer of hope that he gets some shit done without having to worry about being reelected. I also kind of want to see what happens to the GOP if he wins (kind of like a gory car crash.) More and more I wish we had a coalition type government where minority views CAN get a voice. But any thought that there&#39;s any real choice is kinda silly. But it&#39;s just as silly as voting for a third party in a system that doesn&#39;t acknowledge them.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a part of me that thinks a lot of what Paul says is just plain out-of-touch (in that Randian glorified selfishness way), but then again, I&#39;d love to see what his flavor of conservative would do to this country (in a good way.)</p>

<p>Seriously, how naive are you people to not realize he&#39;s part of the same system?

    <div class="md"><p>Well I have to say that I could agree with you 100% and did for a long time. I guess it was my apathy for politics. I Remember Ron Paul from back in the 80&#39;s talking about the things that I agreed with which is the same stuff today. He has been very consistent in my opinion. To say he just walked right to our front door one day is a stretch. He has been at it for decades. It was the internet that delivered him to our doors. It&#39;s not the main stream media that&#39;s pushing his agenda, they are ignoring everything he does keeping him out of the news. They&#39;re doing that for a reason. As a independent he never got any coverage so he had to take his message through as a republican, being able to participate in the debates. We all know he is more of an independent running as a republican. He is not part of the establishment he will never be president he is spreading a message of liberty and people are starting to    wake up to the corruption because of him. If he is part of the EST. then they are causing a huge problem for themselves, but maybe you&#39;re right could be exactly what they want to happen. Time will tell.</p>

<p>All it takes for this administration to kill a US citizen without due process is to label you as a terrorist.</p>

<p>And you&#39;re making it sound like it&#39;s just this administration, when the Bush administration was basically the pioneer for things like this.</p>

<p>Also, that guy is far from some average American citizen that was labelled a terrorist and killed by Obama.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When did the Bush administration blow up an American citizen without due process?  They just imprisoned people without due process, which was heinous enough.</p>

<p>And mitigating the facts of this by saying he was <em>really</em> a terrorist doesn&#39;t change a goddamn thing.  The US government blew up a citizen who was not actively in the process of committing a crime against American citizens.  The precedent here is terrifying.  Maybe the guy had blood on his hands but what if he didn&#39;t?  That&#39;s the part that should make you take pause.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s because &#39;brown skin&#39; = terrorist to a lot of people sadly.</p>

<p>Nobody will care until the precedent gets abused.  When kids running protests get called &#39;terrorists&#39; and drone strikes are used against them.  And people won&#39;t care at first, either, because they&#39;ll believe that these kids are really domestic terrorists.  40somethings in Topeka will feel safer, until it becomes more and more apparent that the reductions in our rights we&#39;ve allowed in the name of the War on Drugs and the War on Terror represent nothing more than excuses for our government to exert more control over the populace and protect itself from the long overdue revolution.</p>

A &quot;repeatable experiment&quot;.  However, optimization artifacts are almost certainly not to blame and if there were OCR data in there you would expect for the search feature to work (no words are searchable if you try).  I have seen the layers in Illustrator for myself from the file off of the whitehouse.gov site not that long ago - AFAIK it is likely still up there untouched (changing it would probably cause even more controversy so they leave it alone).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please for fucks sakes can everyone and the mainstream media stop slamming Obama with the socialist label as if socialism is a bad thing. People who keep saying that obviously don&#39;t have the faintest idea of what socialism is all about. As a socialist, I can tell you hands down Obama is not a socialist. He is a capitalist. Until a politician decides to do away with all corporations and have everything a direct-democracy and all modes of productions are worker controlled and self-managed...they are not socialist. Cuz that&#39;s what real socialism is, the democratic ownership of the modes of productions for the people and by the people. Obama is a capitalist still support big banks and big governments. Thank you...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I may very well be throwing my vote away by voting for liberty and am very aware that it may not win. But I am sick of the Republicrats. With them, I feel like a kindergartener and my ball has been stolen from me by 6th graders. Right now they are tossing this ball back and forth, playing keep-away from me. Both of them want me to beg for that ball back and I have before but always ends up that I am on my knees just begging for one more chance with my own fucking ball. I am tired of it. They can keep that fucking ball, I am not playing with it anymore... I want my dignity, god damn it. All that ball represents now is some perverted version of my freedom, a small glimpse of what it should be. My dignity is worth more than that and I&#39;ll be damned if I grovel to get that piece of shit ball back again. I want the ability to say that I didnt vote for someone who continued this tired same agenda we have been playing since Vietnam and possibly as far back as WWII. I am walking away from this fucked up game of keep away. </p>

<p>I posted a reply to this random redditor and said...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This should be on the front page of Reddit. Just sayin&#39;... :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s one way of characterizing &quot;Libertarians&quot;.  I&#39;m sure many people can agree with some ideologies of the various isms.  Bob Marley talked about &quot;isms and schisms&quot; in his music (here&#39;s a link to a song where he uses the phrase if you feel like listening to some random music: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2W3aG8uizA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2W3aG8uizA</a>).  Though I think many people can identify with some values touted by various multitudes of other people.  Even those associated with &quot;libertarian&quot;.  Or &quot;liberal&quot; (a Fox News&#39; boogyman).  I wouldn&#39;t know even know where to begin in this context on &quot;race&quot;.  Many people just see the governments of the world acting in a wasteful and unnecessary manner and look to potential solutions.</p>

<p>&quot;The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you&#39;re inside, you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;They are BANKING ON IT that you do! You DO NOT have to choose from the lesser of the two evils&quot;</p>

<p>The odds are stacked heavily against those who would vote outside the box, most people understand this, but with the amount of people who actually exercise their right to vote, and those who vote ignorantly based on party instead of research, really make it nearly impossible for the odds to be overcome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I may very well be throwing my vote away by voting for liberty and am very aware that it may not win. But I am sick of the Republicrats. With them, I feel like a kindergartener and my ball has been stolen from me by 6th graders. Right now they are tossing this ball back and forth, playing keep-away from me. Both of them want me to beg for that ball back and I have before but always ends up that I am on my knees just begging for one more chance with my own fucking ball. I am tired of it. They can keep that fucking ball, I am not playing with it anymore... I want my dignity, god damn it. All that ball represents now is some perverted version of my freedom, a small glimpse of what it should be. My dignity is worth more than that and I&#39;ll be damned if I grovel to get that piece of shit ball back again. I want the ability to say that I didnt vote for someone who continued this tired same agenda we have been playing since Vietnam and possibly as far back as WWII. I am walking away from this fucked up game of keep away. </p>

They&#39;d be impotent without strong third party representation in Congress as well. THAT&#39;s why nothing changes. Change has to begin on the state level as well as the federal. And you have no information whatsoever about what I may or may not be doing to affect that sort of change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You think Obama controls the shadow government?  The intelligence agencies, the Pentagon and their contractors?  The CIA alone has been squashing movements of the people all over the world since it&#39;s inception, so why would they stop at America?  Obama won, and he was allowed to, but they have him on a tight leash.  And he wants to be able to retire someday, so he plays ball.  I&#39;d rather have him in that role than some completely soulless power glutton, like Romney, that will let them strip every last freedom, with no questions asked.</p>

<p>EDIT:  Attention Paultards:  He has great ideas for foreign policy, but his domestic is unrealistic and selfish.  Besides, you think the Establishment would let him in?  Dream on.</p>

<p>And you&#39;re making it sound like it&#39;s just this administration, when the Bush administration was basically the pioneer for things like this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it amazing that on one hand there&#39;s a huge interconnected system of power and authority that manipulate us every day through lies and misdeeds causing wars and strife around the world, manipulating the discussion points of the electoral system through the corporate run media,  but Ron Paul just walked RIGHT THROUGH that system to your front door.</p>

<p>Seriously, how naive are you people to not realize he&#39;s part of the same system? He&#39;s an outlier meant to capture and maintain the far right and &#39;fed up&#39; vote to deliver it back to the center parties when the election comes. He&#39;s a useful tool and you guys are getting suckered in by the same system.</p>

<p>If he was really someone from the outside he wouldn&#39;t be trying to run under the banner of a corrupted party system, he would have always been an independent, not someone sucking on the teet of the system that he so claims to want to change.</p>
