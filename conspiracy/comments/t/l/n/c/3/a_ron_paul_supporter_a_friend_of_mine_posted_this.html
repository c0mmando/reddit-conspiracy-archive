       Ron Paul is the only Constitutionalist who is running so it follows that we would logically support the one person who supports what we believe in so much. When Romney was asked a simple question about the Constitutionality of something during one of the debates, he could not answer it and ultimately said "Why don't we ask the Constitutionalist" as he pointed to Dr Ron Paul (
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=gOq3O8g1xw4#">
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=gOq3O8g1xw4#
       </a>
       ! ). If Romney cannot answer a simple question about the Constitutionality of something, he can not honestly claim to support the Constitution. And if he does claim to support something he clearly is not well versed in, then he is being intellectually and factually dishonest. And if he is willing to be intellectually and factually dishonest, then explain to me why he deserves your obviously blind trust, please?
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Paul has proven his honesty and trustworthiness over the course of his lifetime. Even those who adamantly oppose his bid for office (due to their concern over their own financial interests which would be jeopardized by a Paul Presidency) readily admit he is honest and trustworthy. There is a reason he is known in DC by lobbyists as 'the one man who can't be bought'. They don't even bother to ask him anymore. Haven't for a long time because they know that he will not cast his vote based on what incentives he is offered by lobbyists but will always vote pro-Constitution. His character is above reproach. He is the only candidate who served in the military. During one debate last year, Newt Gingrich was asked why he did not go to Vietnam when he got his draft letter. He responded that he didn't go because he was married and had a baby on the way. Ron Paul was asked the same exact question and he said "I was married and had two kids - and I went!" So when he speaks about ending unnecessary wars, he speaks from the experience of having actually served as a member of the armed forces during war time. He has delivered over 4,000 babies in his own private Obstetrics practice, so no one can claim he does not have the highest regard for life. As a physician he refused government insurance on principle, but never turned a patient away for inability to pay. The people who worked in his practice have clearly stated that he absorbed the bills of those who could not pay rather than refuse to see them or send them into a collections problem. So when he says we need to oppose national health care, he knows what he is talking about. When he says that the government needs to keep it's nose out of medicine, he is not just speaking from a position of observation. This was his life and livelihood. In nearly four decades he has never once voted yes for anything that was un-Constitutional. In Washington, DC, they call him 'Dr No' because he has so often been the lone voice willing to oppose bad legislation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ron Paul could have sold his votes to the highest bidder, yet he never has because America is more important to him than special interests are. If his goal was to become filthy rich and be part of the big boys club, he would have done that long ago. And he would not have opted out of the Congressional Pension Fund. After all, he is one of the very few people in congress who actually EARNED that pension by serving the interests of the nation, rather than the interests of bankers and corporations. But he feels strongly that the Congressional Pension is a robbery of the American People and as such he has refused to accept it. He is also the only congressman who gives back to the federal government a portion of his congressional fund every single year. He has done so consistently throughout his congressional terms. This speaks well of his ability to manage funds and not spend what he does not have. Unlike Romney who, during his governorship, boasted about how he knows where the money is and how to go after it. And went on to instruct his people to go after every dime they could get. (
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuQDLvNGM-Q">
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuQDLvNGM-Q
       </a>
       ) He then went on to brag about how he managed to get more money than anyone had in the history of the Olympics. "We managed to get over 410 million dollars from the federal government for the Olympic games. That is a HUGE increase over anything ever done before. We did that by going after every agency of government." Then he even brags about how he got over a million dollars from the Department of Education! But wait... In a debate just this year he told Rick Santorum that for the Olympics he only got the same amount that the government has given to every Olympic committee.... So which was it? a HUGE increase over anything the Olympics had ever gotten? Or the same as all the Olympics got? He had to be lying at least one of those times. But which time? Does it even matter which time? Shouldn't it matter that he lied at all?

       Mitt Romney is such a bad person to have running for President that a lot of his fellow Mormons aren't even voting for him. That should tell you a whole lot about what he says vs what he does. While I am not Mormon and I don't agree with their doctrine, it cannot be disputed that Mormons are typically very nice, very honest people. It is also a well known fact that Mormons tend to band together to help their own in their individual endeavors. Since those things are typically true of Mormons, does it not strike you as odd that there is an uprising AGAINST Romney in the Mormon community? Every Mormon I know is voting for Ron Paul. And the reason they are voting for him is because he is the candidate they know they can trust and because Romney's agendas are in diametric opposition to Mormon's stated beliefs. I'm not sure if that speaks more to Paul's character or Romney's lack of character, but either way it does not speak well for Romney.
      </p>
      <p>
       As candidates go, there is no material difference between Obama and Romney. It doesn't matter which one you pick out of those two, you will see precisely the same result from either of them. (
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=IWDJEc92d38#">
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=IWDJEc92d38#
       </a>
       ! ) For far too long people have been told there is a difference between Republicans and Democrats and it simply is not true. They have the same exact agenda. There is no difference. Pretending there is a difference is the lazy person's way of avoiding responsibility by refusing to invest themselves in the process and educating themselves on the issues. It gives people a false sense that no matter what happens it isn't their fault. But I have news for you... Anyone who votes for evil on any level cannot expect anything from them except evil. And so it is not the Paul supporters who will be responsible if Obama is re-elected. We are voting for what is right and we refuse to compromise those principles. Anyone who votes for anything less that what is Constitutionally right is at fault for the destruction of this nation. Obama and Romney voters alike. Ron Paul supporters will not wear their shame. They will have to own that themselves. We will vote for Ron Paul. And if his name is not on the ballot, we will write him in. Because our lives and our freedoms are at stake and we can no longer get by with the lesser of two evils.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a thousand good reasons to vote for Ron Paul and not a single good reason to vote for Romney. So my question would be why would anyone vote FOR Romney?
      </p>
      <p>
       Those of us who support Ron Paul do so because he represents what we believe in: The Constitution and Liberty. We do not support Ron Paul for any other reason. If, God forbid, Ron Paul were to die today, we would still follow the principles of liberty. We would be forced to find a new representative who also follows those same principles. And this is what you need to understand about this... If something were to happen to Ron Paul, we would still not vote for Romney. If Ron Paul did not exist, we would still not vote for Romney. For us, this election isn't about choosing between Democrats and Republicans as there is no choice there at all. Choosing between Obama and Romney is like being offered a choice between liver cancer and pancreatic cancer. I'll take... NEITHER, thanks. And it isn't about choosing between Romney and Dr Paul because they are so diametrically opposed on everything that matters (and with Romney consistently on the wrong side of every argument) that offering Romney as a 'choice' against Dr Paul is laughable. There is no comparison. Romney is to Ron Paul what darkness is to light.
      </p>
      <p>
       We do not follow Ron Paul as some idol or rock star. If he ever deviated from his stated beliefs and what he has very publicly represented for four decades, we would cease to support him and he would be replaced by someone who adhered to our ideals. So while you might like to enjoy the fantasy that Ron Paul is a god to us, you would be factually wrong. We admire his principles and his conviction. We respect his consistency. We believe as he does. But our beliefs are not contingent upon Ron Paul. They are our own core beliefs. The fact that we finally have someone with a large enough platform to represent OUR beliefs is exciting for us. It gives us hope that perhaps we might be able to turn all these years of bad policies around and save the nation we love. That is our singular goal. And we won't give up on that goal for anything.

       The only reason Romney is a candidate.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It turns out that presidential candidates often have Commander in Chief relatives, and this election cycle is no different, finds Ancestry.com after six months of research. Jon Huntsman is also related to FDR, Coolidge and the Bushes. And yes, his bloodline mirrors Romney’s because they too are cousins: Romney’s great-great-grandfather Parley Pratt, an early Mormon missionary, is Huntsman’s great-great-great-grandfather. The Romney-Huntsman–George W. Bush connection comes through Anne Marbury Hutchinson, who was a religious-freedom advocate in early 1600s. Rather fitting, since all three of them are still quite open about their faiths, be they Mormon or Evangelical.

       Non-American here, what are the chances of Ron Paul getting the republican nomination to run for presidency?

       I tried googling but I dont understand how the system works in america, primaries, delegates, etc etc

       The GOP nomination is based on number of Delegates. This is supposed to be a human cross check of the voting process. The first results and votes work on the peoples vote (not that the machines can actually add) then depending on the state they will hand out delegates proportionally to the votes, or they will hand the delegates all to the "winner" of the votes. Michigan splits the delegates proportionally to the top 2 winners.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, now the nomination can be handed over to whoever gets a certain number (over 2/3's of possible, I believe) of the delegates, before all the states have voted. But if this majority of delegates number is not reached then the delegates themselves get to go vote on who gets the nomination. Right now Ron is by far in the lead with the number of "Pledged" delegates. And Ron has in all effect outright won the delegates in MANY states. Ron might take the certain number delegates before even having to have the delegates vote, but we wont get a real count of delegates willingly from the GOP party. They will force it to go all the way through the steps.
      </p>
      <p>
       What will be interesting is if those "state given" delegates refuse to vote for a man with felony charges on him, by saying, "we cannot with a clear conscious vote for Mitt Romney due to information we have learned about him." And the delegates should (per law) be freed from any obligations to vote for any particular candidate. But we'll see.

       When he see's they really will do anything to keep him out, he'll toss you all over to Romney, and the ones who can stomach that will say

       nah... he's been ready for that stunt since JFK. Besides by some media twist of election results, Ron does NOT get the nomination, he is running on the Independent/Teaparty ticket. The party has already extended the invitation.

       No matter what, its going to be interesting. How interesting? well lets just say that what NO ONE is talking about, is the fact that this President was given the power and authority to maintain his seat of power indefinitely in a time of "a National Crisis" per the U.S.P.A.T.R.I.O.T.ACT.  Obama has the power to shut down and/or ignore the elections. And maintain his power over America and the worlds strongest military power, for as long as there is some form of a "situation" happening, or "until the crisis has passed" ... so King Omoba could just take away our right to vote.

       except the fact that the U.S.P.A.T.R.I.O.T.ACT would be one of the first laws veto'ed per Ron Pauls pledging several times to do. Ron has also said he'd be the first president in history to work to get rid of the job. He believes that with our present technology "We the People" can actually run our country ourselves! NO, not giving the authority to a world government, but a truly public government, no secret operations against Americans without Americans deciding on it. Every aspect of our nation can be voted on by the people. We do not "NEED" representatives any more, we can virtually be there. Its really quite simple, but our leaders say "there is no way to be sure it'll be safe and secure" BS The truth is the shadow government cant "CONTROL" a simplistic system to count votes.

       10th amendment. And yes any unconstitutional law can be veto'ed by the position of President, and Ron Paul can without question present an air tight case for their being Veto'd by the American People the states and yes even on the national level... therefore he would be able to in effect immediately veto those administrative laws. Since they are not part of the Constitution nor an "Amendment" to the Constitution, and easily proven how they infringe upon the Constitution and be "nullified". Theres a bit more then"HA HA its law now you cant stop it" thats the preconception they teach you. But the 10th amendment is very clear and specifically included into the "Bill of Rights" (the first 10 amendments of the Constitution) for just such a reason of illegal government laws being created. TY Thomas Jefferson!

       Let's also examine why Paul's monetary position is
       <em>
        against
       </em>
       the Constitution.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's true that gold and silver are mentioned in the Constitution, but in what context?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       So, we see that states (NOT the federal government) are limited to gold and silver.  What is the purpose of this?  Paultards would have you believe it constitutes "real" money, but we can see quite clearly that the founders thought otherwise: they include bills of credit in the text of the Constitution as legitimate mediums of exchange for commerce, that is, they recognized paper currency as legitimate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore it is not hard to see that the intent of the founders was actually to
       <em>
        restrict
       </em>
       currency competition in the market by pushing the states out of the business of money.  That the founders actually intended a relative monopoly over currency and credit is even more strongly supported by the first Congress, consisting of over twenty authors of the Constitution, authorizing the National Bank and George Washington signing the legislation as well as appointing Hamilton secretary of the treasury.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paul, as a subversive British agent, would like you to think of the National Banks as similar to the Federal Reserve.  This is transparently false for many reasons, among them: the public ownership of the national banks versus the private ownership of the fed, the direct issuance of credit to producers by the national banks versus exclusive issuance to bankers by the fed, the anti-usury policy of the national banks versus the programmatic resource consolidation of the fed, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the constitutional position is plain: public national bank that makes credit available to all producers without usury.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Paul position, which could be characterized as British loyalism or subversion of the constitution, is the Austrian philosophy of higher interest rates as a good thing (usury, anti-Christian) and competing currencies versus the stability provided by the first two national banks which were each subverted by British agents put into the White House by Aaron Burr: Jefferson and Jackson.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paul is a very smart man and knows his history, and therefore can only be thought of as a conscious traitor.  Patriotic Americans are therefore more inclined towards seeing him in jail than public office.

       Let's do an in depth analysis of the con that Paul is running on the budget.  The most important element of the con is his pretending that interest rates will remain at historical lows in the absence of a national bank purchasing most issuance of T-Bills.  Right now the fed (which is private and should be nationalized, but not the point right now) purchases about 60% of T-Bills and keeps the interest rate down to about 1.5%.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Greece, a country without a central bank to defend from derivative attacks on the national debt, interest rates are about 100 times greater, or 200%.  If we expect a relatively modest increase in the average rate on the debt to 5%, which is probably
       <em>
        far
       </em>
       too conservative given actual implementation of Paul's ideology, then the $17 trillion in national debt when he takes office will cost $850 billion per year to service.  His budget expects only $250 billion in interest services in 2016, so there is a $600 billion short term problem with his numbers from a very conservative viewpoint.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's fair to call this an outright con because Paul is of the Austrian school of economics and they actually
       <em>
        advocate
       </em>
       for higher interest rates as a good thing.  So, surely this development is not only anticipated but eagerly awaited yet it is not reflected in the budget.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paul also projects baseline tax revenue to increase from $2.5 trillion to $3 trillion by 2016 under extreme austerity conditions with no dirigist programs whatsoever.  No economy has ever experienced significant growth under these circumstances in history, so this estimate is, to put it friendly, comical.  Indeed, revenues have contracted whenever austerity has been implemented, but we can be generous and assume a flat revenue picture rather than the 20% increase in 4 years that is projected.
      </p>
      <p>
       This creates an additional $500 billion problem with his budget, for a conservatively estimated total shortfall of $1.1 trillion per year by the end of a hypothetical first term under Paul.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the longer horizon, we see budget cuts to things like high protein meals for impoverished children.  Inadequate nutrients in the diet result in inadequate brain development, lower IQs, and often mental retardation.  These sorts of people are almost guaranteed to turn into criminals, and certainly so in the absence of social safety nets.  Paul proposes that we not spend the $1 dollar per day to make sure they are fed, but defray the costs of rampant mental retardation onto our children's generation that will be forced to deal a crime epidemic resulting from broad swaths of people unable to care for themselves as a direct result of neglect that could've easily been avoided.  There are many such relatively minor "savings" that he proposes in the fashion that actually are tremendously expensive in the long run.
      </p>
      <p>
       The above is all quite rosy though.  To be more realistic, we can expect that Paul will do all that he can to halt open market purchase of T-Bills by the fed, which is fine, but won't create another source of credit for the markets to replace it.  A seizing up of the liquidity in the treasury market is the only reasonable expectation of such policy, which implies, at the least, a short term halt of world commerce.  This is the sort of thing where T-Bills go from 1% interest rates to 500% almost overnight, assuming there is anyone willing to buy them at all.  This is the sort of thing where you can't buy oil from Saudi Arabia anymore because they won't take dollars, which means our farmers can't grow crops, which means your kids don't get to eat after the two week domestic food supply runs out.  This is the sort of thing where you experience a 50% contraction in economic activity in a matter of months and disintegration of society in the short run.  This is masonic genocide of the worst sort seen since WW2.

       The greatest economic boom in the US, and the only time the US had zero debt, was under andrew jackson after he got rid of the US central bank, everything you just said was meaningless conjecture.  I don't know if Ron Paul is the answer he has a lot of baggage, but getting rid of the banking cartel is definitely the way to go.

       Who taught you that?  The aftermath of Jackson ending the second national bank was economic depression and over 7,000 currencies in circulation.  European financiers were the only stable sources of credit after the Jacksonian subversion of the American state and the nobility/banking houses of Europe bought up much of the country for basement bargain prices just like after the Battle of Waterloo.  Commerce did not really cover until the Civil War.  If it were not for vast open expanses in the west for people to flee towards for an agricultural rather than industrial future, the consequences of Jackson's policies would have been mass starvation rather than mere depression.

       This simply isn't true whether you know it or not.

      <p>
       Take his budget plan for example.  He proposes about $1 trillion in tax cuts per year and most of it goes to the very wealthy in society such as capital gains, dividend tax cut, raising the exemption on estate tax to infinity (from $5 million currently), etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this was a strategy to bankrupt the empire, then I might be convinced, perhaps even enthusiastically convinced.  Instead, he also proposes $1 trillion in budget cuts that mostly go to the poor, science, infrastructure, and other things that make good sense.  We get lots of
       <em>
        bullshit
       </em>
       from Paul about his $1 trillion in budget cuts being about balancing the budget, but no mention of his $1 trillion in tax cuts keeping the deficits just as high - probably because he doesn't want you to know he is planning to simultaneously impose austerity on the despondent while giving the rich and even freer ride than they presently enjoy.

       Any serious scholar knows that all of the continental gold stocks were collected by Hitler and deposited in British bank accounts in Switzerland.  Furthermore, the American gold stocks have been depleted and transferred to oligarchical control.  Paul, knowing that there is presently a monopoly on gold by oligarchs (whom I consider the enemy, not "government"), advocates a gold standard.  Is this a joke?  On the American people, surely.  Now, I don't know the distribution of mentally retarded Paul supporters versus people caught up in the rock star cult thing he has going, but I do know that all of them fall into one or the other category.

       Sorry you completely misunderstand the simplicity of his plan. His plan is to stop "taxing America
       <em>
        "into"
       </em>
       prosperity". We will print our money instead of a FOREIGN bank, called the "Federal Reserve" (which was NEVER an "American Institution" but a foreign owned operated and invested into BANK) He will stop all the wars and murdering hundreds of thousands of lives per year, and buying all the ammo and fuel to do so. Obviously this information is all a shock to you, or you'd already understand his simple CONSTITUTIONALLY AUTHORIZED plan. He is the ONLY candidate with an actual (you can go online to see it) budget plan, that is BALANCED!
      </p>
      <p>
       Any serious scholar... you are aware that scholar means to have been SCHOOLED, right? So what your implying with that condescending tone is you paid more for knowledge to be instructed to you, and you really had no need to analyze the info you were receiving because it was TAUGHT TO YOU! Well congrats, on self limiting your understanding. .... and so far BOTH groups seem to put more actual thought into what they support then you do.

       Paul advocates a gold standard.  This is distinct from printing our own money.  So, the first tangible thing you said is simply made up.

       Maybe, but austerity is known to induce deeper depressions.  Look at what is happening in Greece and Spain, or deeper into history at Germany between the world wars, etc.  With global food supplies tight, this can only lead to mass starvation and death on a far greater scale than any of our wars are presently causing.

      <p>
       For example, he estimates the cost of eliminating capital gains and the dividend taxes to be only $150 billion by 2016 even though capital gains taxes alone bring in $300 billion.  Only in Paultardian lalala land do numbers work this way.

       This stuff makes me think you're trolling.  The constitution specifically authorizes the government to regulate currency and the value thereof, but Paul thinks that individuals should issue their own currency and let them compete in the market.  This is one of his strictly anti-constitutional views among many.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond the constitution, thinking people amongst you are also gravely concerned about his promotion of the Aaron Burr network, known traitor and reject from the continental army by George Washington, his Eastern Star wife, his association with the Ayn Rand atheistic school of thought that holds selfishness as a virtue, his getting her book signed by bubble blower extraordinaire Greenspan, his association with the Scottish Rite masonic front John Birch society, and on and on.

       Ron Paul believes history has served its purpose in showing the prosperity of civilizations who used the gold standard, and in turn the downfall that happened once those cultures strayed from such practices.  What Ron Paul actually advocates for the US as an immediate strategy is competing currencies.  So, your first claim in the comment is simply wrong.  Didn't bother reading on.

       Jefferson was a Jacobite sympathizer.  This is essentially the satanic school of thought at the time exemplified by people like Jeremy Bentham and other obscurantist philosophers.  His philosophical orientation is one of elitism and broadly dismissive of the middle class while promoting a play to the emotions of the undereducated.  He is a famous backer of the French revolution which was initiated by agent provocateurs (lies about the Queen's excesses in a time of economic difficulty from prolonged war) and resulted in the slaughter of the middle class while leaving the masonic agents unscathed.
      </p>
      <p>
       In America, this basic philosophy was put to practice against the Hamiltonian theory of economy.  Obscurantist British agents like Ron Paul will try to equate the national banks with the Federal Reserve, but I said elsewhere in this thread they are very different systems indeed.  The Constitution specifically authorizes the issuance of Bills of Credit, or paper currency by the federal government, and the Hamiltonian national banks issued credit directly to producers for farming, road building, canal building, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beautifully, Hamilton arranged for elimination of usury by insisting on low interest rates, 4% at first and rapidly reduced to 2%, essentially only covering the operating costs of the bank.  As this is consistent with most human ethics from Christianity to Islam to Confucianism, all of which ban usury, the satanic Jefferson and his faction were naturally enraged.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, the method of operation of the national bank was designed to provide mechanisms for countering the collusion of European oligarchy in the models.  Since the money supply was loaned into existence (similar to Fed, except without usury), the national bank had the ability to contract their supply of credit when the oligarchs over-issued, or expand their supply of credit when oligarchs colluded to remove credit from the market, thereby providing for a long term balance between the demand and supply for credit.  This is how you get a stable monetary unit and economic booms which characterize the first national bank system under Washington and Adams before Jefferson's treason as well as the second national bank prior to Jackson's treason.  Since collusion in manipulating the supply of credit is the primary mechanism of oligarchical or elite control, Jefferson correctly perceived that the public national bank must be ended lest the masses establish themselves as the real controllers of society and he pursued his agenda of elitism quite effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paul, of course, knows this and is similarly manipulating the ignorant and/or stupid in a Jeffersonian faction in defense of British Freemasonry.  He's not dumb, he knows what he is doing, and it shouldn't be characterized as anything but conscious treason.

       You're an idiot if you follow LaRouche or Paul although the former is definitely smarter and with a better moral orientation.  He's wrong about plenty of things, but it's still a good article on their website.  Why don't we talk about the facts in it instead of your silly comment?

       Rocky Anderson, do some research.  And all my comment was was telling you Paul advocated a competing currency market which you attempted to refute by claiming the same thing? I'm not quite sure what you are trying to prove.  And yes, a revolt will change things a lot more than necessary, but every time we have been close we have been pacified by some bullshit law.

But as for me I have researched well beyond your false claims and see the "WHY" he is doing what he is doing.

       If you want to continue this, cointelpro, be ready I think I have already gotten a few of you fired! Be warned, I fight with truth, and your employers will not be happy when my DESTROYING your lies starts to explain the truth to others reading along, and they start waking up because of your lack of any real scope into the truth.

       The greatest economic boom in the US, and the only time the US had zero debt, was under andrew jackson after he got rid of the US central bank, everything you just said was meaningless conjecture.  I don't know if Ron Paul is the answer he has a lot of baggage, but getting rid of the banking cartel is definitely the way to go.
