       I still think this "Anonymous" group is CIA/FBI pretending to be some kind of super hacker group so the politicians will have an excuse to give the public for increased surveillance and censorship on the web. The real anonymous was a bunch of loosely related teenagers doing shit like ordering pizza to your house and signing you up for the military.

       It started off that way. But as that article said; Project Chanology showed how much power like-minded people have, when they concentrate on an issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, Anonymous is used by CIA/FBI to tarnish the name but that's just the thing; everyone can be anonymous. It's not a singular group, but an idea.

       jesus christ... I never thought of anonymous that way, but your point is interesting and makes a lot of sense. I wouldn't pass the government and the CIA to do such a thing. I mean, 9/11 was practically done by the CIA/government to introduce martial law, anonymous is introduced to enforce internet laws, imagine how ignorant the people will become without the internet. 1984 seems like a scary reality.

       First of all, people already are adherently ignorant, even with the internet.  I mean, it never crossed your mind that some clandestine organization that basically fits every stereotype introduced by Hollywood depicting some rogue hacker group that infiltrates tv signals and websites using some effected robot-voice is actually the CIA or government conditioning the public to believe that it exists?  Come on, man.

       The issue with this, and having no centralized leader, is that there are way more fake Anon quotes than real ones, and then it becomes, well who do you believe when they come out and say "That wasn't us."

       It's quite clever really, since there is no head you can't kill it.  People take what Anon says at face value and are forced to think for themselves whether they believe what is being said or not.  Remove authority (be it religion or established political) and you are really left to think for yourself and decide for yourself what message you agree with, or even promote your own on the same platform.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course this mechanism cannot really sustain, eventually it will either fall apart or graduate to something more formal, but it certainly seems to be filling some sort of purpose for now.

       Peer-reviewed meritocracy. Those who know most about the issue at hand get more weight in their opinions. They also take responsibility for their words/actions, as decent people should.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as for property and resources... Sharing is caring. Obviously, there's always going to be greedy people, and those can be dealt with individually.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I trust a person, I borrow or share what I have, to a point. Breaking that trust, obviously, has repercussions. If I have excess of what I need, I gladly share what I have with strangers, if nobody close to me needs it.

       What happens if a sect of your free thinking community is greedy and bands together to manipulate the peer-review system to favour their own group heavily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because this group organises their votes they need to coordinate frequently, and so they appoint a head coordinator to help make that process efficient and free others up from having to attend every meeting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could go on, but you see where I am going.

       Ironically your ideal relies on everyone thinking like you and does not take into account actual free thinkers who by their nature have very different ideas to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The world is as it is today because of free thinking.  Free thinking does not necessarily make things better, it is not a virtue in of itself.  If you are seeking peace and happiness often times one can be much more content not thinking at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thoughts are ideas fighting for survival. It's not always pleasant when one idea comes up against another and battles it out.

       Anyone who wants to claim they're anonymous is anonymous. So you get a whole lot of different types there. Claims are one thing, action is another. If this is even vaguely true, I like to see exposure of "aliens, then military science, then BlackOPs" happen. It'd be a total clusterfuck for a while, but it would be nice if some kind of visible action was made on claims... otherwise it just gets drowned out with all the other noise.

       I'm sorry, but to add, to compare anyone in Anonymous to Julian Assange would mean they'd have to come out and say who is on their "team"
      </p>
      <p>
       Assange, while I'm not fond of him, was a brilliant hacker. With a mind like his, I honestly wonder what he could have brought to the table purely from a helpful standpoint. And I don't mean in creating wikileaks, and leaking documents that were classified, I mean like, actually helping people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Realistically though, we need to pull the old wait and see as we always do, and see what Anonymous says about this article coming out. Because to me, this reeks of bs, only because of the dozens of articles I've seen anyone from Anon interviewed, this is about the least...professional? I've ever seen them act.

       You could probably get a rough idea of the different levels of classification used by the US and our partners just from a quick google search. The hardware and physical permissions required for certain classifications completely negates anon's statement. The statement is sensationalist and will hook only those ignorant of how security clearances and sensitive data is handled.

       Most material in databases is not going to be particularly enlightening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who reads much knows there is rampant criminality throughout the system.  We can get unknown names from these sorts of databases and maybe some interest stories / unknown details, but that is about it.

       Aliens are fake.  Sorry to disappoint.  Military scientists are actual human beings that all received their education from institutions you're free to attend.  What's available might surprise someone who doesn't study science, but not a big deal to anyone with a tinge of creativity and a solid education.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anonymous does more good as content creators and protectors of information channels than hacking (like helping keep the internet alive when the Egyptian government tried to shut it down).  All you that you can achieve from a hacking side of things is information insecurity for the elites, but this isn't necessarily a long term good.  One need only stop using email and restrict communications to paper and/or verbal exchanges to make databases more or less useless.

       Thank you, I actually needed to hear that and frankly, I believe you. But of course, there are just some good arguments pertaining to these issues, I'm sorry to say but, Ancient Aliens? but I'm pretty much a noob and these stuff and honestly, I know next to nothing, so I probably might just be getting fooled.

       But what about the subject matter regarding Government Cover-ups and things that are not paranormal, like inside-job assassinations and etc? surely it won't be available online, but having this access to different informations could surely lead to a pandora's box of expose's and other answers to questions (specially facts about history.) right?

       Like what?  Everyone knows 9/11 was an inside job - it only takes an introductory physics course to figure that out.  We know who killed Kennedy and why.  We know the names of most major banking families,  intelligence operatives, their ideologies, etc.  It's mostly only minor stuff that is missing from the public record at this point which is useful and interesting but still minor.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is definitely a deficit of good historical narratives though.  You can figure this stuff out on your own from information that is already public, but there are not many good history books available.  Even if you made all government archives available to the public I can't see it impacting the public's grasp of history much.  A well-educated President doing fireside chats like FDR under peacetime circumstances could get the job done.  Humans have a knack for detecting truth so if they ever get a leader that starts connecting the dots for them then most people will grasp the big picture relatively quick.

       Yes.  Building 7's roof accelerated towards the ground at a rate statistically indistinguishable from free fall.  This is only possible if no resistance was encountered, which means controlled demolition.  Controlled demolition means inside job.  End of story.

       Not that I disagree with your claims, but:
      </p>
      <p>
       "At this point, a large majority (73%) wants the United States to reduce the number of troops in Afghanistan, but less than half (44%) want troops withdrawn completely."
      </p>
      <p>
       Doesn't mean they polled the entire country.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really like either side using statistics like this.. Even Sportscenter, they get 100,000 votes and they say "58% of America wants ___ to win" but only 100,000 people's "votes" were counted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know I'm going to get down voted for even posting this; but I'm just saying, "truthers are a substantial majority throughout the world" is hyperbolic, there's really no way to know this, and a poll that doesn't even hit 10% of the country doesn't represent the entire population. You could ask 10,000 people if they like Blue M&amp;M's and 70% say yes, 30% say no. But if the next 10,000 you asked said the opposite, your poll would be a little skewed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit; You can see it all over this, they are at least smart enough that in (some) of the cases, they state things like:
      </p>
      <p>
       "polled 16,063 people in 17 nations outside of the United States during the summer of 2008."
      </p>
      <p>
       'found that only 2 out of 5 of those polled in India"
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it's really not related to your overall purpose of your post, but it happens all over the place, politics, sports, news, whatever, statistics being displayed as a "guarantee" instead of saying a poll of 20,000 people.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Two out of three Americans perceive that over the decade since 9/11, U.S. power and influence in the world has declined"

      </p>
      <p>
       Also, good job ignoring the parts of the article you don't like such as:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The poll indicated that nearly 90% percent of Germans are convinced that the government of the United States is not telling the whole truth about the September 11 attacks"
      </p>
      <p>
       "A new poll conducted in France by HEC Paris shows that 58% of French people doubt the official version of 9/11, and 49% believe the U.S. government might have intentionally allowed the attacks to happen"
      </p>
      <p>
       "51% of Americans want Congress to probe Bush/Cheney regarding the 9/11 attacks, two-thirds (67%) of Americans say the 9/11 Commission should have investigated the collapse of World Trade Center Building 7"
      </p>
      <p>
       "A poll conducted by CNN-IBN in August 2007 found that only 2 out of 5 of those polled in India – the world’s second most populous country – believe that al-Qaeda is responsible for the 9/11 attacks"
      </p>
      <p>
       "The poll showed that in the world’s most populous country – China – only 32% believed that Al Qaeda carried out the attacks."
      </p>
      <p>
       China and India are damn near half of the world's population and have an average belief rate in the 9/11 myth of about 35%.  9/11 truth has super-majority status now, not just majority.

       The parts I don't like? I just pulled random parts out..

      <p>
       Why do you take things so personally?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no idea who you are, I've never seen you post before (or don't recall it) I'm just ponting it out.

       "but it's been a long time since I have seen the validity of statistics questioned."

      <p>
       So then you must have never taken any sort of Statistics/Probability courses in college? Because, this type of shit was brought up all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't ignore any parts of the article I didn't like, I took parts that said how many people were polled, and one that said "2 out of the 5..of those polled"
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't say, 66% of Americans agree on something, unless you put, of _____ amount of Americans, we found that 66% believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like seriously, in a non-objective opinion, which I'm not sure if you'll give, considering how you've already replied to me:
      </p>
      <p>
       "two-thirds (67%) of Americans say the 9/11 Commission should have investigated the collapse of World Trade Center Building 7""
      </p>
      <p>
       How many people do you think were polled for this?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no idea, but do you? Do you have a legitimate idea of how many people you think were polled for this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think they polled random people on the street? Or do you think they selectively polled people from certain locations?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you not notice shit like this, even when I point it out? Or were you selectively ignoring what I said?
      </p>
      <p>
       ""A poll conducted by CNN-IBN in August 2007 found that only 2 out of 5 of those polled in India – the world’s second most populous country – believe that al-Qaeda is responsible for the 9/11 attacks""
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay cool, so 40% of those polled in India. This is obviously already an article that simply isn't being non-objective, as 40% is considered an "only" when it's nearly half of their poll.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what do they not say, they don't say how many were polled. There are over a billion people in India, as the article does note, it's the second most populated country in the world. And the last number I saw from the article? 16,000.
      </p>
      <p>
       So even let's say, double that, 32,000 people were polled. That's 32,000 of 1 billion. Let's just type that out so you can see just how few people that is.
      </p>
      <p>
       32,000 vs 1,000,000,000. That's a FUCKLOAD of people, so you really think that 40% of India believes something? If no, because like the article suggests, "of people polled" then what do you believe? Then, you have to understand that that small percentage of people polled (assuming; because the article doesn't state it) that only 40% of THAT number actually believes that. That's not by any fucking means a "substantial majority"
      </p>
      <p>
       That is what I pointed out in the article, and pointed out to you, and only that. The article makes other claims of this nature, but doesn't say "of people polled" it doesn't say "of x amount of people" it just states it, almost as to implicate that it's a guarantee, that it's certainty.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what is the ONLY thing I brought to your attention, on your entire post?
      </p>
      <p>
       That you can't say definitively that "x%" of people believe something, with such a small sample size.
      </p>
      <p>
       To quote a legend on the ideas of whether or not there is Extra Terrestrial life in the galaxy:
      </p>
      <p>
       "To say that there aren't other forms of life out there would be like taking a cup of water from the ocean, saying that there are no whales in the cup, so there are no whales in the ocean."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is essentially what broken statistics like this do. They take people, in which you have no idea the randomization of who they polled, an incredibly low number of people, relatively, to the population, which is finished off with "So then... this % of the population believes this"
      </p>
      <p>
       This shit happens all the time, but it doesn't make it correct, by any means.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit;
      </p>
      <p>
       Just to clarify, I am by no means discrediting statistics, or the use of them. What I am discrediting is the use of an undetermined or unmentioned sample size, an in obviously one-sided article, which basically states that because a poll happened, with an amount of people you have no idea, then it means "x% of a population" believes something.

       "The poll of 957 Americans.."
      </p>
      <p>
       So 957 people created all those statistics. So he's telling me that three one THOUSANDTHS of a percent of a population, is enough of a sample size to say that it's a "substantial majority"

       You can check my head math but that's ~.0003%

       Agree with my own sources?

       I used the guys link, and didn't notice until later that there is a link that states how many people were polled..
      </p>
      <p>
       I wrote all of that because in the initial article, I skimmed through it, and didn't see how many people were polled.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't tell if you're trolling right now, I replied to something he linked, I didn't come up with anything..

       Do you think that I'm the other poster here? Or are you confused on usernames on who you're replying to?
