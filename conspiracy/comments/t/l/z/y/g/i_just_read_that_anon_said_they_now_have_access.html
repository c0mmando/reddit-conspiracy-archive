<p>Sure, Anonymous is used by CIA/FBI to tarnish the name but that&#39;s just the thing; everyone can be anonymous. It&#39;s not a singular group, but an idea.</p>

<p>Try not to think so black and white; the world is not so, either.</p>

I wouldn&#39;t pass the government and the CIA to do such a thing. I mean, 9/11 was practically done by the CIA/government to introduce martial law, anonymous is introduced to enforce internet laws, imagine how ignorant the people will become without the internet. 1984 seems like a scary reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s quite clever really, since there is no head you can&#39;t kill it.  People take what Anon says at face value and are forced to think for themselves whether they believe what is being said or not.  Remove authority (be it religion or established political) and you are really left to think for yourself and decide for yourself what message you agree with, or even promote your own on the same platform.</p>

<p>Of course this mechanism cannot really sustain, eventually it will either fall apart or graduate to something more formal, but it certainly seems to be filling some sort of purpose for now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Peer-reviewed meritocracy. Those who know most about the issue at hand get more weight in their opinions. They also take responsibility for their words/actions, as decent people should.</p>

<p>And as for property and resources... Sharing is caring. Obviously, there&#39;s always going to be greedy people, and those can be dealt with individually.</p>

<p>If I trust a person, I borrow or share what I have, to a point. Breaking that trust, obviously, has repercussions. If I have excess of what I need, I gladly share what I have with strangers, if nobody close to me needs it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What happens if a sect of your free thinking community is greedy and bands together to manipulate the peer-review system to favour their own group heavily.</p>

<p>Because this group organises their votes they need to coordinate frequently, and so they appoint a head coordinator to help make that process efficient and free others up from having to attend every meeting.</p>

<p>I could go on, but you see where I am going.</p>

<p>Ironically your ideal relies on everyone thinking like you and does not take into account actual free thinkers who by their nature have very different ideas to you.</p>

<p>The world is as it is today because of free thinking.  Free thinking does not necessarily make things better, it is not a virtue in of itself.  If you are seeking peace and happiness often times one can be much more content not thinking at all.  </p>

<p>Thoughts are ideas fighting for survival. It&#39;s not always pleasant when one idea comes up against another and battles it out.</p>

<p>Assange, while I&#39;m not fond of him, was a brilliant hacker. With a mind like his, I honestly wonder what he could have brought to the table purely from a helpful standpoint. And I don&#39;t mean in creating wikileaks, and leaking documents that were classified, I mean like, actually helping people.</p>

<p>Realistically though, we need to pull the old wait and see as we always do, and see what Anonymous says about this article coming out.

<p>Thank you, I actually needed to hear that and frankly, I believe you.

<p>But what about the subject matter regarding Government Cover-ups and things that are not paranormal, like inside-job assassinations and etc? surely it won&#39;t be available online, but having this access to different informations could surely lead to a pandora&#39;s box of expose&#39;s and other answers to questions (specially facts about history.) right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>But what about the subject matter regarding Government Cover-ups</em></p>

<p>Like what?  Everyone knows 9/11 was an inside job - it only takes an introductory physics course to figure that out.  We know who killed Kennedy and why.  We know the names of most major banking families,  intelligence operatives, their ideologies, etc.  It&#39;s mostly only minor stuff that is missing from the public record at this point which is useful and interesting but still minor.</p>

<p>There is definitely a deficit of good historical narratives though.  You can figure this stuff out on your own from information that is already public, but there are not many good history books available.  Even if you made all government archives available to the public I can&#39;t see it impacting the public&#39;s grasp of history much.  A well-educated President doing fireside chats like FDR under peacetime circumstances could get the job done.  Humans have a knack for detecting truth so if they ever get a leader that starts connecting the dots for them then most people will grasp the big picture relatively quick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not that I disagree with your claims, but:</p>

<p>&quot;At this point, a large majority (73%) wants the United States to reduce the number of troops in Afghanistan, but less than half (44%) want troops withdrawn completely.&quot;</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t mean they polled the entire country. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t really like either side using statistics like this.. Even Sportscenter, they get 100,000 votes and they say &quot;58% of America wants ___ to win&quot; but only 100,000 people&#39;s &quot;votes&quot; were counted.</p>

<p>I know I&#39;m going to get down voted for even posting this; but I&#39;m just saying, &quot;truthers are a substantial majority throughout the world&quot; is hyperbolic, there&#39;s really no way to know this, and a poll that doesn&#39;t even hit 10% of the country doesn&#39;t represent the entire population. You could ask 10,000 people if they like Blue M&amp;M&#39;s and 70% say yes, 30% say no. But if the next 10,000 you asked said the opposite, your poll would be a little skewed.</p>

<p>Edit; You can see it all over this, they are at least smart enough that in (some) of the cases, they state things like:</p>

<p>&quot;polled 16,063 people in 17 nations outside of the United States during the summer of 2008.&quot;</p>

<p>&#39;found that only 2 out of 5 of those polled in India&quot;</p>

<p>I know it&#39;s really not related to your overall purpose of your post, but it happens all over the place, politics, sports, news, whatever, statistics being displayed as a &quot;guarantee&quot; instead of saying a poll of 20,000 people.</p>

<p>&quot;Two out of three Americans perceive that over the decade since 9/11, U.S. power and influence in the world has declined&quot;</p>

<p>Really?  I know you&#39;re a sock puppet account but it&#39;s been a long time since I have seen the validity of statistics questioned.</p>

<p>Also, good job ignoring the parts of the article you don&#39;t like such as:</p>

<p>&quot;The poll indicated that nearly 90% percent of Germans are convinced that the government of the United States is not telling the whole truth about the September 11 attacks&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A new poll conducted in France by HEC Paris shows that 58% of French people doubt the official version of 9/11, and 49% believe the U.S. government might have intentionally allowed the attacks to happen&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;51% of Americans want Congress to probe Bush/Cheney regarding the 9/11 attacks, two-thirds (67%) of Americans say the 9/11 Commission should have investigated the collapse of World Trade Center Building 7&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A poll conducted by CNN-IBN in August 2007 found that only 2 out of 5 of those polled in India – the world’s second most populous country – believe that al-Qaeda is responsible for the 9/11 attacks&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The poll showed that in the world’s most populous country – China – only 32% believed that Al Qaeda carried out the attacks.&quot;</p>

<p>China and India are damn near half of the world&#39;s population and have an average belief rate in the 9/11 myth of about 35%.  9/11 truth has super-majority status now, not just majority.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The parts I don&#39;t like? I just pulled random parts out..</p>

<p>Why do you take things so personally?</p>

<p>I have no idea who you are, I&#39;ve never seen you post before (or don&#39;t recall it) I&#39;m just ponting it out.</p>

<p>&quot;but it&#39;s been a long time since I have seen the validity of statistics questioned.&quot;</p>

<p>So then you must have never taken any sort of Statistics/Probability courses in college? Because, this type of shit was brought up all the time.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t ignore any parts of the article I didn&#39;t like, I took parts that said how many people were polled, and one that said &quot;2 out of the 5..of those polled&quot;</p>

<p>You can&#39;t say, 66% of Americans agree on something, unless you put, of _____ amount of Americans, we found that 66% believe it.</p>

<p>Like seriously, in a non-objective opinion, which I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;ll give, considering how you&#39;ve already replied to me:</p>

<p>&quot;two-thirds (67%) of Americans say the 9/11 Commission should have investigated the collapse of World Trade Center Building 7&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>How many people do you think were polled for this?</p>

<p>I have no idea, but do you? Do you have a legitimate idea of how many people you think were polled for this?</p>

<p>Do you think they polled random people on the street? Or do you think they selectively polled people from certain locations?</p>

<p>Do you not notice shit like this, even when I point it out? Or were you selectively ignoring what I said?</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;A poll conducted by CNN-IBN in August 2007 found that only 2 out of 5 of those polled in India – the world’s second most populous country – believe that al-Qaeda is responsible for the 9/11 attacks&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>Okay cool, so 40% of those polled in India. This is obviously already an article that simply isn&#39;t being non-objective, as 40% is considered an &quot;only&quot; when it&#39;s nearly half of their poll.</p>

<p>But what do they not say, they don&#39;t say how many were polled. There are over a billion people in India, as the article does note, it&#39;s the second most populated country in the world. And the last number I saw from the article? 16,000.</p>

<p>So even let&#39;s say, double that, 32,000 people were polled. That&#39;s 32,000 of 1 billion. Let&#39;s just type that out so you can see just how few people that is.</p>

<p>32,000 vs 1,000,000,000. That&#39;s a FUCKLOAD of people, so you really think that 40% of India believes something? If no, because like the article suggests, &quot;of people polled&quot; then what do you believe? Then, you have to understand that that small percentage of people polled (assuming; because the article doesn&#39;t state it) that only 40% of THAT number actually believes that. That&#39;s not by any fucking means a &quot;substantial majority&quot;</p>

<p>That is what I pointed out in the article, and pointed out to you, and only that. The article makes other claims of this nature, but doesn&#39;t say &quot;of people polled&quot; it doesn&#39;t say &quot;of x amount of people&quot; it just states it, almost as to implicate that it&#39;s a guarantee, that it&#39;s certainty. </p>

<p>And what is the ONLY thing I brought to your attention, on your entire post?</p>

<p>That you can&#39;t say definitively that &quot;x%&quot; of people believe something, with such a small sample size.</p>

<p>To quote a legend on the ideas of whether or not there is Extra Terrestrial life in the galaxy:</p>

<p>&quot;To say that there aren&#39;t other forms of life out there would be like taking a cup of water from the ocean, saying that there are no whales in the cup, so there are no whales in the ocean.&quot;</p>

<p>This is essentially what broken statistics like this do. They take people, in which you have no idea the randomization of who they polled, an incredibly low number of people, relatively, to the population, which is finished off with &quot;So then... this % of the population believes this&quot;</p>

<p>This shit happens all the time, but it doesn&#39;t make it correct, by any means.</p>

<p>edit;</p>

<p>Just to clarify, I am by no means discrediting statistics, or the use of them. What I am discrediting is the use of an undetermined or unmentioned sample size, an in obviously one-sided article, which basically states that because a poll happened, with an amount of people you have no idea, then it means &quot;x% of a population&quot; believes something.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t mean that number of people are truthers :/</p>

<p>The poll also showed that 56% chose &#39;Don&#39;t know&#39;. Leaving the remaining 11% to choose between either the US govt, Israel and &#39;other&#39;. </p>

<p>Sorry, but the numbers just don&#39;t add up. The poll does not support your claim the majority of people believe it was an inside job. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Honestly, just <a href="http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/articles/international_security_bt/535.php">look at that poll</a>, there is an overwhelming amount of blue (Al Qaeda). And an extremely underwhelming amount of green (US Govt). </p>

<p><em>In conclusion; you are wrong. The majority of people believe either: Al Qaeda did it, or &#39;don&#39;t know&#39;. NOT &#39;US Govt&#39;</em></p>
