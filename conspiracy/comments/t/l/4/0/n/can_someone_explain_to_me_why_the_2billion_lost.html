       The $2 billion is a huge deal because the $2 billion dollars lost represented a change of 12 basis points, or 0.12% of the underlying assets in 6 days.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, in context this one trader (who represents JPM) is holding a position that is 2 billion/0.0012 = $1.66 trillion dollars. So this guy has a trillion dollar pile of CDO exposure, and over the last six days, its value has dropped $2 billion. The problem is, there is no reason that his cdo bet will get better: all of the macro for CDOs suck balls.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR This position is about 1/600th of all the assets in the world, and is the market right now. The market has started bleeding $2 billion dollars a week. When the bleeding gets worse, the losses will accelerate and it is highly likely at this time that JPM is about to find a $1.7 Trillion dollar hole in their balance sheet by the end of June. AIG x 4, and there will be no backstop for Jamie Dimon, the silver spoon fuck who was buying Jewel-Crusted Gold Trashcans for his new office while he was getting bailed out.
      </p>
      <p>
       The errors, sloppiness, and bad judgment were thinking he could overfail the US Government TWICE. That only worked on bush43.

       people like you are the reason 2007 happened in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       to expand, because many people were completely stupid about home equity situation, once upon a time, someone asked a simple question: What happens if real estate values go down?
      </p>
      <p>
       The math answer is that all your leverage will start working against you. Anyone who understands algebraic identities understands that. Sure as fuck, the PhDs programming knew this answer in 2003 and before, as there had been previous examples, such as Long Term Capital Management (one of the big players in that shitstorm is now taking over at JPMs troubled unit today). When you say I can't predict the future, ok. I can sure as shit tell you what will happen when the carry cost of borrowing exceeds your ability to generate revenue. as can anyone who passed accounting 101. In fact, my favorite episode of this happened during one of the multi hundred point declines (the first or second one in 07), when Erin Burnett reported for CNBC that "no one could have seen this coming" but then say, "no one thought property prices could decline in the aggregate."
      </p>
      <p>
       yeah, no one. except everyone who had talked about the demographic overhangs of the echo boomers. which by 2007, was a substantial number, but shitheads running around saying "you can't see the future" sure fucked us on that one didn't you?
      </p>

       learn math. or die trying.

       nope, no position. haven't had a position since 2006, when it became fair obvious that there was no rational play in the markets. this was shortly after the FBI released its blockbuster report in 2004 about home mortgage fraud. when bush43 crushed the investigations (something like 500 fbi agents sent to counterterror from fraud), i cashed out and headed for the hills.

       bankers would be lucky to have kept the employees they had that told them these things. as with all attempts to best the laws of physics with a 'rules are made to be broken' attitude, failure looms. Some people argue that this all started after the tech wreck, or after Nixon went off the gold standard, or after the Jekyll Island FED 1913 business. sometimes it is useful to imagine a cabal of wicked persons (possibly some aliens!) plotting it against the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       usually, though, it is enough to ask simple questions like: where will the money come from, or, if greece doesn't pay me, how can i get the money i need to finance the drug dealers' wars who will kill me if i stop laundering their money, and pay the bribes to the government officials who will kill me if i stop paying them?

       jamie dimon should have been fed to a fucking woodchipper on the white house lawn years ago. like most of his "associates". it is a stain on the honor of our nation that we have stood idly by. on the bright side, now that the abyss yawns wide, we know for certain that the bankers will at least be the first ones down the hole.

       JP Morgan is one of the companies that was apparently "too big to fail" and received public funded bail outs. To think that this institution is still running on its same old insane gambling MO that partially created this mess to begin with, would justifiably frustrate a lot of tax payers.

       It's one thing to gamble with YOUR money and take losses yourself, it's another thing entirely if some other guy is forced to give you a loan when the bookie comes to claim your losses.
      </p>
      <p>
       The following quotes are from a story on CNN.com a couple days ago (
       <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/05/11/markets/jpmorgan-faq/index.htm?iid=HP_LN):">
        http://money.cnn.com/2012/05/11/markets/jpmorgan-faq/index.htm?iid=HP_LN):
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "But the loss does raise all kinds of questions about the regulation of banks, the value of trading instruments called derivatives, the size of the world's largest firms and the systemic risk they may pose to the financial system."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Over the past few months, the unit has staked out a very large position in insurance-like bets called credit default swaps, the same type of instrument that caused so much havoc in 2008."
      </p>
      <p>
       "CEO Jamie Dimon, who was extremely agitated on the call, said the losses were caused by "errors," "sloppiness" and "bad judgment.""
      </p>
      <p>
       "In the wake of the financial crisis, critics have made the case that the biggest banks are still so large, so complex, and their desire for profits so great that they remain a systemic risk to the global financial system."
      </p>
      <p>
       Long story short, the MSM cares about ratings above all else, and this is something that will keep the public interested and tuning in. I do feel that this is an important story to drive into the public, because while it is nothing particularly out of the ordinary, or even illegal, it does show just how insane the culture of global finance is, and probably always will be so long as these gigantic money-vacuums exist.

       The MF Global scandal was a lot different.  Real deposited funds that were still there were scooted out of the company at the last minute.  Those funds belonged to individuals, it was their money.  I think that it would be much more difficult to argue that the $1.6 trillion actually exists.  Like Max Kaiser has been saying basically JP Morgan has less than zero net worth when you add in their liabilities.

       Remember that this industry is highly leveraged. When things are good banks can make enormous profits, but if things go south their losses can be disastrous.

       it means 20 billion dollars that they cant lend out and take interest on. money is always 10x to banks, because they leverage out at 10:1 or more. but yeah, in comparison to everything else, i dont see why this is getting pushed either.

       because today it is $3 billion, and JPM still doesn't have it under control. by the time we are done it may be closer to $9 billion on one position.
