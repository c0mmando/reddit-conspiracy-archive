       Let them imprison us, let them enslave us, let them lie to us. Let it happen as fast as possible. The one resounding thing about humanity is that when it comes to the last straw, we will fight back. We will fight back with no fear. We will win. The quicker they attempt to put us down will inevitably lead to the sooner oncoming of our revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this has happened before, over time it will happen again. It's our emotional equilibrium between good and evil. Between natural law and the social contract. Between generosity and exploitation. Between denial and realization.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, tomorrow, next year, it will not get better.
      </p>
      <p>
       One day though
      </p>
      <p>
       One day we will have finally learned from our history, from our mistakes.

       I like to think of r/conspiracy as a valuable counterpoint to those half-truths and lies we were told as children.  I always lament that I didn't know this conspiracy stuff sooner, because it would have changed some decisions I made earlier in life.  I think it's important now that we reach out to the younger generation and give them this VITAL and TRUTHFUL information, so that they can make more informed decisions about their future.

       The clock is ticking. History is cyclic, and the powers that be can't see that they're going to be their own undoing. They never can. Money is paper. Land ownership is paper, and laws are fucking paper. They've proved laws are paper by ignoring them. Paper burns, but we do not.  And gold isn't money. GOLD IS A MOTHERFUCKING SHINY ROCK, and please understand that it IS NOT RARE. Paper is all that protects them, and it protects them because we've been convinced we need to fear it. Remember that. We'll take back whats ours.  Just be patient. They need to believe we've been subdued.  I work in the bowels of Hollywood, and spend my time quietly observing the 1%. Their delusion is almost complete.  Just wait gentlemen. We don't have to bring them down, we only need to wait until they fall. Then we'll claw them to pieces.  We will fucking tear them apart.
      </p>
      <p>
       To the Agents that snoop and reports this subreddit:
Do you hear me 1%? I'm waiting at the bottom for you with claws and teeth, and I'm going to shred your whole fucking world, and when you finally die, I'll be waiting to dance by your corpse. I will erase everything that would mark your legacy.  We will make sure history forgets you. We will make sure that you end as you began in this world: as absoluty nothing.

       They can't act fast. They can only act slow, it's a long tedious process. They have to convince us to hand over our guns first. Until then we can fight back. But after that, we have no hope. We have to be sure to identify when it's time to act before it's too late.

       I dont understand, if "they" want to do anything, why is getting it down in Law important? I can see the mentality of the enemy here on reddit. They are clamping down in AMA with pressures for proof, while people are  exhibiting their lack of reasoning by feeding into the BS over in Askreddit where u can say anything to spark the hivemind to +5000 comments and no one not even reddit asks for proof.
 One guy commented on an AMA post about eluding the police in a car chase, 1st he said proof?, then he said,"this is not something u should be letting others know AND something others should have no interrst in knowing about." That is a big WHOA! He is saying just the knowledge AND/or interest in getting around authority is the worst of the worst (THOUGHT CRIME). Authority in what specifically is open ended. That is the framework of complete &amp; total control not only physically but mentally as well. I have no choice but to assume the guy that made this comment is a cop, he'd be perfect for FEMA. We can imagine a thousand scenarios where that comment fits perfectly &amp; is right, but that ama was about escaping a speeding ticket, something u are supposed to get out a jail for the next day. I never heard of someone getting 10 years for leading the police on a chase. This is the internet &amp; there  are parties interested in dictating what we should know &amp; be interested in? A car chase.

       Humanity has been like dealing with Linux, in my experience. There's always something to be learned, and when I do get the happy moment of finally cracking something I've been mulling over, I always go off and push the machine yet again. There's always new mistakes to make, new solutions to be found, and I doubt it's ever going to end. Just because it can get so damn fun.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what history and its conspiracies are, just finding new, similar mistakes to make which eventually turn out to be an amusing story to another human being generations later.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a weird contradiction of being involved but extremely detached. It'll never stop unless the human race stops, but that's

       They don't do it so we know....

       You think with how much we have had stripped away from us already that more will do anything?

       It's not something they do blatantly. You can't beat him on a horse with a stick, but in his bed at night. They come creeping in and steal our everything.

      <p>
       It's a nice thought, but have you read 1984? It gets so bad that we don't even know, and can't know and if we do all we are doing is feeding their machine of POWER.

       While I
       <strong>
        agree
       </strong>
       with you. Lets take the situation serious and discuss two points which suggest this won't happen.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         They don't want to enslave or jail us, they want to rule us and keep us ignorant. They don't seek to eradicate - only to own. It's all very well someone buying their own land, buying a gun and sitting on their porch waiting for the men in suites to show em who's boss. But the reality is the men in suites will never come, they're lucrative and will just effect you indirectly - owning you with never needing to step foot on your lawn.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Also what happens if they balance things at the 75% mark? Never enough to topple situations and never enough to compromise with us. We'd never justify to the masses we're right and to make change - and we'll never be satisfied either. It's a horrible though.

       I agree. If you could stop it, would you? Would you stop all the bad things, so that they wouldn't happen? Because if you would, wouldn't that leave things open so that they WILL happen later? We have to learn the hard way, because there is no other way. If humans learned from their mistakes we wouldn't be in this mess.

       This is interesting. I think it gets at the core of the philosophical issue. It always comes back to CONTROL. The occult(making secret) elements of societies has always been about controlling and "governing" knowledge. The philosophy says we CAN manipulate and control ALL the things! It is taught in our media-centers via propaganda and in our indoctrination schools -- that, like the alchemist manipulates material to ever search for prima-materia, if only there were
       <em>
        these
       </em>
       key series of scenarios, WE would be able to stop all of the bad things, just get rid of the bad guys and then everything will be peachy. You make a great point grandmasterfloss, even if we had the ability to change everything to our own liking, what makes us think that this image we have of a "utopia" wouldn't actually turn into an even more "hellish nightmare" as AJ would say (haha).

       I think if we are sure that there is a certain truism to being against the entire philosophy of control/ruling others, we could imagine human activities that would allow us to peaceably and voluntarily associate with one-another via means that produce mutually beneficial outcome. I have been focusing on how to Supersede the entire status-quo, or allow each of us to step out from under the prowess and have absolutely no need to be ruled/governed/controlled. This process has allowed me to discover some really insightful and increadible resources in the process.

       Learn about scalar weapons. You can't defeat what you dont see.

       Learn to deflect the effects of scalar with silk. There are more esoteric ways. But this is a start.

        Topics covered: Concepts covered in this lecture begin with the restoring force of a spring (Hooke's Law) which leads to an equation of motion that is characteristic of a simple harmonic oscillator (SHO). Using the small angle approximation, a similar expression is reached for a pendulum.
