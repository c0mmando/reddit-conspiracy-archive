       Do you get downvoted for being jewish, or being a dick about being jewish? Had you not just said it, I would have never known, but Reddit generally dislikes religion being shoved in their faces, having it brought up regularly, etc.

       I don't really see how I am being a dick about, it's more likely the arabs / nazi's buy accounts and make antisemitists posts towards us, there's even a pronazi subreddit called Israelexposed! can you believe that?

       Yes, I can. However, I think you have an extremist view of what other people are doing, and you probably shouldn't be looking for people to blame your downvotes on. If you're looking at history, that's the same think that the Nazis did during WWII (finding a scapegoat) and earlier, so the action that you are applying is no better than the concept of what they did. Also, this is the internet. The internet is full of assholes and pricks, and while there are good people, it's better to assume that everyone is an ignorant dumbass with no validity to their arguments until proven otherwise. If you're fairly new to Reddit and the internet in general you should stick around longer before automatically assuming that antisemites are seeking you out just to hate on you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note: I am not condoning what they're doing, just pointing out that it's fairly normal and you shouldn't be surprised or blame it on the fact that you're jewish.

       Okay, I just looked through your posts. To avoid further downvoting, it might be a good idea to stop going against the grain at every point possible, insulting people and constantly bringing up 'my people'. It's completely fine to be jewish, and it's okay to be passionate about it, but people don't want to see it, that's just the world we live in. And its not just the jews, it's every group that constantly brings up their religion/beliefs/actions, etc. To get upvotes, I would suggest sticking to
       <a href="/r/Judaism">
        /r/Judaism
       </a>
       where there are like-minded people who would appreciate your ranting and raging as opposed to reacting negatively to it.

       Not really...  despite what you think, reddit is just a bunch of normal people living under every circumstance of life. There's a mix of every kind of religion, ethnicity, belief system, and set of morals. They're not out to get you. I hate to use the analogy, but it's like america the website, except it doesn't suck.
      </p>
      <p>
       As my only bit of intentional opinionated thought, the jews were not by far the most abused people in history. Lets look at the Native Americans. When people arrived to the new world, they inhabited all of north america, middle america, and south america. Now, there are a few small tribes in south america, and a few living in the undesirable parts of north america, ie the desert and exceptionally cold regions. They killed almost ALL of the native americans. Now lets fast foreward a bit in US history. Slavery. Were the jews persecuted? No, millions and millions of black people were forced out of their homes and forced to work until they died. Some gained freedom before they were freed, but it wasn't at all common. And they fought to gain their freedom through the many years that they were there. On top of that, at least jews weren't treated as objects that could be bought, sold, used, and abused. Still further in history, about the same, if not many million more people were killed in communist russia during the same time period, and lasted far beyond the end of WWII. This was because despite popular beliefs, Stalin was actually a much more brutal and ruthless man than Hitler. At least there are rough estimates as to how many jews were killed. In russia, they don't know, and can never know. Estimates range between 20 and 50 million of his own people were killed. That's opposed to the ~6 million killed in the holocaust. Seems less significant now, doesn't it? And all of these other groups, while they suffered much more, they don't bitch and gripe about it all the time. They accepted it as fact, and that it's over now. They know that they can move on an integrate into the world with everyone else, because it happened in the past and it doesn't matter anymore. That as opposed to jews, who can constantly bring up the holocaust and persecution and base all of their arguments off of the fact that 70 years ago they had horrible things done to them. I realize that the situation in Israel and Pakistan is still going on, but it doesn't seem like that receives enough attention. Even so, the jews aren't the victims there (everyone is equally at fault).
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's why the more extremist jews annoy me. This is the same for extremist muslims, christians, etc, but that's irrelevant here.

       alright, semi-sufficient answer. How come there are inconsistencies between the holy books, even though they're essentially written at the same time, about some of the same people, and revolving around the same supreme God?

       For the amount that you go parading around your religion, you should better educate yourself on these kinds of things. it's very useful when someone comes along and starts questioning your beliefs. Sorry to break it to you, but 'we are gods chosen people' doesn't hold up in a debate/argument with someone who doesn't share your beliefs.

       No. You're not allowed to just say that I'm ignorant and move on. That's the problem with overly religious people. When met with a challenging question or concept, they claim ignorance or victimization to avoid giving an answer. If you leave on that, not only will you be forever lowering my perception of all jews, you will have %100 lost an argument to an atheist/animist teenager. If you're satisfied with lowering yourself and 'your people' to that level, go ahead and persist with your weak claim. If you want to grow a pair for the sake of your religion and your god, prove that I'm wrong.

       See? This guy does it right. He states his argument, then backs it up with 12 different sources that reinforce his statement. While a bit harsh with that bottom part, it's still well presented. Have an upvote, sir.
