    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I can. However, I think you have an extremist view of what other people are doing, and you probably shouldn&#39;t be looking for people to blame your downvotes on. If you&#39;re looking at history, that&#39;s the same think that the Nazis did during WWII (finding a scapegoat) and earlier, so the action that you are applying is no better than the concept of what they did. Also, this is the internet. The internet is full of assholes and pricks, and while there are good people, it&#39;s better to assume that everyone is an ignorant dumbass with no validity to their arguments until proven otherwise. If you&#39;re fairly new to Reddit and the internet in general you should stick around longer before automatically assuming that antisemites are seeking you out just to hate on you.</p>

<p>Note: I am not condoning what they&#39;re doing, just pointing out that it&#39;s fairly normal and you shouldn&#39;t be surprised or blame it on the fact that you&#39;re jewish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I just looked through your posts. To avoid further downvoting, it might be a good idea to stop going against the grain at every point possible, insulting people and constantly bringing up &#39;my people&#39;. It&#39;s completely fine to be jewish, and it&#39;s okay to be passionate about it, but people don&#39;t want to see it, that&#39;s just the world we live in. And its not just the jews, it&#39;s every group that constantly brings up their religion/beliefs/actions, etc. To get upvotes, I would suggest sticking to <a href="/r/Judaism">/r/Judaism</a> where there are like-minded people who would appreciate your ranting and raging as opposed to reacting negatively to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really...  despite what you think, reddit is just a bunch of normal people living under every circumstance of life. There&#39;s a mix of every kind of religion, ethnicity, belief system, and set of morals. They&#39;re not out to get you. I hate to use the analogy, but it&#39;s like america the website, except it doesn&#39;t suck.</p>

<p>As my only bit of intentional opinionated thought, the jews were not by far the most abused people in history. Lets look at the Native Americans. When people arrived to the new world, they inhabited all of north america, middle america, and south america. Now, there are a few small tribes in south america, and a few living in the undesirable parts of north america, ie the desert and exceptionally cold regions. They killed almost ALL of the native americans. Now lets fast foreward a bit in US history. Slavery. Were the jews persecuted? No, millions and millions of black people were forced out of their homes and forced to work until they died. Some gained freedom before they were freed, but it wasn&#39;t at all common. And they fought to gain their freedom through the many years that they were there. On top of that, at least jews weren&#39;t treated as objects that could be bought, sold, used, and abused. Still further in history, about the same, if not many million more people were killed in communist russia during the same time period, and lasted far beyond the end of WWII. This was because despite popular beliefs, Stalin was actually a much more brutal and ruthless man than Hitler. At least there are rough estimates as to how many jews were killed. In russia, they don&#39;t know, and can never know. Estimates range between 20 and 50 million of his own people were killed. That&#39;s opposed to the ~6 million killed in the holocaust. Seems less significant now, doesn&#39;t it? And all of these other groups, while they suffered much more, they don&#39;t bitch and gripe about it all the time. They accepted it as fact, and that it&#39;s over now. They know that they can move on an integrate into the world with everyone else, because it happened in the past and it doesn&#39;t matter anymore. That as opposed to jews, who can constantly bring up the holocaust and persecution and base all of their arguments off of the fact that 70 years ago they had horrible things done to them. I realize that the situation in Israel and Pakistan is still going on, but it doesn&#39;t seem like that receives enough attention. Even so, the jews aren&#39;t the victims there (everyone is equally at fault).</p>

<p>And that&#39;s why the more extremist jews annoy me. This is the same for extremist muslims, christians, etc, but that&#39;s irrelevant here.</p>
