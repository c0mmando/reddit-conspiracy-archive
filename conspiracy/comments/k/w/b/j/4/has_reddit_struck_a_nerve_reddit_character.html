<p>I think we&#39;ve all heard the gossip that Anderson Cooper was recruited by the <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/blog/lewrw/archives/19025.html">CIA right out of Yale</a>, right? Well, even if that&#39;s not true, Anderson Cooper sure has a hard-on for Reddit right now...perhaps he&#39;s been surfing too much <a href="/r/jailbait">/r/jailbait</a>???</p>

<p>It comes to mind that there has quite possibly been posts of a certain nature (in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> or <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>?) that may be upsetting to certain members of the establishment, and I can&#39;t think of a more suitable (and predictable) tactic than to muddy Reddit&#39;s credibility by accusing us of being CP distributors.</p>

<p>What do you guys think? Is Cooper just pulling this one out of his ass for sensationalism&#39;s sake, or does someone have an axe to grind?</p>

<p>&quot;I wonder what reddit did that&#39;s pissing off corporate america. CNN doesn&#39;t report military contractors raping underage Iraqi girls. They don&#39;t report CPS molestingï»¿ little girls. They report a group of people using reddit to comment on teenager girls in bikinis to attack reddit.&quot;</p>

<p>edit: using the term is not inherently misogynistic, however, attempting to control others by labeling their (innocuous)speech as hateful is in fact an attempt to control their actions, which can easily be viewed as &quot;matriarchal&quot;(in the light of a feminist attempting control) and thus, against the goal of egalitarianism. your time would better be served combating the use of the term &quot;dick&#39;, which is quite misandristic, and very much prevalent.</p>

<p>misandristic is not recognized by my spell check as a legitimate word, MATRIARCHY.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if you think about it this is a site that has organized protests, outed police brutality every single day, smashed news organizations, supported information leaks, and shit on politicians from every side of the political spectrum for doing the people wrong. This is a site made up of real people who (in between rage comics and cat pics) are standing up for other real people. </p>

<p>This hivemind way of thinking is bringing people up and bringing establishments down even if people don&#39;t think they are actively participating in doing so. Thus, a smear campaign from the establishment was in order and the scarlet red letter of 21st century is the accusation of CP. The accusation doesn&#39;t even have to be remotely accurate, it&#39;s something that American rubes can rally against and it&#39;s currently the easiest way to paint an entity in a negative light. </p>

<p>This is a large site that does not jive with the establishment&#39;s goals and thus it was smeared. Simple as that.</p>

<p>More importantly, once an entity is successfully smeared with CP in the public mind, <em>nothing</em> they have said or done (past, present and future) is valid. People will always default back to the CP accusation and ignore facts. </p>

<p>This must be squashed immediately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s about mind control. The images in the jailbait site are all images of people wearing clothes. They are not porn. Cooper and his ilk are concerned that someone might get excited looking at them. He is worried about what someone might <em>think</em>, not about the actual images. WTF? Why would he be concerned about what someone else is thinking? Why would he presume that they are thinking naughty thoughts, unless he is thinking naughty thoughts himself?</p>

<p>There are a lot of /r/ that he could raise a stink over - but the accusation of CP is low hanging fruit, which will be used in the future thusly:</p>

<p><em>&quot;...the hacker had posted to the online forum Reddit.com, which is a popular site among hackers and political activists and has entire forums dedicated to things such as jailbait - pictures of barely dressed teens which site users comment on...&quot;</em></p>

The two yes-women who agreed with everything Cooper said seemed to be reciting from a script they had memorized. What hypocrites! I see this as an attack on free speech -- it&#39;s got nothing at all to do with porn.

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s just a matter of time before some of these subreddits are brought into a more mainstream attention.  There are some pretty weird/creepy things in here.  I&#39;m glad I can chose not to have them on my frontpage, but I&#39;m sure there are plenty of folks that spend all day in their underwear hitting F5.  :C~~~~~  BARF</p>

<p>EDIT - I did just hear that they talked to the same guy about FREE PIZZA and lauded how wonderful Reddit was.  Interesting.  One thing likely lead to the next in the &quot;research.&quot;  Meaning:  &quot;When I&#39;m done with this eating this pizza in my undies and hitting F5, I need to come up with another story ASAP!!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many of us had made this point before, that Reddit was going to be slurred by the &quot;taint&quot; of <a href="/r/jailbait">/r/jailbait</a> and other similar subreddits, and that Conde Nast would likely suffer by association. </p>

<p>Everyone that bleats on about the legality of <a href="/r/jailbait">/r/jailbait</a> fails to miss the point that just because something is legal doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t fairly unpleasant (eg coprophagia) and even hugely unethical. Also, at the end of the day who verifies that all those pictures are over 18? And do they have the permission of their subjects to be posted in what is clearly a masturbatory/pornographic context?</p>

<p>Whether they are easily accessible elsewhere is besides the point.  They are collated here, or links to them are, and that affects the perception of the whole community. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jailbiat at one time was run by different mods that had a clear set of rules and would remove posts that broke them. It was shut down &amp; banned a few months ago (Early May I think) and then was re-opened between a few weeks to a month later with a different group of admin&#39;s / mods. And now a few months after it was reopend, with new mods, it&#39;s on Anderson Coopers show used to paint the site in a bad light which I find rather interesting (almost like it was planned since it closed an was reopened with new admin/mods) </p>

<p>I know this because there was a thread in r/circlejerk that discussed this happening and how it transpired. One of the original mods was posting in the r/circlejerk thread. The person comes staright out and says something along the lines of &quot;I was a mod of this r/subreddit until it was banned today, this is what happened and this is how we  have been conducting ourselves&quot; (forget his handle but I think it was lordvobus {sp?})</p>

<p>I&#39;m surprised the fact it was banned at one point about 2 months ago has not been mentioned yet since this is r/conspiracy (should be able to search reddit for the relevant threads refering to the sub reddit being banned/unbanned)</p>

<p>No shit? You know who else is fond of this method? I&#39;ll let you guess.</p>

<p>He&#39;s also counting on your response to this to drive his hits up. If it&#39;s popular topic in terms of number of viewers, he will use reddit for hits again.</p>

<p>Woah, back up...</p>

<p>Let me be sure I understand you correctly. You&#39;re saying I shouldn&#39;t draw attention to AC&#39;s sensationalism and gross overcharacterization of reddit  because it will drive up hits on the CNN website, which in turn will help pay AC&#39;s salary?</p>

<p>I hope what they&#39;re paying you is enough to ease your conscience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I have an incredibly strong argument. Why not go after 4chan (that has actual CP posted to it every day) or any number of the websites that actually host the images that get posted to <a href="/r/jailbait">/r/jailbait</a>? Because obviously someone has an axe to grind against reddit. If you can&#39;t see that, you are either wildly disillusioned or you are working to try to control the opposition.</p>

<p>Furthermore, you clearly didn&#39;t notice that I linked to a reddit search for &quot;Anderson Cooper&quot; in my <strong>self post</strong>, and since I didn&#39;t link directly to AC&#39;s site or any of his affiliate sites, I am not actually driving up traffic for him and he receives no revenue from my post. You argument has sunken friend, and the failboat has sailed.</p>
