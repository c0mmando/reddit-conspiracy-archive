        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Next wednesday marks the anniversary of 9/10/01, the last time in our nation&#39;s history when we could count on any sanity in government, and plan on living our lives in relative peace and convenience. Massive, obvious inside job or not, the vastly disproportionate overreaction of fascist elements of our government has destroyed America in a way that no terror attack ever could. Nothing done since then has made our lives any safer, but let&#39;s review what OUR government has done to OUR people since then.</p>

<p>-Civil liberties have been eroded. People are arrested and attacked for peacefully protesting.</p>

<p>-The media is now the loudspeaker of the government, not it&#39;s watchdog or critic. GOP shills are parading around as journalists, and using religious and nationalist overtones (as well as screaming) to malign those who would engage in rational dialogue.</p>

<p>-Internment camps for US citizens (run by FEMA/Northcom) are all over. We have 77 of them that I know of, and one can hold about 200,000 people. Some are called &quot;Residential Centers&quot;, and are guarded by men with guns that will kill you if you try to leave. Don&#39;t even ask about the mass gravesites being dug.</p>

<p>-Police are killing our citizens with tasers, guns, and blunt force trauma, and getting paid &#39;administrative leave&#39;. Cops lie and deny and congratulate each other, after all, you&#39;re livestock, and they exist to control you and to protect the rich from your anger.</p>

<p>-Heroic whistleblowers are killed or imprisoned without trial -permanently- for exposing war crimes. Remember Bradley Manning? What he did was entirely legal under the Federal Whistleblower Protection Act, posted visibly in every federal facility.</p>

<p>-The gap between rich and poor is among the worst in the world. Most corporations pay more in bonuses to their CEOs than they do in taxes.</p>

<p>-Our nation&#39;s infrastructure has rotted hollow. Power grids and bridges are worse off than they were in the 1950&#39;s.</p>

<p>-Social Security has been looted. Why pay into it? Under 40? You&#39;re not going to see a fucking dime of it.</p>

<p>-Realistic employment rates are at about 25% nationwide.</p>

<p>-we&#39;ve been dragged into at least 3 wars that are NOT supported by the people, and have now been pointlessly occupying Iraq for OVER 20 YEARS.</p>

<p>-Faith in government has never been lower.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s not forget that Bin Laden was armed and trained by the CIA, and that Al Quaeda was called, by President Reagan, &quot;the moral equivalent of our founding fathers.&quot; when they were fighting the Soviets. Let&#39;s also not forget that he died of complications from Marfan&#39;s syndrome over ten years ago, and denied ANY INVOLVEMENT in the attacks (until replaced by a body double that bore only a shabby resemblance to him). But even if you forget that, and forget the obvious controlled demolition, and the huge indiscrepancies between the government version and reality, and don&#39;t believe half of what I said, the remaining half...or third...or TENTH...is far worse than what any terrorist boogeyman has ever done to us on 9/11 or since then.</p>

<p>Forget 9/11. Remember 9/10, and realize who the real enemy is.</p>

<p>WTSHTF-KEIAU.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/military/news/4312850">Sums it up pretty nicely</a></p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Hundreds of thousands of plastic coffins
CLAIM: &quot;500,000 plastic air-tight coffins in the middle of Atlanta Georgia. Apparently the Government is expecting a Half Million people to die relatively soon, and the Atlanta Airport is a major airline traffic hub, probably the biggest in the country, which means Georgia is a prime base to conduct military operations and coordination. It is also the home of the CDC, the Center for Disease Control. I don&#39;t want to alarm anyone, but usually you don&#39;t buy 500,000 plastic coffins &#39;just in case something happens,&#39; you buy them because you know something is going to happen. These air tight seal containers would be perfect to bury victims of plague or biological warfare in, wouldn&#39;t they?&quot;</li>
</ol>

<p>FACT: The black polypropylene products purported to be coffins are grave liners, or burial vaults, manufactured by Convington, Ga.-based Vantage Products. (In this case, they are examples of the company&#39;s Standard Air Seal model.) The use of a burial vault, which prevents the collapse of cemetery ground and protects the casket, is a common requirement when a body is interred.</p>

<p>The filmed lot in Madison, Ga., is a Vantage storage facility. Of the 900,000 or so in-ground burials in the U.S. each year, a small percentage of those people prearranged their own caskets and vaults--which Vanguard holds at the storage facility until the appropriate time. According to company Vice President of Operations Michael Lacey, there are approximately 50,000 vaults in storage in Madison. &quot;It&#39;s nowhere near the quantity they talk about on the Internet,&quot; he told the local Morgan County Citizen newspaper. Furthermore, Lacey has said the company maintains detailed records of product ownership and is audited annually, to insure all vaults are accounted for.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not really surprised they called for an international boycott in 1933. Although I&#39;m not sure which laws against Jews had been implemented by that point. </p>

<p>That is factually unture.  Bin Laden was working with groups who recieved aide and training from the Pakistani ISI who was funded by the US and the Saudis.  Al Qaeda was not founded till after the Soviets had already largely pulled out furthermore Americans at the time were legally barred from entering Afghanistan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not at all.  The Taliban is a totally grass roots Pashtun movement that took over most of Afghanistan with the funding and support of the Pakistani ISI.  The movement was started as the result of the rampant rape of children by warlords.  Mullah Mohammad Omar, a small town Imam and his talibs (meaning &quot;Islamic student&quot;) stormed a warlord&#39;s compound after a particularly gruesome event and ended up hanging the pedo from the turret of one of his T-72&#39;s.</p>
