I think more happened then the official story but the most I am willing to admit is that the Government let it happened not that they were behind it. That being said help me understand more about what you guys think.</p>

<p>So if it was hit by a missile what happened to the plane? It must have went somewhere, so either the pilots were in on it or it was taken over and diverted. I am sure it would be easy enough to make it vanish once you had control of it but why bother? Why bother with a missile when you already have a plane you have to make vanish? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were one or two somewhat-famous people on the pentagon plane, though.  </p>

<p>&quot;Barbara Olson, 45, Great Falls, VA, an author, legal analyst and former federal prosecutor and congressional lawyer, a conservative commentator who often appeared on CNN, and was married to U.S. Solicitor General Theodore Olson.&quot;</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t someone who was just made up.</p>

And hubby <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Olson">Ted Olson</a> has changed his story several times saying it was a plane phone, cell phone, plane phone, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In 2006, the US Government presented evidence at Zacarias Moussaoui&#39;s trial. You can download the US Government&#39;s trial evidence yourself <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/notablecases/moussaoui/exhibits/prosecution/flights/P200055.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Far from attributing all four of the “connected calls to unknown numbers” to Barbara Olson, as the 9/11 Commission suggested, the government’s evidence here attributes none of them to her, saying instead that each of them was from an “unknown caller.” <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/planes/evidence/docs/exhibit/BarbaraOlson.png">The only call attributed to Barbara Olson, moreover, is an “unconnected call” to the Department of Justice, which was said to have been attempted at “9:18:58” and to have lasted “0 seconds.”</a> According to the US government in 2006, in other words, Barbara Olson attempted a call to the DOJ, but it did not go through.</p>

<p>The government itself has presented evidence in a court of law, therefore, that implies that unless its former solicitor general was the victim of two faked phone calls, he was lying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, this does not have anything do do with my point.  This does ZERO to answer the question of what happened to a real, up-til-now live person.  My point was not whether she made calls.  My point, originally, was that this was a live person who, after 9/11, was never seen again.  It was not a made up person; and <em>this</em> was the issue I was countering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lets just go round and around about bullshit, mkay? I&#39;m showing you that it&#39;s a lie. The information that is considered truth such as wikipedia, newspaper, TV are lying to you. You probably heard that terrorists wielding box cutters hijacked planes and crashed them. Where did that information come from? Ted Olson, husband of the semi-famous person you are inquiring about. You mentioned Barbara Olson and I proceeded to explain FACTS about her to you. </p>

<p>What else do you want? I&#39;ve already stated that us average folks don&#39;t know the answer to your question and that you will not find the information you seek. I furnished you with the only information I have on Barbara Olson.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You didn&#39;t explain any facts about her other than apparently she did not call from the airplane.  Of course, I never claimed she did, did I?  No, because that wasn&#39;t my point.  You&#39;re trying to prove me wrong in something <em>I wasn&#39;t fucking claiming</em>.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ll spell it out again for you since you don&#39;t seem to get it.  My statement was that someone &quot;somewhat famous&quot; was on that plane.  That&#39;s it.  That&#39;s all I claimed.  And, as I&#39;ve explained several times, the reason I said that was because I was illustrating someone who was not &quot;made up&quot;.  Right?</p>

<p>So... if you think the whole story is bullshit, PROVE she wasn&#39;t on the plane.  No, saying &quot;we&#39;ll never know&quot; is horse shit.  She was supposed to be on that plane, she bought a ticket on that plane, that plane was never seen again, and she was never seen again.  Any fucking <em>reasonable</em> person would have no problem deducing that she was on the plane, until someone proves otherwise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is my last reply. Not only did I show you that the phone call from Flight 77 to Ted Olson was false, but that the entire story of the terrorists having box cutters is fake too. That was <strong>only</strong> said by Ted Olson, repeating what his wife Barbara supposedly told him.</p>

<p>Facts</p>

<ul>
<li>Ted Olson did not receive telephone call(s) from Barbara Olson.</li>
<li>The box cutter story came from Ted Olson, via Barbara.</li>
</ul>

<p>I can&#39;t prove she wasn&#39;t or was on the plane. I&#39;m a regular guy with the same access to information as you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>^ This is my guesstimate as well. I theorize that a plane was in the air as described by <a href="http://citizeninvestigationteam.com/official-interviews.html">all of these witnesses</a>, but it was not on the flight path of the official story. It flew low and over the pentagon, then the planted explosives go off, and everyone thinks it&#39;s a 2nd plane that continues past the pentagon. And no, I don&#39;t think the C-130 was the plane or &#39;2nd plane&#39; as it was much higher in the air.</p>

<p>Have you seen the passenger list for Flight 77? See <a href="http://911review.org/Wiki/Flight77Passengers.shtml">here</a> or <a href="http://killtown.911review.org/flight77/passengers.html">here</a>. It looks like a charter flight for the military-industrial complex; it&#39;s almost as if this plane should have taken off from the Pentagon, rather than supposedly crashing into it. </p>

I had heard of the discrepancies with the plane serial numbers, the transponder analysis showing almost inhuman piloting abilities, but this passenger list is astounding.

<p>Hani Hanjour, the person accused of flying Flight 77 into the Pentagon, was failing his courses at the Arizona flight school. According to an employee, &quot;He didn&#39;t care about the fact that he couldn&#39;t get through the course.&quot;</p>

<p>In the second week of August 2001, Hanjour had attempted to rent a small plane from an airport in Bowie, MD. Flight instructors Sheri Baxter and Ben Conner declined his request, after taking Hanjour on three test runs, noting he had trouble controlling and landing the Cessna 172. Though Hanjour had attended a flight school in Scottsdale, AZ, for four months in 1996 and 1997, he never completed the coursework for a single-engine aircraft license.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only other thing I can show you is the undamaged lawn. Normally, plane crashes fuck up grass as shown <a href="http://www.airdisaster.com/photos/fdx1478/2.shtml">here</a>, <a href="http://www.airdisaster.com/photos/vl352/2.shtml">here</a> and <a href="http://www.airdisaster.com/photos/ua232/2.shtml">here</a>.</p>

<p>And pushers of the Official Government Conspiracy Theory say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The plane slammed into the west wall of the Pentagon. The impact was deafening. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20011122185232/http://www.delawareonline.com/newsjournal/local/2001/09/12terrorspreadsto.html">The fuselage hit the ground and blew up.&quot;</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Some eyewitnesses <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/09/11/national/main310721.shtml">believe the plane actually hit the ground at the base of the Pentagon first</a>, and then skidded into the building. Investigators say that&#39;s a possibility, which if true, crash experts say may well have saved some lives.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>I saw it hit right in front of -- it didn&#39;t appear to crash into the building; <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0109/11/bn.32.html">most of the energy was dissipated in hitting the ground</a>, but I saw the nose break up, I saw the wings fly forward, and then the conflagration engulfed everything in flames. It was horrible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So where is the damaged lawn? I don&#39;t see it in any of <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/pentagon/evidence/photos/bluehi.html">these</a> or <a href="http://criticalthrash.com/terror.html">these</a> pictures. Why are the cable spools on the lawn undamaged as shown in <a href="http://imgur.com/a/Qyw74">these pictures</a>?</p>

<p>We can only prove that the Official Government Conspiracy Theory is a lie. We can&#39;t answer all the questions from that day. That&#39;s why we need a true independent investigation into 9/11 and bring the real perpetrators to justice. The 9/11 Commission investigation was a joke.</p>

<p>$30 Million to investigation <a href="http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/04/01/starr.costs/">Monica Lewinsky</a>, $175 million for the <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2003/mar/15/nation/na-probe15">Columbia space shuttle investigation</a>, but only <a href="http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/about/faq.htm#q5">$15 million for the 9/11 commission investigation</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a lot you don&#39;t understand about what goes on in the inner circles.  There&#39;s a lot that I don&#39;t understand either.  When you get lots of high powered and wealthy people together, they tend to form partnerships.  And sometimes those partnerships are for good and sometimes they are for doing bad.   It&#39;s funny how everyone agrees that wealthy and high powered people come together to do good things but when we start thinking or talking about how they do bad things, people just don&#39;t believe it for some reason.  People do bad things.   Just because the people involved are rich and powerful doesn&#39;t make it impossible.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We know for a fact that the WTC towers weren&#39;t hit by planes at all and neither was the pentagon so I don&#39;t think the planes/flights ever existed in the first place.  And about 95 % of the alleged deaths on the plane weren&#39;t real.  Some of them were real but most were not.  Who these people were in real life that died?  I don&#39;t know but my guess is that they were most likely relatives of some big shot insiders or they were themselves insiders.   Do you think the corporations and Govt are incapable of putting &quot;their boys&quot; in strategic jobs in order to pull something like this off?

<p>I have done so, as I was once convinced too.  I have since learned, like many others, that none of these claims hold up to hard scrutiny.  </p>

<p>Head on over to <a href="/r/skeptic">/r/skeptic</a> some time if you want to learn why.  The whole idea here is critical thinking.  And I don&#39;t mean critical as in &quot;distrust authority&quot;, I mean taking a simple, scientific approach to research and investigating.  Pretty much every conspiracy theory that&#39;s been pitched about 9/11 has long since been debunked, but you probably don&#39;t want to talk about that.</p>

The exit holes in the C ring are puzzling, so was the fact that clocks stopped at 9:30 and explosions were reported at 9:30.   One woman walked out right through the &#39;entrance hole&#39;</p>

<p>there&#39;s no evidence for the plane, funny because they had 10 years to produce one convincing security camera tape.</p>

<p>the other damning evidence is the light poles.   the cabbie that confessed his story was bunk, and that the wings or whatever clipped them didn&#39;t divert or destroy the plane.      </p>
