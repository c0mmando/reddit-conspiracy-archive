There is speculation that this is in response to Gaddafi&#39;s plan to change the currency within Africa to the gold dinar, which would cause a mass shift in the state of the World economy</p>

<p>(link : <a href="http://madmikesamerica.com/2011/05/is-nato-involvement-in-libya-about-gaddafis-gold/">http://madmikesamerica.com/2011/05/is-nato-involvement-in-libya-about-gaddafis-gold/</a> )</p>

<p>Nato&#39;s involvement would be seen as a favour, and the Libyans would be compelled into giving them cheap (or free) oil for their services.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the government formed by the rebels included a new banking hub, plans for oil exportation, and pre formed alliances with several of the worlds super powers. The only difference between libya and syria is the level of involvement of our own nations in the region.</p>

<p>There was no swaying, this coup was formed well in advance of the libyan uprising, and was milked accordingly by the propaganda machine to pluck at the heartstrings of mortal men. Syria along with iran and a few other countries gave us authority to go in, as long as we didn&#39;t meddle in their own protests.</p>

<p>Believe what you want to, but libya is just another pre-planned coup d&#39;etat organized and authorized by shady back room deals and the cia. The objective was the oil contracts that libya was to give strictly to china, russia and germany after cutting out most western powers such as italy, france, england and the us.</p>

<p>So don&#39;t be so naive, believing that the protesters asked for assistance, when they clearly stated &quot;don&#39;t bomb us bro!&quot;</p>

<p>The cause was hijacked by the powers that be.</p>

<p>And what about the british sas force of 6 that was protecting one of the rebel leaders, two weeks in to the affair, before they even began opening offices in france, the states.......</p>

<p>Look, it&#39;s a fucking conspiracy. They conspired to do this ahead of time. That&#39;s why the pieces fell in to place so quickly. Why nato didn&#39;t stop the fighting on all sides like the missions in the 90&#39;s, and why we are fucked. You want democracy for libya? Maybe killing opposing viewpoints isn&#39;t the way to go.</p>

<p>Seriously though, go check out the lockerbie stuff on your own, you will be shocked.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also never known forbes to be a socialist propagandist website. Now do you see what actually led up to all of this bullshit death? A means to protect the future exports of oil and other resources from the african nations, also to protect the waterways, which is why yemen is next.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gotcha. So, what you have here is a Forbes article from 2009 that says <em>nothing</em> of any future conspiracy to depise Gadaffi and another &quot;article&quot; from the New American (infowars jr.) that cites as it&#39;s primary source a Mr. Robert Wenzel...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I have never before heard of a central bank being created in just a matter of weeks out of a popular uprising,” noted Robert Wenzel in an analysis for the Economic Policy Journal. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>An analysis for the Economic Policy Journal? It&#39;s a blog, man. A blog with the same unfounded conspiracy theories that cites other blogs as evidence, that cite blogs as evidence, which cite even more blogs as evidence until you&#39;re lost in the rabbit hole. And you call this &quot;putting the pieces together?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>and believing lopsided propaganda is the bane of conspiracy theorists. </p>

<p>would you have argued that the invasion of poland was justified, as polish soldiers obviously attacked a german radio installation in 1939? that was stated as clear fact, and unless you had a really good line on the truth, you wouldn&#39;t have had any idea it wasn&#39;t true. that&#39;s just one singular example of events being faked as pretext for war. </p>

<p>so just using some relatively recent ones from america, you&#39;ve got the gulf of tonkin, 9/11, and iraqi WMDs. are you going to tell me that after being repeatedly lied to about why we need to fight yet another war, you&#39;re ready to just believe this one? that they&#39;re probably telling the truth this time? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What? Is Human Rights Watch simply an arm of this vast, shadowy conspiracy of yours? Do you have evidence that news outlets widely accepted as legitimate and unbiased, such as BBC and NPR/PBS are shills? </p>

<p>Each link I provided you featured either a well-researched article in which sources are cited and then, if possible, verified independently or from an organization dedicated to reporting human rights abuses across the world... the same organization that strongly condemned the human rights abuses in Guantanamo and those secret CIA prisons <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has such a hardon for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>human rights watch is barely a credible source of information, they barely go in to detail and they cited the lockerbie case as a link to terrorism conducted by libya. Look at the lockerbie case, i mean really look at it. Read the court files and how the judge handled the submission of evidence. Keep in mind, this was the one bit of propaganda most utilized by western media three weeks prior to the beginning of the revolution in libya.</p>

<p>Now look at human rights watches website, it is not even the slightest bit critical towards the rebels and their treatment of pro gov forces. These people, regardless of their ideals, are still civilians. But they are raided at night, and whole families slaughtered, simply because they believe their government was doing the right thing.</p>

<p>Human rights watch is just another bullshit website presenting one side of the facts, while ignoring what would be inconvenient towards the portrayal of history in the future. </p>

<p>Remember why we went in to iraq? And then we capture and kill saddam. This is the same shit, just with a leader who hasn&#39;t actually been all that bad. And for that, the repercussions will be a long, tumultuous time for the libyan people at the expense of our own national integrity. If that even exists anymore.</p>

<p>Human rights watch is just an ignorant politically serving propagandist website.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously, dude. Veteranstoday is another conspiracy rag and Matt Drudge, god love him, provides news for people who don&#39;t bother to read beyond the headlines.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t appreciate ad hominem attacks, so I&#39;ll try my best to avoid them here and explain why the links you&#39;ve provided aren&#39;t valid evidence of some conspiracy.</p>

<p>The veteranstoday article, aside from the obvious agenda of the site itself, simply cherrypicks quotes from articles and editorials without linking to the cited article. Then, veteranstoday proceeds to explain the intent of said quote without any of its context to make his argument.</p>

<p>The Drudge article links to an article from a site that a) has an agenda and b) isn&#39;t independantly verified.</p>

<p>I know r/conspiracy has a hard-on for hating legitimate news sources. But, those sources are legitimate for a reason... aside from a few bad eggs (Fox News, Huffpo, etc), the articles are researched, sources verified, and the article is written with as little slant as humanly possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the BBC reported the Libyan war unbiasedly at all. They never even said who &#39;the rebels&#39; were. Gaddafi said the rebels were Al Qaeda and now the Al Qaeda flag is flying and Sharia law has been imposed, so it looks like Gaddafi was right.</p>

<p>The Russian military said that there was  no air strike when BBC gave it as a major reason for our intervention. While Russia may not have a good reputation for honesty and openness, RT.com does seem to be giving fair reporting on topics relating to the West. By fair I mean that experts are interviewed who disagree with the party line, so you know what the information is and where it is coming from and it is discussed in detail from different angles.</p>

<p>If you listened to the some and the words used in BBC war reporting it is extremely biassed. But you have to bear in mind that MI6 plotted an assassination against Gaddafi in the past. Why would you expect an unbiased reporting on a war? &quot;The first casualty in war is the truth.&quot;</p>
