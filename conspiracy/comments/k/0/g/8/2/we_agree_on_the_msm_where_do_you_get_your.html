    <div class="md"><p>Well it all started with the want to have icon flair. When I became moderator I was curious about what I what to do to make it. So I looked at a few ideas and implemented them in one of my other subs first. The eye of Horus has always been a symbol I have gravitated toward, not really sure why. Very clean and very precise. Some even say the Egyptian mathematical system was based on the proportions of the eye. The icon also fits in very well with the background color and is related to the subject matter. </p>

<p>Plus since I am a mod here, you can see how it could have meaning as a symbol of power, ala the all seeing eye. Let everyone know I am watching. Lol. The eye of Horus does not blink. </p>

He throws around vague theories about the Illuminati without any concrete evidence for his claims.  He makes people with legitimate gripes about the criminality and corruption of the US government look like crackpots. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pure foolishness.  Nobody is perfect, every person in the &quot;truth&quot; movement has credibility holes and inconsistencies, but every person in the &quot;truth&quot; movement will admit that.  Anyone who&#39;s honest will accept that they do not hold the full truth and neither does Alex.  As said above, Alex has good info, and just because you don&#39;t agree with his style or you&#39;re upset because he&#39;s made a mistake or two in the past doesn&#39;t mean he can be written off.  It ESPECIALLY does not mean that the rest of the sources I use are illegitimate.  That&#39;s a guilt by association approach to the information I read even though a lot of my other sources you don&#39;t seem to contend with - so I don&#39;t know why you&#39;d &quot;stop reading.&quot;  If you &quot;stop reading&quot; for any reason that just shows me how incapable you are of critical thinking.  Given your positions, that&#39;s not all too surprising.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I sometimes watch RT and Al Jazeera. I read a couple of local newspapers sites. My quick news hit is the Drudge Report. Once in a blue moon I&#39;ll watch a clip from the Jon Stewart Show. I watch the television edition of the Alex Jones show, not so much for the news but for the entertainment (I enjoy the rants). Much of my news comes from following links here at Reddit, and branching off from those links.</p>

<p>What I don&#39;t do, ever, is watch broadcast or cable news channels such as FOX or CNN, or regular networks such as NBC or CBS. I&#39;ve just stopped paying any attention to them at all. They don&#39;t exist for me. They are nothing but propaganda and lies, and the news hosts seem to get stupider every year.</p>

<p>Alex Jones was my first step in this whole &#39;conspiracy&#39; thing. I&#39;ve listened to him less and less and have attempted to find other sources, but I wasn&#39;t sure if there was anything I was missing out on.  </p>

<p>I still credit AJ for providing me with perspective and maybe more perspective is all I&#39;m looking for...</p>
