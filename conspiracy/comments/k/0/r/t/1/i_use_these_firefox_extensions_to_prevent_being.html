      <ul>
       <li>
        Adblock Plus -  to stop quite a few flash adds that can place very persistent flash cookies.
       </li>
       <li>
        Ghostery - blocks hundreds of tracker sites like Facebook, Google Analytics, etc.  I also enable the cookie blocker option.  Be sure to check the top two columns of the setup wizard.
       </li>
       <li>
        NoScript - this makes it so that you will need to turn on javascript for each site.  Many of the common sites are already enabled.  You can turn it on temporarily or permanently for a site.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The last is RequestPolicy.  This could be quite a pain for some.  With this installed you would need to first enable javascript for the site using NoScript.  Then enable it for each site that the current site is trying to access.  The list could be quite long.  Its a little scary to think that some sites might try to track with 5-10 different services.  Almost always, about 75% percent of the javascript references are non-content related.  That means stuff like trackers.
      </p>
      <p>
       At any rate Ghostery is a simple blacklist extension that will protect you quite a bit.  Sometimes I need to access a site and I can't quite figure out the right one to enable so I turn RequestPolicy off for a site.  At least then Ghostery is running and will prevent me from being tracked by the obvious trackers.
      </p>
      <p>
       [edit] Opt out of the Ghostery submission system.  They want information on new tracking services but I don't think that it is necessary.

       The worst that is going to happen is the Javascript is blocked.  Now that can kill the site.  I'll take you through the best case scenario and worst case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Best case) You go to a website and everything appears to work.  Then you notice that there is a big blank spot in the article where a video should be.  You enable Javascript by right clicking the page -&gt; NoScript -&gt; Allow (this.com).  Then the page reloads and it all works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Worst case) You did everything above but still it doesn't work.  You right click the page -&gt; RequestPolicy -&gt; Holy Shit!!!, there are 15 different domains that this page is trying to load and ten of them are obvious trackers.  So you choose the one from the list that looks like a companion or cache site for the current one.  With that enabled the page reloads.  No that wasn't quite it, but now there are some more images in the page and the CSS has at least loaded.  You do this 2-3 times and then the page works.  Now probably this is a shit site anyways if the web developers are loading that much crap.  A pain in the ass.
      </p>
      <p>
       ABC news I recall is quite bad.  Mostly though it only requires one NoScript change and one RequestPolicy change.  A common thing is for web developers to use apis.google.com for the jQuery Javascript library.  That will require an extra action as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The good news is that these changes have a make permanent or temporary option.  Its a bit cumbersome at first but then it gets easier.

       I watched a TED talk about what I will call being in an information bubble.  By personalising the searches so much they can limit your exposure to new information.  When they know already what you like then they just keep hitting you with it and you don't see new novel stuff anymore.

       It's not about showing anyone anything.. The concept of "basic principle" is always in reference to one's own principles.  What they see or hear doesn't even enter into it.  "They" are just a faceless machine after all, so what is there to prove.

       To continue with your pigeon poop line of thinking: what you have done is stop pigeons with poop that smells slightly of peppermint from hanging out above your stoop, and caused them to be replaced with pigeons that poop just as often, and in the exact same volume, but with poop that just smells like random things.  You haven't moved them anywhere.

       Funny, you demonstrate very little understanding.  And to think this comes from me not wanting my private emails picked apart to sell me some cheap shit on basic principle.  You're really this passionate about my preference in this matter?

       Good basic privacy tips, but if the govmnt's got it's eyes on you, then there is no avoiding being tracked. Just look up STUXNET and you will catch my drift.

       The point is not to prevent tracking by the gov'mnt...if they've got their eyes on you you've go a different set of problems.  For myself, I don't want to be blind shill for the corporate internet info-mill.  I would just prefer not to be on anybody and everybody's radar.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a side-note...I use NoScript and AdBlock, and am very happy with them.  Once you get the hang of them they do what you want without making your surfing experience inconvenient.  In fact, most sites are more enjoyable without all the BS loading and running.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, it is a pain when you can't find out which script you need to enable on NoScript to make a site work right (but you can always just 'enable all'), and yes there are some flash programs that I might have wanted to run, but could never quite get to work (prob'ly due to my AdBlock custom filters, which is just my own laziness).  I don't know Ghostery well, but I think I'll check it out.

       Thats true but the more people that opt out of more systems the easier it is for people with real reasons to go undetected.  The extreme of this would be everyone being implanted with a GPS device and then all of a sudden you are the wise guy who disables it, and then that puts you on the radar.

       Basically my government the corporations knows all kinds about me but I know that there are some easy things that I can do to make their blinds spots as big as possible.  I'm going to at least make them do their job working for it and not just be handed everything on a silver plater; like here is every picture of mine, here are all of my friends, here are all of their friends, this is every site that I go to, this is how long I spend on each site, etc.

       This is more about blocking marketing companies from tracking your surfing habits.

       Every website you hit is logged by your internet service provider and probably by intelligence agencies.

       To start with STUXNET used exploits in a proprietary operating system.  The big companies get driver keys that let them install shit without the OS complaining about it.  There is the equivalent in Linux and this is why I use it and while it is still very possible for the repositories to be compromised it is much more difficult to pull off.  Also I have big iron companies on my side who want to keep their shit secure.  I can count the amount of closed source products that I use on one hand.  Flash, AMD graphics driver and a firmware blob for my wireless chip.  In one more release cycle I will be able to use the open source graphics driver.  It was actually good enough in one of the more cutting edge Linux distributions.  So in 2-3 months it will be generally out there and working.  Then Gnash is almost there and just doesn't work with DRM and Youtube has quite a bit of HTML5 video already.  If the government compromised a Linux distributions package delivery system it would only get them a small portion of a small market.  The rewards wouldn't be that great.  Now coming right up now in just maybe 3 years we will be able to run an open source BIOS implementation from the Coreboot project.  Then you throw in SELinux security, full disk encryption with a USB removable boot partition and then run certain programs inside of a virtual machine and you are talking about serious security.  I'm not even going to consider Bitcoins until I can have something truly trustworthy like this.  Then I can finally look at porn in peace.

       One thing that I find strange about Ghostery is that it's made by an advertising company called Evidon.  They claim that it's opt-in only for aggregating advertiser tracking cookies and scripts but not sure about that since they are into internet marketing.

       They don't have to be good, they just have to ask somebody who is, and then the law takes over. I used to work at an ISP and when the cops came with the right documentation we had to do what they asked us (to a degree). They only have a very narrow set of "rights", so it's up to the ISP to give them the least (or most exact) info required by the law. That's the case in Europe anyway, where there are data protection laws. We couldn't hand over a big chunk of logs because it would breach the privacy of other customers and we would be breaking the law.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're talking about intelligence agencies then I have no idea how that works, but the scale would require serious hardware and staffing. I doubt their hiring process and standards are any less stringent than the private sector.

       I wasn't privy to the charges. I was just asked to get the logs matching certain parameters. Both times (there were only two times) involved mostly image files moved from ftp sites, so I suspected it was pornography. And the kind I didn't want to look any further into.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my experience ISP's generally turn a huge blind eye to filesharing. Unless you're impacting other customers capacity it's not an issue. Maybe if you were some kind of huge uploader you would get closer attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it all depends on the ISP I guess. And like I said, I'm sure the law in the US is different from the EU. It could be better for the customer or worse, I don't know.

       Would the ISP get paid for the work?  It seems to me that a potentially negative part of all of this back end interface stuff is that the government could just pay everyone off for the hassle.  Then the telcos and ISPs could just feel as though they had another paying client with some unusual needs.  That would be truly insidious.  I'm not sure if it actually works that way though.

       I doubt they get paid, unless it was something huge that would cause a financial impact. That way they would have a case to ask for compensation. I'm sure there's some sort of obligation for a company to cooperate as fully as they can with the police.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's the police, not the intel agencies. We can only guess at how they operate, and it's bound to be impressive. There's not many backbone carriers (the companies that actually own the cables), and they carry huge percentages of traffic transatlatic and transcontinental. They would be the ones to look into with respect to large scale interceptions.
