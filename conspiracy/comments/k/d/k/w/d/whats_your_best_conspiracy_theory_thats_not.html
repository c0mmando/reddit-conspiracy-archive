       The television networks, through extremely calculated methods, are programming children to become stupider.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mostly through feeding them with hours of fictional gibberish (harry potter), morally deprived content, ambiguous messages (no right or no wrong), and confusing scenarios, leaving them completely inapt to deal with real world scenarios.  Most content encourages children to be louder, the so called "learning" shows basically teach malnutrition and gibberish, and tedious things to prepare a child for nothing less than a rat race.

         The USA keeps many financial transactions quite complicated, such as settlement of stock purchases, to allow for widespread manipulation.  Naked short selling is one example, in which the share price of a company can be depressed by a huge amount of naked short selling, triggering margin calls on that company's loans and possibly ruining it. This allows large institutions to pick and choose which businesses succeed, and which fail.

       The Catholic Church had deep Nazi connections. High ranking Church Officials have been complicit with establishing the Rat Lines and smuggled war criminals from justice. Hitler used Catholic symbols and the Reich was religion based but whitewashed throughout history.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Orwellien style, word meaning have been changed which undermines the study of certain subjects. The concept of corporatism which was proved powerful by the Lombard League was influenced by the Church.  Corportism was different insofar that people were raised with the natural obligation to their temperol and lay lords. Alligience with a choice was novel, which leads me to the
       <em>
        BIG
       </em>
       conspiricy which has been around as long as Civilization and may have even been the driving force behind its creation:
      </p>
      <p>
       Nationalism, religion, greed, and (familial) love have been the institutions which enslave humanity. With the exception of one, they are artificial motivations and have been conceptualized at different times. There are no banners, no major faction of true alturism, people are lead by the nose by one of these and that is why the current power structures. There is overlap but nationalistic marines and fundamentalist muslums fight and die for pretty much nothing. Even those who lead are motivated and controlled by greed or to ensure their familial dynasty. Using a very revealing riddle from ASOIAF, which I have changed for modern times, a person is in a room with figureheads of importance, the Pope, the President, richest man in the world, and the hostile father of his love which refuses to wed him without consent. There is an attack and all but the man is injured and could save only one. He.is promised Beautification in the church, Herodom with recognition, medals, and parades. He could be an instant billionaire and powerful person, or he could have his love finally. The consequences of not choosing each person are respectively, excommunication and threat of possible Hell, criminal status and revilation in his homeland, the rich mans influence would make him unhireable, penniless, and forclosure. If her father is killed his beloved will despise him for eternity, and he can only save one. Who does he save? It depends on the man. The motivations and will of people are what allows power and people are programed with values that allow different interests to appeal to. America is a corporate state whose propaganda is  mostly in the commericials we were raised on. We grew up wantinv thinking happiness would follow. There was so much crap toys I NEEDED and the propaganda appealed to me. This is one of the reasons American productivity is so high as well as Corporate power. The Soviets were fed a diet of Nationalistic pride. Korea is a mix of that as well as concern over the wellbeing of your family. The middle east follow their religious beliefs, but these are the reasons we are pawns in agendas. Not everyone has these motivations bit enough do and that is enough. These are not seperate factions but the means of their power, sometimes there are conflictions but usually self interest is  easy to predict and mutual benefit perferable. Right now Globalization vs Imperialism is the only major wedge.

       I actually adressed that initially but must have removed it in revision before submission. Latin American priests have supported populist movements but I really doubt and have no reason to believe they were supported by th Vatican, it was  more the community integration which influenced those acts and they even spoke against the historical role the Church played. After the whole Nazi debacle, Vatican II emerged as a modernization movement which gave distatance to any previous practices. There is no monolithic tool of opression (or there would be no reason we are not literal slaves or serfs reduced to the bare minimum) but many organizations who for the most part collaborate due to mutual interest but methods both differ as well as interact. In turn different organizations also have internal structures which are not necessarily homogenized.  The so called Liberization Theology was very close to a schism against the old ways (which was probably triggered by the blowback concerning their roles) but it seems a return to center has been reached. What I mentioned were not factions but methods. They overlap and conflict in turn but all roads point to contol. Perhaps it is a natural result of mass socialization but it results in armies of manipulated pawns with blantantly obvious figureheads which are conceptual abstractions controlled by puppetmasters. I am curious if there is more, perhaps new paradigms of motivation reasoning and control which drive those pulling the strings which have not been introduced to the masses, althoug I feel greed is most likely the factor which is used to control them in turn. I doubt I will ever appreciate the weaved web but some strings can be followed, and sometimes plucked as the Sviets tried to rempve religion before allying with it for mutual benefit.

       Also the death squads were usually CIA trained ireggulers from Chiliean paramilitaries to Iraqi Shiitess and Mexican Zetas. Classic School of the Americas derived and similar training. Conflicting ideaologies which have always been powerful bullshit maintaining the delicate balance which is constantly redefined. Do you know which internal master which you serve? There are competing overlords above him wishing to take advantage. We need a whole conceptual renoot of what we consider Civilization and Humanity.

       Then adjust your understanding of that words definition. Even a group which used Alturism as a binding force, those behind it would have their own reasoning. This is why I hope that theirs is an unheard of motivational factor which is (hopefully figurtivally) alien because I cannot respect the current methods of which servitude is enforced.

       Absolutely wrong.  One of the reasons the Catholic church supported the Nazis was because they shared a hatred of communism.  The Catholic also hates communism due to communism's hatred of religion and propagation of atheism.

       I always wondered how easy would it be to broadcast subliminal messages through ice-cream trucks PA? For one thing they are usually found in medium or low end neighborhoods. Secondly they can broadcast the sound without any real check system in place. At least in T.V./Radio/Movies there are hundreds if not thousands who screen this stuff. Eh just a thought.

       This is really my theory.  I haven't seen it written anywhere, so I can't just link to a source.  The one thing that stands out the most is how much islam changed after her death.  Until she died, it was just a rehashing of Jesus' teachings.  You can look at Mohammad's wiki page and see the pattern.  There is a book about her, that paints her in a very holy light, but still doesn't say that she was the prophet.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are so many little things about islam that seem blasphemous when compared to judaism and christianity.  The fact that they prey to mecca, a stone, an idol.  An idol that was the used in the pagan ceremonies of Mohammad's first religion. It also makes since why muslims are constantly praying for Mohammad's soul.

       The reason I requested a source was that I did not give much credence to the racist barfly who was hit or miss when discussing events of current and historical importance (which are verbally pidgeonholed as theories when they deviate from the commonly thought versions). I dont know where he got his info but it is interesting where else it has popped up.  If you have any new info please euclidate me, otherwise dont try to "call me out" and stifle questions, particularly when the doubtful nature of which has been acknowledged.

       What do you mean?  They are both white with the same natural hair colour and facial features overlay too perfect.  Eyes ears, nose all in exactly same proportions and position.

      <p>
       Weezer does the best Nirvana covers I've heard..  Why would Foo Fighters tour with them and do sessions with Cuomo saying - they were great.. too great to even do a tour with?   Why would the Foo Fighters want to have Rivers Cuomo be their lead singer and do Nirvana covers with them if he sucks?

       POWs dont usually live very healthy lifestyles and with the treatment they recieved, I doubt they lived more than a decade or two. Id also bet that at some point it became politically convienent to eliminate them (perhaps when relations with US corps sweetened) at which point they would have been removed.

       Perhaps some have been allowed to assimilate in the general population or Buddist sect but I doubt it. The horrid conditions they were exposed to would not allow the nutrition, hygine, or care for longevity. You think they were held in retirement home conditions or do you think there are all these Americans living in exposed bamboo cages. They were held at a starvation level or barely above it and all of their conditions spoke against longevity. I doubt you would survive very long in dirty, sedetary and malnourished conditions and traditionally POWs have very high death rates from condition even within the first few years, the elderly would not survive very long in a dirty cell with shit every where and improper conditions. Worse is that at some point they would have been considered a political liability for the Vietnamese. At some point the became allies, tourists and corporations moved in and there was no reason to support and many reasons to remove them. I dont have faith in any Country for any such liabilities that dont officially exisit on any side. As soon as they became a problem I bet it was very easy to solve with no cost politically. There is no reason that they would be alive and many that they wouldnt.

       The book
       <a href="http://www.enormouscrime.com/">
        An Enormous Crime
       </a>
       does a good job of documenting this.  It did happen.  Whether any of those POWs are alive in 2011, I personally doubt that, but there's no question many were left behind and may have lived into the 80s, if not the 1990s.
      </p>
      <p>
       The author explains very clearly that Henry Kissinger had promised $3 billion in aid to Vietnam following the war and the Vietnamese held onto America POWs until America paid that sum.  But America never paid it.  And Vietnam never released the POWs it held back for insurance.
      </p>
      <p>
       People forget that 25,000 American POWs were left behind following WWII and approximately 8,000 following the Korean war.  There is historical precedent for America abandoning its servicemen after war.

       The 2005 trial and murder of Michael Jackson, more the latter than the former. I know of a group of people who knew Michael personally for years (before Michael died and this all turned into a big conspiracy, the community knew them as people they could trust, people saw them with Michael, etc.) and helped the fans know what was really going on in the drama of his life. Many of them have incredible information, but I know of at least one that is afraid of going public with any of it (we communicate on a very private forum) because of the harm that going public with info has done in the past - including Michael's murder itself. For example, Frank DiLeo, Michael's recently hired again-manager, had a fan spying for him on this forum right before Michael died. She reported the plan that the 'follower fans' (fans who followed Michael around and actively communicated with him regarding his terrible health and his disdain with the concerts) were establishing that involved getting Michael out of AEG's dangerous hands. Security was then tightened so much that the fans were unable to communicate with him at all. He was murdered a week later.
      </p>
      <p>
       During the 2005 trial, one of these women was writing blogs about all the behind the scenes stuff (such as Sony 'anonymously' sending financial info to the Santa Barbara DA to help convict Michael to get the Sony/ATV catalogue back in their hands) and she started to get her email hacked into and IIRC threats.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people won't act on just hearing a celebrity was murdered, they don't care. But do realize that there has been at least one mysterious suicide that seems heavily related to Michael, but possibly two more. (They happened, but it's hard to gain info on at least one of them because of New Jersey laws and the other I have yet to investigate due to time/money constraints.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Due to this, many people are afraid to speak up. The lady I mentioned before is a mother and is not willing to put Michael Jackson before her family - understandably, of course. Last summer when I had more time, I called detectives and tried getting information. Some of it was really scary and even spooked one of the detectives.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's so crazy behind the scenes that sometimes I wonder if it really is Michael doing a hoax... all of it seems like it's out of a movie. But at the same time, it's too real for it to be a hoax, which is the saddest part of all, especially watching his kids being put on anti-depressants and turning into brats.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know I'm being very broad with a lot of this info, but it would take a long time to figure out and even some of this stuff I'm a little confused on... But I will say one thing, Conrad Murray is probably innocent, but if not he was not just some negligent doctor and his charges need to be raised to at least manslaughter in the second degree. Michael Jackson was NOT a drug addict - that is a fact based on his autopsy.

       Something Meta: not really attachingmyself to this, just a random brainstorm: maybe all the conspiracy theories are originated with and propagated by anti-science folks who want to eliminate the growth of accountability and transparency science promotes which could lead to more difficulty in doing shady stuff in general. In essence, an attempt at framing science as a stodgy and uncaring powdered-wig-wearing white men's game that's not open to meaning-giving conspiratorial truths.

       Yeah, because we all know that scientists are completely objective and beyond reproach, and have never published scientific studies which were deliberately designed to come to a pre-determined conclusion.
      </p>

       I can tell you this because I'm actually a researcher working for a multi-national corporation (true), and I'm working for the benefit of humanity, not the benefit of shareholders.

       I can also tell you that the reason that I like conspiracy theories is because genuine scientists, just as with conspiracy theorists, begin by making wild hypotheses, and then testing them.

        maybe all the conspiracy theories are originated with and propagated by anti-science folks who want to eliminate the growth of accountability and transparency science promotes which could lead to more difficulty in doing shady stuff in general.

       Yeah, because we all know that scientists are completely objective and beyond reproach, and have never published scientific studies which were deliberately designed to come to a pre-determined conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can tell you this because I'm actually a researcher working for a multi-national corporation (true), and I'm working for the benefit of humanity, not the benefit of shareholders.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can also tell you that the reason that I like conspiracy theories is because genuine scientists, just as with conspiracy theorists, begin by making wild hypotheses, and then testing them.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the scientific method.

       Number 3 is pretty much how the big boys operate in the stock market...

       What about this: the stock market in the US is pretty much run by about 8 odd computers, which are responsible for most of it.

       The Catholic Church had deep Nazi connections. High ranking Church Officials have been complicit with establishing the Rat Lines and smuggled war criminals from justice. Hitler used Catholic symbols and the Reich was religion based but whitewashed throughout history.

       In Orwellien style, word meaning have been changed which undermines the study of certain subjects. The concept of corporatism which was proved powerful by the Lombard League was influenced by the Church.  Corportism was different insofar that people were raised with the natural obligation to their temperol and lay lords. Alligience with a choice was novel, which leads me to the
       <em>
        BIG
       </em>
       conspiricy which has been around as long as Civilization and may have even been the driving force behind its creation:
      </p>

       Nationalism, religion, greed, and (familial) love have been the institutions which enslave humanity. With the exception of one, they are artificial motivations and have been conceptualized at different times. There are no banners, no major faction of true alturism, people are lead by the nose by one of these and that is why the current power structures. There is overlap but nationalistic marines and fundamentalist muslums fight and die for pretty much nothing. Even those who lead are motivated and controlled by greed or to ensure their familial dynasty. Using a very revealing riddle from ASOIAF, which I have changed for modern times, a person is in a room with figureheads of importance, the Pope, the President, richest man in the world, and the hostile father of his love which refuses to wed him without consent. There is an attack and all but the man is injured and could save only one. He.is promised Beautification in the church, Herodom with recognition, medals, and parades. He could be an instant billionaire and powerful person, or he could have his love finally. The consequences of not choosing each person are respectively, excommunication and threat of possible Hell, criminal status and revilation in his homeland, the rich mans influence would make him unhireable, penniless, and forclosure. If her father is killed his beloved will despise him for eternity, and he can only save one. Who does he save? It depends on the man. The motivations and will of people are what allows power and people are programed with values that allow different interests to appeal to. America is a corporate state whose propaganda is  mostly in the commericials we were raised on. We grew up wantinv thinking happiness would follow. There was so much crap toys I NEEDED and the propaganda appealed to me. This is one of the reasons American productivity is so high as well as Corporate power. The Soviets were fed a diet of Nationalistic pride. Korea is a mix of that as well as concern over the wellbeing of your family. The middle east follow their religious beliefs, but these are the reasons we are pawns in agendas. Not everyone has these motivations bit enough do and that is enough. These are not seperate factions but the means of their power, sometimes there are conflictions but usually self interest is  easy to predict and mutual benefit perferable. Right now Globalization vs Imperialism is the only major wedge.

       Absolutely wrong.  One of the reasons the Catholic church supported the Nazis was because they shared a hatred of communism.  The Catholic also hates communism due to communism's hatred of religion and propagation of atheism.
