<p>There is plenty of evidence of tainted vaccines. </p>

<p>There is plenty of evidence that WTC 7 was felled by contolled demolition, 1500 architects and engineers agree... you don&#39;t see that all over the news. Why would you expect different on vaccines?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason that we tend to see vaccines as a &#39;safer&#39; (relatively speaking) topic is the vast amount of proof we have through successful inoculation and the eradication of preventable diseases all over the world. Polio didn&#39;t disappear because we wished it would go away, or prayed it away. It was eradicated thanks to Dr. Jonas Salk and his revolutionary work on developing his vaccine. Not only do we have direct inoculation to count as proof, but we also have the Herd Immunity phenomenon which protects the vulnerable among us by inoculating those healthy enough to receive such treatment and creating a shield of resistant citizens around the vulnerable.</p>

<p>Of course there will be tainted batches of vaccines, whether through accident or through the corruption of one or more people. However, I am much more inclined to believe that WTC 7 was felled due to controlled demolition, seeing as how it was the HQ of the SEC and was attempting to prosecute moneyed interests than I am to believe that vaccines are a massive conspiracy.</p>

<p>If you are advocating close regulation over the production of vaccines, then I am full well in support of your position, as it affects the lives of all those to whom the vaccine will be given. However, we have already seen the harmful effects of vaccine alarmism thanks to Jenny McCarthy and they are hard to ignore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your reasoned response.</p>

<p>I have nothing but respect for work of Dr Salk and polio. However, the type of vaccines he produced were not the same as what are produced now. </p>

<p>Nowadays, almost any substance will be put into the vaccine if it helps the antibody response, e.g. human, animal proteins, food proteins, neurotoxic metals, adjuvants, etc.</p>

<p>All of these substances (not the attenuated viruses) are totally untested, and my feeling is that the reason people look away is that poisoning and controlling the plebs is their MO.</p>

<p>In that way, it is like 9/11</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see the point you&#39;re trying to make, and understand very well that the lack of testing in certain fields in America is outright criminal (the FDA springs to mind). Additives may indeed come to be a serious problem, though I have to see much if any convincing evidence of it, unlike 9/11, where we have a large body of professional experts clearly demonstrating physical principles that support their case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a few people use science as a religion without realizing it, and they will invariably deny it with atheistic zeal. Peer reviewed articles are taken as holy books, and Rockefeller foundation grants as the favor of the almighty. And who can question the certainty of well documented studies, they use math don&#39;t they? Despite the immensity of the interests involved, the scientific method prevents all corruption; science is the only good and pure purpose, and all-in must humbly trust in the certainty of medical science, submitting to proper vaccination for the good of the community as we await the singularity from whence our salvation comes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, we do need them thanks to diseases like Polio that would have continued to cripple young children and relegate them to iron lungs. Dr. Jonas Salk developed a vaccine for Polio that then freed humanity from the need to worry about yet one more disease, and we can definitely attribute our longer life spans (if only in part) to the eradication of common diseases that would have shortened them otherwise.</p>

<p>What next, saying that humanity has gone without dental care for thousands of years, so we don&#39;t need it? Appendectomies? Pacemakers?
Surviving thousands of years without something, especially considering massive breakthroughs in our understanding of the breakdown of the human body represents a viewpoint that is akin to Solipsism or being a Luddite.</p>

<p>As for the OP, there is DEFINITELY the possibility of corruption in the medical field. We all know that insurance companies exist solely to deny care to those who need it, corruption on a grand scale. However, the trend to pay attention to in this case would be the proliferation of Me Too drugs, where companies latch onto successful formulae and replicate them for their own profit, with only slight alterations. These drugs are the major profit makers for private medicine firms, not vaccines. Vaccines to Pharma is like pot to a drug dealer, they&#39;re nice to have on hand, and they make steady profit (if not very much), and it&#39;s good PR to be seen developing vaccines that work and are safe, but it isn&#39;t where your main interest lies.</p>

<p>Another important thing to consider is the effects of actions by people like Jenny McCarthy in her blanket campaign against vaccination. In areas where her speeches are taken to heart, levels of vaccination are dipping below herd immunity levels, and have already shown resurgences of preventable disease in the vulnerable of those areas who cannot be vaccinated due to infirmity or age, and who depend on herd immunity for protection.</p>

<p>I very much understand your want to be able to ask questions about vaccines, and not be pushed back at so roughly, but to those with an understanding of the amazing benefits conferred by simply having vaccinations it reminds one of pushback against obvious science in other areas such as that against evolution or the big bang theory. Sometimes, you just have to keep asking your questions, and hope that there&#39;s someone who will understand your curiosity, and nurture it with all the knowledge they possess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>.....Do you understand what medicine is?</p>

<p>All medicine comes from nature. </p>

<p>Aspirin is just the distilled active chemicals from the bark of the willow tree so that you can get the effective ingredients in a large enough dose to be meaningful without having to stuff a metric ton of willow bark down your throat, or drink willow bark tea (which tastes like ass).</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same for every single medication on the market today. We find a natural plant or animal that has a peculiar quality that we find interesting, and we attempt to find out what chemicals/materials/bacteria/etc create the quality, and then replicate them by themselves, to eliminate potentially harmful side effects from unwanted ingredients. </p>

<p>I sincerely hope that you don&#39;t buy into Homeopathy as well as Holistic Medicine. Both of the former have been shown to be fraudulent through the inability to consistently produce any effect besides utter consternation. Life can be patented, unfortunately, which is yet another example of the influence of money in what I would prefer to be a more egalitarian society. Natural Cures can be patented as well, as I said above with aspirin and mostly any medication on the market today. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>just like their trying to patent vitamin b17????</p>

<p>one can not legally patent a vitamin, mineral, etc. all of which are holistic, natural medicine. sure, plenty of pharmaceuticals have come from the natural world as you point out, but how can you so adamantly degrade holistic medicine when an integral part of it (natural balance) is used by the the mainstream medical establishment? it&#39;s hypocrisy...</p>

<p>&quot;new&quot; treatments so often come from <em>old</em> protocols, and natural medicine. yet the establishment will come along and try and patent them (b17). these things belong to humanity, it&#39;s our sovereign right as sentient beings to have unregulated access to such essential life giving nutrients.</p>

<p>all medicine does come from things that were natural at some point, but when you can&#39;t find it in nature it&#39;s no longer natural. so many drugs are not natural, and they are not healthy, but harmful. we survived, we evolved into human beings without synthetic chemicals in our bodies, and we&#39;d be just fine without them. the medical establishment does not seek to cure, there&#39;s no money in it, they just want to treat. they do not have our best intentions at heart.</p>

<p>i <em>do</em> &quot;buy into&quot; both medicines. the only time the modern medical establishment is needed is for surgery, everything else can be more effectively dealt with naturally...</p>

<p>intravenous vitamin C is illegal in the US! and if the FDA has it their way all vitamins will be regulated...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As soon as you mentioned the FDA, you walked into well known territory. The FDA is now nothing more than a corporate shill, and it has been for some time. Any point you make that the FDA may be doing something wrong will probably be close to the truth, so we can definitely agree there.</p>

<p>They&#39;re trying to patent Vitamin B17 because that&#39;s what corporations do, lol. They exist solely to maximize profits and engineer legislation to aid them in doing so (It sucks that this is the case &gt;_&gt;). I understand your point about natural remedies and their derived treatments being a sovereign right to sentient beings, but I differ from you in the application thereof. I would advocate healthcare as an essential human right, and put forth that the tax money of all be used to allow all free healthcare and the free use and proliferation of medicine without respect to profit. Does that sound agreeable to you?</p>

<p>You say &quot;When you can&#39;t find it in nature, it&#39;s no longer natural.&quot; Every component in modern drugs can be found in nature, it may look unnatural being in pill or caplet form, but that is due to the one substance being transformed to the most efficient form of delivery in the human body. The medical establishment is a mix. Many doctors and nurses get into medicine specifically to help people, but find that insurance companies and biomedical corporations squeeze them dry unless they fall in line. This is a good case against large corporate interests having their hands in healthcare or public medicine, but not against drugs and medicine in general.</p>

<p>Your argument that we&#39;ve evolved into human beings without synthetic chemicals in our bodies and thus we are fine without them does not hold water. Why use cars? Watches? Computers? Clothing? Dental Care? We evolved without any of the modern day conveniences we now have, but I don&#39;t see you shunning electricity because we didn&#39;t evolve with it. Progress is painful and can cause tragedy, that&#39;s why we must strive for careful oversight and regulation, to ensure that progress for progress&#39; sake is not encouraged.</p>

<p>As far as Homeopathy is concerned, it is a crock of shit. No two ways about it. It posits things that are false by definition, and makes ludicrous claims without any backing. However, if you choose to personally use them and promote them, it&#39;s your choice and I definitely believe you have that right. I only ask that you don&#39;t scream &#39;prejudice&#39; when homeopathy is treated with scorn and derision for being....well....baseless.</p>

<p>&quot;The only time the modern medical establishment is needed is for surgery&quot; </p>

<p>I really think the problem you might be looking at with the modern medical system is the intrusion of profit-driven corporate entities into the system. These corporate entities have taken the literal heart out of the system, making doctors do excessive/unnecessary surgeries for profit, insurance companies driving up prices, bio-med firms hyping up me too drugs and jacking the prices to steal money from the consumer. </p>

<p>I completely agree with you that the FDA is a joke now, that the modern medical establishment has quite a lot of problems, and that a greater focus on the homeostasis of the human body should be emphasized. However, what about the massive advancements in human life that have happened ONLY as a result of the medical establishment? We live longer, relatively healthier, have beaten many deadly diseases out of existence, and are developing new ways to help people all the time, even with the problems. Ignoring all that medicine has to offer is like the Amish rejecting electricity because it is against the bible (though plenty of them like a nice phone in their barns [dirty cheats]).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>some drugs are completely synthesized. they take something that is known to exist in nature and they drop a hydrogen atom here, a oxygen atom there, blah, blah, blah. this creates drugs that do <em>not</em> exist in nature. about 70% of current drugs are found in nature.</p>

<p>I mentioned B17 because it&#39;s illegal to patent vitamins, yet it&#39;s being done. Just going back to what you said earlier about companies being able to patent virtually whatever they like. Only by breaking the law do they do so. </p>

<p>Why do I have to shun everything if I denounce modern medicine? A little sarcastic if you ask me, and we all know where sarcasm comes from. You tell me what can&#39;t be cured with natural medicine, and I&#39;ll give you a cure...</p>

<p>And as far as life expectancy go&#39;s have you missed the news? It has dropped...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Only by breaking the law do they do so&quot;</p>

<p>Thanks to Monsanto&#39;s ever growing legal division and their rabid glee at the sight of patents, they are even today pushing back the legal boundaries in an attempt to patent whatever life they can. They aren&#39;t the only company to do so, just one of the worst. </p>

<p>But that&#39;s besides the point. When has mere legality ever stopped a corporation from doing whatever the fuck it wants. Who&#39;s going to stop them, the FDA? It is a known part of corporate procedure to do every illegal thing you can to make profit, provided the payoff/money saved &gt; legal fees/fines incurred.</p>

<p>&quot;Why do I have to shun everything if I denounce modern medicine?&quot;</p>

<p>I responded the way I did because your argument relied on you stating that we have lived for thousands of years without needing these medicines, and can therefore feel free to do so even now. I likened it (rather appropriately) to stating that we have survived for thousands of years without harnessing electricity, yet it improves lives in countless ways and we justly harness that power for that purpose. Does it kill people? Abso-friggin-lutely! There will be growing pains and problems with every single advance we make, however, we could always stay stranded in the mire of human history rather than entranced at the wonder of the human future.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have to provide you with examples of things that can&#39;t be cured with natural medicine, only insofar as it is akin to disproving god. You can&#39;t prove a negative without exhaustive proof. There are three points that might help you respond to my argument with more success:</p>

<p>1.You undermine your own case by stating that a certain number of drugs are not natural. This would seem to suggest that some poking and prodding is necessary to actually get the work of &#39;curing&#39; done, not just leaving it to nature to proffer cures.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You, being the affirmative case (That is, making the claim that there are natural cures for everything) must provide proof of your assertion if you would like to sway me to seeing your point, otherwise I can&#39;t see evidence, only assertions. For instance, a natural cure for cancer that doesn&#39;t require a laboratory to tweak or change it would greatly interest me.</p></li>
<li><p>You forget that I clearly stated that &quot;Every component in modern drugs can be found in nature&quot;. This does not mean that every drug we have is found lying around in the grass like a field of Nexium and Prozac. This means that we are only rearranging what nature already consists of to achieve the desired effect.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>&quot;And as far as life expectancy go&#39;s have you missed the news? It has dropped...&quot;</p>

<p>If you&#39;re talking about the news in America, then yes it has dropped. I believe you might be mistaking the meaning of this, however. Private companies are able to play around with healthcare in America like kittens with a ball of yarn. There are large percentages of people succumbing to preventable illness and disease not through the lack of effort of doctors, nurses and the medical establishment, but rather because a particular company does not find it profitable to do so. </p>

<p>This is what happens when you put a private, profit-motivated corporation in charge of an essential human service. Expect them to fuck it up DESPITE the work of pioneering medical researchers.</p>

<p>In other countries with more civilized human healthcare systems, life expectancy is well above (relatively speaking) ours, because they rightly refuse to allow a corporation to control your healthcare, lest it strangle you for your pocket money.</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t let the words I choose to use, or some of the rhetoric I&#39;ve employed give you the impression that I&#39;m disrespecting you in any way. I like to discuss things in depth, and enjoy being able to do so with you, regardless of the fact that we do not see things eye to eye.</p>

<p>Edit: I numbered the points incorrectly! (It must be really late at night &gt;_&gt;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;For instance, a natural cure for cancer that doesn&#39;t require a laboratory to tweak or change it would greatly interest me.&quot; = Marijuana, B17</p>

<p>&quot;not through the lack of effort of doctors, nurses and the medical establishment, but rather because a particular company does not find it profitable to do so.&quot; = You give them far too much credit. Doctors do not give enough credence to natural, holistic medicine, even though 70% of the drugs they work with come from nature. Don&#39;t forget that natural medicine is an integral part of holistic medicine. With that in mind - how do you think a doctor would react if I told them that I take Milk Thistle for my liver? Now, how do you think that doctor would react if he read those claims in his favorite medical magazine? The point is doctors shun natural medicine even though most of their cures come from it. That&#39;s hypocrisy...</p>

<p>How can you bang anyone for holistic medicine when it is rain forest shaman, and native healers that had the cures <em>first</em>, and shared them with the modern medical establishment?</p>

<p>&quot;I responded the way I did because your argument relied on you stating that we have lived for thousands of years without needing these medicines, and can therefore feel free to do so even now. I likened it (rather appropriately)&quot; Oh, now sarcasm is appropriate? Because putting the two in the same boat is only a metaphorical comparison, and if it&#39;s metaphorical it&#39;s not exactly rational. Expecting  me to denounce the whole modern world just cause I&#39;ve denounced modern medicine = irrational sarcasm.</p>

<p>&quot;You forget that I clearly stated that &quot;Every component in modern drugs can be found in nature.&quot;
First of all you&#39;re speaking to someone with a 12.9 in reading comprehension. Secondly, you tell me the difference between the following two sentences. 1. Every component in modern drugs can be found in nature. 2. All drugs are found in nature. Perhaps you should look up the definition of component.</p>

<p>&quot;You, being the affirmative case (That is, making the claim that there are natural cures for everything) must provide proof of your assertion if you would like to sway me to seeing your point, otherwise I can&#39;t see evidence, only assertions.&quot; What more do you want? I already pointed out the fact that 70% of drugs are found in nature!!! So you see, nature is the queen of cures, doctors just pretend (while they barrow from Her)...</p>

<p>I jumped around a bit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;For instance, a natural cure for cancer that doesn&#39;t require a laboratory to tweak or change it would greatly interest me.&quot; = Marijuana, B17</p>

<p>Unfortunately, marijuana has only been shown to have effects on certain types of cancer cells, not the entire spectrum of types of cancer. Vitamin B17 is something I don&#39;t know anything about relating to cancer. Do you happen to have an article that you prefer for me to peruse?</p>

<p>&quot;Doctors do not give enough credence to natural, holistic medicine, even though 70% of the drugs they work with come from nature.&quot;</p>

<p>I know how doctors in general might respond to you taking milk thistle for your liver, their responses would run the gamut. Some would ask you if it helps you, and then have you continue using it if they can verify your improving condition. Some would shun it out of hand. This is because they are HUMAN BEINGS. Some will be appropriately curious and attempt to find the cure that works best for you, as in the first example. Some will be too closed-minded to do so. </p>

<p>&quot;How can you bang anyone for holistic medicine when it is rain forest shaman, and native healers that had the cures first, and shared them with the modern medical establishment?&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure that I have every right to &#39;bang someone&#39; for using holistic medicine if those very same doctors managed to weed out the useless practices of those very same shaman, get rid of the magic, and then concentrate the effective parts of the medicine to more promptly and ably address illness. I remember an early human cure for mental illness was &#39;trepinning&#39;. When in the hands of someone akin to a shaman, medicine may work in some cases, but will lack the precision and applicability of a modern laboratory. I must once again address dental care as being one of the most important advances of the human race towards health and longevity. Shaman can&#39;t do much for an infected tooth root, but one trip to a dentist and you&#39;ve got a fully functional tooth without the pain or chance of death anymore.</p>

<p>Rain forest shaman pointed out potential cures and medicines, yes. However, they lacked the understanding and tools necessary to truly take advantage of the cures they were using. This is akin to using a hatchet versus a scalpel. You can still get the job done, but it won&#39;t look pretty or come out quite as well.</p>

<p>Sarcasm is a rhetorical tool, and can be applied judiciously in conversation. I have attempted to remain as polite as I can, in an attempt to foster discussion and debate as opposed to anger or name calling.</p>

<p>&quot;Expecting me to denounce the whole modern world just cause I&#39;ve denounced modern medicine = irrational sarcasm.&quot;</p>

<p>Your point is incorrect. As I stated previously, your argument hinged on you stating that we have lived for thousands of years without X, therefore we do not need it to continue living on. Your chosen X was modern medicine, I switched it to electricity, and suddenly you no longer see this as the same statement. It is, the metaphor is valid and accurately descriptive of your point, and it is not sarcastic to point out your discrepancy.</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps you should look up the definition of component&quot;</p>

<p>Ah, we see the gloves have come off and sarcasm has been used. Wait a minute, &quot;Oh, now sarcasm is appropriate?&quot;.</p>

<p>Component: a constituent part; element; ingredient.</p>

<ol>
<li>Every component in modern drugs can be found in nature. </li>
<li>All drugs are found in nature. </li>
</ol>

<p>There is a clear difference between these two statements, in that the first one does not claim that all drugs are found IN THEIR PRESENT STATE in nature, it only implies that all of the components necessary to manufacture them indeed are. Components, as we know, are constituent parts, elements or ingredients.</p>

<p>&quot;I already pointed out the fact that 70% of drugs are found in nature!!! So you see, nature is the queen of cures, doctors just pretend (while they barrow from Her)...&quot;</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take one off the top to see how well it goes. Doctors created vaccines, whereas shamans....well....didn&#39;t. Doctors have made breakthroughs regarding our understanding of human dental care that has allowed us to eliminate one MAJOR cause of death almost entirely. A simple visit to the dentist can easily take care of something that a shaman would be helpless to combat. The list goes on and on.</p>

<p>PLEASE, understand that I agree with you on many things. I do believe that excessive corporate entanglement has caused the medical system in the US to be a sickened shadow of what it could be sans profit motive. I agree with you that a larger understanding of human homeostatic care is necessary to ensure that we don&#39;t overmedicate. I agree with you that many doctors may shun your naturalistic approach to medicine. However, there would be doctors that would eagerly support you if they found your cure to work better than what they could offer. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve definitely jumped around my fair bit, kind of hard to avoid when we&#39;re addressing so many things.</p>

<p>Edit: &quot;First of all you&#39;re speaking to someone with a 12.9 in reading comprehension.&quot;</p>

<p>What is this statement supposed to prove? All that a 12.9 means is that your reading comprehension is equivalent to someone in the 12th grade, 9th month of standard American Education (At least, if you are using something similar to the TABE system). I have seen fifth graders test at a 12.9 in reading comprehension.</p>

<p>Lol, this argument is not long for this world. I suppose DNA that is altered by radiative bombardment is no longer natural then? That&#39;s what your argument boils down to. While a complex alloy such as can be found in a modern vehicle might be perceived as unnatural very easily (since you usually won&#39;t find such ordered structure in the natural world), the judgment can&#39;t be so easily made when looking at biological material. </p>

<p>Say you re-engineer the AIDS virus to function as a cancer-killing agent, you may choose to call it synthetic, but the nomenclature fails to truly encompass the nature of what you&#39;re looking at. Where do you draw the line? </p>

<p>&quot;I think you posses nothing more than a TV viewers understanding of shamanistic medicine. You&#39;ve seen a few rituals, maybe even read a few articles. That does not make you an expert, nor does it give you the right to judge the effectiveness of alternative medicine.&quot;</p>

<p>This is a rather large judgment call for you to make, especially without seeking more information from me to see if your generalization would be correct. I have never claimed to be an expert on ANYTHING, never mind Shamanism. I also have every right to make known my opinion on a topic, including Shamanism and Alternative Medicine. Besides, I am not judging either of them, simply understanding that they have not met their burden of proof. Sure there are cures that have been derived from the ancient ceremonies of the shaman.....except you don&#39;t see your doctor doing anything but taking the derived component of the active ingredient used by the shaman and ignoring the mystical parts of the ceremony. </p>

<p>I will try and make my viewpoint on Shamanism and Alternative Medicine completely plain, so that it is not misinterpreted any further. The following excerpts are from Tim Minchin&#39;s beat poem &#39;Storm&#39;, and are the most concise and beautiful form that can be given to the ideas I&#39;m trying to get across.</p>

<p>By definition, (I begin)
Alternative medicine, (I continue)
Is either not been proved to work,
Or been proved, not to work.
Do you know what they call
&#39;Alternative Medicine&#39;
That&#39;s been proved to work?</p>

<p>-- Medicine</p>

<p>During a later part:</p>

<p>If you show me that, say,
Homeopathy works,
I will change my mind,
I will spin on a fucking dime.
I&#39;ll be as embarassed as hell,
Yet I will run through the streets yelling,
It&#39;s a MIRACLE!
Take physics and bin it!
Water has memory!
And whilst its memory
Of a long lost drop of onion juice is infinite,
It somehow forgets all the poo it&#39;s had in it.</p>

<p>You show me that it works,
And how it works,
and when I&#39;ve recovered,
from the shock,
I will take a compass and carve
&#39;Fancy That&#39;,
On the side of my cock.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it, that&#39;s all there is to my viewpoint. Alternative Medicine is a set that consists of items not yet proven to work, or items proven not to work. All of those items that are proven to work are moved into the subset Medicine.</p>

<p>&quot;You&#39;re actually telling me that since I denounce modern medicine that I should go live in the woods in a house I built with hand-tools, and an outhouse? And that&#39;s not irrational?&quot;</p>

<p>Okay, really, do you still not get what I have been trying to say since very early on in this conversation? Your point rested on you stating that since we had lived for thousands of years without synthetic chemicals (your chosen term to encompass modern medicine), we can safely ignore it and indeed do not need it in the future. </p>

<p>&quot;&quot;we survived, we evolved into human beings without synthetic chemicals in our bodies, and we&#39;d be just fine without them&quot; </p>

<p>Now change synthetic chemicals to electricity, and you have what I said to you. We have survived, evolved and indeed thrived without electricity for thousands of years before it was harnessed. We could do fine without it (though quite uncomfortable). You keep trying to foist the irrationality of the argument on me....when the entire framework was provided by you, and I really think that you need to respond on that claim.</p>

<p>ALL I DID WAS CHANGE &#39;Synthetic Chemicals&#39; TO &#39;Electricity&#39; TO DEMONSTRATE THE FACT THAT YOUR PREMISE WAS NOT WELL THOUGHT OUT.</p>

<p>I really hope that you can see that. Our entire conversation is up on the web, easily re-readable for edification purposes. Your point rested on the premise that having lived for thousands of years without something, meant that we could easily live without it now. You CHOSE Modern Medicine, I simply changed it to electricity to point out how absurd the point was. That&#39;s it, nothing more! The rest of what I said naturally flowed from changing one term in your argument to another similar item. This does not mean that my example is irrational, rather it means that the framework it was in (i.e.- your argument) was irrational.</p>

<p>&quot;Well then, how bout I just scream from the roof-tops that modern medicine sucks my balls, while watching my 42&quot;, 600hz HDTV, playing on my oc&#39;ed quad core PC, listening to hi-fidelity music on my new t-amp?&quot;</p>

<p>You&#39;re welcome to do anything you please, after all this is America. THE ENTIRE POINT OF ME RESPONDING TO THAT WAS TO ILLUSTRATE THE IRRATIONALITY INHERENT IN YOUR ARGUMENT. That&#39;s as simple as it is. It&#39;s as irrational as saying that you&#39;re a christian or a muslim, but only picking and choosing the verses of the holy book that you&#39;d like to worship. </p>

<p>&quot;That&#39;s kind of like saying that just because you support your government, you support everything they do...&quot;</p>

<p>Actually, it&#39;s not. You provided the structure of the argument, all I had to was change one noun to illustrate that your argument could be taken to extremes without any effort. </p>

<p>&quot;Who&#39;s gonna do anything about it?&quot;</p>

<p>It just gets funnier and funnier. I&#39;m trying to show you that there&#39;s an inconsistency in your argument, something that you may very well use to ensure that your beliefs and/or positions are maximally true, which one would assume is generally to be desired. </p>

<p>If we&#39;re not going to really go anywhere with this discussion, we may as well just end it. I appreciate the time that you&#39;ve taken to respond to me. I just don&#39;t think that we&#39;re reaching anything substantive any more. We&#39;ve come to a point where personal attacks and biases are rendering any attempt at reasoned discussion rather moot.</p>
