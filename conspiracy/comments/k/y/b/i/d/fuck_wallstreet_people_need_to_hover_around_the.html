    <div class="md"><p>The Fed is at the center of a banking cartel whose members are the largest banks of the World.  The Fed’s fractional reserve system is an efficient mechanism for extraction of wealth out of human endeavors.  This system is like the Matrix in the movie that you can’t see, touch, or hide from.  People generally understand that banks rob them.  What most don’t understand is how the Fed’s fractional reserve system robs them even more, or how the Fed pulls the strings of the government from behind the curtain.  The <a href="http://www.thebirdman.org/Index/Others/Others-Doc-Economics&amp;amp;Finance/+Doc-Economics&amp;amp;Finance-Money&amp;amp;AlternativeSystems/ProsperityFromColonialMoney.htm">founding fathers</a> fought a revolutionary war to free themselves from this tyranny.  </p>

<p>“What we need is an Andrew Jackson to stand, as Jackson stood, against the encroachments of organized wealth.” … “We say in our platform that we believe that the right to coin and issue money is a function of government.  We believe it.  We believe that it is a part of sovereignty, and can no more with safety be delegated to private individuals than we could afford to delegate to private individuals the power to make penal statutes or levy taxes.” … “Those who are opposed to this proposition tell us that the issue of paper money is a function of the bank, and that the Government ought to go out of the banking business.  I stand with Jefferson rather than with them, and tell them, as he did, that the issue of money is a function of government, and that the banks ought to go out of the governing business.” - William Jennings Bryan 1896</p>

<p>It is likely that protesters will never be allowed near the Fed’s building.  However, the protesters can and should adapt a goal, and a slogan – <strong>End the Fed</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;It is absurd to say our country can issue bonds and cannot issue currency.  Both are promises to pay, but one fattens the usurer and the other helps the people.&quot; - Thomas Edison</p>

<p>“We the people” should “coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin”.  Accordingly, the US Treasury must issue the Constitutional currency - the <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Note">United States Notes</a></strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is my understanding that the US Treasury still does mint coin, and the Fed regulates how much is made.</p>

<p>Money is a fiction, and the Federal Reserve is our storyteller.  If we were to abolish the Federal Reserve, we would likely end up with something akin to what happened in Brazil years ago.  Unless, of course, we go back to the gold standard, which, as I understand it, cannot happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Besides gold being in limited supply and therefore unsuitable as currency (e.g., there is no way to pay off interest that physically does not exist), history clearly demonstrated that gold based currency is unstable since its value constantly changes through trading and manipulation.  History also shows that work cannot be valued in terms of a commodity, because an abstract unit of work can only be equated to an abstract unit of value.  But what is more devious about gold currency is that it’s just another form of fiat.  Since the face value of commodity based currencies exceeds value of the commodity they represent.  It is designed to fool people!  And people are easy to fool.  </p>

<p>The issue of money is so simple yet too complicated for most to grasp.  So he is an example.  If a company want’s to expend (e.g., build a new plant) it generally has two choices: sell bonds or issue additional stock.  In either case the company will simply print the securities (i.e., stocks or bonds).  Selling bonds will put the company in debt and reduce value of its shares until debt is repaid.  Issuing stock may dilute the shareholders’ stake until production is increased.  The difference between issuing bonds and stock is that the buyers of debt (the banks) profit from the company’s efforts instead of the shareholders.</p>

<p>Now imagine a company with a name USA Inc. whose shareholders are “we the people”.  For decades, USA Inc. has been selling bonds to a private central bank and in the process was swindled by this bank using the “fractional reserve” scam.  Now imagine that USA Inc. stops issuing bonds and instead issues stock i.e., the United States Notes.  Then the USA Inc. would no longer generate debt to profit banks and instead produce more profits for its owners “we the people”.</p>
