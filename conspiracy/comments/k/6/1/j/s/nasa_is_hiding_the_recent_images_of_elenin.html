        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Since the STEREO telescope showed Elenin&#39;s turn and that it hasn&#39;t broken up about Aug 31, SECCHI went off line. It just came back on line, but has added no new images to it&#39;s gallery. That usually happens after 24 hours. They are way late.</p>

<p>If you go to the NASA site, there are images, but since the turn and evidence that Elenin hasn&#39;t broken up, the image quality is so bad that you can&#39;t see anything let alone Elenin.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what it looked like before Sept 1 2011: <a href="http://imgur.com/z05MC">NASA</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s what it looks like after Sept 1 2011. . : <a href="http://imgur.com/FV50z">NASA</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s how you can see what I&#39;m talking about:</p>

<p>Go to this site: <a href="http://stereo.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/images">NASA</a></p>

<p>Select from the Telescope list &gt; Behind HI1</p>

<p>Select a decent resolution &gt; I use 1024x1024</p>

<p>Under Display select &gt; Slideshow</p>

<p>Start Date &gt; 20110826</p>

<p>End Date &gt; 20110904</p>

<p>Click the &quot;Search&quot; button.</p>

<p>It will create a video showing how the quality became useless just after Elenin turns and was still clearly visible on Aug 31. </p>

<p>The quality of the images at NASA is so bad now that you can&#39;t see anything.</p>

<p>Images since Sept 1 are still not available at SECCHI. This site has much higher quality images, so if you want to see Elenin&#39;s make an apparent turn (this not an issue) and that it hasn&#39;t broken up (this is the issue), I suggest you go there.</p>

<p>Go to <a href="http://secchi.nrl.navy.mil/index.php?p=js_secchi">SECCHI</a> website.</p>

<p>At the bottom select &quot;Multi-day SECCHI tool&quot;.</p>

<p>Enter these values:</p>

<p>Telescope &gt; HI1</p>

<p>Observatory &gt; SECCHI-B</p>

<p>Image size &gt; 1024x1024</p>

<p>Date &gt; 20110825</p>

<p>Duration (Days) &gt; 9</p>

<p>At the start, Elenin is just below and to the right of the letter &quot;y&quot; in Mercury. It moves against the star background up. As the lens flare (looks like a ring or oval) comes out from the right, it intersects with Elenin at &quot;25/50 20110828_024901_tbh1B.png&quot;</p>

<p>According to John Gossop, here&#39;s <a href="http://i727.photobucket.com/albums/ww271/Rob_Kau/Comet_Eleninadjatext.jpg">what Elenin looked like</a> on Sept 2.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what comets look like when they break up:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.physics.unc.edu/%7Eevans/pub/A31/Lecture14-Satellites/comet-west-breakup.jpg">Image 01</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.universetoday.com/88494/comet-elenin-could-be-disintigrating/">Image 02</a> (4th image down)</p>

<p>**<strong><em>Update</em></strong>*** &gt; No new independent images of Elenin in the last 24 hours.</p>

<p>The SECCHI website came back on line and has the final latest images of Elenin, but it is now left it&#39;s field of view.</p>

<p>If you want to see the last images of Elenin go here: <a href="http://secchi.nrl.navy.mil/js_secchi_day.html">http://secchi.nrl.navy.mil/js_secchi_day.html</a></p>

<p>Enter these values:</p>

<p>Telescope &gt; HI1</p>

<p>Observatory &gt; SECCHI-B</p>

<p>Image size &gt; 1024x1024</p>

<p>Date &gt; 20110827</p>

<p>Duration (Days) &gt; 9</p>

<p>At the start of the video Elenin is on the right of the screen a little bit above center to the left of where the lens flare comes from about two inches, moving up.</p>

<p><strong>To me it looks like comet Elenin is still significant and not broken up. Also Elenin changes brightness significantly in the last few frames</strong>. </p>

<p>Elenin has now moved out of the field of view of Stereo B and is obscured by the Sun from Earth based telescopes.</p>

<p>We won&#39;t be getting any new images until late September, unless NASA re-positions Stereo B.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>look at background stars. Also note on image 214  it jumps time frames almost 2h instead of the 20 or so min time frames it had been.  The 215 to 216 it jumped 4h... But the background stars change a lot.  And then frame 216 to 217 it jumps 3h and the background stars move again.... This progresses with each frame from this point.  With each of the drastic changes between each frame look at the changes of time between frame and background star location.  The scope is moving!  Is it possible something has happened to the scope and it can&#39;t get images?  SECCHI seems to just show the ones it could take.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is related. It appears to be written by the guy himself Leonid Elenin:</p>

<p>Quote for the lazy:</p>

<p><em>Overall, the most scientifically interesting thing is the breakup scenario, but unfortunately right now the comet is not visible to the largest telescopes or even the Hubble Space Telescope because of its close angular distance from the Sun (small elongation). On the other hand, amateur astronomers, awaiting this comet which might have been visible to the unaided eye, will now not see it, at least visually in their telescopes and binoculars.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whether or not it actually breaks up is pretty much irrelevant seeing as its not coming closer than 90x the distance away from the moon.</p>

<p>Its simply too small to have any effect on us. We&#39;ve seen bigger comets come closer in the past and our orbit has even passed through comet comas before. But we&#39;re still here. Elenin is a small comet. Its not in the news because it is insignificant, despite what fear mongers tell you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were over 100 comets the size of elenin discovered this year alone. They don&#39;t get news coverage because they are insignificant. Why conspiracy theorists latched onto elenin is besides me.</p>

<p>I wonder if you&#39;ll still have any belief in this theory after the comet has left the system?</p>

<p>Do you think its a brown dwarf or something? If so, do you realize we would see it with our naked eyes very clearly, and it would have already affected the orbits of our planetary neighbors to a disastrous degree?</p>

<p>If its in the news AT ALL its probably because it&#39;s gotten soo much attention from the conspiracy communities. Yet when the actual astronomers and scientists speak on it, oddly, the conspiracy theorists are nowhere to be found in the crowd... Its really strange how that works out.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not even <em>not</em> on TV. They talk about it, but it&#39;s always a short blurb about &#39;nothing to see, carry on&#39;.

    <div class="md"><p>It is insignificant, it is however strange that a comet will take a turn like that, it&#39;s not un-ordinary for a comet to break up during the fastest part of it&#39;s orbit however it&#39;s pieces will usually follow the same orbit path..</p>

<p>if it has indeed taken a turn, then it is unusual but still probably nothing that cannot be explained with reason. I could bet it really is all coincidental, it is however a strange series of events regardless.</p>

<p>Comet from a not common section, makes an uncommon turn, nasa lies about it and doesn&#39;t release anything new...</p>

<p>It&#39;s just a bit strange, whether or not there is any significance however really doesn&#39;t matter. I will still continue to read until there&#39;s some solid answers as to what is actually going on (seems to be a lot of confusion atm)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not but I am personal friends with one. I was looking at it with him back on the night of the 1st - morning of september 2nd.</p>

<p>Some quick googling <a href="http://spaceobs.org/en/2011/09/03/comet-elenin-the-final-prospect/">turned up this post from the 3rd</a> which claims it has broken up. It also provides reasoning for the lack of recent images (some conspiracy sites are hosting alleged photos from australia on the 6th that are not actually elenin - but a completely different object and you can see this with simple comparison).</p>

<p>I just gave my buddy a call and he actually picked up (its 5am). He tells me elenin is not visible in the current night sky. This seems to match with the above linked article. Here is a small excerpt from it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Overall, the most scientifically interesting thing is the breakup scenario, but unfortunately <strong>right now the comet is not visible to the largest telescopes or even the Hubble Space Telescope because of its close angular distance from the Sun (small elongation).</strong> On the other hand, amateur astronomers, awaiting this comet which might have been visible to the unaided eye, will now not see it, at least visually in their telescopes and binoculars.</p>

<p><strong>We will wait for Sept. 23rd when the comet is due to appear in the field of view of the SOHO space coronagraph.</strong> Any result will tell us what we can expect at the beginning of October when the comet once again should appear in the pre-dawn sky. We will wait. The end of this story is near…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This also offers additional valid explanation as to why the quality level of images suddenly slipped.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The orbit viewer doesn&#39;t appear to be loading properly. Adblock sees it and provides a block button so I know its there, it simply doesn&#39;t load up.</p>

<p>If I&#39;m not mistaken though, this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>last obs. used       2011-08-02  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indicates that the last observation that added to any estimates from them was from august 2nd so its completely possible that it will in fact be gone until September 23rd.</p>

<p>In addition, <a href="http://www.space.com/12603-comet-elenin-photo-nasa-stereo-spacecraft.html">this article from mid-august</a> provides legitimate explanation as to why observations in high resolution got dipped on september 1st.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Comet Elenin is expected to become brighter over the next few days, and could be detectable using Stereo&#39;s coronagraph instrument <strong>between Aug. 20 and Sept. 1</strong>, NASA officials said. Mission managers are then expecting the comet to become visible to another sun-watching spacecraft – NASA&#39;s Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) – for six days, beginning on Sept. 23.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So this is another article confirming the reappearance on the 23rd. Not only that but it also provides more explanation (though that was already clearly shown) as to why it dissipated on the 1st.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll try that orbit diagram thing again later. Perhaps its just busy right now.</p>

<p>Some more quotes from the above mentioned article.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NASA has dismissed the notion that comet Elenin is anything other than a dim, wimpy comet. It poses no threat to Earth, making its closest pass at a distance roughly 100 times farther than the distance from Earth to the moon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The human race has been freaking out over comets for thousands of years. They were believed to herald upheavals of society, and were taken as fell portents, particularly regarding the lives and future prosperity of kings and other rulers. They had little or no bearing on the lives of ordinary folk, except in a secondary way (if a war is made on a ruler, the people under him suffer).</p>

<p>When a comet appeared during the reign of Queen Elizabeth the First, she was advised by some of her advisors not to look at it. The fear was that a ray from the comet would blight her life (all astrological objects were believed to send down rays to the earth that affected human lives). She defied them and looked at the comet anyway, and had a long and prosperous reign.</p>

<p>The comet craze of the present moment is tied in with the 2012 false prophecy of the Mayan calendar, which is (wrongly) supposed to predict the end of the world in 2012. Once we get past that year, much of the present apocalyptic nuttiness we see around us will fade away ... until the next doomsday.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh calm your britches! I just decided to skip all the &quot;disinformation&quot; (as you called it) that surrounds all these Elenin conspiracies.</p>

<ul>
<li>Step 1: Claim NASA is hiding Elenin images</li>
<li>Step 2: Ask why they are hiding them</li>
<li>Step 3: Assume they don&#39;t want people to see something about Elenin</li>
<li>Step 4: Ask what could this something be?</li>
<li>Step 5: It must be a brown dwarf or large mass object or some other doomsday event</li>
</ul>

<p>I skipped 2-4.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The orbit viewer doesn&#39;t appear to be loading properly. Adblock sees it and provides a block button so I know its there, it simply doesn&#39;t load up.</p>

<p>If I&#39;m not mistaken though, this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>last obs. used       2011-08-02  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indicates that the last observation that added to any estimates from them was from august 2nd so its completely possible that it will in fact be gone until September 23rd.</p>

<p>In addition, <a href="http://www.space.com/12603-comet-elenin-photo-nasa-stereo-spacecraft.html">this article from mid-august</a> provides legitimate explanation as to why observations in high resolution got dipped on september 1st.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Comet Elenin is expected to become brighter over the next few days, and could be detectable using Stereo&#39;s coronagraph instrument <strong>between Aug. 20 and Sept. 1</strong>, NASA officials said. Mission managers are then expecting the comet to become visible to another sun-watching spacecraft – NASA&#39;s Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) – for six days, beginning on Sept. 23.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So this is another article confirming the reappearance on the 23rd. Not only that but it also provides more explanation (though that was already clearly shown) as to why it dissipated on the 1st.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll try that orbit diagram thing again later. Perhaps its just busy right now.</p>

<p>Some more quotes from the above mentioned article.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NASA has dismissed the notion that comet Elenin is anything other than a dim, wimpy comet. It poses no threat to Earth, making its closest pass at a distance roughly 100 times farther than the distance from Earth to the moon.</p>
