       there's some good posts and good info, but a fuckload of retards and retarded fearmongering. the way obviously untrue stuff gets upvoted leaves me shaking my head, so i can't consider this place to be a serious source of information as a result.

       here's what i just said to some other guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       "i'm tired as fuck of getting called a disinfo shill and getting downvoted for using logic and rational thought instead of blindly believing youtube attention whores or suspicious bloggers."
      </p>
      <p>
       i just don't think it's worth it. the people smart enough to judge for themselves what's true and what isn't don't need me, and the people who aren't smart enough to judge for themselves usually think they are so they refuse to listen to something outside of their confirmation bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       it's the odd thing about this realm of thought that lets someone think that just because they're "open minded" they're also "better critical thinkers" which is entirely untrue. it just gets really, really old arguing with people who think they're smart, open minded, and critical thinkers when in reality they just bought into disinfo trolling 100% and are using that belief to do unpaid disinfo work for whoever started the rumor in the first place.

       This is almost the exact reason I subscribe to this sub. If "truth" movements are going to go anywhere or get noticed, we need level-headed, rational discussion and debate. What we don't need is a giant circlejerk where people just spout off speculation unchecked. Debate and opposition are GOOD things, not things to be downvoted or a responsibility to be shirked.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of people here just seem to ignore and/or downvote my comments, call me a shill or a sheep, or just say that I am uninformed instead of engaging me in conversation. All I'm really trying to do is promote rational, unbiased (gasp!) discussion about important issues by presenting an opposing argument in an effort stem the massive tide of bullshit that is so prevalent here. It is very telling and ironic that ideas that go against the grain here are often attacked so aggressively.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've noticed that it has been getting better as the subreddit grows but we still have a long way to go. People need to realize that the only way to teach people about your beliefs in to engage them in adult conversation instead of insulting and disregarding them. Many of my comments serve as a litmus test for peoples' willingness to do that. They often fail.

       Anti-Zionism isn't racist. It's anti-racist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry, but saying opposition to organized Jewish racism is itself racist is beyond Orwellian.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, I would say that defending organized Jewish racism is a major ideological component of liberal fascism.

       Completely agreed. I'm talking about anti-jewish sentiment masquerading as anti-zionist speech. Reddit has attracted the attention of stormfront, as well as JIDF types.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is now directly owned by advanced publications which is owned by the Newhaus family, so if you really are running the "A group I can't join is in control of all of the resources and centers of power" program and in this instance it's been imprinted with "it's the Jews", completely ignoring all the secret fraternaties, intelligence agencies, drug cartels, arms traders, crime syndicates, think tanks, billionaires, industrialists, religions, pedophile rings and media outlets that aren't wholly jewish and not wondering if this group of people ever feel as threatened by people like you, as you them, then you might be on the wrong website.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you prove it's solely zionist at the top, or are nearly 7 billion distinct realities playing out and vying for position?
Is fascism solely zionist in nature and execution?
Do you care about the palestinians because you want the best for all of these 7 billion concurrent lives?
Because you want to know who's an oppressive no-good shit you can denounce?
      </p>
      <p>
       Notions of anti-zionism are combatting a heirloom meme that serves as a specific genepool's
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_nepotism">
        survival strategy
       </a>
       , can we agree that not every member inherits this meme in the first place?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's complex but it's not immune to analysis. Hopefully we're on similar ground here, and you're not one of the stormfront types who might even just be acting on their own genepool-specific handmedown notions about the world.

       The corrupted elites two-party regime have used American Empire and dollar hegemony to fashion a false-consciousness not only in Americans, but in much of the West, as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who lives in reality?…those who can see society collapsing socially, economically, spiritually, and in all other ways around them, or those who have blinders firmly placed over their eyes by Empire and insist “everything is fine” and “we’re going through a mere hiccup right now.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Few people have the courage to face reality, which consequently gets shunted aside as “conspiracy.”
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s easier to be a lemming…and it used to be safer. But now the lemmings are marching over the cliff, so its far smarter to face reality or “conspiracy” or whatever the lemmings deign to call it.

       Whenever I observe the news whether it's outside, in MSM or in here, underground. I have to 'catch the line', so to speak and ignore the 'lure', the fear-mongering, sensationalism, emotional reconstruction over obscure/vague issues, etc. I love it but I don't trust it all.

       Your turn of phrase
       <em>
        grand masters
       </em>
       is simply rhetorical  one-up-manship. There are no grand masters. Your
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       masters are the 1%.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people do not understand that they are slaves because they have been programmed by religion, public education and nationalism and allow themselves to be  "entertained" by television, sports, video games and other forms of virtual reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on your link I am guessing you are addicted to video games. Addiction is a form of slavery.

       Now you are making sense but you are mistaken.
      </p>
      <p>
       The unknown and unknowable was called God or "the gods" but they do not exist. If they did they would, by definition, be impartial or equally disposed toward all of their creations. There is no "royalty" or "chosen people". The monkeys who accentuate, promulgate and profit from inequality are no brighter or better than you are. They want you to believe in hierarchy. There is no one above.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "pyramid" is just another way of reinforcing their scheme. Their conspiracy is designed to preserve, promote and enhance their common interests. Since the 99 are often victimized by their activities they want you to believe it in inevitable or the work of God. Your education, religion and nationalism predispose you to concur and cooperate.

       God or "the gods" can be known if you look,it is ignorance to consider knowledge unknowable.

       About six months ago, I told a local friend about what was going on with the bailouts, the banksters, and the war profiteers.
      </p>
      <p>
       That night, she went out with some Eskimo Joe's
       <sup>

       </sup>
       "insiders".
      </p>
      <p>
       The next day, she asked me: So, do you believe in bigfoot and aliens, too?
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I sent her a text message yesterday telling her that the bigfoot and alien believers are having a picnic on Wall Street.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sadly, she still hasn't heard about Occupy Wall Street, so she had no clue what I was talking about.

       The evolution of this sub/redditt reflects the evolution in the collective consciousness of society. More and more people are waking-up to a harsh reality that cannot be reconciled with their programmed beliefs in religion, politics and economics. They try to belittle you, out of fear and desperation. The name-calling and attacks are positive indicators. It means they have been informed.

       If I tell someone there is a fire hazard in their house they will take it seriously, if it is their house. If they do not have a stake in the house they will dismiss my claims. If they have a stake in it burning down they will do whatever they can to discredit me.

       Are you sure you're still not trying to convince yourself nothing is going on?  Lookup the word "conspiracy" and tell me if that's not basically what's happening right now in Washington.  A collection of wealthy and powerful people are benefiting while the rest of the country goes down the shitter.  The conspiracy is out in the open now.  You can't say it doesn't exist because big corporations have more say that you do right now!

       That's the conspiracy......and they've made you believe there isn't one even while it happens right in front of your face.

       I actually agree with you, something that I rarely find with people in this subreddit.  What would be fascinating, and highly productive, is if we could harness the networking power of reddit to get some
       <em>
        solid
       </em>
       <em>
        proof
       </em>
       .  There are bits and pieces of proof, but not enough to paint a complete picture.  I have no doubt in my mind that some of these big corp execs meet at country clubs or restaurants, band together to work out lobbying strategies, and fix prices in their industries.  But until we can get proof it's all just a "theory".

       According to the German philosopher, Arthur Schopenhauer, "All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being self- evident."

      <p>
       Let us know when you make it out of the first stage.

       No, but they get exposed to ideas they won't find elsewhere nonetheless. The status quo mindset is like a water jug that people carry on their heads. You do not have to demolish it to make it useless, ONE crack will do.

       This place is hilarious. White nationalists and paranoid Redditors mixing together to talk about the Jews controlling the weather. And if someone is skeptical of a conspiracy theory, they're downvoted and accused of being government agents and hasbara shills. You guys are my source of entertainment. Sometimes, while I'm having lunch, I actually visit this place, just to have a chuckle at the latest nonsense that you morons have been upvoting.

       This is a place for sharing and discussing conspiracy theories, not for being skeptical of them. Some of them may be stupid, some may be great, but that's not the point. No conspiracy theory should be too outlandish to be submitted here - that's what it's for - people can upvote and downvote as they please.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want healthy skepticism, go to r/skepticism or a similar subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Coming here and complaining that we post/believe in too many conspiracy theories is like going to r/minecraft and complaining that they're obsessed with minecraft, and you shouldn't get downvoted for saying the graphics are too blocky.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really don't understand people like you. Nobody is forcing you to come here. Take a good, hard look at yourself - do you feel important by being a troll?

       That subreddit is a joke. It's mostly people saying "I'm a skeptic but I don't have time to research topic X, what should I believe about it?" Agreeing with other self proclaimed "skeptics" has nothing to do with a skeptical mindset.

       I see you're very familiar with the ways of r/conspiracy.  I'm on one of their shill lists, but I can't remember which one, but I think I'm supposed to be mossad, hasbro, or whatever they call it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there's just 13,000 people more looking and laughing, and 1,000 new future mental patients.  Linking to a ranting blogger article titled something like "Obama is a secret JIDF agent trying to make America a CIA controlled Jewish state" would be worth at least 500 upvotes in this subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       They really should have a reddit alien logo in r/conspiracy that's wearing a 'wife beater' t-shirt that says, "White Power" and a little tinfoil hat. Maybe with a few UFO's fighting the Loch Ness monster in the background too.

       I seem to find more Christian zionists here in America than Jewish ones, so I'm not surprised Joe is one.  He was raised in a devout Catholic home, and several popes claimed the Jews going back to the "promised land" was necessary to fulfill the the biblical prophesy of the second coming of Christ and the rapture.  Just because he's Biden is a zionist, doesn't mean that he has any ties to JIDF or any other groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the only thing that gives Israel a right to that land is the UN decision, and the wars they won, not some line in the bible.

       You're mostly correct.  They don't believe in the rapture as it's portrayed by other forms of Christianity.  It's not the Harold Camping / Family Radio prediction of the rapture.  But, they do believe in most of the same prophesies leading up to Jesus returning.  The debate between Catholicism and other denominations seems to lie in what the return of Jesus would be like.  This is the clearest info I could find on it with a quick search.

        As Cardinal Ratzinger recently pointed out (in the context of the message of Fátima), we are not at the end of the world. In fact, the Second Coming (understood as the physical return of Christ) cannot occur until the full number of the Gentiles are converted, followed by "all Israel."
