       The moon landings may have been faked, but one needs to look specifically at the geopolitical climate of time and the exo-politics between the USA, china and Russia to have any kind of understanding of why Russia played along with our little game. Let me just leave it at that because this issue is kind of a holy Grail issue even with conspiracy theorists. As for reptilians, they may exist on some other planet somewhere, but probably not here. Notice I said probably because no one can ever be 100% certain of anything anymore. But I do agree that all the shapeshifting reptilians videos on YouTube are all just bad data compression and missing I-frames.

       have you ever seen planet earth? the super famous documentary? (i assume you have, or at least hope you have, so...) have you seen the "making of" parts at the end of the episodes? people travel to the most remote regions on this planet and sit in freezing/sweltering/soggy/desert blinds for days or even WEEKS on end, just to get video of a certain creature. not any video that serves a real purpose, just evidence of a creature so we can better understand it.
      </p>
      <p>
       and you're going to tell me that these are "pathetic and petty antics" that are beneath an intelligent creature? get the fuck out of here you moron.

       And this is why this subreddit is fucking garbage. Crosem answered the OPs question and gave his reasoning. I am not saying it was the best post ever, but your post calling him a retard gets upvoted, and him using the site exactly as intended gets downvoted.

       i made a post about this just a few days ago. i'll use the same analogy because i just woke up and i'm lazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you put a book under a wobbly table, you just fixed a table. you used that book in a way in which it wasn't intended for use, but now you have something else that works a little better.
      </p>
      <p>
       this is the same way. whatever reasoning they had in their heads when they invented reddiquette is fucking bullshit. why? because people don't choose to use this user-directed site that way. doesn't matter why, they just do. part of that less-than-ideal reality is the de facto use of downvotes as a "this person is an idiot" device.
      </p>
      <p>
       so it's like bitching at someone for misusing a book, while that person only cares that their table isn't wobbly. just because you give a shit that books are meant for shelves doesn't mean that everyone else does, so refrain from telling us what we should and shouldn't do.
      </p>
      <p>
       and i called him a retard because he IS a retard. did you read his post? that's some shoddy fucking logic, and he actually had the gall to get a little condescending about it. you don't get the luxury of believing you're right while going down in flames in a logic crash on a place where people are allowed to leave comments to your post.
      </p>
      <p>
       oh, and i downvoted you against reddiquette, because i can.

       Great analogy of downvoting. Of course they can still "believe" they are right. There are people who believe they have a personal relationship with Jesus. Go ahead and prove them wrong. Lol.

       The logic wasn't great, but it wasn't retarded.
      </p>
      <p>
       His logic is probably:
      </p>
      <p>
       "If aliens can travel light years away, I am willing to bet they don't need to experiment with us to find out what's going on inside of us."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all speculation by him, but the point of the entire original post was for people to speculate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Calling him retarded when you disagree only serves to make him seem the far more intelligent one. In fact, I can actually read his post, while your seems like it was written by a 4th grader.

       My reply to this is that these aliens would probably possess the technology to remotely scan a human stealthily, or use nano bots, or something we wouldn't understand to get all the information they would need.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you could get an atom for atom scan of someone you could create a 3d replica complete with your personality for the ai as long as the software could parse you neural network, and I would assume alien tech could you could learn everything about the person.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are just a couple theories on the matter. Alien tech is highly speculative so who the fuck knows.

       you'd still have to send a team to scan or deploy/retrieve the bots. (unless you're ridiculously automated.)

       I could imagine a probe the size of a tennis ball equipped with scanners that could scan an ant from high orbit, or release nano bots that could rain down on earth. Imagine 300 years ago trying to predict the technology we would see today on earth. I think any alien visitors are likely to be at least that much ahead of us, maybe 1000years or more the tech they posses is unfathomable. If they don't want to be detected it would likely be trivial for them. They could have a scanner using physics principles we don't understand, that would allow them to scan any point in the universe from any other point in the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       They say a sufficiently advanced civilization would appear to have god like powers to a less advanced one. I think if god wanted to study people he wouldn't need to kidnap them and stick a probe up their ass, and if he even needed a space ship it would probably be invisible to us.
