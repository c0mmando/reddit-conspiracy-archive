        I can answer that one about the battery patents 'conspiracy' if you don't mind. There's one known case about the NiMH EV-95 battery patent.
328 RAV4 EVs were made available in November of 2002 and sold out immediately. After the 328th one sold, the program was unceremoniously shut down. The EV-95 battery was no longer available. Chevron had inherited control of the worldwide patent rights for the NiMH EV-95 battery when it merged with Texaco, which had purchased them from General Motors. Chevron's unit won a $30,000,000 settlement from Toyota and Panasonic, and the production line for the large NiMH batteries was closed down and dismantled. Only smaller NiMH batteries, incapable of powering an electric vehicle or plugging in, are currently allowed by Chevron-Texaco.

       it makes sense for anyone to buy up battery patents.
fossil fuel organizations like oil companies have so much
cash they can easily buy patents.

       Seriously though, this isn't too far removed from what the the Powers- that-be did during the Dark ages with their suppression of technologies and general progress of mankind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, from the seat of Greed and Power, it makes perfect sense to buy up patents, or to threaten the inventor's life if they don't sell out to them. They would gladly make the world suffer if it meant them holding on to their profit margins.
      </p>

       It's unethical. And IMHO it's the sole reason why we don't have flying cars and hover boards yet. * - nor, i'd venture to say, the technology to colonize the solar system.*

       Just like it made sense for the automobile industry to buy all the street cars nationwide and dismantle them and then lobby the federal government to build an interstate highway system? You are comparing apples to oranges as the computer industry has a practical application of that battery technology. The industry had no motive here other than to suppress technology that would endanger their bottom line. This has happened countless times in this century alone. We could be living among the stars by now if this shit wouldn't happen. Capitolism breeds competition, competition breeds secrecy.

lots of cash.
i was not trying to be very specific about the companies i choose.
if i controlled a company with tons of cash regardless of industry
i would be buying every relevant battery and energy
related patent out there.

       I've mentioned this before, but I suppose it's worth repeating in this thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       The clockwork radio which uses the constant velocity spring (patented by Trevor Bayliss) revealed "free [and pollution-free] energy" a long time ago. This radio used a photovoltaic cell, a rechargeable battery (not really necessary if the technology were developed slightly further) and a wind-up coilspring driving the patented constant-velocity spring to drive an internal electric generator. The publicly released version of this, however, did not actually
       <em>
        use
       </em>
       the "free energy" model (possibly due to pressures from Dow chemical or some other powerful corporate magnate to keep toxic battery waste in the game). This model allowed the radio to operate off of the photo-voltaic cell (exclusively in good sunlight), the rechargable battery (which the solar cell would recharge), or the wind-up coilspring (not the gyroscope kind... this one wound up like a clock/watch, thus why it's called "clockwork" radio).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where they failed to follow through, however, was having the photovoltaic cell charge an internal capacitor which could, in turn, wind the coilspring (removing the need for a chemical based battery, altogether).... It is the closest thing I've seen to a perfectly clean version of solar power to date (removing the battery and making the modification I mentioned, that is). Coilsprings are 100% recyclable (they do tend to "get tired" -the technical term for "wearing out"- and need replaced every now and then), chemical batteries are not.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: typos.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT2: Here's the only remaining (to my knowledge) reference to this technology on wikipedia...
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Baylis#Invention">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Baylis#Invention
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       There used to be articles specifically about the clockwork radio itself, as well as the patented constant-velocity spring, but they have been removed within the last 3 years or so (to suppress the technology?).
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT3: Correction. They still have this article...
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind-up_radio">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind-up_radio
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But, no link to the patented constant-velocity spring (the key to making this design work without a gyroscope [the gyroscope models require constant cranking of the gyroscope] is the constant-velocity spring and clockwork mainspring...  you wind it up 10 or 12 winds like a clock/watch, and it runs for 15-30 min unattended). That is, there used to be 2 or 3 extensive articles about this patented item. Now they're nowhere to be found.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT4: Summary: "Free clean energy" (without a Tesla coil) already exists (in potential, at least) in the following manner...
      </p>
      <p>
       photovoltaic cell -&gt; capacitor -&gt; electric motor -&gt; coil/mainspring
       <sup>
        1
       </sup>
       -&gt; constant-velocity spring -&gt; generator.
      </p>
      <p>
       1: the coil spring or mainspring from a clock/watch is a
       <em>
        mechanical battery
       </em>
       (pollution/toxin-free, fully recyclable), and the rest of this technology already has models proven to be long-term durable (small scale photovoltaics are approaching a 10+ year lifespan).

       Then, make an array of these, such that each "unit" (identified above) can feed back to the capacitor which, rather than just winding one "unit", is computer controlled to wind each unit, in a cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Final modification: make each spring retain it's ability to be manually wound, and you can have this thing run (off of minimal "manual" input) at night, as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       perpetual motion (it requires the solar or manual input). However, once in motion, it takes relatively little (one or two periodic manual winds, or the little solar input) to keep it going.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically this:
      </p>
      <p>
       One solar cell, plus one capacitor feeds...
      </p>
      <p>
       many units of the rest.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you have the array going, you can get whatever voltage/wattage/amperage you want. The only caveat is that it does need time to build up a bunch of wound springs from the tiny solar input.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, distribute the array so that each "unit" is part of an electric outlet , and you have a modular unit which can be mass produced and sold. With low wattage LCD lighting (or whatever) it could basically light your home for free (and probably more, because I'm not an electrical engineer, just a mental experimenter).
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: p.s. I posted this on another forum about 5 or 6 years ago and released it to the public domain. If you improve upon this model, only the improvements can be patented... the rest (what I've said, above) is public domain (with the exception of Trevor Bayliss' patented constant velocity spring).
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT2: I think Popular Mechanics was allowed to release a version of Bayliss' freeplay radio about a decade ago (I actually had use of one that my housemate received as a gift). The Bayliss version is kind of expensive. The Popular Mechanics one was about $50 (US), I think.

       Imagine a bicycle with the following modifications...
      </p>
      <p>
       Pedal-drive the front wheel. Connect the front wheel to the center "pedals" via arched (formed in an arch, so it is flexible, but wants to retain it's formed arched shape) spring metal. Those pedals then drive the rear wheel.

       The large black circles are the "wheels". The green loops are "chains". The blue arch is the flexible (but formed in a specific arched distance) spring.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rear wheel
       <em>

       become (close to) constant velocity to drive a generator.

       The oil industry is shafted anyway. Japan has already produced a fully viable Hydrogen powered car that runs on water. and its ready for production. Hence a reason why Japan was targeted for artifical earthquakes from HARRP.

       its still unverified... But nice try. Also, Haarp being used to cause earthquakes is a retarded idea that has no merit. 15000 tests that show a neutrino may barely go beyond the speed of light has more credibility. Not to mention that a neutrino going faster then light really doesn't break the laws of special relativity or causality.  Once again I'm saddened by the sheer ignorance of r/conspiracy.
