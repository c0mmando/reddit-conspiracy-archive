<p>Here are a few.
(several added from reddit contributors)</p>

<p>Heading - voting is a complete fake:
The voting machines are known to be hackable and furthermore have been shown to have been hacked yet no one changes them. <a href="http://www.bbvforums.org/forums/messages/1954/15711.html?1138193805">http://www.bbvforums.org/forums/messages/1954/15711.html?1138193805</a> and the whole <a href="http://www.blackboxvoting.org">www.blackboxvoting.org</a> site and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/search?q=voting+machines&amp;sort=top">http://www.reddit.com/search?q=voting+machines&amp;sort=top</a></p>

<p>In a court case the man, Mike Connell,  responsible for hacking the Ohio voting machines in 2004 was killed just before he was to testify in court on the case. He ran the network connection from Ohio secretary of State&#39;s office into Chattanooga,TN to Smartech company where the the totals were adjusted and sent back to Ohio to be &quot;officially tallied&quot; . He had been threatened by Karl Rove and that threat a had been reported to the judge who denied protective custody. (He had already testified under oath and explained the process and that has been shown in open court - he just hadn&#39;t testified in court yet which is when prosecutions start happening.
<a href="http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/12-mysterious-death-of-mike-connell%E2%80%94karl-roves-election-thief/">http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/12-mysterious-death-of-mike-connell%E2%80%94karl-roves-election-thief/</a> and <a href="http://www.bradblog.com/?p=6765">http://www.bradblog.com/?p=6765</a> ( and many others - google it)</p>

<p>&quot;the Ohio Secretary of State election servers were suddenly re-routed to the GOP controlled servers at Smartech in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and the results flipped from John Kerry to George Bush.&quot;
<a href="http://www.velvetrevolution.us/prosecute_rove/">http://www.velvetrevolution.us/prosecute_rove/</a></p>

<p>The cofounder of another voting machine company used in US election killed in a another plane crash where BOTH engines inexplicably stopped. <a href="http://www.bradblog.com/?p=5947">http://www.bradblog.com/?p=5947</a>.</p>

<p>Heading - public opinion is manipulated by coordinated action of the all major news outlets to pick leaders and issues:</p>

<p>At a time Ron Paul and Michelle Bachman were the front polling Republican candidates  TV news media suddenly declared Rick Perry the lead candidate and gave him top press coverage despite him never having polled well until then.</p>

<p>Despite polls showing people overwhelmingly wanting politicians to concentrate on solving wealth inequality through taxation the media uniformly pushes deficit reduction and &quot;Austerity&quot; as the primary issue of the decade and never discusses the clearly polled uniformly known interest and desire for the addressing of wealth inequality.</p>

<p>The Presidential campaign of Larry Agran, especially the part in the documentary &quot;Spin&quot; where he is dragged by police from the audience of the debating hall where he should have been on the podium with the rest of the candidates. Also, any video I ever see of people stepping out of line at public debates... the police or security are on hand immediately to manhandle the person.</p>

<p>Heading - candidates - even the ones that seemingly are &quot;popular stars&quot;- are complete plants:</p>

<p>Obama worked for a CIA front company.
<a href="http://www.exportblueprint.com/blog/1552/verified-cia-front-business-international-corp-paid-for-obamas-columbia-college-tuition/">http://www.exportblueprint.com/blog/1552/verified-cia-front-business-international-corp-paid-for-obamas-columbia-college-tuition/</a>
and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_International_Corporation">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_International_Corporation</a></p>

<p>&quot;Obama lived in Indonesia with his mother and his adoptive father Lolo Soetoro, the 20-year-old Obama, who was known as “Barry Soetoro,” traveled to Pakistan in 1981 and was hosted by the family of Muhammadmian Soomro, a Pakistani Sindhi who became acting President of Pakistan after the resignation of General Pervez Musharraf on August 18, 2008. &quot;<a href="http://www.exportblueprint.com/blog/1552/verified-cia-front-business-international-corp-paid-for-obamas-columbia-college-tuition/">http://www.exportblueprint.com/blog/1552/verified-cia-front-business-international-corp-paid-for-obamas-columbia-college-tuition/</a></p>

<p>Mitt Romney who got $1,000,000 in campaign contributions from a dummy company that was set up by an anonymous contributor only for that purpose, and disolved directly afterwards</p>

<p>Heading - the parties hand pick candidates and it has nothing to do with the nomination &quot;votes&quot;:</p>

<p>Former Secretary of State George Shultz said in a nationally broadcast interview on a major network that George W. Bush had sat right on the couch in his Shultz&#39;s own house where he was being interviewed for the TV and had been grilled by the Republican party controllers to vet Bush before they chose him as the Republican party candidate in 1999 (so much for that silly nomination voting process)
(anyone got the link? it was an interview in his home probably related to a book release by abc nbc or cbs or someone like Barbara Walters.)</p>

<p>&quot;Shultz associated himself with the Bush presidency early on, introducing the Texas governor to Condoleezza Rice at the Hoover Institution in 1998. &quot;<a href="http://www.hoover.org/publications/hoover-digest/article/7920">http://www.hoover.org/publications/hoover-digest/article/7920</a></p>

<p>Heading - if a popular candidate surprisingly rises to takeover the hand picked positions when the manipulators are caughtoff guard they are quickly silenced:</p>

<p>Reagan was shot and almost killed by son of man who nominated George H. W. Bush after Reagan beat Bush which almost put Bush in as President after all. <a href="http://killtown.911review.org/assassinations/reagan.html">http://killtown.911review.org/assassinations/reagan.html</a> and many more if you google &quot;Hinckley knew the Bush&#39;s&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was the stuff about how Bush the younger originally stole the election by removing Blacks from the voting roles. The racist treatment of non-whites in general is one of the most glaring examples of the non-democratic nature of the beast. But the treatment of the poor, such as the shirtwaist fire, the attacks on striking miners, taxes for the poor vs. taxbreaks for the rich. Media control is another topic. Gulf of Tonkin, Pearl Harbor, 9-11, JFK, RFK, MLK, how much do you need? It is basically the entire history of the country.....</p>
