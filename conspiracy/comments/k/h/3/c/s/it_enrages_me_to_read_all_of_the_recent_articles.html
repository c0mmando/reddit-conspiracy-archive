        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve seen about a dozen articles in the MSM in the last week which attempt to portray the Human Species as fickle and imperfect, as if that explains the dire state of our economy, the ridiculous wars waged by the USA, and the obvious dysfunctionality of the US congress.</p>

<p>I actually find this quite enraging.  It seems pretty clear to me that these articles are written to close off further enquiry, and use trite, simplistic explanations for world affairs to avoid asking any difficult questions.</p>

<p>Rich people are  making massive profits from the exploitation of the poor, and it&#39;s quite obvious that the dire events of the last decade are more a product of a callous ruling class than of human frailty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Greenies pushing for control of EVERYTHING, including what you eat, what you sit on when you shit, what you wear, and what you think, try to convince people that they are evil, and that they are responsible for the ills of the world. It&#39;s a tactic designed to create guilt. Advertisers have used it for decades to sell products. Create doubt, insecurity, and guilt, and you can convince people to do anything. But we know who created the problems -- it was the small band of psychopaths who run things, the rich bastards who have distorted the world economy for their own enrichment and empowerment, and who have bought and paid for the elected politicians. They created the problem, and they <em>are</em> the problem. They need to be exterminated like a disease.</p>

<p>My posting is a bit of an exaggeration; I&#39;ve only seen one article in the last week, and maybe a dozen over the last twelve months, and I can&#39;t find the specific article which really got my goat.</p>

<p>However, I think we&#39;re more likely to solve problems if we search for specific problems in the world and fix them, instead of ascribing financial disasters to the nebulous problem of &quot;human behaviour&quot;.</p>

<p>What is there to disagree with?</p>

<p>Obviously excluding yourself since you find yourself to not fall under this category, who or what percentage of the entire human population does?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll answer it for you: Too many to even wrap your head around. But that doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t or won&#39;t change.</p>

<p>Basically what it boils down to, you may or may not jive with this but that doesn&#39;t remove the validity, is everyone&#39;s own perception of the world. What this perception consists of or how this perception is formed is entirely up to the individual. After a certain point in <em>anyone&#39;s</em> life, for me it happened at 6 years old, they become responsible for what they ultimately see it as. It is always changing as new knowledge, new data, differing perceptions come into an individuals &#39;bubble&#39;.</p>

<p>How these perceptions play out in peoples lives is entirely up to them. Some are completely aware of this, in tune with it, and see things as an ever flowing waterfall of life, love, happiness and joy because they see through all the bullshit that are other peoples perceptions brought into this world. Some are completely oblivious to even their own perception but still play it out with a certain <em>je ne sais quoi</em>. And there are many groups in between just living out their lives not fully realizing what they want or their truth, or others who know their perception and still blame aspects they have full control over but cannot get past what is right in front of them - in denial.</p>

<p>What you are upset with is that for some reason, the same reason people look at secret societies with such ill contempt, is that they feel cheated or lied to when the truth, or the knowledge to the understanding, whatever it may look like to you, is there but you may or may not be choosing to see it on account of your (anyone&#39;s) perception.</p>

<p>You can tell someone 10,000 times that the sky is blue, but that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean they see the sky as being blue, or even that the sky is, in fact, blue. (OMG wtf did he just say? :D)</p>

<p>Some people get it, others don&#39;t; But those that do, for the most part, are trying to bring those who don&#39;t up to speed. They just don&#39;t want to allow it into their realities because they choose not to acknowledge it. It literally is right in front of everyone&#39;s face.</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>What people causing what problems? Do you mean the &#39;elite&#39; moving abroad bringing other countries up to a standard more recognizable by our standards in the US and then those very people who were brought up to this par now being pissed because they still refuse to help themselves?</p>

<p>Stupidity, ignorance, educational background, and realized consciousness do not mean the same thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And I don&#39;t agree that the people running the whole show are stupid, either.</p>

<p>Of course not. But, again, who is running the show? Is it still not the people who are now pissed off by the very people the keep allowing them to be represented by? Democracy = Mob Rule. The dichotomy of the political system is a farce, granted, but most people still only <em>want</em> to see red and blue.</p>

<p>Republican: 9+5+2+4
Democrat: 2+3+6+8+1</p>

<p>Which do you prefer?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;re just mistaken if we think they have our best interests at heart.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you sure? The people speak every day about what they want. It is clearly defined by those put into office. I would say it goes hand in hand. (Just so we&#39;re clear want =/= need; as the saying goes, &quot;Ignorance is bliss.&quot; Right?)</p>

<p>Until people start acting not from a place of conditioned responses by the very society they put all their hard work into, making it all the more dismal in my eyes but still perfect for the purpose it serves, then change, from a perspective such as [y]ours, will seem like no change at all over the course of your life as far as &#39;standards&#39; are concerned in relation to those in the know (the people running the show; the wealthy; the elite) and those who make the choice to remain ignorant. All the information is there. One has but to really ask. I mean know the question(s) and <strong>really</strong> ask (themselves for the answer) what they wants to know.</p>
