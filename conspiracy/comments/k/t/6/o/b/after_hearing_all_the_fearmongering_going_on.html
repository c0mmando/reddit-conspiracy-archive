       First off, it wasn't a prediction it was an opinion.

       So, a misguided opinion spectacularly changing someone elses opinion. Hrmmm, where do we

       see that

       propaganda/warmachine/etc  isn't a bad thing if you're of service to others in forms such as exposing the propaganda. No?

       I don't even think it's disinfo - there are always fringe elements to any group of people. In this case, delusional people who would latch onto conspiracy theory style scenarios who would normally be isolated in their own communities are suddenly able to communicate with others the same via the internet, and effectively self-reinforce each other's delusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       This forms a small, but fanatical core group of people who act as a focus for the larger number of  the nice-but-dim gullible types who get drawn into it, thinking "if so many people believe in (reptilians, etc.) then
       <em>
        there must be something to it
       </em>
       ).

       I don't think anyone was saying that Elenin absolutely had to materialize today, by a certain time.  With conspiracies, it's more of a "Here are the facts we have, and they point to...."  where they attempt to predict the most likely day for an event.  They're not promises, they're not even predictions.

        When will Comet Elenin come closest to the Earth and appear the brightest?
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Comet Elenin should be at its brightest shortly before the time of its closest approach to Earth on Oct. 16, 2011.
        </strong>
        At its closest point, it will be 22 million miles (35 million kilometers) from us.
       </p>
       <p>
        Will Comet Elenin come close to the Earth or between the Earth and the moon?

        <em>
         Comet Elenin will not come closer to Earth than 22 million miles (35 million kilometers). That's more than 90 times the distance to the moon. *

       Airspace around Denver was not shut down today.  There was a VIP restriction that prohibited non-commercial and non-official (gov't, military, rescue) aircraft from entering a certain airspace, in this case for Obama's scheduled visit.  That prevents people in private planes from trying to buzz Air Force 1.  Commercial flights continued unobstructed.

       It's the end game of a lot of recent conspiracy mythology.  See "The Quickening", and talks on Project Camelot, for example.  Not promoting it, just sharing, as I find this stuff interesting from a story-telling point of view.

They just make you look silly and they make the rest of this subreddit look like they're all tinfoil hat wearing neckbeards.

       Actually without that and the occasional ancient prophecy all you'll have in this reddit(and all other conspiracy sites) is how are they going to kill,rape,pillage or beat us next, which is completely pointless since you can get that by watching Fox News.

       Elenin did something to the Sun, it is going bonkers; who knows what that means for Earth. Severe geomagnetic storm as we speak.

       Elenin has done nothing to the sun; you're talking out your bum. Comets do not have a measurable effect on the Sun.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sun, however, has a large sunspot (#1302), which is rotating towards the earth, which could cause a g4 electromagnetic storm. The sunspot is larger than planet Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       There has been increased solar activity for the last few weeks, including two X class solar flares. Also, there has been increased earthquake activity as a result.

       Q: Do solar flares or magnetic storms (space weather) cause earthquakes?
      </p>
      <p>
       A:  Solar flares and magnetic storms belong to a set of phenomena known collectively as "space weather". Technological systems and the activities of modern civilization can be affected by changing space-weather conditions. However, it has never been demonstrated that there is a causal relationship between space weather and earthquakes. Indeed, over the course of the Sun's 11-year variable cycle, the occurrence of flares and magnetic storms waxes and wanes, but earthquakes occur without any such 11-year variability. Since earthquakes are driven by processes in the Earth's interior, they would occur even if solar flares and magnetic storms were to somehow cease occurring.

       Although I object to the "retard" label, I retract the statement from my previous post that says that increased earthquake activity is a result of Solar Flare 1302. I stand corrected; I read through your link and a couple others, thank you(In my original learning effort, I must have originally clicked the first link when I googled "can geomagnetic storms cause earthquakes" instead of the second)   ;)
      </p>
      <p>
       However, all the other information I provided is factual, and my point regarding the comet Elenin's inability to effect our Sun stands.
      </p>
      <p>
       I upvoted you for the correction, but downvoted you for the insult; therefore, my votes will have a similar effect on your karma, as Elenin will on the Sun.

       But that doesn't mean they have
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       effect; human technology only measures less than 2% of the EMS after all. Long period comets, given their origin outside the heliosphere, are just about certain to carry a vast cloud of protons with them. There
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       be a very substantial electrical interaction between that and the vast electron cloud surrounding the Sun. The Sun's activity increased dramatically as Elenin approached, something that does defy coincidence under the circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sunspots surely mean something, but probably not what you guess they mean. In the summer of 2002, the sun was covered with huge sunspots, I saw them with my naked eyes. But while there were heatwaves and many forest fires, there was much less seismic activity then than there is now. Geomagnetic storms cannot be correlated outright with sunspots either, BTW, as they depend entirely on CMEs striking the earth apparently at random. There have been more than 2 X flares by the way.

       First off, I'm sorry if I came off rudely in my original comment. I probably replied too quickly to your post, which I interpreted as a wild, undocumented claim. I see from your latest reply that your comment was not made absent of relevent knowledge; thanks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there any scientific evidence that the recent increase in solar activity is a result of Elenin(or alignment thereof)? I would be inclined to believe that, but do historical records not overwhelmingly show otherwise? Here is a good article outlining the debate.
       <a href="http://news.exopoliticsinstitute.org/index.php/will-comet-elenin-cause-major-earthquakes-as-it-approaches-earth">
        Link
       </a>
       . He presents the research of Dr Mensur Omerbashich in support of the alignment-has-effect argument. Here is the
       <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2036">
        link
       </a>
       to the abstract of
       <em>
        Astronomical alignments as the cause of ~M6+ seismicity
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also worth mentioning, is solar flare 1302, which is rotating towards the earth over the next couple days. Is this not the more obvious cause of the solar activity? Can comets cause solar flares? Is it even a comet?

       Actually it isn't conjecture, it's physics; you can look all that up. As it happens, I saw the spots through the smoke of an immense forest fire.

       actually, YOU can look all that up for me. Perty please? I mean they are YOUR words that you spout out.  If you had any will to provide integrity to your words, you would provide your own external support. Otherwise don't take offense when people call your word worthless.

       Actually I don't really care all that much if you believe it or not. Simple physics though; electrons have a negative charge and low mass, they can't get far from the Sun. Protons have a positive charge and are heavy, the Sun uses them to inflate the heliosphere which protects the system from cosmic rays and debris. Comet picks up galactic protons in the oort cloud (this is static electricity), and even more as it proceeds through the heliosphere toward the Sun. With a 10,000 year comet, the electricity involved could easily be of proportions immense enough to effect a low mass star like Solaris. At some point it must discharge these protons into the electron cloud around the Sun, just like your finger on the doorknob when you've walked across the carpet. I suggest you watch Dr. Strong's channel on YouTube if you want to keep an eye on the Sun, BTW. Food for thought; what if that electrical discharge actually conveys information to the sun? :)

       It's pure conjecture without at least one scientific test to prove it. This isn't elementary school, you're not just allowed to play scientist. In fact, without any sort of backing whatsoever, what you're doing is more politics than science.

       Like you, I don't really care about the facts. What I care about is the spreading of misinformation to a retard who is dumb enough to believe whatever simply sounds legit yet has little to no merit.

       Elenin has done nothing to the sun; you're talking out your bum. Comets do not have a measurable effect on the Sun.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sun, however, has a large sunspot (#1302), which is rotating towards the earth, which could cause a g4 electromagnetic storm. The sunspot is larger than planet Earth.

       There has been increased solar activity for the last few weeks, including two X class solar flares. Also, there has been increased earthquake activity as a result.
