    <div class="md"><p>Elenin was a distraction but also a mark of what exactly happens when top secret, extinction level information gets released to the internet. It was the perfect storm. There is no doubt some threat heading our way, but Elenin was passed off to fringe sites for the reason of testing what information will be disseminated and absorbed by the public. It was the boy who cried wolf.</p>

<p>Next time an event comes this way, info will be released the same way, but even less people will listen, allowing elites to move about freely in a tide of &#39;conspiratorial waves&#39;, letting more die to being unprepared. Elemin was a test, that is all.</p>

The moon has had this same orbit since man has been around, but it may have caused tons of earthquakes when it first took it&#39;s orbital residence.
