        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>One night me and a friend were drinking some beer at my place. Forget how this came up but he claimed he was able to leave his body during sleep and basically travel around in his spirit form. I took it with a grain of salt for obvious reasons but I didn&#39;t dismiss him right off the bat because I knew him pretty well and he wasn&#39;t the type of kid that would try to troll me about these things. At the end of the night, I told him hey, why don&#39;t you prove to me that you can really fly around as a spirit and come to my room tonight. He agrees. I came up with the idea that I would write a note on a post it and he would have to guess what I wrote. He agreed so after making sure wasn&#39;t watching, I wrote something random and posted it up facing away from him(in my room there was this huge vent that protruded from the top of the ceiling where I could stick the post it facing away from him.) I did all this making sure he had no idea what I had written. We say our goodbyes and fast forward to the next morning. I get a call from him telling me that he had came and read the note. And yeah, you guessed it. He got it right.</p>

<p>This experience has really changed the way I view reality. I know it would be hard for most of you to believe me but this really happened and I am 100% positive that there was no way he could have seen what I had written on that post it. </p>

<p>Just some more interesting things about this kid. He was really into physics. He was a jock. Played football and made it to states for wrestling. He told me he used to see ghosts in his room all the time when he was a kid. He told me he could lucid dream whenever he wanted but stopped because he would go around basically fucking girls but &quot;what if when I&#39;m fucking them, I&#39;m actually in their dream raping them.&quot; haha crazy guy...</p>

<p>If you have anymore info or insight into this type of phenomena I&#39;d be interested to hear about it.</p>

<p>Edit: For those thinking that he may have broken into my room that night, I was living in graduate housing dorms back then so he would have needed to get into the main door, then the door to our suite, then the door to my room which were all locked, so very unlikely. Also like I said, he wasn&#39;t the type of person that would do something like that. He had a sense of humor but not the trolling kind.</p>

<p>there are a variety of reasons why it would still be unwon, ranging from Randiâ€™s own dishonesty and less than sincere motives, to tricks like perpetually raising the bar, as well as the spiritual principle that psychic abilities used for selfish motives or profit disconnect one from the higher source they emanate from.</p>

<p>If your friend claims to be able to do this then simply tell him about James Randi&#39;s scheme whereby he will pay you one million dollars if you can do it under controlled conditions.  We expect you will post pics of you and your friend receiving the award.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had an OBE. I was about 15 and sleeping over a friends house on a mattress on the floor. I &quot;woke up&quot; and my &quot;spirit&quot; was floating about a foot or two from the ceiling. I could see my body below and the ceiling which i was facing above me, at the same time. I slowly descended to my body below and about a metre from my body i woke up back in my physical body. It was unlike any dream i had had before. It was something different and i was confused. I remember telling some school friends about it but of course they didn&#39;t believe me. I had heard about out of body experiences/astral projection before but didn&#39;t really know anything about them because i thought it was a load of shit. After this experience i read up and saw that during these you have 180 or 360 degree vision. That blew me away and i realised what i had experienced. I&#39;ve never had one since but have read up about it and tried but without success (and will continue trying, though i haven&#39;t applied myself fully to it admittedly, maybe due to a bit of fear).</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad this happened to me because it has changed my view of the world and my areas of study. I truly believe there is MUCH more to the world than we are led to believe. I would go so far as to say it changed my life. </p>

<p>I hope you will be interested in what happened to me because nobody else really has been hahaha</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d somewhat recommend &quot;The Holographic Universe&quot;.  Here&#39;s part of the first review on Amazon:  </p>

<p>&quot;This is one of the most provocative books I have read in years. In the first few chapters Mr. Talbot describes the emerging holographic paradigm in science, drawing on David Bohm&#39;s work in quantum physics and Karl Pribam&#39;s work in neuroscience. I found both descriptions to be fascinating, and especially enjoyed the historical context for the work of these two seminal thinkers. As a person with a master&#39;s degree in neuroscience and chaos/complexity theory, I found a couple of his simplifications misleading, but would give him high marks for his overall comprehension of the conclusions of Pribam and his followers.
The remaining 2/3 of the book is a discussion of how the holographic paradigm may provide a rational basis for interpreting a wide variety of phenomenon located around the fringes of established science. He looks at everything from strange historical &quot;miracles&quot; like stigmata and appearances of the Virgin Mary to modern psychic abilities and LSD experiences, from out-of-body and near-death-experiences to UFO abductions. In addition, he compares language used in the modern scientific discussion of holography with the language used by ancient mystical traditions.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Holographic-Universe-Michael-Talbot/dp/0060922583">http://www.amazon.com/Holographic-Universe-Michael-Talbot/dp/0060922583</a></p>

<p>There is some great scientific discussion at the beginning of the book, but from there (like the review mentions) it tries to explain all sorts of weird phenomenons with the holographic model, and I think the author is really stretching things a bit.  But the first part of the book is worth it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for that info and the links.  I have many years experience as a scientist, and I think that its complete arrogance to think that the current &quot;reality model&quot; that most scientist have in their heads, (e.g. scientific materialism) is the complete story on our universe.  I think that there probably is more to the universe than just matter.  I&#39;m not saying we all have souls, or there was some grand creator. But it does seem that there is more to the universe than what we can manipulate and control enough in order &quot;know&quot; scientifically.  Before we had detectors that measured the full spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, we had no idea that there were other kinds of light that we couldn&#39;t see. So, what I&#39;m saying is, maybe there is something to the notion of life after death, or reincarnation, or ghosts.  We can&#39;t assume they don&#39;t exist, just because we can&#39;t control these phenomena, well enough to test them in a reproducible way. Given that many many people throughout history have seen ghosts and other paranormal activity, it seems much more likely to me that there is more to the universe than just matter. Or perhaps our understanding of matter is very limited.  Anyway, its easy to make fun of people who believe in ghosts, or reincarnation or whatever, but believing only in scientific materialism is just as much of a reach, if not more so. (this is not to suggest that you make fun of them, but many do.)</p>

<p>I live in a 200+ year old house and there have been many strange noises and strange happenings. I once saw a book fly out of the book case and land several feet away from it.   It had been wedged between two books. No one else was home, and I was several feet away. It was the strangest thing I&#39;ve ever seen.  So, I myself believe that there is a strong possibility of the existence of ghosts. Whether or not those are &quot;trapped souls&quot;, or just some kind of echo in time, it does seem likely to me that there is some kind of phenomena that we often call as ghosts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason I ask is that this subreddit, conspiracy sites and forums etc are filled with alot of nonsense and nutjob ideas that have absolutely nothing to do with conspiracy and unfortunately it makes it far easier for the average person to completely dismiss legitimate concerns raised by conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying your post is a load of insane nonsense, I don&#39;t pretend to understand everything about how the universe works, but I&#39;m sure you can appreciate that the majority would take one look at the title and think &quot;this guy is crazy&quot;, which then leads to &quot;conspiracy theorists aread nutjobs&quot;.</p>

<p>But hey, atleast you have anecdotal evidence, which is alot more than the doomtards etc have, I&#39;m just suggesting that there must be a better subreddit for this kind of discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely understand and I agree with you so no worries. </p>

<p>Just to add to how the average person views r/conspiracy or conspiracy theorists in general, I&#39;ve noticed that a lot of times, more than what one actually believe it&#39;s how those ideas are introduced.</p>

<p>I took a few counseling psych courses back when I was in school and one of the most important tenets of enlightening another individual is not by lecturing them with advice but guiding them towards a particular conviction by craftily presenting new ideas in the form of questions. Basically the point being that they need to feel like they&#39;ve reached the newer and truer conclusions on their own. This is crucial because it lets people put their guard down and we all know how defensive people get about ideas that disrupt their framework of things.</p>

<p>When dealing with friends and family members, I&#39;ve also noticed that the way you present yourself will have a lot to do with how successful you will be in enlightening them. For example, one of my friends basically alienated himself from our group of friends because he started putting all of his energy on conspiracies and he got so deep into it that it basically took over him. Like the quote, &quot;beware when you battle monsters lest ye become one,&quot; he basically started to turn really dark and paranoid. I think he looked into the abyss and the abyss looked him right back in the eye and it <em>changed</em> him. So no matter how much knowledge he was dropping between our friends, everyone just started feeling an aversion towards him.</p>

<p>Last thought about this whole thing is that even if you are crafty about presenting new conspiracies to people, you can&#39;t change the fact that some people just don&#39;t have the leisure to be thinking about such big ideas. They&#39;re too preoccupied with responsibilities and I can understand this very well now that I&#39;m getting older and I gotta start thinking about financial security and all that jazz. I think the biggest misconception we, conspiracy theorists, have about the average person is that knowledge will actually change them. I feel that at some level, those who are still living in the matrix have all at some point chosen to take the blue pill.</p>

<p>Edit: And to tie this back to your concern, the &#39;nutjobs&#39; are in some ways just enabling this denial.</p>

<p>I may have been sceptical, if it wasn&#39;t for the fact I have a strange ability of my own - I know when people are going to die sometimes, and when people close to me have just passed, I know. shittiest superpower ever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe in all of that stuff, but that said, I&#39;m sure that the beliefs and definitions we have now are probably not the right ones.</p>

<p>In my experiences, OBE&#39;s are a real thing.  I&#39;ve had a few myself.  I know a lot of people for whatever reason shit on the possibility that these things can happen (probably because they are jealous), but I&#39;m sure this is something that goes on.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t claim to know why or how and honestly, I&#39;m not sure anyone can.  But we shouldn&#39;t ignore that these seemingly anomalous events occur.</p>

<p>In my case, the first one I had was when I was in my early teens.  I had just gotten up in the morning to go to the bathroom.  After that I went and laid down again.  I felt SO comfortable, then I started to buzz and vibrate.  I sat up against a pressure, all the while seeing this powerful light.  I looked around the room for a moment before I lost it and then came back to my body and it&#39;s point of view.</p>

<p>Another one I had by accident was when I woke up in my old house that I grew up in, rather than where my body was at the time.  It was a hard state to maintain, and when I tried to get out of the bed and walk around, the world split in half and I woke up where my body was.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t do it on purpose, but I have come close a few times.</p>

<p>Anyways, the fact is weird shit happens and it happens a lot more than we like to admit.  We can&#39;t be afraid to say &quot;I have no idea what that is&quot; and move from there, rather than trying to cut those events out or cram them into our current world views.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, please understand this from Wikipedia:</p>

<p>In the criminal law, a conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to break the law at some time in the future, and, in some cases, with at least one overt act in furtherance of that agreement. There is no limit on the number participating in the conspiracy and, in most countries, no requirement that any steps have been taken to put the plan into effect (compare attempts which require proximity to the full offence). For the purposes of concurrence, the actus reus is a continuing one and parties may join the plot later and incur joint liability and conspiracy can be charged where the co-conspirators have been acquitted or cannot be traced. Finally, repentance by one or more parties does not affect liability but may reduce their sentence.</p>

<p>So what crime is being committed? How does your post fit into r/conspiracy after reading this? Please post this somewhere else in the future. kthxbai</p>
