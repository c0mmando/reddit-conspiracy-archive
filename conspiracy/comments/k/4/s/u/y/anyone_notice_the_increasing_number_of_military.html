        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;Feel good&quot; pictures of soldiers returning home after committing all sorts of unnamed atrocities, and a huge jingoist circle jerk to follow. Anyone else sick of this shit? </p>

<p>I tried to make my own responses <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/k4nnc/what_soldiers_really_do_fixed/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/k48au/hey_reddit_you_guys_love_pictures_of_soldiers_how/">here</a> but as usual the masses don&#39;t want to listen and go full retard whenever you expose US soldiers for what they really are: trained assassins on behalf of US corporate interests. </p>

<p>Another interesting point is that why don&#39;t pictures of soldiers from any other country other than the US ever make it to the front page? I have yet to see a picture of a poor Iraqi father holding his dead child in his hands on the front page. Yet the people who are actively killing the children not only get upvoted like crazy each week but there are masses of mindless idiots praising them for their war-crimes. </p>

<p>Since when was it wrong to stand against torture, murder, and the invasion/occupation of countries that were never a threat to us and sympathize with people who have had their entire lives turned upside down for a decade now. They cry that it is only a few bad apples, but that is bullshit when the goal of the military is to occupy and aggressively attack third world nations to secure resources on behalf of corporations. I doubt hundreds of thousands of civilians are dead due to &#39;a few bad apples.&#39; <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/k48au/hey_reddit_you_guys_love_pictures_of_soldiers_how/c2he0oq">When you point out facts and list sources</a> of widespread rape, murder and other horrible shit being a big part of the military, you get down voted for it with nothing but apologists thinking that handing out a few shoes somehow makes <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9yRzoOB1C4">shit like this ok</a>. Fuck everything about that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to remember that the Americans are brainwashed practically from the day of their birth through the TV and the &quot;education&quot; system that the US can do no wrong. They can&#39;t concieve of the fact that the US military is increasingly being used as the military arm of enforcement for Europe and Israel as well as US corporate interests. It is sad, but it is hard to blame them. One little piece of information one day is not going to counter years and years of propaganda that everyone around you believes is true.</p>

You&#39;re informed and awake, I&#39;m informed and awake, so maybe in a few years those people in rural Texas watching the football on Sunday afternoons with a case of Bud at their elbows will wake up. I can dream, can&#39;t I?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Blame the american NSA owned &quot;RAF Menwith Hill&quot; in England. Once they went fully operation two months ago they had the means to use up to close of almost half a million fake IP addresses and fake forum id&#39;s to infiltrate internet forums. </p>

<p>The David Icke forum in the UK has about almost 30 mil-intel trolls churning out rubbish on a almost continuous industrial scale trying to paint Icke and his followers has anti semitic and terrorists.</p>

<p>So we have to assume that this section here on Reddit will have a good 30 posters with fake ids coming on here from the NSA and Hasbara posting gunk just to try and grind us all down.</p>

<p>The glorifying of war and military. All these posts about soldiers hugging and kissing with terrorist kittens /s. Its so fucking obvious propaganda bullshit, yet people are blisfully ingnorant at the subconcious assosiations these pictures are meant to create.</p>

<p>War is peace, Freedom is slavery, Ignorance is strength.</p>

The general populous doesn&#39;t want to acknowledge that for a multitude of reasons, the primary being their concern for their own flesh and blood. </p>
