       I know when "Osama's compound was "raided" they said there were plans for an attack on 9/11/11 possibly on a train (if this is wrong correct me). My thoughts were they would do this (false flag of course) causing people to panic and allowing another tightening down on rights, TSA agents on all public transit, etc. I do think if that was the case, people WOULD see through it this time and rebel, but would it be too late?

       I think that as people become more aware, they are prone to questioning the legitimacy of any attack, and I think it's pretty clear that people are recognizing the propaganda/misinformation machine. There are also people that are more skeptical than they are willing to publicly admit, and as their friends and neighbors start to "come out" so will they. I believe we have evidence of this right here on Reddit, as I've noticed a drastic change in the tone of posts in
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       , the topics of articles linked, and interestingly, posts from alternative news sources with very high amounts of upvotes and not a whole lot of comments. Obviously this is anecdotal at best but I think we can all agree to some extend that posts that would typically only upvoted in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       are now getting attention from the hivemind in
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Clearly, the intelligence agencies monitor sites like Reddit, and if a government conspiracy of this type does in fact exist (I couldn't tell you yes or no), and I were running the show, I would be a little nervous and careful about my next move. I think that's why we are hearing a lot about "disclosure" (lol) now because there's going to need to be a drastic false flag unlike we've ever seen, in order to keep those friends and neighbors on the other side of the fence.

       nah, people aren't awake at all.  Only 15 % are awake and only 2 or 3 % really know what happened on 9/11.

       This comes off as arrogant to me. I said aware, not awake. I will contend that none of us are truly awake, but people with always have varying degrees of skepticism, which is fluid, and can change dramatically based on outside stimulus and personal experience. Awareness comes in degrees, while awake vs. asleep is either a. or b., and I think looking at the situation in black and white is as narrow-minded as the "asleep" ones that you would be so quick to criticize.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've explained my view of awareness, and would love to hear what you mean by "awake." By the context of your post and your smug, arrogant approach to responding to me is evidence to me that you are someone who has mistaken himself for being "awake," much like a religious fanatic will claim he has understanding of the world, but is still following beliefs that originated 2,3,4 thousand years ago. My point is that you will never be "awake" until you realize how little you actually understand about the world and the events therein. This all starts when you begin saying "I believe" something to be true, rather than just passing it off as a fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no idea where you got your numbers from but they're nonsense. It also takes only a small number of people (like 15%) to create a tipping point for an evolution in thoughts and beliefs. Like I said above, as people's friends and neighbors become more aware, so will they.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, there are always multiple angles to any story and therefore nobody knows the truth of 9/11, and most likely nobody will ever get the full story. The 3k+ people that knew the story the best are already dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, we all have a vested interest in uncovering lies and not allowing ourselves to be deceived. We need everyone to begin thinking for themselves, by throwing fuel on their tiny internal flames of skepticism. Most people won't fuel the fire themselves, and it's the people that they learn from and respect that cause that fire to grow. An overbearing amount of fuel can retard the fire as well though, so it needs to be approached gradually, as people's minds are finicky like that fire. Be someone who throws just the right amount of fuel at just the right time, instead of someone who neglects the fire altogether, or conversely who tries to fuel it too quickly. Please have compassion and empathy for people, the skeptic's fire is much more prominent resilient than you may realize.

       so basically like. 55 million and 10.5 million people respectively are awake? Lets just round to 70 million people. That sounds like it'd fit all those 30,000 fema coffin liners to me.

       what is, then, as you say a "sensible" way to react to something as utterly disgusting and DOWNRIGHT TERRIFYING as figuring out that your government has lied to you and allowed thousands of your fellow citizens to be murdered with knowledge aforethought for the purpose of invading numerous sovereign nations to exploit natural resources?

      <p>
       The morning of the 12th of September this year, you forward any news or information of any form of 'terror attack' which occurred the day before to my inbox, and then we'll see who's been over reacting.

       No, no one is saying "YES! WE ARE GOING TO HAVE AN ATTACK! EVERYBODY HIIIIIIDE!" It's just the possibility of there being one, just like any other day, except 9/11 has a higher probability of there being one. Do you get it? Or is it too hard?

       Look, there's not a moment when I watch footage of 9/11 where I don't shed a tear, but posts like this, in my opinion, create an unnecessary 're-kindling' of fear and anxiety. Discuss about this as you please, I just find it to be a silly thread.

       Massive fear hype with no event.
      </p>
      <p>
       The intended effect of terrorism is fear.  All the media has to do is remind everyone of 9/11 and that should do the job.  Don't be surprised if Obama's approval ratings go up for a couple of days.

       I think this is probable. that nothing will happen. I think that if something does happen it will reinforce the opposition and do more damage than good for the US Government as a whole. That being said, my wife and I have taken the day off from work.

       I think we'll just see the predictable: politicians, pundits, news anchors, and other assorted bullshitters carrying on about what a tragic event it was, and generally reinforcing all the propaganda that we've been subjected to since that September day.  Terrorism this, terrorism that.  Yada yada yada.  So on and so forth.  Et cetera et cetera.

       2006 Sears Tower bombers; a gaggle of young, clueless and homeless black men squatting in an abandoned Miami warehouse. The FBI entrapped them with shoes, cash, and the promise of an apartment, then trumped them up as a paramilitary Al Queda
       <em>
        terror cell
       </em>
       operating a plot to bomb the Sears Tower out of a Miami
       <em>
        compound.
       </em>
       It more-or-less blew up in their face, in the blue states anyway, with one of the FBI agents involved eventually stating the young men were only going along for the  compensation, and had no intention or ability to bomb anything. They still burned though; mission accomplished!

       I will go out on a sensationalist limb. A nuke is going to go off in Chicago, Detroit, L.A. or New York. The attack will be blamed on Gaddafi, the bomb will be of Isreali origin however, no one will mention this in the news. Gaddafi will have exacted his "revenge" before going into silence. Then we will relentlessly pursue another boogeyman for the next 10 years.

       I'm sure the sons of darkness are likely to be jazzed to do something on that day, and Bilderberg may have actually scheduled it, but ops is very likely to be pointing at the
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       unraveling 911 and shaking their heads at this point. People will not react the same way no matter how big they make the bomb this time; they need a new terrror solution, and soon. I don't think they have it yet; but they will eventually
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to do something to goose the terror before too many people wake up. I don't see how they can let 11/11/11 go by without some kind of substantial sacrifice, it is a number of godlike power. If the sons of darkness grow impatient through astrology and force an ill prepared government's hand, the resulting fiasco could be the break that will shed the light of day on the puppetmasters long before the slow-but-inevitable 911 revelations do.

       I'm not really sure. Most of me has the suspicion that something big and distracting will happen that makes the outcome irrelevant and forgotten. If that doesn't happen, I'm hoping it will all go well and open a lot of people's minds.

       ) because that doesn't exist. Confirmation bias is looking for information with which you agree. This is predicting... I understand there's a clique of anti-semitic idiots that believe in the government-created, fake Jewish conspiracy that's meant to make us look bad and get people to stop looking at issues like this, but the vast majority of us don't.

       Too obvious for a 'small' group of people ... but for the MASSES is not. When i say masses i'm refering to those that can't breath without their morning,mid-day and evening news.

       2006 Sears Tower bombers; a gaggle of young, clueless and homeless black men squatting in an abandoned Miami warehouse. The FBI entrapped them with shoes, cash, and the promise of an apartment, then trumped them up as a paramilitary Al Queda
       <em>
        terror cell
       </em>
       operating a plot to bomb the Sears Tower out of a Miami
       <em>
        compound.
       </em>
       It more-or-less blew up in their face, in the blue states anyway, with one of the FBI agents involved eventually stating the young men were only going along for the  compensation, and had no intention or ability to bomb anything. They still burned though; mission accomplished!
