My thoughts were they would do this (false flag of course) causing people to panic and allowing another tightening down on rights, TSA agents on all public transit, etc. I do think if that was the case, people WOULD see through it this time and rebel, but would it be too late? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that as people become more aware, they are prone to questioning the legitimacy of any attack, and I think it&#39;s pretty clear that people are recognizing the propaganda/misinformation machine. There are also people that are more skeptical than they are willing to publicly admit, and as their friends and neighbors start to &quot;come out&quot; so will they. I believe we have evidence of this right here on Reddit, as I&#39;ve noticed a drastic change in the tone of posts in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, the topics of articles linked, and interestingly, posts from alternative news sources with very high amounts of upvotes and not a whole lot of comments. Obviously this is anecdotal at best but I think we can all agree to some extend that posts that would typically only upvoted in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are now getting attention from the hivemind in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>.</p>

<p>Clearly, the intelligence agencies monitor sites like Reddit, and if a government conspiracy of this type does in fact exist (I couldn&#39;t tell you yes or no), and I were running the show, I would be a little nervous and careful about my next move. I think that&#39;s why we are hearing a lot about &quot;disclosure&quot; (lol) now because there&#39;s going to need to be a drastic false flag unlike we&#39;ve ever seen, in order to keep those friends and neighbors on the other side of the fence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This comes off as arrogant to me. I said aware, not awake. I will contend that none of us are truly awake, but people with always have varying degrees of skepticism, which is fluid, and can change dramatically based on outside stimulus and personal experience. Awareness comes in degrees, while awake vs. asleep is either a. or b., and I think looking at the situation in black and white is as narrow-minded as the &quot;asleep&quot; ones that you would be so quick to criticize.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve explained my view of awareness, and would love to hear what you mean by &quot;awake.&quot; By the context of your post and your smug, arrogant approach to responding to me is evidence to me that you are someone who has mistaken himself for being &quot;awake,&quot; much like a religious fanatic will claim he has understanding of the world, but is still following beliefs that originated 2,3,4 thousand years ago. My point is that you will never be &quot;awake&quot; until you realize how little you actually understand about the world and the events therein. This all starts when you begin saying &quot;I believe&quot; something to be true, rather than just passing it off as a fact.</p>

<p>I have no idea where you got your numbers from but they&#39;re nonsense. It also takes only a small number of people (like 15%) to create a tipping point for an evolution in thoughts and beliefs. Like I said above, as people&#39;s friends and neighbors become more aware, so will they.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there are always multiple angles to any story and therefore nobody knows the truth of 9/11, and most likely nobody will ever get the full story. The 3k+ people that knew the story the best are already dead. </p>

<p>Finally, we all have a vested interest in uncovering lies and not allowing ourselves to be deceived. We need everyone to begin thinking for themselves, by throwing fuel on their tiny internal flames of skepticism. Most people won&#39;t fuel the fire themselves, and it&#39;s the people that they learn from and respect that cause that fire to grow. An overbearing amount of fuel can retard the fire as well though, so it needs to be approached gradually, as people&#39;s minds are finicky like that fire. Be someone who throws just the right amount of fuel at just the right time, instead of someone who neglects the fire altogether, or conversely who tries to fuel it too quickly. Please have compassion and empathy for people, the skeptic&#39;s fire is much more prominent resilient than you may realize.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure the sons of darkness are likely to be jazzed to do something on that day, and Bilderberg may have actually scheduled it, but ops is very likely to be pointing at the <em>still</em> unraveling 911 and shaking their heads at this point. People will not react the same way no matter how big they make the bomb this time; they need a new terrror solution, and soon. I don&#39;t think they have it yet; but they will eventually <em>have</em> to do something to goose the terror before too many people wake up. I don&#39;t see how they can let 11/11/11 go by without some kind of substantial sacrifice, it is a number of godlike power. If the sons of darkness grow impatient through astrology and force an ill prepared government&#39;s hand, the resulting fiasco could be the break that will shed the light of day on the puppetmasters long before the slow-but-inevitable 911 revelations do.</p>
