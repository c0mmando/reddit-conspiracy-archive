        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m watching the Packers/Saints game and a &quot;special report&quot; comes on. Shocker, they are talking about &quot;good information&quot; about a &quot;threat&quot; to go along with the ten year anniversary of 9/11. Of course then he goes on to say that the story wasn&#39;t corroborated and that it is unconfirmed. They just said that it is &quot;credible&quot; but &quot;uncomfirmed&quot; and &quot;lacks credibility but should be taken seriously.&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe there is going to be an attack. You&#39;d be stupid to believe that. I was totally expecting this though. They&#39;ve been hyping the ten year anniversary around here and it&#39;s the perfect chance to scare people again. The press conference that&#39;s going on right now is literally just saying &quot;Yeah we heard there might be something happening, like we say around every holiday because terrorists hate us. We don&#39;t have anything confirmed but we should tell you guys anyway just because we like scaring you. Oh, but we&#39;ll still ride the subway and go about our lives. You should too without worrying. But you should totally remember that there are terrorists who hate you, because you&#39;re Americans, and fuck you.&quot;</p>

<p>Ugh. </p>

<p>Edit: Is this airing anywhere outside of the NYC market?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True.. but I think it&#39;s the way the calling out is done. Someone with some prominence and sanity needs to pose the right questions. I hate to lift ideas form film, but maybe like a They Live kind of thing..wake people up. It&#39;s certainly worth a shot if you do it right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly at this point I don&#39;t think it would be so obvious. They&#39;ve done this scare tactic bullshit so much. How many tips about &quot;men using truck bombs in NYC&quot; threats have we heard about since 9/11? They just do this to keep people in check. When/if something like a false flag event happens it&#39;ll be random so no one expects it. This thing that happened today is just out there to scare people and make the government look competent when they say they kept us safe next week after nothing happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right! Some big threat (announced now) gets thwarted at the 11th hour and credited to &quot;Homeland Security&quot; for stopping the &quot;terrorist attack&quot;.. All of the same jargon and much of the same storyline as all of these other thwarted &quot;attacks&quot;. And what&#39;s really sad, is that there are better plot-lines in 80s porn. I mean, what moron came up with the &#39;Underwear Bomber&quot; thing? OOO! Christmas isn&#39;t even safe!! But we sure got him though! Swordfighhtt!!</p>

<p>Thus, on the anniversary of 9/11, you need a bigger, more scary setup. Reinforce that fear and apprehension!</p>

They said something along the lines (don&#39;t remember exactly) that 4 alleged &quot;terrorists&quot; entered the country like 6 months ago with plans to attack a major city(no shit) on the anniversary  with bomb strapped trucks. And they went to mention how 3 or 4  trucks have gone missing in NYC or Washington. bunch of horse shit if you ask me</p>
