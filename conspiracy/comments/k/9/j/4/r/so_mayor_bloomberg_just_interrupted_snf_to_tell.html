       I'm watching the Packers/Saints game and a "special report" comes on. Shocker, they are talking about "good information" about a "threat" to go along with the ten year anniversary of 9/11. Of course then he goes on to say that the story wasn't corroborated and that it is unconfirmed. They just said that it is "credible" but "uncomfirmed" and "lacks credibility but should be taken seriously."
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe there is going to be an attack. You'd be stupid to believe that. I was totally expecting this though. They've been hyping the ten year anniversary around here and it's the perfect chance to scare people again. The press conference that's going on right now is literally just saying "Yeah we heard there might be something happening, like we say around every holiday because terrorists hate us. We don't have anything confirmed but we should tell you guys anyway just because we like scaring you. Oh, but we'll still ride the subway and go about our lives. You should too without worrying. But you should totally remember that there are terrorists who hate you, because you're Americans, and fuck you."

       Groooannn.. Good lord, these assholes are so predictable. Every ten years they're gonna ramp up this terrorism bullshit..every ten years we the sheeple will put up with it. I don't know what's more pathetic, the constant fearmongering or the fact that no one has called them out.

       True.. but I think it's the way the calling out is done. Someone with some prominence and sanity needs to pose the right questions. I hate to lift ideas form film, but maybe like a They Live kind of thing..wake people up. It's certainly worth a shot if you do it right.

       Don't put it past them to kill another 3,000 + people to keep the war machine running and continue to turn this country into a police state. 3 trillion for 3,000 lives of people they didn't know. That comes out to $1,000,000,000 per person. There are people in my city that would kill someone for a $25 rock. Seems plausible.

       I wouldn't put it past them to try and sell us on the Easter Bunny being not only real, but able to produce videos and found to be anti-American and Muslim! And the sad thing is, we'd probably believe that too!

       Honestly at this point I don't think it would be so obvious. They've done this scare tactic bullshit so much. How many tips about "men using truck bombs in NYC" threats have we heard about since 9/11? They just do this to keep people in check. When/if something like a false flag event happens it'll be random so no one expects it. This thing that happened today is just out there to scare people and make the government look competent when they say they kept us safe next week after nothing happens.

       Right! Some big threat (announced now) gets thwarted at the 11th hour and credited to "Homeland Security" for stopping the "terrorist attack".. All of the same jargon and much of the same storyline as all of these other thwarted "attacks". And what's really sad, is that there are better plot-lines in 80s porn. I mean, what moron came up with the 'Underwear Bomber" thing? OOO! Christmas isn't even safe!! But we sure got him though! Swordfighhtt!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, on the anniversary of 9/11, you need a bigger, more scary setup. Reinforce that fear and apprehension!

       Saw something similar on my local "news" station earlier today. They said something along the lines (don't remember exactly) that 4 alleged "terrorists" entered the country like 6 months ago with plans to attack a major city(no shit) on the anniversary  with bomb strapped trucks. And they went to mention how 3 or 4  trucks have gone missing in NYC or Washington. bunch of horse shit if you ask me

       I watched the entire video and I noticed he said they were going to run drills tomorrow (Meaning Friday 9/9/11) they would be taking place in Grand Central Station as well as Times Square.... they were running drills on 9/11 for the very scenario that happened, they also ran drills on 7/7 for exactly what happened and they also ran drills on the day of the Oslo shooting/bombing.

       If you google 9/11 drills, or 7/7 drills, or oslo attack drills. You'll find plenty of websites on the top that prove it.

       Mhm. It was him, the police chief, and some other lady. They eventually put the game on but with no audio and had the press conference play over it. Then they stopped five minutes in and threw the Q&amp;A section of the conference onto NBC New York's website.

       Even though I now the chances are low, and that it is most likely just capitalizing on our fears, I still don't feel comfortable living directly next to the Stock Exchange on Wall st. Oh and the Federal reserve is one block away, and so is ground zero. FML

       I'm not surprised. Bloomberg would never pass up a chance to be on tv. Hes probably pushing this bs to make up for the fact that he over reacted to the hurricane last month. The midget is probably working on setting up his fourth election. Mike Bloomberg mayor for life of NYC.
