       I used to be a fan of Alex Jones, particularly of his doomy predictions. Eventually I became more moderate and began to realize: I WANTED all that shit to happen. Economic collapse, hell yeah! Martial law, bring it on! Anything to escape the daily reality of being stuck as nobody in a meaningless existence.

       Alex Jones is a sanctioned banner under which the dissidents can gather to be easily identified. The best way to discredit legitimate voices of change and reason are to lump them together with other more radical (and often demonstrably false) demigods that are either seeking power for it's own sake or are disinfo agents themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take content that you are concerned about and mix it up with a lot of surrounding bullshit, and you have successfully reduced the perceived legitimacy of the actual legitimate information on the channel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Classic conintelpro. The fact that he rails against this very mechanism of disinfo dissemination is ironic but typical in the FOX/Republican/1984 doublespeak trending. Alex accuses others of what he himself is doing. Same as the closet gay republican railing so vehemently against gays.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are lots of good information sources these days. Alex Jones and Prison Planet are not among them. The signal to noise ratio is far too low and the good information on the channel is often distorted beyond all reason.

       Personally I don't follow or even click on links to Alex Jones, Prison Planet, Infowars, etc.  I doubt Jones is a disinfo agent and suspect he's just a large ego who's found a niche to satisfy his desire for fame and a paycheck...but again, I don't really know or care.

       High-profile sites like these often serve as gateways for people just opening up to the non-MSM view of the world.  So it's easy to criticize their lack of responsible journalism.  But it's each individual's responsibility and need to learn how to think for themselves, and to separate the wheat from the chaff, the BS from the Shinola, the 'truthiness' from the Truth.  So in that sense such sites are actually very useful, aren't they?  Like a freshman 101 course.  If you can pass this, you can move on to more advanced studies, right?

       I hear what you are saying and there is undoubtedly some truth to it, but I still say it is far better to start with better information sources than it is to learn how to sniff out the bullshit on sites like PP.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said though, everyone has to start learning how to effectively discern and to separate the wheat from the chaff at some point.

       There's a distinction to be made here. Many listeners of Alex Jones (myself included) do indeed want the collapse of the present society, but we also want a return to respect for human rights, freedoms and the rule of law (as opposed to fiat rule, which is increasingly what we now have). We want the present Federal Reserve to collapse, but we want a return to a money standard that will retain value and remove inflation.

       A collapse of any system will find those cast from high to low utilizing what resources they have left to cause chaos that mirrors what they feel as a result of being cast out of power.
      </p>
      <p>
       While a restructuring of society is preferred to building on top of the current rotten foundation, we must also prepare and inform about the actual collapse stage.

       I'd hate to see the suffering it would cause, but i'm in a town where every fucking kid, every mother is spoiled rotten. Everyone tries to outdo everyone else, and talks about them behind their back when they can't outdo them.
Fathers are workers and wallets, sometimes standing out, but mostly just that. I work odd hours, and sometimes do the duty of kid pick up and drop off... it's disgusting, I'm treated like a pedo, I can see the disdain in the mom's eyes. Why? I don't know.
People believe that three skyskrapers fell into their own footprints perfectly from very little fire.
Society does need a reboot.

       Our government kills 3000 of us in a matter of hours and our system doesn't need a reboot?
      </p>
      <p>
       I never said my kids were spoiled, I make them work for what they want. My SO and I are perfectly happy, it just bothers us how spoiled our well to do neighbors are. They pray to god and complain to their friends, but live in air conditioned homes with stocked fridges.

       Here is the thing. The people who created this system are not stupid. I guarantee you that they are planning the next move anticipating the crash.
      </p>
      <p>
       The longer they bandaid the problem the more time they have to refine a new system. I'm of the mind set we need to help the crash in some way. Though I'm unsure how.

       All you can do is withdraw your support for the system you find so unfulfilling, and give it to a way of life which is more sane and rational.  Get rid of all debt (&amp; stop imagining 'collapse' will miraculously absolve you of it!).  Buy natural, unadulterated foods directly from farmers and producers.  Don't justify working for a large corporation because "you have to have a job &amp; benefits".  Don't spend your money on unnecessary shit from stores &amp; businesses outside your community.  Learn to grow things, repair things, reduce your consumption of energy, get away from urban or suburban (i.e. expensive) centers that can't support disruptions in their transportation-centric supply-line infrastructure.  Etc. etc. etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are all difficult transitions to make, but they have to be made.  Plus, as you walk this path you will actually begin to feel your life slow down, open up, and you'll be more in touch with your unique human experience.

       Google Alex jones Zionist and you will see what he means. I have heard it straight from the horses mouth. He supports Israel. Whether or not he is a Zionist, is debatable. Supporting the idea that Israel has a right to exist is not Zionism, but that it must exist at any cost in order to fufill biblical prophecy, now that is Zionism.

       Jones's latest statement, a couple of days ago, is that he is "allergic" to Israel. This his word, allergic. He doesn't want to talk about Israel either from a pro or con position. I think he's just afraid of the Jews. Can't really blame him, they can be vicious to anybody who criticizes them.

       It's what he's NOT doing that pegs him a Zionist. Zionism has a definite hand in what's happening in the world, but it remains the ONE THING Jones  refuses to discuss at length.

       Why do you think it's so 'obvious shit will eventually go sour'? At what time in history has there not been atrocious activities by the government, natural disasters, and wars between human beings? You can achieve societal reformation without a total collapse. The people who sell this material are just as guilty as being slanted as the media they criticize. It is shortsighted and is rarely deeply rooted in historical fact, and it only disrupts the ability to facilitate transition to a more globally conscious society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex Jones &amp; Co keeping people angry and fearful at everyday events and at the government is terribly detrimental if we want to see any progress in true reform. It only offers a defeatist attitude. It has no light at the end of the tunnel and no plan beyond "prepare for the worst, it's coming!"

       This is different. This collapse isn't going to be an accident, they have a plan, and they are waiting with baited breath. Attitudes like yours are what allows these people to do what they please behind closed doors because you and your like minded bretheren will continue to defend them. Maybe we are crazy, but let's just say hypothetically, that the government was taken over by some criminal organization, would it be obvious? Would all of our perceptions of "freedom" remain the same? Would they advertise that they were criminals, or would they work in the shadows until it's too late and they have walled themselves in to the whitehouse? How long would it take for a nay-saying public to catch on? Or would they? Government operates in much the same way as organized crime so differentiating the two can sometimes be difficult. Just some food for thought.

       , IF and only if those who are still vested in it are able to slowly ride it into the ground. However, if anything like, oh I don't know AN IRANIAN OIL BOURSE were to form unhindered, that would expedite the process.

       This would be the Alex Jones fan in a nutshell. There's plenty of sources for truth out there, INCLUDING THE MSM, if you know how to see the fjnords and affix your third eye properly. Jones is a clown that gives the middle finger to the Wizard Of Oz with the hand you see, and accepts his paycheck with the hand you don't.

       Our society is a wreck and corrupt to the core. Anything short of financial collapse is not going to fix it.

       Alex Jones is part Baptist fire-and-brimstone preacher, part car salesman, and part talking-head.  Note the sound effects when the B-roll starts . . . it's brilliantly orchestrated fear-mongering.  Anything to alleviate the malaise, the meaninglessness, of most of his fans' lives.

       Some people are not ready for the massive amount of info Alex provides.
It's kinda sad you weren't able to separate reality from entertainment.
Meaningless existence? Sounds like a white person problem.

       It is a white person problem, but that doesn't make it any more real. However, it's also the problem of all people who grew up in civilization. The Chinese workers in the iPod factory feel the same way.

       I like how OP has attempted to psychoanalyze a bunch of strangers based on his on struggles with being a nobody stuck in a meaningless existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't listen to Alex Jones on a regular basis, but when I do, it's typically because he's the first or only person talking about some crazy new theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that crazy theories are interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, in 100 years, 99.9% of the people alive will have led a
       <em>
        meaningless existence
       </em>
       , get over it, it's certainly not Alex Jones' fault, or his listeners.  Do the things you enjoy doing and enjoy your life, a whole lot of people didn't turn out to be Einstein or Plato.

       A collapse of any system will find those cast from high to low utilizing what resources they have left to cause chaos that mirrors what they feel as a result of being cast out of power.
      </p>
      <p>
       While a restructuring of society is preferred to building on top of the current rotten foundation, we must also prepare and inform about the actual collapse stage.
