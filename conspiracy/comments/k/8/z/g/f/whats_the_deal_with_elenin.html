<p>There&#39;s NASA telling us it&#39;s breaking up and small etc, there&#39;s amateur astronomers telling us its got a huge magnetic field, that it has <em>not</em> broken up, and some claiming it&#39;s much more massive than NASA tells us, some videos going on about Mayan calendars etc, and so on and so forth.  A lot of talk about brown dwarf stars, some pics of supposed UFOs, Russian news casts claiming it&#39;s an intelligently controlled object, etc.  There&#39;s claims that we&#39;ll experience 3 days of darkness, some claiming the object will swell as it orbits the sun, emerging from behind it much larger than before, there are some claims that <em>we&#39;re</em> orbiting Elenin even!</p>

<p>There&#39;s scientific paper claiming earthquakes are directly linked to it, and that he can predict future quakes based on it, and that suggests it&#39;s much larger than NASA says according to some videos.</p>

<p>With all this conflicting information, I&#39;m getting confused.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Too slow, too dim, too angular; coming from the wrong place at the wrong angle; didn&#39;t develop a coma at the right time; two unknown objects flanking it at a distance; seems to be <em>towing</em> a large asteroid; looked like it exploded and lost its coma, but is back with full coma now, the explosion apparently being a <em>turn</em>; a tetrahedron was seen to form around it at moment it turned; the sun has grown more active as Elenin approaches it, its flares packing more punch than is normal. This is clearly no ordinary comet, but that does not necessarily mean it brings catastrophe for earth.</p>

<p>But even more troubling is NASA&#39;s strange behavior about it: Treating it, and in fact all recent comets, as a non-event when they used to promote astronomy by exposing comets heavily in the media; they don&#39;t promote astronomy at all now; nothing but lo-res images of Elenin despite their demonstrated ability to get hi-res images; suddenly shutting down SECCHI when their claim that Elenin exploded was contra-indicated on YouTube, and the image resolution greatly reduced when it came back online so nobody can see anymore what happened; saying the comet is not blue, and altering hue and saturation to make it appear not blue, but now amateurs can see it&#39;s blue.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t go into all the spooky tie-ins between Elenin and movies such as <em>Deep Impact</em> and <em>Knowing</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the correct answer people.</p>

<p>It is utterly ridiculous to suggest that this comet could be causing earthquakes etc on earth.</p>

<p>The comet &quot;changed direction&quot; because guess what, objects in orbit are <strong>constantly</strong> changing direction, that&#39;s what makes their motion circular / eliptical.</p>

<p>There is nothing magically unique about Elenin, it poses no threat to us and is pretty much a non-event for 99% of the population. </p>

<p>If you want to get excited about comet / asteroid doomsday scenarios take a look at comet Honda which is larger and is set to pass much much closer than Elenin and there actually is REAL potential for an impact scenario. You&#39;ll have to wait a few years for this one though.</p>

<p>The 2017 trajectory cannot be accurately mapped. There is a chance of impact in 2017 and also 2036 if memory serves me correct.</p>

<p>Not sure what chance of impact exactly, but its non-zero unlike Elenin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Less than a minute in, and I can give you a solid answer: No, his science is not correct. Celestial alignments don&#39;t &#39;amplify&#39; anything, not gravity, not &#39;energy&#39; of any kind. Gravity doesn&#39;t work that way. Even if it did, elenin is too small to have any effect. Your car would have a far greater effect on Earth&#39;s gravity than Elenin ever will, its closest approach to earth brings it no closer to us than Venus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t remember the source, but when I was looking into the whole &quot;elenin is causing earthquakes&quot; thing I came across a major discrepancy with that theory.  Yes, there where a lot of earth quakes that mapped to an alignment with elenin.  But the problem is, at those distances elenin would have had to of been much more massive than what elenin is claimed to be to have an geological effect on earth, tying into the brown dwarf theory.  </p>

<p>Keep in mind earth quakes happen every single day, but that aside I realized there was a huge problem with that theory...if elenin is as large as it would need to be to cause quakes then it&#39;s trajectory would be vastly different, which means the alignments wouldn&#39;t align anymore.  </p>

<p>So either elenin is massive and the published orbit is bullshit and no such alignments exist, or the published orbit and projected mass is correct and is a zero risk for impact.  It&#39;s one or the other. </p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;m more worried about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaW4Ol3_M1o">Apothis</a>.</p>

<p>But yeah, aliens and space ships presents a much more complicated conspiracy theory. </p>
