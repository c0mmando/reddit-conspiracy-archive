       The simulations were at 1:15 scale and they treated the engine and wings as rigid objects - claiming that they would pass through the steel walls of the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       The simulation cuts off when the plane hits the core columns, leaving us to imagine how the plane went through the entire building without seemingly losing speed, deforming, losing engines - and out the other side as seen on 'live' TV.

       The simulations will show anything you want if you feed them the right input.  Unfortunately the simulation input file is secret because letting you have it would endanger your security.  really.
      </p>
      <p>
       MIT did the finite element analysis simulation mentioned.  I believe with NIST.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO it's a crock.  Nobody else can even evaluate the applicability of the model independently , so it's of no use to anyone.

       Didn't you watch the TV? It did go through the steel of the outer walls.

       However in terms of the collapse I'm talking about the simulations showing how the cut structural elements and the weakened ones eventually failed to cover the static load, and went through a progressive collapse.

       Interesting how the data inputs for the NIST report on Building 7 are classified. You will just have to take their word, no independent analysis or peer-review has or will be done. The FEMA report on WTC1&amp;2 ends and the moment the collapse begins and no explanation is given for the collapse event itself.  It's easy to simulate building collapse progression when you start with a conclusion and build the inputs and filter the data to fit the result. That's science!...right?

       Ok,  perhaps we are getting off topic here.  The topic is a request for a simulation that proves that a plane could NOT bring down the towers.

        There isn't one
       </strong>
       , because the numerous other simulations that were run
       <strong>
        DID
       </strong>
       prove that a plane can  (and DID) bring down a tower.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have a simulation video that proves a plane CAN NOT bring down a tower,  by all means, please post that link. Until then, your speculation and posting of various forums highlighting NIST denying WTC7 data doesn't seem to be on track with this particular thread.

       you don't need a simulation even.  there have been enough crash tests to prove that the plane could not slice through steel like butter.

       But... this thread is asking if it is possible to run a computer simulation  so that it can prove that a plane couldn't.   Where is your simulation link?
      </p>
      <p>
       The damage to the structure of the columns has been thoroughly discussed, fact checked, and the "no way-ers" always seem to come up short with evidence.  In this thread I provided a link that simulates how a plane can knock out supporting columns.   There were numerous other simulations that indicated that a plane can in fact do that damage.   There are
       <strong>
        0
       </strong>
       simulations that prove or even support the opposite.

       It is possible, and it is/has been done.   The best thing would be to test crashing a real replica of the airplane into a steel frame structure replica of WTC at the same speed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can already see the wings and engine go flying and the nose crush and plane flip violently as it encounters the steel frame at 400mph.  No way a non-crash rated aluminum can cuts through steel like butter.  I've never seen that in any real life test.

       An airplane the size of a Boeing 767 that weighs ~390,000 lb travelling at nearly 600 mph will cause a lot of damage.  Take a college level physics course and get back to us after you understand the relationship between speed and mass in a basic kinematics equation.  Having said that, there is definitely a large part of the 'official story' that doesn't add up, but it's not the collapse of the twin towers.  WTC7 is the huge WTF in my understanding.

       I think it is the collapse. There are three factors that describe the equation of motion of the mass of falling floors if one subscribes to the pancake collapse theory.  1.  Acceleration due to gravity. 2. Conservation of momentum, and 3. Deceleration due to damping. If a group of floors fell from above and collapsed once floor at a time, adding to the main falling body as it fell each floor, the body would both accelerate and it would slow down, since the momentum remains constant yet the falling mass progressively adds more mass.  So those are two things that can be modeled, provided access to reliable information regarding the mass of each floor of the WTC.  The floors were lighter as they went up, so it's not as simple a calculation as it seems.  Next, reliable information is needed on how the floors reportedly failed once right after the other.  This is needed to calculate the level of damping produced by each floor, which would slow down the velocity of the fall to some degree.  Is it 5%? 1%?  It cannot be zero, because that is complete free fall.  However, without all the diagrams to calculate a failure mode, we can only speculate on the damping produced and test various values it into the said model.  With this we can calculate the time to fall completely.  That being said, I've produced such a model in MATLAB, and can see that even a slight amount of damping (1,2%) changes the final time to collapse by several seconds.  This is simply due to the many number of floors that had to fail as the towers failed.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, this is assuming a pancake collapse.  We can be seen from this kind of model is that in order for the building to collapse at the speed it did, damping would have had to be really low or eliminated, ie. the floor fell from beneath rather than progressively.

       The floor falling from beneath is completely contrary to the "official story".  According to a quick google search, the South tower fell in roughly ~9 seconds which would put it at nearly free fall speeds, which calls the pancake theory into extreme doubt.  I hypothesize that there must have been a bomb or multiple bombs below the impact zone in order to account for the missing seconds in the collapse of the South tower, which would put it into direct contradiction to the official explanation. I am saddened that scientific examination has become politicized and dogmatic in the past 10 years, I am afraid to ask questions.

       Not disputing your knowledge or education, but if you watch the video/look up construction of the WTC's and understand how they were designed you will realize that the buildings were very structurally sound, and in fact they designed them to withstand an aircraft crashing into them.

       in case of structural failure in the core or outer wall, the weight of the failing columns is re-distributed, via the hat truss to the other columns.

       The towers were designed to absorb the impact of a Boeing 707 travelling at ~180mph lost in the fog looking for their landing zone, like the B-25 bomber that mistakenly flew into the Empire State Building in 1945.  The building's designers never contemplated that a similarly large airplane to the Boeing 707 would be flying at full throttle intentionally aiming for the structurally weakest point in the towers.
      </p>
      <p>
       F=M*A, that is Force applied is directly proportional to the mass of the travelling object multiplied by the acceleration of said object.  Acceleration is calculated by the amount that velocity changes of the time that transpired during said event.
      </p>
      <p>
       In layman's terms, without several college level math and science course, the amount of force applied at impact is roughly quadrupled every time that speed doubles. Ergo, an airplane of similar mass to a Boeing 707 travelling at 600mph, will apply a force roughly 60 times more intense than the force that the designers of the WTC had in mind when they built the building.

       Im no physicist and I cant really dispute all this stuff completely but, from my understanding of the design it just doesnt seem plausible. The outer wall and inner core were both connected with each other from the top of the building, via the hat truss. So, if the entire outer wall was destroyed it would still be connected to the hat truss, and thus connected to the inner core, distributing the weight. And also vice versa, the entire inner core could have been destroyed at a point, but, it too would still be connected to the outer wall via the hat truss. So in order for a collapse to even begin to take place you would have to completely sever both the inner core and the outer wall on all sides and areas for there to be zero support.

       I wish that we had the complete model because as I run through the very rough calculations here in front of my computer I am losing faith in my hypothesis. The problem is that there are no
       <em>
        hard
       </em>
       records.  Even the video tape of the collapse is shrouded by dust and debris and makes an accurate model nearly impossible.

       There were no 767s flown into anything on 9/11. All four of the planes were 757s; medium haul continental aircraft that were essentially surplus and could be had cheaply by anyone needing to pick up some planes. The top speed of a 757 is around 375 mph at cruising altitude. The speed at impact was about 180 mph because that is the speed limit for the aircraft at the altitude of the hits. See the Boeing site for details of the 757.

       Look up the 9/11 commision report. It's right there. Have you never seen a video of the planes hitting the buildings? Have you never seen a 767? A 767 has 4 engines while a 757 has 2. Count the engines. They were 757s and they were moving slowly. End of story.

       I don't believe the official story.  That being said, regarding the aluminum case you make, you have to deal with the argument that it's not just the aluminum wings that strike the building... it is a wing filled with jet fuel.  This is sort of the difference between the impact of an empty can of beer and a filled can of beer.  Obviously, the filled one will cause more damage.

       The only thing I can say is, get a copy of COMSOL and play around with it and do your own simulations with the speed and size of a 747 hitting steel beams similar to those on the WTC.  Everything else is just speculation...  A copy of COMSOL runs around $10,000.  But you may have better luck with mattys on the interwebs.  Or sign up for a free class in your city from their website and you'll get a totally legal and free copy with a license that lasts a few weeks :)

       and give them your info.  Just make up a company or something and request some more information regarding their software. They'll then start sending you email updates on free webinars and training in your city or one nearby.

       Seriously, all I can say is planes don't cut through steel like we saw on the videos.  They certainly have black boxes, and also don't leave explosive residue in the dust of buildings they don't hit next door.

       Yeah, I don't really think a wing filled with jet fuel would damage steel too much either, but I really can't trust my intuition if it the impact was at 600 or so mph.  The energy is 1/2 mv
       <sup>
        2,
       </sup>
       so there's a lot of m and a lot more v at 600 mph.  I really don't know, but I wonder how much damage it could do, simply because no one really thought that a piece of foam could damage the leading edge to the Space Shuttle either, when that happened.  It's the energy.  On the videos, I don't really know how fast they are going. I guess we can do a calculation of a wing cross sectional slug with all the fuel in its tank, and figure out what its momentum would be as it impacted a column...

       You can view the problem as a steel web of columns slamming into a stationary plane at the same speed.  600mph is too fast for the plane IMO.  I think estimates are 400-530mph, someone might have calculated from the video I can't recall.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case what do you think will get sliced, the wing or the steel wall.  Also, will the engines be knocked off, or pass through the steel?  I say the engines aren't rigidly attached to the plane and wouldn't go.    The MIT simulation I saw didn't convince me.

       Straw man.  What would possibly make you believe that they were "cut through like butter".  The steel beams that support a massive structure like the WTC don't need to be cleanly severed to topple the building, they just need to loose enough strength.

       It should be possible but the input data would never be 100% accurate.  Was the plane traveling at X at impact or .99999X.  Was the angle of attack Y degrees or .999999Y.  Did the steel mfg for the building have good quality control for all the input steel or was the steel produced by several different suppliers. etc etc etc

       Also the formulas for calculations would be different depending on what engineer you ask.  I work for a company that spends millions on engineering and the life calculations we use for our products are not the same as what our competitors use.  Smart people don't always agree about things.  Engineers even more so.

       There have been some graphic simulations using supercomputers that show HOW the crash happened, and speculate on fuel expansion, the resulting fire, etc., and seem conclusive on the fact a plane with such mass at such speed would likely slice thru beams up to a point inside the building like, well, we all saw on the videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for proving the fire could bring down the building... well, I imagine for it to be valid, a simulation of the building would have to include not just the structure and basic wall partitions but also provide for the complex electrical systems, lift engines, heating and kitchen fuel installations, not to mention all the flammable material and its' complex interactions... I doubt a simulation like that can be easy to implement on current hardware.

       Nope, because reality is that planes did bring down the buildings. Any accurate simulation would verify this objective reality, and the computer would then be accused of being a jesuit mason working for the NWO. BUY ALEX JONES' ATMOSPHERIC WATER GENERATOR WHILE SUPPLIES LAST!

       I wish that we had the complete model because as I run through the very rough calculations here in front of my computer I am losing faith in my hypothesis. The problem is that there are no
       <em>
        hard
       </em>
       records.  Even the video tape of the collapse is shrouded by dust and debris and makes an accurate model nearly impossible.
