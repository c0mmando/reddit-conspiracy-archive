        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ya know, from the new world order shit to 9/11 and everything else. It makes you question your reality to the fullest extent. And what if its true? What are we as a group of people suppose to do? Like its fairly obvious that there is a lot of fucked up shit going on in our world right now. Its just no one cares to even think about it because were all happy with our lives right at this moment. Weve all got a tv and internet and we can mostly do whatever we want and its awesome and we don&#39;t worry about anything outside of our immediate bubble.</p>

<p>But thats the problem we all sit at the computer and look up these articles about different conspiracies and talk about it and all this shit, but we don&#39;t really think about the true real reality of it, and how it will effect us. part of it is that we cant really be sure, it seems there is a giant disagreement towards all of this stuff that is posted, and in general. no one can come to a consensus ever, and everyone just always disagrees about everything else, and for whatever reason that it is i dont know. Maybe it is because that is how weve been conditioned in our worlds society, to always seek to be different than someone else, always disagree and to fight amongst ourselves, but in the end whats the worth, when we are all generally the same and just want the same things. </p>

<p>Anyway. what are we suppose to do about this in the real world. How do we apply ourselves to our communities and eventually the whole world to start making an actual difference. and though i feel we all care about this deeply, at least i do, i feel like there still is just a barrier, or a sort of filter that gets put up when we just see this on the internet and dont really apply it to our actual physical lives. Sometimes I feel like there is just too many people on this planet and its just the natural way that we would be so divided amongst ourselves in such a time.</p>

<p>Like we see the bad shit that happens everyday, but what do we do about it, what are we suppose to do about it? I really dont know, because sometimes it feels like the world is just destined to fuck itself over and then restart fresh, like it has in the past.</p>

<p>Sorry im drunk.</p>

I now read more, cherish learning new things and overall enjoy life more and more. Earth is a beautiful place, our minds are sacred...we just have to learn to stop polluting them...and people are divine...it&#39;s just when people gather in masses...shit gets weird and our primitive brains take over. Yea, just be more mindful. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is really the key, just be more mindful and aware of your own existence, body, and habits of perception.</p>

<p>the rest can be ridiculous intellectual masturbation that doesn&#39;t mean anything and doesn&#39;t float on any real proof (or perhaps it might have as much proof as the &quot;official&quot; story on anything).  i mostly lost my interest in following political conspiracy when someone tried to turn me onto the existence of giants based on evidence from the bible.  </p>

<p>shit happens, politicians are dicks, and what we can do about it is working to improve our ability to block out the things, paths, and ideas that we know are not good for us or our goals as tiny little human beings seeking happiness or whatever</p>

<p>fuck the intrigue, there&#39;s almost no way to tell what&#39;s real, just do your part and work for what you know to be good.  If it works for you and you become a happy, solid person, others will notice and some will start to follow your example.</p>

<p>or whatever</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea I agree. I plan to start preparing for extreme scenarios, soon. And every damn person should do the same. We should be taking our lives and future lives more seriously, we should all be prepared for the worst. And not because some conspiracy article or video on the internet said so, but because we should just be ready for anything that comes our way, and to realize that most anything is possible and that it is better to be prepared as best you can for these situations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where outside the US would you go? Who would let you live there?</p>

<p>Why do you think the Western societies will collapse before the developing world?</p>

<p>Who will come knocking on our doors?</p>

<p>Will a firearm and some ammunition really be enough to protect against agents of the state?</p>

<p>If you plan on planting your saved seeds on the open land, it will be very difficult to protect that land if urban dwellers flee the cities on mass looking for food. Would it make sense to have self-sufficient communities rather than be a self-sufficient individual (state of nature and all that).</p>

<p>Check out the American Pirate Party and see if they&#39;re in your area. I&#39;m planning on doing some work for them, perhaps an open voter registration guide with a clear breakdown of parties.</p>

<p>The barrier is a mental one. The epigenetics of our parents may be hurting us as a generation as well. But we need to use the internet to unite in a community, and guard against isolation, apathy, and hopelessness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I take out of all the stuff on /conspiracy is this: to be wary of lies, bullshit, agendas based on religion, patriotism, fear and xenophobia. To doubt and analyze the orders and interests of the authorities, of mass media, of anyone with a badge. To learn between the lines, to spot the patterns history shows, to try no to be fooled twice, or thrice, or n-times...</p>

<p>To be a skeptic, but not a wacko. To understand that more than millennial cults and aliens, the hidden masters are usually greed, lust, the hunger for power and the stupidity and incompetence masked as evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A prime example of in-fighting amongst whistleblowers was the heated argument a few years back between Alex Jones and Peter Joseph over some egocentric trivialities. Alex Jones, as most of you are aware, subscribes to Catholicism and Peter Joseph attacks Abrahamic religious institutions in his documentaries. What began as a civil discussion about the global elite quickly spiraled into a chest-beating contest ranging from ethics to semantics.</p>

<p>Alex Jones is good at exposure and being angry at corruption, but he isn&#39;t much of a leader or problem solver. Peter Joseph creates powerful presentations, but his agenda is not much different from a dystopian globalist&#39;s. I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is that the odds are stacked against us at this stage of information dissemination. We&#39;re in a build up period of an inevitable revolution. 10 years ago, Alex Jones hardly had an audience, but those numbers are multiplying. I only mention Alex Jones because Infowars is one of the major players at the forefront of the battle.</p>

<p>If you want to do your part, continue to educate as many people as you can. That&#39;s all any of us can do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GooNhOIMY0">Michio Kaku talk about the &quot;3 types of civilizations.&quot;</a>. He claims that we are essentially at a crossroads between transcending our current condition or facing our demise. Across the vast span of space and time, there could very well have been millions or billions of civilizations, not unlike us, that have all eventually reached the very same crossroads. Dr. Kaku claims that no civilization has ever advanced from type 0 civilization to type 1 (watch the video and you&#39;ll understand better). We are at the turning point in our civilization&#39;s history: either we move through it, or we perish and sadly, based on the evidence we have (no type 1, 2 or 3 civilizations) the latter is much more likely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh I didn&#39;t make that claim. I was responding to balefare&#39;s post. However I agree with your take on the issue. Kaku is obliviously a very intelligent man but when he goes on about &quot;oh the &quot;terrorist&quot; doesn&#39;t want a planetary civilization, blah, blah, blah.

    <div class="md"><p>We are conditioned to &quot;fight&quot; amongst ourselves, us &amp; them, red &amp; blue, black &amp; white, its the pointless ego that drummed into us all our lives, another example is you can state cold hard facts and still have some asshat come in and say &quot;well IMO&quot;.</p>

<p>No, fuck your opinion, facts are facts, if we&#39;re dealing with opinion you have a right to an opinion, if we&#39;re dealing with facts you bring facts to the table or fuck off!</p>

<p>But that&#39;s not the way it works, and everybody wants to have a say, even the &quot;awake&quot; are just another part of the &quot;control system&quot;, they all want to be in the X-files, want to be the guy that has all the answers, knows all the secrets.</p>

<p>The problem is that&#39;s where the &quot;fantasy&quot; ends, nobody want to do shit with this information because its dangerous, everybody is far too desperate to hang on to their little pile of scraps they&#39;ve managed to accumulate.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s basically it, we are born into a type of slavery few people will ever know exists, don&#39;t get me wrong, we&#39;re on the top end of the slave ladder, we obviously have it better than most, from the Indian kids making our clothes to the Chinese slaves that build out electrical devices or the Africans digging raw materials out of the ground with their bare hands.</p>

<p>As long as people are fat and &quot;entertained&quot; the sys will perpetuate itself, as long as they buy into the &quot;us &amp; them&quot; mentality we&#39;ll always be divided, a united man kind is the biggest fear of the corporate elite, it could end them all in an instant!</p>

<p>This is the world, it will change eventually but first people will have to accept what has to happen for these changes to occur, so far very few people are willing to accept or even acknowledge this cold hard truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are some people that have been in control for recorded history, and this is their game.   If you had any idea the type of abuse they do <em>to themselves</em> in order to maintain control you will quickly realize they are masters at this game. (hint, research svali).</p>

<p>So, the obvious question is why? And what can we do?  Well, to answer why - (I believe), they think they are guardians of this world.  It is their duty to provide a massively <em>unbalanced</em> world in order to help us achieve our goals.  How can this be?  Well, think ying / yang and polarity, because without it, you can&#39;t really have good &amp; bad.  Their job is to create as much negative as possible, in order for people to rise above it all and become equally positive.  But above all this, you begin to realize there really is no such thing as positive &amp; negative - it&#39;s really just a matter of perspective.  <em>Anything, anyone, anywhere</em> can be viewed as positive or negative just by changing your perspective.  </p>

<p>So that brings us to &quot;what you can do&quot;.  Well I believe the fight we are all fighting is just our ego lashing out on what we perceive as &#39;unfair&#39;, which is completely natural.  We can spend our lives trying to achieve fairness but it will never happen (look to history).  The real challenge is within, almost fractal in nature - and that is to become the best people we can be, from inside to outside.  Working on ourselves, becoming aware of our egos, challenging ourselves, growing, etc.  Everyone has different goals, so no use in pushing your own goals onto other people - it will certainly have a backlash effect.  These are all my own ideas, which make up my reality...so not everyone will see things as I see it, which is Okay.  For all the complaining we do about differences, remember what this world would be like if we were all the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I stopped watching TV a while ago, I use the internet to read this site, a few others like Instructables, and I stay outside much longer. I&#39;ve had preparedness kits ready for over a decade, and constantly upgrade them, and I bought a 4 wheel drive pick-up after trading in my useless sedan. Beyond that, I read more, exercise, practice growing and canning food, and then I start my day of work and teaching and playing with my kids. When you give up TV, useless vices (I still drink beer, have to have something!) you find time for things like this.
A disaster may never happen, but I don&#39;t want a double disaster by not being prepared for the first. Worry about you and yours, really. The world will have to come around on it&#39;s own. For years I had stomach pains and headaches because I worried about everyone and everything, but just take care of yourself, find your balance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find my zen with the Zeitgeist Movement. The idea of what they are fighting for... getting rid of money, it makes sense. If humanity could achieve that, we would eliminate most of corruption and put all our efforts into advancing as a species, as a thinking organism on a small planet trying to push the boundaries of technology and knowledge. Be all we can be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a war on you consciousness and what matters is the result.</p>

<p>Evolution didn&#39;t stop at simply your brain but still continues into your soul.</p>

<p>The Endgame isn&#39;t just an enslavement, the final <strong>endgame</strong> is the transformation of all humanity into devils or so they would want.</p>

<p>Do not scorn normal people because they don&#39;t know or how foolish and stupid they are.</p>

<p>Even in there mundane normal live they fight the war of hearts by facing there upheavals in there lives and doing what is right.</p>

<p>If you want to help, look at your own life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe I can help. </p>

<p>Number 1: Watch what you buy and why. There are subtleties to commercials that you can apply the principles of conspiracy-theories to, since all we want is the truth. One thing I realized last night, for instance, is that Progressive and Geico are probably owned by the same company. How did I reach this conclusion? I saw a commercial that said absolutely nothing about the product they were selling. Which means they don&#39;t have to &quot;sell&quot; it to you by telling you about their product. It&#39;s a monopoly, state-supported. All they have to do is get you to believe that one is better than the other. Doesn&#39;t matter which one. Watching what you buy and why will help you drop out of the game of materialism (&quot;money makes you happy&quot;), which is their keystone.</p>

<p>Number 2: Always be positive. The minute you think that you are powerless is a minute that they have power over you. We are all here together and we make the rules, not them. One of their primary tenets is that we&#39;ll do anything for money. And it keeps them running because they have so much of it. But we don&#39;t have to, and we never did have to ... do bad things for money. Dropping out of materialism is number 1, number 2 is that there&#39;s a world that we live in that has nothing to do with money (&quot;can&#39;t buy you love&quot;).</p>

<p>Number 3: Don&#39;t panic. Never panic. Panic makes it worse, always. Play chess to study how panic and anxiety affect your thought process. There is an order to the cosmos and not seeing it doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t there. In actual fact, over time, we gave them the power that they now have. Every time we listened to their threats or did terrible things for money. Maybe not you and me, per se, but <em>us</em> -- we did this. Let&#39;s not pretend that they&#39;re actually smarter than we are (they aren&#39;t).</p>

<p>... and get on with life and living. Living in the moment is the best thing for you, me, and them. You&#39;re not realistically going to drop everything, dedicate your life to WikiLeaks or Anon, but by living your life as best you can, you do more than you know (think positive).</p>
