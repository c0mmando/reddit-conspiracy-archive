    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t agree with a lot of Ron Paul&#39;s policies. His son, Rand, is a total fucking moron. But I do think Ron Paul is genuine. I think he&#39;s honest about what he believes and his voting record is consistent with that. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a fan of Dennis Kucinich personally, but he may lose his district in this upcoming election due to the awful redistricting.</p>

<p>Both of them I think know a lot more about what&#39;s going on, but they&#39;re both guarded enough so to still be part of the process (Kucinich more than Paul as Paul wasn&#39;t invited to his party&#39;s last convention and Kucinich was invited and gave his &quot;Wake up America Speech&quot; at his party&#39;s). </p>

<p>Still neither compare to former Senator Mike Gravel who radically stands up against the blatant lies from our government.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;With regard to the idea of whether you have a right to health care, you have realize what that implies,&quot; the senator [Rand Paul] said. &quot;It’s not an abstraction. I’m a physician. That means you have a right to come to my house and conscript me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It means you believe in slavery,&quot; Paul added. &quot;It means that you’re going to enslave not only me, but the janitor at my hospital, the person who cleans my office, the assistants who work in my office, the nurses.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I’m a physician in your community and you say you have a right to health care,&quot; Paul continued. &quot;You have a right to beat down my door with the police, escort me away and force me to take care of you? That’s ultimately what the right to free health care would be.&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>He&#39;s so far libertarian that he doesn&#39;t believe in the Civil Rights Act or The Americans with Disabilities Act and honestly believes that if these laws hadn&#39;t been put in place, public opinion and industry would have made exceptions for these on their own. </p>

<p>He tried to make up his own board certification for Ophthalmology because he didn&#39;t want to pay the official state review board. </p>

<p>In Rand Paul&#39;s perfect world, there would be no FDA, no EPA and industry would regulate themselves based on the demands of the people. Unfortunately that will never work because the majority of Americans are about as stupid and ignorant as he is. </p>

<p>One cannot learn from history is one refuses to acknowledge it.  It&#39;s kinda like skinning your knee.  If you don&#39;t look at your shoe laces and realize that you skinned your knee because you didn&#39;t tie your laces well.....you&#39;ll be forever skinning your knee and wondering why.</p>

<p>Good luck out there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Operation mockingbird controlled the media for years and was privatised after the church committee hearings, the same deception and ideology shifting propaganda continues today and most Americans will only think and do what they are instructed to take to the water coolers and make gospel.</p>

<p>Be clear they are 2 steps ahead of you and will &quot;lead all opposition to us&quot;.</p>

<p>The deception will remain while MOST american remain ignorant of all things outside Oprah and Walmart</p>

<p>America will be destroyed from within and blamed on others, out of the chaos will come order, but first a couple of generations will have to make sacrifices for a better humanity caused by this american ignorance.</p>

<p>Fool me once shame on you</p>

<p>Fool me twice shame on me</p>

<p>Fool me a 1000 times shame on americans</p>

<p>Ron Paul plays his role very well and is a sleeper designed for you to feel someone is on your side and will sort it out. Same as every other stooge you elect in the two party puppet show you call democracy</p>
