       Nope. I was already 30 in 1990. If you read the information below the video you will see sections of the video were recorded in different years. I have seen even earlier video of Ron Paul.

       Yes. My comment was aimed at you saying the video was from 1990, though more of it is from 1996. Your age at the time is irrelevant, as is the existence of earlier "Ron Paul videos."

       I don't agree with a lot of Ron Paul's policies. His son, Rand, is a total fucking moron. But I do think Ron Paul is genuine. I think he's honest about what he believes and his voting record is consistent with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a fan of Dennis Kucinich personally, but he may lose his district in this upcoming election due to the awful redistricting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both of them I think know a lot more about what's going on, but they're both guarded enough so to still be part of the process (Kucinich more than Paul as Paul wasn't invited to his party's last convention and Kucinich was invited and gave his "Wake up America Speech" at his party's).
      </p>
      <p>
       Still neither compare to former Senator Mike Gravel who radically stands up against the blatant lies from our government.

       "With regard to the idea of whether you have a right to health care, you have realize what that implies," the senator [Rand Paul] said. "It’s not an abstraction. I’m a physician. That means you have a right to come to my house and conscript me."
      </p>
      <p>
       "It means you believe in slavery," Paul added. "It means that you’re going to enslave not only me, but the janitor at my hospital, the person who cleans my office, the assistants who work in my office, the nurses."
      </p>
      <p>
       "I’m a physician in your community and you say you have a right to health care," Paul continued. "You have a right to beat down my door with the police, escort me away and force me to take care of you? That’s ultimately what the right to free health care would be."

       He's so far libertarian that he doesn't believe in the Civil Rights Act or The Americans with Disabilities Act and honestly believes that if these laws hadn't been put in place, public opinion and industry would have made exceptions for these on their own.

       He tried to make up his own board certification for Ophthalmology because he didn't want to pay the official state review board.
      </p>

       In Rand Paul's perfect world, there would be no FDA, no EPA and industry would regulate themselves based on the demands of the people. Unfortunately that will never work because the majority of Americans are about as stupid and ignorant as he is.

       They might be doing poorly due to the way corporate control is destroying all the social system here in the US, but imagine what this country would be like without them. They still do a lot. My office is next door to the EPA building and my ex-girlfriend is a fellow at the EPA currently doing important research on water quality in Tennessee. They do more than you realize.

       My 2 cents: Paul won't get the bid to run against Obama. In fact, we may not make it to 2012 election. WW3 will approach this late fall early winter, and yeah, start learning how to grow crops and raise chickens.

       One cannot learn from history is one refuses to acknowledge it.  It's kinda like skinning your knee.  If you don't look at your shoe laces and realize that you skinned your knee because you didn't tie your laces well.....you'll be forever skinning your knee and wondering why.

       Operation mockingbird controlled the media for years and was privatised after the church committee hearings, the same deception and ideology shifting propaganda continues today and most Americans will only think and do what they are instructed to take to the water coolers and make gospel.

       Be clear they are 2 steps ahead of you and will "lead all opposition to us".

       America will be destroyed from within and blamed on others, out of the chaos will come order, but first a couple of generations will have to make sacrifices for a better humanity caused by this american ignorance.

       Ron Paul plays his role very well and is a sleeper designed for you to feel someone is on your side and will sort it out. Same as every other stooge you elect in the two party puppet show you call democracy

       Some people might call it paranoia, but I have lived long enough to know that there is no such thing as paranoia. Not in the 21st century. No. Paranoia is just another word for ignorance.

       The real definition of the word paranoid is the ability to make links where none are easily visible, it wasn't until the modern age that the word changed to someone who was afraid of everything.

       One cannot learn from history is one refuses to acknowledge it.  It's kinda like skinning your knee.  If you don't look at your shoe laces and realize that you skinned your knee because you didn't tie your laces well.....you'll be forever skinning your knee and wondering why.
