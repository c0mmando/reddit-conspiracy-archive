        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There is a phenomenon going on right now where everything is a setup or a fix.  The Mayweather vs Ortiz fight. The air show crash in Reno was completely fake in my opinion.  I don&#39;t even think the crash took place.  The news media now have the ability to create news out of thin air.  It&#39;s incredible.  We are living in fake times.  Also, I believe the Erin Andrews peep hole scandal was a setup by Erin Andrews and the camera guy.  Erin Andrews now has a fitness video out and a new career.   A lot of UFC fights are fixed.  A lot of things in politics are definited fixed and rigged.  Elections are rigged.  Wherever there is money to be made, you can be sure that a fix is in the works.  </p>

<p>Air show crash info:</p>

<p>1) no pilot in cockpit in one photo</p>

<p>2) rudders aren&#39;t moving in photo</p>

<p>3) no video of actual point of impact</p>

<p>4) videographers conveniently point camera down right before impact</p>

<p>5) video of aftermath shows bystanders casually walking around and walking over dead bodies and conversing with others...go watch the Livestream footage and you&#39;ll see how absurd it is.  People weren&#39;t even running from the scene or panicking.   And why were bystanders allowed near the injured people?  One guy showed a leg cut off but no blood was coming out.  </p>

<p>Whenever have something that can be profited from, you have corruption.  And news stories can be profitable.  Are you guys saying that it&#39;s impossible to profit from news ratings?  That&#39;s bullshit.  We have billion dollar news corporations.  It would be so easy to create fake news stories.  </p>

<p>UPDATE:  You call yourselves conspiracy theorists?  What a joke.  You guys are nothing more than average losers on the internet.  </p>

<p>I guess if you believe that everything is a setup or a fix, then a logical consequence of this fact is that you will end up believing that everything is a setup or a fix.</p>

<p>However, maybe your initial assumptions are at fault, not the world.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t just say &quot;everythings rigged!&quot;</p>

<p>You need to be more specific than that, with details about <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> things are rigged.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to apply common sense when filtering the news. If a story doesn&#39;t make any sense, chances are it&#39;s fake. There is indeed a rise in the incidence of corruption and fraud. I think it has to do with a matching decline in respect for truth. Many people believe it&#39;s OK to lie. There&#39;s always a very good chance that any major boxing event is fixed. However, regarding the air show crash -- why would it be fake? See, that&#39;s the application of common sense. Why fake it? It makes no sense to fake it, and with so many witnesses, it would be almost impossible to fake it, so it was probably a real accident.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can&#39;t you profit from news?  I&#39;m quite sure there is a way to profit from tragedies.  I don&#39;t have enough knowledge of how they are doing it but there was no pilot in the cockpit in one of the photos.  And the rudders of plane were not moving.  Also, there is no video of the point of impact.  Each video either has a head blocking the impact shot or the videographer conveniently points the camera down right before impact.  That&#39;s highly suspicious.  Think how cheap it would be to create news stories out of thin air and boost your nightly news ratings.  That&#39;s one part of it.  Now if there was some kind of manufacturing part of it or some kind legal part, it could be very profitable.  Like persuading people to begin supporting computer controlled airplanes over human controlled.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>gss99, in the few months that I have been hanging around on r/conspiracy this is the first time I&#39;ve thought that a poster of an article or opinion might have lost touch with their sensibility. I truly don&#39;t mean to be dismissive of your thoughts and ideas, nor do I mean any disrespect, but I believe that you should take a step back and reevaluate your statements, gs99. Most people on r/conspiracy are tolerant and have an open mind, but there is no conceivable legitimate reason to fake such an accident.</p>

<p>Let me offer this: If the plane wreck in Reno was faked for ratings, who would benefit? No single network. news corporation, or media giant would stand to gain more than any of its  competitors. Of the five media conglomerates that control the overwhelming majority of the airwaves, none have an exclusive story on the Reno air show crash, hence no motivation for faking such a story. The immediacy of internet viewing of such events pretty much kills the idea of a fake for TV news ratings.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a professional boxing match that <em>wasn&#39;t</em> fixed in some way would be a story worthy of r/conspiracy. NBA, NFL - fixed. In NCAA football  I&#39;ve watched Colorado get a 5th down twice in one game a few years ago when playing Missouri. In fact, next to boxing being rigged, NCAA football is the second most corrupt sport that I know of.</p>

<p>I woke up to the idea of fake news immediately after 9-11. The events of 9-11 were unbelievable, but our government&#39;s actions and the media&#39;s unwavering support of the ridiculousness is what opened my eyes.</p>

I&#39;ve only seen really one man being interviewed on the air show crash.   It&#39;s not inconceivable that a group or corporation has been formed to create fake tragedies and profit from it.  They create groups to do all kinds of other things and where there is money to be made, the void will be filled.  Demand meets supply.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh okay thanks for narrowing it down, I checked the many youtube videos of the crash and what your claiming doesn&#39;t seem to add up. People where generally scared which you can clearly see and you can see the impact in a few videos, no severed leg videos and I doubt that would be on youtube, considering liveleak doesn&#39;t have anything to back up your story and they post uncensored raw stuff I think your full of shit. No need to call names, you proposed a theory with no backing and you get mad when I ask for the links you claim to have seen. How does that make me a faggot for simply asking you to back up the shit you spew? It&#39;s shit like this that really makes you look like a fool, your just some kid filled with piss and vinegar, what happened? Is your dildo stuck in your ass again?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the severed leg part is on Livestream. It&#39;s past the 40 minute mark into the video.  The guy is laying down and you can see his lower leg is missing but there is no blood coming out.  See, I&#39;ve done way more research than any of you here so I think I know a lot more about whether this is fake or not.  Most of you haven&#39;t even seen all the videos.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How about the US political system. Hell, the global financial system for that matter. The ones on top always profit. They play the games, set the maps, create the characters. Fake wars for no reason, royal &quot;weddings&quot;, and new pharma drugs that cure weight-lose and cure your crazy kids ADD, all bullshit. We (normal people obviously) are the puppets within such system. We are the gears that make this machine run. Going to work 9 -5 making someone up-top more money. So we can spend minuscule amounts on things we value like beer and clothing. Sports is mindless entertainment, as well as T.V, Hollywood, and even politicians, their just puppets in suits to show us what we want to see, keep us so called entertained. Making sure we are in check and happy with our &quot;votes.&quot; We don&#39;t elect, we don&#39;t choose, we aren&#39;t free. In any aspect. Whether its food, politics, education, health, we&#39;re all given these &quot;choices&quot; and know nothing of whats the truth. It&#39;s sick. You gss99 are close to opening your eyes. Keep searching, the truth will make you sicker then what your feeling now...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which is more plausible?  That the pilot scooted his chair back in the cockpit and went to sleep in 1/2 second or that the news story is fake?  I&#39;m going to go with the idea that it&#39;s fake.  I don&#39;t think you can scoot your seat back in a plane that&#39;s going 300 mph and do it in less than a second.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A little tip. Posting random things with no backing, while affixing a label to everyone here and then insulting everyone for simply asking for proof you claim to have seen isn&#39;t a good way to draw attention to yourself. This entire post and all your arguing with these reasonable people makes you look fuckin stupid. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll call me something racist or homophobic but really it&#39;ll just make you look more immature than your already portraying yourself as. Just to save you time because I assume your to stupid to post the video links I have found a bunch of vids on the crash and your claims are utterly stupid, like yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya it&#39;s so silly to expect you back up your stupid claims with evidence or at least the links you claim to have seen. If you actually roam this sub you will see people often ad the links about the claims they make whether it be legit or not. I&#39;m not being an ass I just call trolls like I see them. Maybe in the future you&#39;ll post the links of the claims you make instead of making yourself look like a tool here and destroying any cred you may have had, which judging by your piss poor attitude is absolutely none. Maybe you should just post this to facebook hoping it gets &#39;liked&#39; without having to back up your moronic &#39;theories&#39;.</p>
