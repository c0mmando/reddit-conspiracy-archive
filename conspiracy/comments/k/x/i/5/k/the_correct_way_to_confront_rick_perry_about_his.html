       You really are not there to influence the mind of Rick Perry nor any of the members of his immediate entourage because that's not going to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason you are there is to make it acceptable to talk about and ask questions about Bilderberg-related issues with our politicians.  This is the biggest deterrent currently: the peer pressure to shun taboo subjects and those who raise them.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         You have to wear a suit and tie when you physically confront these guys on camera.  Because humans are so easily manipulated by things like physical appearance, you're committing a public-relations self-castration if you do otherwise.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Don't find yourself becoming nothing more than a discredited nuisance by failing to have facts at the ready and end up just repeating the words Bilderberg! Treason!  Globalist Scum! Over and over.  Write down 3 good, specific questions for every celebrity globalist you confront.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Know that the celebrity globalist will most definitely ignore your questions.  So, once you've had your questions heard, you direct your attention to the reporters and other people there who are listening to him.  Engage these people.  Address these people with engaging questions and confirmed facts about the celebrity globalist and make the celebrity globalist compete with you for an audience.  Remember, this is done with substance, not volume, so leave the voice-horn at home.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Film everything and make sure to get your suit and tie juxtaposed against his so everyone knows this is one suit talking to another, not just some "redneck peasant" or some other derogatory label people will apply to you if given the chance.

       I am just saying its a silly question, there are close to 7 billion people in the world, chances are you aren't the only one around that wants to do anything. Furthermore there are close to 40k people in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       , 40k people interested in things of this nature, I am very sure that the majority of subscribers would love to go to a Bilderberg meeting to find out what they really talk about.

       The point I'm trying to make is that I think the vast majority of people wonder what is going on in those meetings so it is a silly thing to ask. Its reminds me of the DAE subreddit where they tell you to avoid post like "Does anyone else breathe?".

       It's almost like you've forgotten what thread you're in.
      </p>
      <p>
       The OP is talking about how to attack 'celebrity globalists' in an effective way.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is all of his hatred (and the common hatred) for globalists comes from learning about what they are and what they do from conspiracy blogs and youtube videos about the new world order.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm suggesting it would be far more interesting to actually go to these sort of meetings and learn about what they actually talk about than merely decrying them for their zionist plot for world domination.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same could be said for the masons, the illuminati, the council on foreign relations, chatham house, the world economic forum, and the meetings of the world bank and the imf.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect, something that will be very controversial to r/conspiracy, that most of the people that go to these sort of meetings aren't involved in any kind of plot, but rather are powerful enough to not only talk about how to solve the pressing problems of our times, but to actually implement policies to change the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm saying that the NWO is as made up as Al Qaeda.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way to find this out for sure is to actually go and participate, rather than speculate based on youtube videos with scary music.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have anything to add?

       Finally, this latest post actually has some content in it and adds to the discussion, you are clearly capable of making these posts so try and make more well thought out posts instead of asking one-word-answer rhetorical questions...
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that most of the Conspiracy Material "exposing" the NWO/Bildeberg Groups/G20/IMF etc is basically fear mongering based on weak assumptions and faulty logic. I would agree that the only way to figure out what is happening here would be to attend the meetings (unfortunately it is an exclusive group so we aren't going to get invites anytime soon).
      </p>
      <p>
       What I took issue with in the first place was that your initial question did not initially lead to any further discussion, what were you hoping to gain by asking if anyone else in a conspiracy forum would like to attend a super-secret meeting? People saying "Yes, I would also like to go!"?

       I agree that the "NAU" should not be brought up.  Not because open borders cannot be used as a political tool (they can be), but because it's been mythified in the minds of Americans.  Once Alex Jones covers it, or John Stewart, Steven Colbert, or the Onion have made Americans laugh about it, it's been disarmed so be fresh and be as simple and verifiable as possible.

       Republicans don't use open borders as a political tool anyway.  it's on the first page of their handbook.  only Democrats do, and even they just talk about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       no, the fear of open borders is the real political tool.   politicians scare-monger about how the "illegals" (what a horrible word) are going to use up the social security and take all the jobs, and use that as an excuse to build huge fences and line the border with armed guards.  bunch of totalitarian bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       i have seen plenty of videos of politicians and banksters getting "confronted" and i have to say this is one of the least interesting.    perry acted according to script - the video isn't
       <em>
        evidence
       </em>
       of anything.  and that's really the best thing that can come out of a video like this.
