    <div class="md"><p>There may not be justice in the sense that Bush and Cheney will probably never be sent to prison or hanged, but there is a cosmic justice at work. No action is without its consequences, and big actions such as the invasion and occupation of countries have big consequences down the road. There is currently a backlash against the crimes of Israel, and against US support for Israel, and in large part this is due to the actions of Israel itself. In the US the entire Truth Movement and the awakening of the population is being driven by the crimes of the Bush and Obama administrations. It may result in the abolishment of the Federal Reserve, which would be a pretty big piece of cosmic justice right there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. You&#39;re wrong. Look at the media&#39;s actions in the last couple of weeks. As soon as Rick Perry entered the race, before he even had much backing, the media made him the de facto nominee. Like they knew he would be. I believe they knew, or were told, that the Koches and their billions had decided to back Perry, would be paying for his commericals and so they knew he would be nominated. Few people outside of Texas had even heard of him apart from the scandal when his wife caught him in bed with a man, but suddenly he&#39;s the front runner? </p>

<p>The Tea Party is the Koches&#39; front. It started out as a reasonable group but was taken over by their evil. Money is power. If they have decided Perry will be the nominee, judging from the media&#39;s sudden change in attitude, he will be.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You won&#39;t win the republican party by telling the truth. Or the democratic party for that matter. The left right paradigm is a blight on the face of American politics, I would fully embrace Ron Paul if he refuse to play along and went independent, but until then I still agree with him, but I know he has a snowballs chance in hell as long as he is with the GOP. say hello to president Perry, champion of bilderberg! How does vice president Bachman sound? This is what support of the GOP will lead to as Paul is marginalized, his supporters will just end up feeling disenfranchised. Paul is a deliberate move by the GOP to sideline libertarians, pacifying them with a real acceptable canidate, then when this canidate fails miserably because of a media blackball and rigged voting they can draw his supporters to vote for whatever fuckwad they decide should be president. This is just my theory, but I&#39;ve given this more than a passing thought.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This comment deserves a bit of attention. While the claims made here are quite unsubstantiated with physical evidence, the circumstantial evidence is pretty overwhelming that HW was closely involved with a splinter cell of the CIA responsible for political asassinations abroad. Supposedly jfk jr ran into some real physical evidence that HW may have been involved and on the day of his death he was about to present this evidence to a grand jury to try and obtain justice for his father&#39;s murder by identifying the real asassins. I&#39;m not sure if all of this information is 100% accurate as I am reciting it from memory of research done over a year ago. Please feel free to prove this wrong if you know what really happened to jr. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unsubstat. Claims:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A newly discovered FBI document reveals that George Bush was directly involved in the 1963 murder of President John Kennedy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What doc?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The document places Bush working with the now-famous CIA agent, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on this doc. no cited</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since he had been the supervisor for the secret Cuban teams, headed by former Cuban police commander Felix Rodriguez, since 1960, it is likely Bush was also in Dallas in 1963</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Claim of head of secret Cubam Teams, not shown</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The corporations would not put somebody in charge of all the state secrets held by the CIA unless he was experienced and well trained in the CIA</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Guessing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Recently I interviewed former CIA liaison officer L. Fletcher Prouty</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This man is certifiable nuts, have you read about him?
Here believes that oil is not from fossil, Princess Di was killed by Secret Team of US agents, Evolution is a massive conspiracy fraud, and L. Ron Hubbard was a the victim of a military conspiracy.  He was at the nerve center of the intell. community for years, and  he became consumed by the idea of conspiracies due to covert work.  He also beleives the moon landing was fake and for a while, that the round earth &quot;theory&quot; was a conspiracy. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He is a consultant for the excellent new movie on how the CIA killed JFK, being made by Oliver Stone</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That movie is fiction, is not truth, was not presented as truth.  In fact Prouty&#39;s influence was thrown out of much of the movie when it became apparent he was crazy.  His claim of Edward Landsdale as one of the three tramps, was debunked by Daniel Ellsburg(Pentagon Papers guy).  Stone described the movie as counter myth, not based on fact, but based on factual conjecture.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every serious investigator now agrees that Oswald did not shoot JFK</p>
</blockquote>

<p>NO ONE believes that.  He may have been part of a greater conspiracy, but he was the shooter, there is not doubt about that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sirhan Sirhan did not shoot Robert Kennedy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He was caught at the seen with dozens of witnesses.  He literally was in a crowded hotel and did not leave the room.  This is absurd and pathetic.  Unless the man they took away and arrested was not the man who stood trial, it was Sirhan Sirhan.  </p>

<p>James Earl Ray admitted it several times, without being interrogated.  he recanted years later b/c he saw he could be released due to the conspiracy around MLK assass.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact, Preston Bush is credited with creating the winning ticket of Eisenhower-Nixon in 1952</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This a source to a subjective opinion statement...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact, Nixon was given credit for planning Operation 40, the secret 1961 invasion of Cuba, during his 1959 campaign for President </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The invasion of cuba was a CIA run operation given the green light by JFK, nothing to do with Nixon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The polls had Nixon winning by a landslide. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>By 8/1960 the lead was slim, and after the debates Nixon was behind.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the U.S. would step in to protect the drug trade from the GoIden Triangle</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The source cites the Air America fiasco.  Yes drug running did happen, but it was not CIA run, it was rogue pilots.  I know pilots who flew for Air America.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, in 1960, Preston Bush was running Nixon&#39;s campaign</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am guessing he means Precott, HW&#39;s father.
I dont have time to go through the rest.  I suggest if you really want to look for the truth, look.for.the.truth.  Not a sensationalist news story.  HW would obviously deny all knowledgte any all CIA activities before he was acknowledged as a member.  This author has a basic misconception of how the CIA works.  It is not that centrally controlled.  Agents are only paid when they are working.  The do this so they can move them around a lot and not develop any habits the agency does not like.  This also leads to a lot of independ. unilateral action by agents.  You are basically a contract worker who, in certain circumstances, can do what you want, when you want, where you want.  The agency keeps a distance to disavow all knowledge.  The agency is not capable of constructing something as intricate as this assassination and keeping it quiet.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing in that document at all implies Bush was involved.  Bush is not mentioned except that he furnished the info.  And the letter is expressing concern over the assassination.  That assumption is predicated upon the belief that the anti-castro Cubans were involved, yet the letter states they are concerned about not getting the support they did under JFK.  Of course a pro-Castro group would be concerned.  They would be a likely patsy or suspect, does not they did anything.  If a PRO-Castro group did it, and the CIA knew about they would have ran it up the flag poll.  The CIA still hates Castro, they very much wanted to get revenge for the Bay of Pigs.  </p>

<p>I can put out lies with a webpage too and call it facts.  The Sirhan Sirhan line and Prouty line finished it with me.  That would the same thing as saying Jack Ruby did not kill Oswald, give me a break.  The murder was literally filmed on t.v.!!!  I do not believe that Oswald acted alone, but I do not believe that CIA was the organ. behind the assassination.,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not exonerating the Bushes from everything, they certainly have their fair share or shit to answer for, but I do not believe HW was responsible for JFK or involved, and I do not believe that W was responsible for 9/11.  I have seen nothing other than circumstantial evidence or hearsay to show the opposite.   Why did you jump, to the &quot;Im paid to push the Bushes are innocent lie&quot;?  B/c I do not jump to a shocking conclusion without a reasonable amount of proof?  The accusations in question are certainly not absolute in either direction.  Barring that, I believe someone should be assumed innocent until shown that oppositte is true. Who, on any side, pushed that HW was in on the JFK assassination?  If you read the original article you cited about Bush and JFK and took that as fact, you are not only sticking your head in the sand, you are digging the hole too.    From what I have read and found, the most likely conspiracy involves the mob.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really?  Why would anyone spend time and money paying someone to convince people who, by definition of the subreddit they are in, believe everyone who disagrees with them are paid informants.  This is the last place to bother with that.  Thats like paying a white supremacist to convince black people to be racist against black people.  No one cares about reddit, we don&#39;t matter.  This entire site is a circlejerk for people&#39;s self confirmed beliefs.  People don&#39;t join this, or any, subreddit for open minded discussion, they join to solidify their pre-conceived beliefs.  If you take a poll of people on here if they believe the &quot;official&quot; 9/11 story, how many would vote yes?  None.  Political parties don&#39;t cater to their base, except for the primaries, they cater to the swing voters.  Same premise here, you all are not swing voters, you are hard line believers.  Whether your beliefs are correct or not, you are not changing your views.  No one who actually tries to block ideas, does so on reddit.  Unless they are a mod trying to control their fiefdom.  They&#39;re 7 billion people in the world, then couple hundred thousand(stretch) on reddit are not a blink on the screen.  Do you have any proof that these people are paid shills and not just trolls or as convinced as you are, but of the opposite standpoint?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honest question:  If this was an inside job, 9/11 I mean, by Bush and Co.  Why?  Where is the end benefit for such a risk.  And dont say power, b/c that IS NOT it.  A sitting POTUS does not need anything other than his pen to increase power.  Cheney was filthy rich before, and would have continuted to be even without military contracts.  There was no attempt to expand the wars from Aghan. and Iraq, even when the war in Iraq was popularly supported.  We did not have any plan, obviously, for post war Iraq so I cannot think that a smash and grab job on oil was a real thought, maybe a better relationship with the next regime, but we have never tried to set up for that either.  The patriot act has been used 80% or more for drug busts, there hasn&#39;t been a POTUS since Reagan who cared about the war on drugs.  Re-election, possible at some point, but the &quot;rally around the flag&quot; syndrome lasts for months not 3 years, ask Obama after OBL was killed.  Cheney and Rove were way to sly politically to take that chance without a sure bet for a massive payoff, but where is it?  Look at Bush campainged on the first time.  No nation building, well we obviously are in two places activley, but we did not go in with any plan of building anything, so I do not see how we planned to acqurie something from them, besides dead bodies.  The country has been moving to right, steadily, since Carter and there was no reason to think the right was anywhere but sitting pretty politically in 2000.  C. Rice was already talking a big game to N. Korea and China, the cold war scare tactics were about to be re-introduced.<br/>
      The main reason I hear is power, as in gov&#39;t. control.  Control of what?  For what?  They are tracking our internet searched, phone records, emails...ok, and what does that do for them.  Is it corporations that are pushing this?  For what, we are a consumer economy on crack and speed.  If it is on the shelf, we buy it.  The risk for the perceived reward, I do not see it.  At the end of the day for every expert report by an engin. alleging 9/11 was an inside job, you can find another expert engin. saying it was not.  I do not see what tangiable reward Bush and Co. would have/ or have received by taking that risk.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What oil are we stealing?  We never even bothered the Iraqi oil fields and there is no oil in Afghan.  As far as promoting the ruling class, these actions, massive attacks,  usually have the opposite affects in the long run.  W is the son of HW, who was head of the CIA and POTUS, both went to yale and are members of the Skull and Bones... I&#39;m pretty sure they are not worried about the &quot;ruling elite&quot; losing power.  The family is the personification of consolidated power, there are no threats to them.  So the attacks were caused simply to start a war?  War without an end goal, which we obviously did not have, is counter productive for all parties, including the ruling parties.  </p>
