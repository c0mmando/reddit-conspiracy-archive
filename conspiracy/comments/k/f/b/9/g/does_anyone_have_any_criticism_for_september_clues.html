<p>TL;DR for the video(s): WTC was not hit by planes, but by missiles. It questions  all &quot;amateur&quot; video footage.</p>

<p>But I did see very close videos from WTC that clearly showed planes.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still going through &quot;part 3&quot;. Does anyone have any comments on this video?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Downvote me into oblivion. But first consider the angle of the five network shots; the nose of the plane completely exiting the other side; the plane-shaped gash appearing only after the explosion; the difference in weather and light conditions from shot to shot; the moving bridge in the background; the misplacement of buildings; the media ties; the BBC coverage; all before the fact aluminum could not sever any core columns after getting shredded by the perimeter. Visual evidence of engine parts at the Pentagon or New York are no different than whatever was planted in Shanksville. They&#39;re called &quot;clues&quot; for a reason. It&#39;s up to you to determine which evidence manufactured after the fact should be permissible. Debunking the debunking videos takes it to an existential extreme. If we accept the inner walls of the Pentagon could not have been knocked down by a plane, why is it so hard to say the same is true for WTC? Timed/planted explosions along with news scripts that are secret anyway explain everything. Next to the physics side, this is damn compelling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I heard a little more explanation of the no-planes theory by a video of a Russian nuclear scientist.  He made a good point.</p>

<p>You know how the twin towers and WTC7 fell at free-fall speed?  And how jet fuel (and the flimsy explanation of weakened steel) wouldn&#39;t cause it?</p>

<p>Consider the all the videos you&#39;ve seen of planes crashing into the towers.  They always go in at full speed.</p>

<p>The twin towers were made of much reinforced steel (like tank armor).  The military uses rounds with depleted uranium tips to help pierce armor.  The planes are made of aluminum - and they aren&#39;t exactly too thick either (they have to be light enough to fly and all).</p>

<p>Yet we see planes go into the towers at full speed.  Put it this way, what if you threw a paper airplane really hard at a cardboard box?  The plane would be smashed, the box would pretty much be OK.  Even if you managed to throw it faster than a bullet, if it even pierced the box it certainly wouldn&#39;t go in at full speed (or have a nose emerge intact on the other side - once again with no sign of slow down at all.  Each action must have an equal and opposite reaction.  We&#39;re showed destruction of a very strong building yet no damage to the entering planes.</p>

<p>I thought the documentary was very interesting to consider.  I used to think of the no-plane theories as out there (except the Pentagon no-plane theory).  But this (among other sources I&#39;ve watched and considered) is fairly compelling.</p>

<p>It would be nice if I personally had live footage recorded from that day so I would have concrete proof for myself (it&#39;s always possible for conspiracy videos to be doctored although the work required seems like it would be harder than faking the planes on Sep. 11 lol).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So let me get this straight</p>

<p>Plane hitting the Pentagon...not true</p>

<p>Planes hitting the WTC Towers...true</p>

<p>On the same day</p>

<p>On the same attack</p>

<p>By the same people</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t care if the planes hit WTC or not, why do you care what hit the Pentagon?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The truth is always important. Why do you assume that I don&#39;t care if planes hit the WTC or not?!? I never suggested this. I am also not speculating about what these data points imply about who was behind the attacks or the obvious cover-up that has taken place in the last 10 years. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s review for those who haven&#39;t seen the relevant data points:</p>

<p>We have a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHhiRIgzI_c">LOT of eye witness testimony</a> about the planes (especially the second plane) hitting the towers and also about other explosions (the demolition charges) that went off in WTC 1, 2 and 7.</p>

<p>Meanwhile at the pentagon, the office that was hit was busy sorting out a missing 2.3 TRILLION (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kpWqdPMjmo">announced literally the day before</a>), an amount greater than both of the massive banker bailouts that have stalled the global economy. The hole in the Pentagon could not have been made by the plane that they claim hit it, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6j8U6Vcoh0c">we have no footage of the plane hitting it</a> (despite the pentagon having hundreds of video sources from the building and around the area), and <a href="http://www.disclose.tv/action/viewvideo/16052/9_11_commissioner_slips_up__Missile_hit_Pentagon/">one of the 9/11 commissioners</a> has publicly slipped up and stated that the Pentagon was hit by a missile. Rumsfeld has also made this slip and you can even <a href="http://www.defense.gov/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=3845">read the transcript</a> at the DOD site. Search for &quot; the missile to damage this building&quot; for the relevant passage within the longer interview.</p>

<p>As for flight 93, the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5GgZa9V0A8">VP Cheney says he ordered it shot down</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V9MD15qs5s">Rumsfeld also said it was shot down</a>.</p>

<p>So I think any suggestion that the WTC was hit by missiles is likely incorrect. I think that the official story of the flight 93 passengers causing the plane to crash is likely incorrect. I think that the official story of a plane hitting the Pentagon is likely incorrect. </p>

<p>In my opinino, the best evidence we have shows planes hit the two towers, shows all three WTC towers were demoed, shows flight 93 was shot down, and finally shows the Pentagon was hit by a cruise missile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many levels of truther, my like-minded brother. In my belief system, certain Islamic extremists (probably not the ones we were told) carried out an attack that American government let them get away with. I believe planes indeed hit the towers, as I saw them with my eyes from several camera angles. I am suspicious, however, about the pentagon.</p>

<p>And when you mention the inefficiency of planes, consider the sheer weight of one single engine; the added weight of all the people, let alone the weight and size of the plane itself. If we assume structural damage was the intention of the crash; they could have picked no better weapon. </p>

<p>I liked September Clues and it points out some interesting inconsistencies. I could see if Simon Shack were a disinfo agent to further the, make truthers look ridiculous plan. However I also wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he was genuine and misinformed. </p>

<p>While what actually happened is extremely important, I tend to lean planes in New York, but not in Shanksville or Pentagon. I think that this is a classic case of divide and conquer. The truth is that it is not crucial to find out where the actual planes were. </p>

<p>We know enough to know that the official story is ridiculous, and that is what we should run with. When we argue about planes or no planes and the like, it makes us look even crazier. </p>

<p>You have a point. On the other hand, for such a person to remain alive would be an embarrassment to the U.S. government. Such a person would probably suspect that 9/11 was a false flag operation, and would be wise to fear a quiet assassination. If it were me I would keep a low profile.

    <div class="md"><p>The creator needs to look up Occcam&#39;s Razor. I don&#39;t buy every single bit of the &quot;official 9/11 story,&quot; but if a dozen (or dozens) of cameras show a plane crashing into building, the idea that every one of them has been rotoscoped or overlayed just doesn&#39;t check out.</p>

<p>The idea that most/all of the amateur footage was from people with multimedia ties is interesting, but it makes sense that these people would have cameras available and the presence of mind to roll tape.</p>

<p>The &quot;audio evidence&quot; is bologna as these were very likely on-board camera mics that aren&#39;t very good to begin with, and certainly weren&#39;t calibrated to catch a sudden and large explosion. </p>

<p>The idea of network cues (the ABC &quot;beep&quot;) is intriguing, who knows. But the &quot;hat&#39;s off&quot; glitch shown in the video is a pretty standard interlacing problem with digital video and predictable of a moving camera.</p>

<p>He goes on and on about CGI landscapes for reasons I don&#39;t understand. Eye witnesses that mistake the sound of an accelerating airplane to that of a missile isn&#39;t very compelling evidence as victims of crime often later identify as innocent person as the guilty party even when they claim to have gotten a good look at their assailant. People on the scene, in shock and under stress, don&#39;t always make great witnesses. </p>

<p>There is some good, thought-provoking stuff in the video, but the creator devotes the most time to the weakest of ideas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with most people&#39;s use of Occam&#39;s Razor is that it is complete nonsense, and doesn&#39;t offer anything scientific to the debate. &quot;Simple&quot; is a relative term, and any scientist that believes in their hypothesis because it is the simplest one, well they are not much of a scientist. </p>

<p>There is the possibility that the government has designed missiles that can project an optical illusion around themselves, appearing as a plane to observers. Not the simplest explanation, but the remote possibility at least demonstrates the fault in common usage of Occam&#39;s Razor, and false dichotomies(well if they weren&#39;t planes they MUST have doctored everyones video evidence). </p>

<p>I accept there are things I&#39;ll never know about 911, but collapse analysis is all the proof of an inside job that I need.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>None of the truth movements are genuine.  All of them (from my knowledge) are controlled by the elite.  All of them seem to give a little...or a lot of truth but then throw in some lies here and there.  The no-plane movement gives a lot of truth but also throws in some lies.  I&#39;m not sure why this is done completely.  Maybe the lies are designed as a method of further weakening the movement or rendering it impotent.   Obviously whoever has designed these movements is very very intelligent and knowledgeable on human psychology.  The United States experiment may never be duplicated and if it is,  who the hell would want to participate.  The people running this world are the greatest minds that ever existed.  These guys would even give Hitler a boner.  We are dealing with a group of people extremely knowledgeable in economics,  news media, law, psychology, etc etc.  It&#39;s amazing.  </p>
