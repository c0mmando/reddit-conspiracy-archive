       In case you have not noticed. There is a great deal of quiet censorship at r/politics and r/worldnews since the moderator lineup  has changed.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you go to r/politicsnew or r/worldnews/new you won't see a lot of submissions critical of Israel or the Israel Lobby in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a look at the newest submissions to r/politics that the moderators will allow you to see:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/new">
         http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/new
        </a>
        <br/>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Nowhere will you see this submission which was made a shortwhile ago:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/kjtr2/glenn_greenwald_the_mainstreaming_of_walt_and/">
         http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/kjtr2/glenn_greenwald_the_mainstreaming_of_walt_and/
        </a>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       This kind of quiet Zionist-oriented censorship has become routine at both r/politics and r/worldnews lately. It began when the moderator lineup changed.

       Apparently there is a new subreddit created to discuss censorship by moderators at r/worldnews, r/politcs, and r/technology:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalModeration">
        http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalModeration
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It looks like this sort of censorship has been flourishing ever since the moderator lineup has changed.

       The reason is simple enough. The r/politics subreddit has three-quarters of a million subscribers. It's considered by the Zionists to be mainstream. By contrast r/conspiracy and r/worldnews have less than 40,000 subscribers each. They are niche subreddits. R/Conspiracy is considered by most people (who don't know it) to be nothing more than a nutball subreddit, so the Zionists don't mind if we post accurate news about Israel here ... but they don't want any truth showing up on r/politics because it reaches 22 times as many viewers. I'm a bit surprised they bother censoring r/worldnews, but maybe it's because the name of the group suggests that it is mainstream.

       The clever thing Zionists have done is to use the tax monies paid by the American taxpayer to fund their propaganda wars, and also to bleed out more US tax money. They don't even have to fund their propaganda campaign out of their own pockets. Did you read the story about all the Jewish organizations getting free security upgrades to all their offices and community centers? What a joke, considering there is no security threat, other than maybe from an occasional Mossad bomb team.

       Zionists strive to control all sorts of social media, and news. They have conference's, and people volunteer to censor and rewrite history to show what they would like the world to see. Its how the major new's networks are run to portray their Apartheid Xenophobic society as saints. It because they run and own it, and make anyone who questions them look ridiculous or racist, even when their not.

       Exactly so. Try getting a piece in the newspaper or on local televison news concerning Jewish control of the media, or the pervasive control of AIPAC over Washington. Or any subject critical of Jews, Zionists, or Israel. The media drones will back away from you as if you've got the plague.

       I've noticed. But you're wrong about worldnews. It has been censored for a long time. That's why I'm subscribing to
       <a href="/r/worldpolitics">

       Glad I'm not the only one to see past the bullshit and not brainwashed to think assholes who volunteer to participate in an organization responsible for some of the worst war crimes in the past decade alone.

       I am not saying your wrong/right but this is the 9th story in r/politics:
      </p>
      <p>
       Tom Friedman in NY Times: the US government is Israel's "hostage" and "the powerful pro-Israel lobby can force the administration to defend Israel", not exactly a Pro-Israel title (I am not talking about the article just the title), and the article you are referencing above is mentioned in the comments and has 3 up votes and is visible. Just to  be clear I am no fan of r/politics and I do think the mods do some shady things there.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a different note the more interesting thing I think is if you compare the main stories in r/politics with r/conspiracy right now they have several similarities, this Occupy Wall Street is being pushed hard in both of them, ron paul winning the straw poll, social security issues, yesterday there was a meme post on raise taxes on the rich

       The fact is that it was banned immediately after being submitted and remained banned until a moderator changed his mind more than a half hour later and decided to allow it.

       I was reading a post over in Theory of Reddit earlier that gave the impression that everything posted to r/politics, except for the mods posts and their list of approved posters, by default is labeled spam. Therefore unless the OP notices and complains they never realize what the deal is and it is left up to the mods to release it at their discretion. If all this is true, I can think of few less then honorable reasons why they are doing it and I am sure you can too.

       That may explain why there are so few new submissions showing up on
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/new/">

       No they dont. The internet is the last bastion of true free speech - the jewish lobby owns a hell of a lot - but the internet is certainly not one.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that you can setup a site, or post a comment, anywhere to say anything is exactly how it should be.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am sure though there are many efforts to prove the internet provides a pulpit from which racism/anti-semitism/national security secrets can be shouted and thus should be controlled (thus the efforts of recent to frame cyber attacks on lulzsec, anon, etc..)

       I agree, they don't quite own the Internet. Yet. They are doing everything in their power to rectify that situation, however. Unless some kind of rules are put into place insuring diversity, all the main sites will be bought up, and once they own them, they start to exert their social and political filters over them, just as they do over television, radio, popular music, books, magazines and movies. We've probably only got a few more years to make our voices heard, before the bastards smother us all. They will control Google, so you won't even be able to find truly independent and truthful sites, even if they manage to survive. The pressure is very subtle, but it is unrelenting. It's the kind of pressure a gardener puts on a tree to make it grow crooked. He doesn't want to kill the tree, so he takes his time, but he never allows the tree to stand up straight. That the kind of pressure the Zionists exert over the media to twist it to their purposes.

       Google and Facebook were funded by Jewish ppl, so probably no problem controlling those.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is so much pro-Israel/Banking/Mass media censorship on Wikipedia. I'm wondering if any of the it's funders - Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger - is also of Jewish origin.

       Exactly so. Try getting a piece in the newspaper or on local televison news concerning Jewish control of the media, or the pervasive control of AIPAC over Washington. Or any subject critical of Jews, Zionists, or Israel. The media drones will back away from you as if you've got the plague.
