        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have been watching the Occupy Wall Street protests very carefully and I must say I am very encouraged at the potential this movement has. I live in Florida and I really want to get up to New York to get my voice heard but I don&#39;t have much money. So, I decided to whip up some shirts to try to entice people to help me get there. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/TF31w.gif">This</a> is the original design and <a href="http://i.imgur.com/YgLGZ.jpg">this</a> is what the shirts came out looking like. These are hand silk screened by <a href="http://i.imgur.com/rNXka.jpg">me</a> although, in full disclosure, that picture is from another day of printing. If you like what you see, please go <a href="http://getmetowallstreet.bigcartel.com/">here</a> and buy a shirt!</p>

<p>Also, my one qualm about the whole movement is that they don&#39;t have a central message they are trying to get across, so in conjunction to the shirts I have made, I made my own 3 point plan that addresses the problems and offers a solution to problems presented. For any of you that are wary to support me because you dont know what my message is (understandably), go <a href="http://notepub.com/#fb=&amp;note=259307&amp;dk=ea82434c216ee19623a82984ee55f657">here</a> and check it out.</p>

<p>Lets get something done.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is what the MSM has said and it&#39;s what their owners want you to believe.</p>

<p>They <strong>do</strong> have a central message and, although I do not claim to speak for them, I am able to discern the message clearly and unambiguously as being this:</p>

<ul>
<li>We&#39;re tired of getting screwed.</li>
</ul>

<p>The MSM (the megaphone of its ownership) is spinning it this way: &quot;Well, tell us which parts of the ass-raping are unsatisfactory.&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>Summary: Do not fall for this &quot;no clear message&quot; crap. It is part of <strong>their</strong> tactic to force the angry mob to elect representatives (easily bribed) to present a list of grievances/demands (easily accommodated through rhetoric) so that they can send the angry mob home and continue business as usual.</p>

<p>Stand your ground. Do not back down. Do not be intimidated by their &quot;demand&quot; for a &quot;list of demands&quot;. DO NOT PLAY BY THEIR RULES ANY MORE. Let the occupying forces work this out. They seem to be creating ad hoc systems (human megaphone, for example) by which their message is beginning to come together. </p>

<p>Patience is a virtue.<sup><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiV6PqH_BUI&amp;amp;t=1m55s" title="We&#39;ve only just begun to fight.">*</a></sup></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well ive seen their message and although i can agree with most of them (end the wars, end the patriot act) they dont even mention the Fed which is the <strong>crux</strong> of the problem.  I think the Fed is the reason why ANY of the other problems can be constantly perpetuated by the government; they get free money without having to tax people.</p>

<p>Calling them names (clueless), regardless of whether they are on location, or on the internet, is neither supportive of the cause, or productive toward an outcome.</p>

<p>It&#39;s one thing to say &quot;I think we can do better.&quot; It&#39;s an entirely different thing to say &quot;this sucks. you suck. we&#39;re doomed.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who is &quot;they&quot; in this instance? It appears (to me, anyway) that this is just some blogster doing a &quot;here&#39;s what I think they&#39;re going to ask for&quot;. I don&#39;t see him offering any credentials as a representative of the people on the ground. As near as I can tell, he&#39;s just a redditor on a different reddit-code site... probably one of several redditors who snatched up the domain &quot;occupywallstreet.org&quot; and decided to appoint themselves commanders of the resistance.</p>

<p>Although I do watch these postings flow through, here on reddit,... I also take them all with grain of salt. Youtube videos have more sway with me than random blogpostings by someone calling themself &quot;GandhiKingMindsetResist&quot;.</p>

<p>EDIT: Thanks for the link though. (I&#39;m not shooting the messenger here.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I saw the list posted on Reddit a few days ago by a guy who said he was from the protest, but I&#39;d like to see a Youtube video of them being read out. They need to realize that televising is an important part of the modern world and they need to organize their filming, since the MSM won&#39;t take care of it for them. The great thing about the internet is they don&#39;t NEED the MSM, they can make their own media.</p>
