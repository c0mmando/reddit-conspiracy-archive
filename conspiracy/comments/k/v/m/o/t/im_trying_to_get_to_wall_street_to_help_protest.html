       I have been watching the Occupy Wall Street protests very carefully and I must say I am very encouraged at the potential this movement has. I live in Florida and I really want to get up to New York to get my voice heard but I don't have much money. So, I decided to whip up some shirts to try to entice people to help me get there.
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/TF31w.gif">
        This
       </a>
       is the original design and
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/YgLGZ.jpg">
        this
       </a>
       is what the shirts came out looking like. These are hand silk screened by
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/rNXka.jpg">
        me
       </a>
       although, in full disclosure, that picture is from another day of printing. If you like what you see, please go
       <a href="http://getmetowallstreet.bigcartel.com/">
        here
       </a>
       and buy a shirt!
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, my one qualm about the whole movement is that they don't have a central message they are trying to get across, so in conjunction to the shirts I have made, I made my own 3 point plan that addresses the problems and offers a solution to problems presented. For any of you that are wary to support me because you dont know what my message is (understandably), go

        here
       </a>
       and check it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets get something done.

       This is what the MSM has said and it's what their owners want you to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       They
       <strong>
        do
       </strong>
       have a central message and, although I do not claim to speak for them, I am able to discern the message clearly and unambiguously as being this:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        We're tired of getting screwed.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The MSM (the megaphone of its ownership) is spinning it this way: "Well, tell us which parts of the ass-raping are unsatisfactory."
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Summary: Do not fall for this "no clear message" crap. It is part of
       <strong>
        their
       </strong>
       tactic to force the angry mob to elect representatives (easily bribed) to present a list of grievances/demands (easily accommodated through rhetoric) so that they can send the angry mob home and continue business as usual.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stand your ground. Do not back down. Do not be intimidated by their "demand" for a "list of demands". DO NOT PLAY BY THEIR RULES ANY MORE. Let the occupying forces work this out. They seem to be creating ad hoc systems (human megaphone, for example) by which their message is beginning to come together.
      </p>
      <p>
       Patience is a virtue.

       Well ive seen their message and although i can agree with most of them (end the wars, end the patriot act) they dont even mention the Fed which is the
       <strong>
        crux
       </strong>
       of the problem.  I think the Fed is the reason why ANY of the other problems can be constantly perpetuated by the government; they get free money without having to tax people.

       Oh, I won't argue with that. The Federal Reserve is the hinge pin of the entire international financier criminal network. If you follow the link in my previous comment (the asterisk at the end) and play the whole video, there are actually
       <em>
        numerous
       </em>
       references to the Federal Reserve and the international cabal of financiers who own it.

       Exactly, sorry i didn't notice that link before haha. I was making these shirts for myself but I also figured i could show them to some other like minded individuals. I dont want to fight against the protesters, I want to help as much as possible and I think these shirts are something I can do from my home

       Don't condemn the blogsters and spinsters. Praise those who are there, in person, taking the beatings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Calling them names (clueless), regardless of whether they are on location, or on the internet, is neither supportive of the cause, or productive toward an outcome.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's one thing to say "I think we can do better." It's an entirely different thing to say "this sucks. you suck. we're doomed."

       Who is "they" in this instance? It appears (to me, anyway) that this is just some blogster doing a "here's what I think they're going to ask for". I don't see him offering any credentials as a representative of the people on the ground. As near as I can tell, he's just a redditor on a different reddit-code site... probably one of several redditors who snatched up the domain "occupywallstreet.org" and decided to appoint themselves commanders of the resistance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although I do watch these postings flow through, here on reddit,... I also take them all with grain of salt. Youtube videos have more sway with me than random blogpostings by someone calling themself "GandhiKingMindsetResist".

       EDIT: Thanks for the link though. (I'm not shooting the messenger here.)

       Yeah, I saw the list posted on Reddit a few days ago by a guy who said he was from the protest, but I'd like to see a Youtube video of them being read out. They need to realize that televising is an important part of the modern world and they need to organize their filming, since the MSM won't take care of it for them. The great thing about the internet is they don't NEED the MSM, they can make their own media.

       I really like what you've written up.  A small typo, however:  Under number 2, "Being able to finance private military contractors (read: mercenaries) is only possible because the Fed
       <strong>
        is allowed to Although
       </strong>
       some financial talking heads will insist that all the stimulative policies pursued by the Fed..."
      </p>
      <p>
       I think maybe you meant "exist."?
Just trying to help.  Great job on the shirts, man.  Keep fighting the good fight.

       How about: You stay home and put your artistic skills and energy toward supporting and spreading awareness for local and state government candidates who share your values.  Some might make it to the House and Senate, and would be able to change the things you want changed.  (Imagine if everyone occupying Wall Street tried that instead of "making demands" to the politicians who allowed the mess in the first place.)

       Whats funny about the protests is that they have a message thats clear:
We are pissed at you, Wall Street.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now what if WS turns around and replies: Then what do you want done about it?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the problem I have with this protest. Im pissed too, but what exactly have these people come up with that may try and fix or lessen the situation? Im all ears, its just that I havent heard ANYONE come up with a plan of action.

       Its just like that one south park episode where the hippies invaded.
