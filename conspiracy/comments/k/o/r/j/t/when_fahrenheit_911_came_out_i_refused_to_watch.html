       For what it's worth, the "wake up, sheeple" line is only really annoying to those who are already awake to what has been going on. It's annoying like an alarm clock that you can't turn off. And, now that r/politics and r/worldnews are reflecting much of the same content as r/conspiracy, it seems that more people are awake now than previously (during the heyday of that phrase)... thus, it's now becoming annoying to a lot more people. What we mustn't forget, however, is that this phrase actually motivated a great many people to do just that: wake up (at least to a limited extent - enough to mount widespread activism).
      </p>
      <p>
       We're talking about a nation of almost 300 million people, about 90% of whom were lulled to sleep by the repetitive drone of the official narrative (interwoven with all of the other sleep-inducing aspects of the corporatocracy). The fact that these statistics have now turned almost 180 degrees (80% no longer accept the narrative that had them in their slumber), is a testament to the efficacy of these somewhat aggressive and annoying phrases.
      </p>
      <p>
       It really is very similar to the alarm clock analogy. It makes one stop and think "hey, did that person just dismiss me the way I've been dismissing them? how dare they? I now have to rethink this and dig a bit deeper."
      </p>
      <p>
       That having been said, though, your initial point deserves repeating

       I think the real winner in the effectiveness department is the MSM considering we have 80% not believing the government's version of the conspiracy and still have not reached a tipping point in public outrage. Their "repetitive drone" has kept the lid on it in spite of the recent numbers saying they no longer believe the spin job.  Powerful stuff.  PR/propaganda has become a pretty exact science of numbers.

       Excellent point. Which is precisely why I wanted to nip the cliche-hating in the bud. There are far more productive places to place our contempt than in-fighting among ourselves about whether or not a tactic is effective and/or how effective a tactic is. The institutions which have oppressed us have been drawing upon the resources of professional research and polishing the process for decades. Whereas we, the oppressed, have had to rely solely on our disorganized collective individualisms to overcome that great beast. Truth and determination have been our two greatest allies.

       It always shocked me that how apathetic many people were at the whole movie... it came and went without causing a major storm... just like the recent wikileaks revelations. What I thought would be world-changing was just a random news story. The problem with today's world? Nobody cares to think beyond the confines of their everyday lives.

       It's not that no one cares, it's mostly a feeling of helplessness when you look at the problem and realize that beyond some great uprising of the people, nothing will change.

       As long as people can keep doing their 9-5 job and taking care of their family, then they'll do just that. They just want to be left alone, no matter how bad the world really is.

       Sadly, we have the power, we're just too afraid to assemble and use it (imagine 100k people in DC storming the white house, the govt wouldn't be able to do anything to stop it otherwise they'd end up with a PR nightmare and possibly a larger uprising to follow if they injured/killed the protesters).

       We are so apathetic because we're programmed to be that way. Anyone armed with facts are ridiculed as 'tin foil hatters' or 'truthers'.. we love our brand-stamping in America, hell I'd be willing to bet that most of us will recognize a corporate logo before we recognize one of our own states. Unfortunately the morons and assholes are the ones running the show, and the rest of us have to hold on for dear life. Of course, maybe letting go would be a better option at this point.

       Fiction is compelling. Facts are often boring. The point is, that people are so quick to fall in line with the 'official story'. I blame the media for 90% of this. Most, if not all feeds, 'Independent' or not, have done their share of promoting the terror scare.

       I was just watching "Morning Joe" this morning, even though I can't stand Joe.   Anyway they had this author of a new book come on and talk about how Saudis have been manipulating oil prices since the NIXON era in order to get Republicans elected.   Shady shit and oil have been going on for that long!   They were basically talking about how they completely fucked Carter too.   The "hostage crisis" that got Regan elected was completely cooked up to fuck Carter..... as if skyrocketing gas prices and shortages weren't enough.

       Read Greg Palast's "Armed Madhouse" for probably the most well-researched, and frankly, distressing insight into how Bush "won" the 2004 election. It's also a brutal insight into the power struggle between the two parties who were largely behind and wanted the Iraq war and their rather different goals (Big Oil, and the State Department accordingly).

       Fahrenheit 9/11 isn't even the tip of the iceberg of how the world of commerce, politics, and religion really functions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The culture that you were born into didn't begin with your arrival in it, it's a complex web coming down through history, and what average, working-poor/lower middle class type newswatchers would consider "conspiracy theory" is seen by the educated as just being the way that our civilization developed. It's not a secret, it's all out there, it's just that most people will never have any desire to know the truth about their own culture or their own history.

       Be very very careful. It is okay to be angry about things, but if you become too much of a free thinker, then you will be labeled a "truther". It is similar to leprosy. You are allowed to be upset but NEVER question anything.

       It has nothing to do with agreeing, the very act of raising a question is enough to be labeled  and thrust into a compartment. It is a villification of anyone who doesn't conform to majority sentiments. Once the perjoritive is established, it serves as an easy way to marginalize anyone who "isn't like us".

       I never held you accountable for having been programmed. Relax. At worst, I was frustrated and disappointed by people such as yourself who adamantly insisted on living in a very vocal state of denial. But, I never held you accountable for the actions of the scum who made you that way. I can only imagine what it must feel like to suddenly realize that you were fiercely determined to be wrong for 10 years... while also only beginning to discover that you weren't actually to blame for that, either.

       Thanks for all the feedback. Yeah, I've been a closet truther in the last few months. In all honesty, I have r/conspiracy to thank for that. I've also watched Loose Change which made things a little more clear.

       I still remember where I was ten years ago when this all unfolded. It made me think it was a Tom Clancy novel unfolding right before my eyes. I knew it might be bullshit, but then I just got suckered into everything after seeing the coverage, of all places, on Fox. Ugh.

       Just because an alternative viewpoint is being presented, it doesn't mean there is no agenda. Oftentimes the agenda is much stronger than the so-called mainstream media.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would encourage you to double check any information presented to you. A lot of these "conspiracy" (for want of a better word) documentaries are made by people :
      </p>
      <p>
       a) with a rigid viewpoint and/or agenda
      </p>
      <p>
       b) a complete lack of expertise on the subject
      </p>
      <p>
       c) lacking in logic who jump to huge conclusions
      </p>
      <p>
       And then there is disinfo, just outright lies or distortions.

       Believe me, the last few months I've been more engaging at looking at the other sides of stories. I don't take anything for face value anymore. It's just brainwashing at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right before Tripoli was captured by the rebels, I saw some video posted on here that talked about how better things were in Libya when Gaddafi took control of the control. All the perks the citizens got and how they were better off with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the Lockerbie incident was mentioned and how it was a setup because Gaddafi wanted to switch from the dollar to the African Dinar. How the whole incident was a lie and that scientist is now saying that he was offered several million dollars to lie on the behalf of the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       So after watching this video, I saw something on the news and told my wife in a tl;dr format about Gadaffi, and what the real play is behind the scenes. We're both smart people and she trusts what I read and talk about with her. She was puzzled, but realized it made sense. I just didn't ramble off without any facts behind my statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything, I'm more educated on a lot of things, and lately it's been affecting my mind because, for all of my life, everything is pretty much a lie that we're born into and made to believe it as reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see why now people who expose the truth or counter any claims wind up being called nutjobs or wind up in "accidents." As long as I see facts backed with claims about something that isn't the way it's supposed to be, I'll believe. I always seek the truth now.

       I was just trying to advise caution because the tone of your posts were so energetic. I know that sounds weird, but some people go headfirst down the rabbit hole without keeping tabs on how deep they've gone.

       I'm a smart guy. I'm not that crazy. I know what's extreme and what's fine.

      <p>
       I sound energetic because I have r/conspiracy to talk to and I just felt I had to admit to you that "look, this is where I was, I am here now, I like you guys. Keep up discussions."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a place for me to not feel like I'm an outsider. Other like minded people I can talk to on here. It's just hard being an American and wanting to admit you know everything is not face value.

       OP, I hope you know this scumbaggery goes back to the Philippines, 1899, and further back still.  For a country always shrieking about "freedom" and "democracy", America has spent a lot of time working to take away other people's rights.

       I've been a Chomsky fan for years. I recently started reading his books again. I've absorbed the gist of Hopes and Prospects and now see the overall picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's ingrained in my mind that the US will stop at nothing to ensure that they will always be the dominant power in the world. No matter what.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it means crippling a country's economy with "free trade", or if it means removing "a thug dictator," we keep our interests at heart in the name of peace and justice.
      </p>
      <p>
       I consider Moore as someone who breaks it down to the average Joe. I consider Chomsky more of a, "here are the details about what you've seen/read about in the news."

       Well....one of them.  I think there was a HELLUVA lot of shady shit going on in the banking World.... and of course the trillion dollars missing from the CIA.  Our Government is just so corrupt right now.   We elected Obama wishing for a good guy.  Unfortunately he is no better than the rest.  His biggest contributor was Goldman Sachs.

       There is a difference between "Not Knowing" and "Ignorance"...
"Not knowing" is not knowing something happened/exists.
"Ignorance" is when you refuse to even acknowledge it even happened/exists.

       Michael Moore never speaks ill of Israel. When he made Farenheit 9-11, his checks were signed by Disney (run by Michael Eisner at the time).
      </p>
      <p>
       He's a softer Alex Jones but does use more facts and leaves many important ones out.  When asked why he won't talk about NORAD standing down, he replied "that would be un-american."

       Oh really?  You didn't get rich because gullible retards went to see Bowling for Columbine in droves, voluntarily giving you their money for a product you created and introduced into a (relatively) free market?  You didn't sue your producers for another 3 million in profits from Fahrenheit 9/11?  How does he think he got rich?

       He's a shitty documentarian and a fraud.  He's such an empty vessel that he even had to steal the name for his damn movie. (Which Ray Bradbury was upset about, by the way.)  There's no way I could take anything he ever says seriously.

       I agree that there are plenty of things to justifiably criticize Moore about. But still, there is some useful content in
       <em>
        Fahrenheit 9/11
       </em>
       , such as scenes of Congress members admitting on camera that they often vote on bills without reading them.

       Moore lost all his credibility when he tried to pin 9/11 on Saudi Arabia - mixing utter bullshit in with just enough facts (and a side order of entertaining soundbites) to make it all seem plausible.

       In all fairness, the Bin laden family has a lot of financial ties to the Bush family. Bush, being someone who helped 9/11 go down, is complicit, and therefore his business partners. Everyone's hands are dirty.

       If you weren't a "conspiracy nut" as CircusAtari puts it, you would already know the flaws in a movie you apparently revere.  Long story short, it's trash TV in which he ignores anything that does not further the position he is trying to sell - not really a trait of a respectable documentary.

       Again where are the lies? sure Moore has a bias but where are the lies? your link is a blog about an opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please post solid facts, this is an opinion blog and nothing more.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you note at the bottom of this blog they even had to make corrections themselves: Correction, June 22, 2004: This piece originally referred to terrorist attacks by Abu Nidal's group on the Munich and Rome airports. The 1985 attacks occurred at the Rome and Vienna airports. (Return to the corrected sentence.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet nothing about pointing out factual discrepancy's. I dont agree with the entire Moore documentary but when you separate facts and opinion's the facts seem to stand on their own.
