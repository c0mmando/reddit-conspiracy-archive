    <div class="md"><p>For what it&#39;s worth, the &quot;wake up, sheeple&quot; line is only really annoying to those who are already awake to what has been going on. It&#39;s annoying like an alarm clock that you can&#39;t turn off. And, now that r/politics and r/worldnews are reflecting much of the same content as r/conspiracy, it seems that more people are awake now than previously (during the heyday of that phrase)... thus, it&#39;s now becoming annoying to a lot more people. What we mustn&#39;t forget, however, is that this phrase actually motivated a great many people to do just that: wake up (at least to a limited extent - enough to mount widespread activism).</p>

<p>We&#39;re talking about a nation of almost 300 million people, about 90% of whom were lulled to sleep by the repetitive drone of the official narrative (interwoven with all of the other sleep-inducing aspects of the corporatocracy). The fact that these statistics have now turned almost 180 degrees (80% no longer accept the narrative that had them in their slumber), is a testament to the efficacy of these somewhat aggressive and annoying phrases.</p>

<p>It really is very similar to the alarm clock analogy. It makes one stop and think &quot;hey, did that person just dismiss me the way I&#39;ve been dismissing them? how dare they? I now have to rethink this and dig a bit deeper.&quot;</p>

<p>That having been said, though, your initial point deserves repeating</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the real winner in the effectiveness department is the MSM considering we have 80% not believing the government&#39;s version of the conspiracy and still have not reached a tipping point in public outrage. Their &quot;repetitive drone&quot; has kept the lid on it in spite of the recent numbers saying they no longer believe the spin job.  Powerful stuff.

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent point. Which is precisely why I wanted to nip the cliche-hating in the bud. There are far more productive places to place our contempt than in-fighting among ourselves about whether or not a tactic is effective and/or how effective a tactic is. The institutions which have oppressed us have been drawing upon the resources of professional research and polishing the process for decades. Whereas we, the oppressed, have had to rely solely on our disorganized collective individualisms to overcome that great beast. Truth and determination have been our two greatest allies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that no one cares, it&#39;s mostly a feeling of helplessness when you look at the problem and realize that beyond some great uprising of the people, nothing will change.</p>

<p>As long as people can keep doing their 9-5 job and taking care of their family, then they&#39;ll do just that. They just want to be left alone, no matter how bad the world really is.</p>

<p>Sadly, we have the power, we&#39;re just too afraid to assemble and use it (imagine 100k people in DC storming the white house, the govt wouldn&#39;t be able to do anything to stop it otherwise they&#39;d end up with a PR nightmare and possibly a larger uprising to follow if they injured/killed the protesters).</p>

<p>Yeah. I almost fell for Wikileaks, but they shot themselves and I laughed, turning my back on them.</p>

<p>We are so apathetic because we&#39;re programmed to be that way. Anyone armed with facts are ridiculed as &#39;tin foil hatters&#39; or &#39;truthers&#39;.. we love our brand-stamping in America, hell I&#39;d be willing to bet that most of us will recognize a corporate logo before we recognize one of our own states. Unfortunately the morons and assholes are the ones running the show, and the rest of us have to hold on for dear life. Of course, maybe letting go would be a better option at this point.</p>

Anyway they had this author of a new book come on and talk about how Saudis have been manipulating oil prices since the NIXON era in order to get Republicans elected.   Shady shit and oil have been going on for that long!   They were basically talking about how they completely fucked Carter too.

At worst, I was frustrated and disappointed by people such as yourself who adamantly insisted on living in a very vocal state of denial.

    <div class="md"><p>Just because an alternative viewpoint is being presented, it doesn&#39;t mean there is no agenda. Oftentimes the agenda is much stronger than the so-called mainstream media.</p>

<p>I would encourage you to double check any information presented to you. A lot of these &quot;conspiracy&quot; (for want of a better word) documentaries are made by people :</p>

<p>a) with a rigid viewpoint and/or agenda</p>

<p>b) a complete lack of expertise on the subject</p>

<p>c) lacking in logic who jump to huge conclusions</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Believe me, the last few months I&#39;ve been more engaging at looking at the other sides of stories. I don&#39;t take anything for face value anymore. It&#39;s just brainwashing at this point.</p>

<p>Right before Tripoli was captured by the rebels, I saw some video posted on here that talked about how better things were in Libya when Gaddafi took control of the control. All the perks the citizens got and how they were better off with him.</p>

<p>Then the Lockerbie incident was mentioned and how it was a setup because Gaddafi wanted to switch from the dollar to the African Dinar. How the whole incident was a lie and that scientist is now saying that he was offered several million dollars to lie on the behalf of the US.</p>

<p>So after watching this video, I saw something on the news and told my wife in a tl;dr format about Gadaffi, and what the real play is behind the scenes. We&#39;re both smart people and she trusts what I read and talk about with her. She was puzzled, but realized it made sense. I just didn&#39;t ramble off without any facts behind my statement.</p>

<p>If anything, I&#39;m more educated on a lot of things, and lately it&#39;s been affecting my mind because, for all of my life, everything is pretty much a lie that we&#39;re born into and made to believe it as reason.</p>

<p>I see why now people who expose the truth or counter any claims wind up being called nutjobs or wind up in &quot;accidents.&quot; As long as I see facts backed with claims about something that isn&#39;t the way it&#39;s supposed to be, I&#39;ll believe. I always seek the truth now.</p>

<p>EDIT: Not that it really matters, it&#39;s an accurate statement. However, it is contextually ambiguous. I&#39;ll give you an upvote to try to get you back to a balanced karma count, but still... it&#39;s kind of pointless to make an important point that doesn&#39;t have a point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I refuse to watch a movie made by a fat rich white man who insists &quot;capitalism has never done anything [for him]&quot;</p>

<p>Oh really?  You didn&#39;t get rich because gullible retards went to see Bowling for Columbine in droves, voluntarily giving you their money for a product you created and introduced into a (relatively) free market?  You didn&#39;t sue your producers for another 3 million in profits from Fahrenheit 9/11?  How does he think he got rich?</p>

<p>He&#39;s a shitty documentarian and a fraud.  He&#39;s such an empty vessel that he even had to steal the name for his damn movie. (Which Ray Bradbury was upset about, by the way.)  There&#39;s no way I could take anything he ever says seriously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that there are plenty of things to justifiably criticize Moore about. But still, there is some useful content in <em>Fahrenheit 9/11</em>, such as scenes of Congress members admitting on camera that they often vote on bills without reading them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good, now that you&#39;ve seen Michael Moore&#39;s ridiculous propaganda flick, look up the HUGE number of inaccuracies and flat out lies Moore made for the movie. This way you are neither an ignorant sheep, nor a crazy conspiracy theorist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you weren&#39;t a &quot;conspiracy nut&quot; as CircusAtari puts it, you would already know the flaws in a movie you apparently revere.  Long story short, it&#39;s trash TV in which he ignores anything that does not further the position he is trying to sell - not really a trait of a respectable documentary.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a good start: <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2102723">http://www.slate.com/id/2102723</a></p>

<p>Christopher Hitchens is actually a respectable human being, too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again where are the lies? sure Moore has a bias but where are the lies? your link is a blog about an opinion.</p>

<p>Please post solid facts, this is an opinion blog and nothing more. </p>

<p>If you note at the bottom of this blog they even had to make corrections themselves: Correction, June 22, 2004: This piece originally referred to terrorist attacks by Abu Nidal&#39;s group on the Munich and Rome airports. The 1985 attacks occurred at the Rome and Vienna airports. (Return to the corrected sentence.) </p>

<p>Yet nothing about pointing out factual discrepancy&#39;s. I dont agree with the entire Moore documentary but when you separate facts and opinion&#39;s the facts seem to stand on their own.  </p>
