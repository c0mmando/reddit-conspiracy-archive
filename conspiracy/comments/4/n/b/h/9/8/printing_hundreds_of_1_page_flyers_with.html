       Be careful if you are using a color printer. There are embedded tracking codes detailing the printer and the time of printing on every printed page. That means if these fliers upset the wrong person they can probably be tracked back to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Photocopying might be a better solution.

       I would take a look at the post with the list of confirmed conspiracies and probably put the most amazing ones that the average people don't know. Like say 9/11 was an inside job, and prove it by showing about Operation Northwoods was released by official government documents in a Freedom of information act request.

       Personally I would stay away from using 9/11 initially. Too many people avoid it because they can't fathom people would do that &amp; they will dismiss the entire message.
      </p>
      <p>
       Entice them with others and let them get into 9/11 themselves. I feel that would have more impact.

       Whatever you decide to put on it I would make it completely factual. Use only proven conspiracies and stay away from theories. Leave opinions and emotion out of it and let people know that it is 100% fact. Spread awareness. I really like this idea OP. I would like to help.

       I was about to post something nearly identical to this. If people can factually dismiss only one piece of that flier, they will dismiss the entire thing. Stick with lesser known, powerful statistics. Consider this structure -
      </p>
      <p>
       1 piece of political fact
      </p>
      <p>
       1 piece of economic fact
      </p>
      <p>
       1 piece of military, war fact
      </p>
      <p>
       1 piece of social fact -
       <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r_YhkHFloLA/maxresdefault.jpg">
        90% of the media is owned by 6 people
       </a>
       and name the CEOs
      </p>
      <p>
       not necessarily in that order. Give 4 - 5 easy to understand, shocking facts from across the spectrum to provoke the viewers interest to do more research on their own. That is the end goal. With the internet, the rabbit hole is out there and easily accessible, but one must be aware and empowered to take that plunge on their own.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR: The goal would be to create awareness and provoke thought. It needs to be easily digestible by the majority and stated in fact.

       For example, the board could be something like:
      </p>
      <p>
       The private Federal Reserve is stealing your money.
      </p>
      <p>
       The People of America pays back billions in interest to the Reserve, for simply printing money.
      </p>
      <p>
       The money to pay them back comes from tax money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tax money that could fund free college...

      <p>
       ...but is used to fund both sides of every war, ultimately funding the terrorists.

       Go to r/conspiracy &gt; Top &gt; Year (or Month)
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of these headlines are not actually conspiracies, many of them are, at least based on, undisputed fact. This would be a good place to start. bookmark or paste 20 - 30 of the most moving headlines and begin to analyze and piece them together. Many of them are related in one way or another which should help you come up with 3 - 5 solid topics or core-problems with our country/society or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       At that point you could probably find a fact or statistic that supports each core topic and you would be good to go. Make sure you site the source for each bullet point and keep away from rhetoric, opinion and commentary. I would think govt. institutional and msm sources would have the biggest impact to your audience, just make sure they can not be discredited.

       I'll try to compile a list of things. Like I said stick to facts. I would definitely leave out involving the homeless. Definitely help them out, but this does not need to be involved. This is a separate issue. As someone said there should be a list of proven conspiracies stickied to this sub. I've been very busy but when I get some time I'll PM you with some helpful info. I really do love this idea.

       I also think its key to spread the message that we are all in this together. The little people vs the machine that is big business, big pharma, military industrial complex, politics, etc.

       For a few summers in my tourist town, I would write up flyers myself (as another said, color printers can be tracked). I wrote in big font so drivers as well as walkers could see, and I'd put stuff like "RESEARCH: PROJECT MK ULTRA" or "BOYCOTT ISRAEL FOR APARTHEID" and so forth, with a link written much smaller to a Wiki article, or a news article on the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw a few people stop and read them, and made friends with two guys who had stopped to read one outside of a bar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also got yelled at by a drunk lady for a poster related to the Boston Marathon (simply telling people to look into it).
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck.

       Not to put anybody down, but homeless people aren't exactly taken seriously by the average business man whose attention you're trying to grab. If you want people to read and consider the information I don't think that is the way to go about it.
      </p>

       I'm all for helping the homeless, but that can be done in other ways.

       True, but it gets the flyers out. One step at a time, if you educate them first they'll talk about it to others also.

       Maybe print 2 - 4 fliers per piece of card stock. This way they will be easier to read, hold and pass out. Readers are more willing to take something and look at it if it's easy to hold and can get the idea of it in a single glance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make sure the design is clean, not cluttered. The more professional it looks the better. PM me if you would like me to do the layout and design for you using adobe pro bono.
      </p>
      <p>
       Homeless people may not be the best idea. like the other user said, people tend to ignore them and it would automatically give the viewer a negative perception of the flier. Not to mention, I could see a lot of your fliers getting thrown out and the cash pocketed the second you turn your back. Not all,
       <em>
        (pc friends)
       </em>
       but some..
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can have a few well dressed people hand them out with you, in a polite and professional manor. If you can wear suits and over do it, thats even better if your near a business district. The other option would be to post them on poles, covertly drop them off in the lobbies of businesses and put them on the windshields of parked cars. Do that shit gorilla style.
      </p>
      <p>
       I apologize for my douche-baggery, but I love the idea and would be glad to help however I can.

       might not actually be a bad place to start. If this article was cleaned up and compressed it could actually make a pretty cool 1984 themed flier itself, but I doubt that's what you're going for. although '90% of the media is owned by 6 corporations' could be a good point to add.

       You're right, my mistake. Companies like Red bull made that
       <em>

       marketing popular, which I'm sure stems from guerrilla warfare.

 about chemtrails.  This was mostly because of the amount of disinformation that the conspiracy theorists 
unknowingly put out there.  If you put out ONE piece of information that does not hold up, most people will dismiss ALL the theories and probably never look back at it again.  It is really important for us to be meticulous and logical if we want to make a legitimate difference.  Try to remember that most people are very turned off by conspiracy theories in general.

       You'd be surprised how many people are there and how many others they interact with. Plus it's cheaper and easier to find volunteers, most standard citizens "don't have time" or are afraid to speak out let alone pass out information.

       This is actually the easiest and beneficial thing one can do in the community, it's just that nobody wants to spare their time or money to make it happen.

       Don't listen to these people telling you to avoid recent events. Fuck that, sounds like disinfo to be honest. Recent events are what will grab people's attention.

       I agree as far as keeping it to facts not theories - list a bunch of suspicious facts about 9/11, for example, then pose the question: Conspiracy or Coincidence? You Decide.

       As far as 9/11 goes, since most people will instantly associate anything questioning the official story with "crazy 9/11 truthers", I think you need only mention WTC 7 and how THREE towers of the WTC, not two, fell that day. And maybe include a youtube link to footage of WTC 7 collapsing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people have no idea and I know it blew my mind when I found out and confirmed to me once and for all that the "official story" is bullshit.

       I'd really urge you not to bring up 9/11.  It's so polarizing and almost tabboo.  People have very strong convictions that you simply will not change for 99% of people.  It's a psychological quirk of the human mind: challenge their convictions directly with perfect fact and they'll resist no matter what.  99% of the people that see 9/11 will turn off their brains and throw away your pamphlet instantly.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you bring up something factual, nondebatable AND it is something most people don't already have convctions on....then you stand a chance of getting through.  Just plant the seed, don't try to expose the "matrix" in one grand strike.
      </p>

       The Fed is a great example.   Most people don't even know it exists, let alone what it does.  Your words might even be the first they've ever heard on the matter.  The power of the first word is huge.

      <p>
       gotta be a simple jumping on point. i feel like it's gotta mention the corrupt press -- that is THE sticking point for most people. "it would have come out by now!" maybe something like this for a rough draft:
      </p>
      <p>
       You always hear about Russian Propaganda, Russian Propaganda, Russian Propaganda. You never hear about... American Propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing about propaganda is that it won't work if you know it's propaganda. I'm very sorry to tell you this, but you must know the terrible truth: We are being lied to, on a
       <em>
        massive
       </em>
       scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       "By whom?" you ask? Our own government. Or, more specifically, by the corporations and extremely wealthy people who effectively own both our government and our mainstream media.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "news" you see on CNN, FoxNews, BBC, MSNBC... virtually
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       "news" outlet... is nothing more than propaganda intended to mislead you, to convince you to cry for wars against countries that never harmed us in the slightest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, 9/11 was an inside job, performed by intelligence agencies and traitors within our own government. It was a crime, used to trick the American public into accepting war against Afghanistan and Iraq.. then Libya, Yemen, and Syria, either directly or by proxy. These countries did nothing to us. Nothing. And yet our armies have killed millions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps even more disgusting, our military -- brave military men &amp; women, who
       <em>
        thought
       </em>
       they were fighting to defend our country against "terrorism", were being used as tools, themselves inflicting terror against innocent people who never harmed us in any way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then when they come home they are discarded and abandoned. Why? Because many of them know they've been fooled. They know they weren't fighting to defend freedom, but rather fighting for corporations that cared only for profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, our government has been overrun by criminals.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a result, our economy is collapsing. The Federal Reserve is printing US Dollars to try to prop it up at an unprecedented rate. These dollars are backed by... nothing. The US Treasury has no gold. It was looted long ago. Those dollars in your wallet, in your bank account, in your retirement fund are only as valuable as the world says they are -- and the much of the world, in an act of self-defense, has formed its own banking system: the BRICS, consisting of Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa and over 100 other nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a result, the US dollar is rapidly losing its value as those unwanted dollars and Treasury Bills return to American shores. The Federal Reserve is printing unprecedented amounts of dollars to try to prop up the economy. They call it "Quantitative Easing"; it's really Zimbabwe-style inflation.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are on the cusp of hyper-inflation, where so many dollars have been printed, they will be worth less and less. Stores, including grocery stores, may shut down as their efficient "just-in-time" delivery model breaks down, bringing shortages of food, medicine, and other essential supplies.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a possible prediction of where the U.S. economy is heading, take a look at Venezuela. Former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan has warned that Venezuela is under martial law, and "America is next".
       <a href="https://www.intellihub.com/coming-destruction-alan-greenspan-warns-venezuela-under-martial-law-and-america-is-next/">
        https://www.intellihub.com/coming-destruction-alan-greenspan-warns-venezuela-under-martial-law-and-america-is-next/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       When will this happen? We're already in the early stages. You may have noticed the layoffs and some stores closing. This will get much worse in the coming weeks and months before it gets better.
      </p>
      <p>
       What can you do? Stock up on essentials. Food. Water. Medication. Toiletries. Get to know your neighbors. Reconnect with family and friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       And spread the word.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government and the corporations that own it have spread the idea that anybody who learns about their criminality is a "conspiracy theories" and is somebody to be laughed at. They invented this tactic after President John F. Kennedy's assassination, to discourage people from investigating his murder. Yes, our president was killed by traitors within our own government. We hear about assassinations in other countries. It can happen here too. It did happen here.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's a lot of bad news, but forewarned is forearmed. And ignoring the problem won't make it go away. We don't know quite what the future will bring, but there is every possibility that the United States will break up, much like the Soviet Union did.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have some tough days ahead. The good news is that, with hard work and care, we can rebuild our economy -- perhaps as separate States, as our founding fathers intended, in alliance but not controlled by a criminal class, but as a free people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please, above everything else: Look after each other. We'll get through this.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       ...needs pics from the wars, things we don't see on the news. Needs something to reach out to police and get them on our side. I intentionally did not mention Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe include some solid news sources -- e.g., Corbett Report -- for those that want to learn more. Make a PDF and seed the fuck out of torrents. Print hard copies and leave stacks around town.

       Look I get the whole conspiracy awareness shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suggest a new approach. Why not teach something useful. Say like how to make gasoline. Its easy enough to get oil. You can make a reactor and burn off your own plastics to get oil. Trust me there is soooooo much you can harvest from your own garbage generation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or even collection if you want to go that route. Making your own harvesting apparatus is simple as well. For your waste oil you can turn into a local garage for free. Waste oil for them is a free thing that they just recycle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its cheap and easy. You can get some fuel from it least enough for a lawnmower or if you want to be a badass you can go and refine crude for the cheap.
      </p>
      <p>
       Usually you get 20 gallons with a home set up off 55 gallons of crude.
      </p>
      <p>
       People know the world is a sham its obvious and they don't want to hear it. You teach them a new skill perhaps they make it better over time. Show them how to grow seeds. Believe it or not many don't know the basics. Its put a seed in dirt then boom its harvest tommrow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't work like that. Perhaps edible plants in the area. Where you can get local foods. Just something to fight the system not make awareness to its existence.

       Peoples eyes are open. They know on some level of corruption. The thing is to teach them something they don't know or believe is beyond their level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its called empowerment. You give them confidence. An alternative to the bullshit they know will kill small town America. Even shopping local is a huge step. Not only for their wellbeing cause trust me we have been doing it for the better part of a year now, and I have better health then ever before.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wake up and go all day till the sun goes down. Getting involved with the community is another big step. Its small shit like this. Sure a theory will get them to do a Google search and then shitpost all over Facebook then get mad and resent everyone they know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or you can do what I said and have them come to the realization on their own and ease into it. Either way choice is all you. Reach 1 person or 100.

       Let's try something with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am going to assume you are on your own with a job. You realize that money is hard to come by so you stretch every dollar far as you can. So one of the main things you need is food.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am sure you have heard of extreme coupon the show. Where these people get like 2000 dollars worth of shit for like 2 bucks. Well believe it or not that is possible even now. The trick is math. See lots of stores offer in house discounts on everything but staples.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bread, milk, eggs, and other shit like sugar and flour. That's why you always see them with toilet paper and 55 gallon drums of juice. Cause manufactures will no bullshit send you coupons for that shit for free if you send them a letter or email.
      </p>
      <p>
       People want to claim its the show offsetting the cost of that shit. It isn't really cause the products they buy are advertised in the show if you watched it. Not the actual product but the maker was. Never did I see them get a store brand of a goddamn thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wife and I did it for a while. See we got 360 bucks worth of shit. Had a coupon roll that took 30 minutes to scan. Knocked that bitch down to 32 dollars. Granted it was household shit like laundry soap and paper towels cause you won't get staples just processed and household goods.
      </p>
      <p>
       The math is so simple and you can get coupons online too.  Coupondiva is a good one the wife used. But like I said you email a maker of a product you like or want to try and they WILL mail you a free voutcher.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every fucking time they did with us. Even the E-cig makers. World really is your oyster if you just ask for some of its pearls.

       It gives you a place to start with saving money. I planted the seed and gave you a place to start. If you do then great but never the less its somewhere to begin.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's all you have to do. Everyone I have ever met in life that is better then me at something I asked questions and learned. Never was I jealous.
      </p>
      <p>
       A good friend of mine on Reddit when I started Lego. He was a dick! Real asshole but I learned from him and he showed me how to price match and sell. In 2 years we had over 1700 sets. Larger of a collection then anyone else I know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because I took time to learn. Some people are like that others need their hand held thru every single step. I like self sustainment. So I prefer the get busy living or get busy dying approach with people.

       A bad position? I don't get how you think education is more of a danger then enlightenment or a variation of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everywhere I go and everything I do is on the principals I have given you in my first comment. People seem to think the world works on the construct they have been conjured into believing because someone in an position of authority has told them this is how it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you show them there is another way it spreads faster then wildfire. Because others see it. Sure some mock you but its because they don't understand. They will see the rewards of it very quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then they try it perhaps even improve the methods. Its much more of a brilliant idea of they come up with it themselves. You give them the basics and just watch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or do what others are saying and make some ho hum shit that has been done so many times just to litter the streets with more paper as people throw it away.

       Even better. You can show how fuel is made. Right now this is my thing cause I know its going to be 5 bucks a gallon after Hillary becomes president. Cause she will its written in stone. Doesnt matter what you want or think.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or education. Oh that's a big one. How if schools were for education how come they don't teach you where our money comes from? How to balance a bank account? Or how to change a flat tire.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just simple everyday shit? How it was Rockefeller is the one that was a major push behind public education. He didn't want educated people he wanted indentured servants to the products he made.
      </p>
      <p>
       That guy was a master of spin. He fought so hard to become a mother fucker and he is remembered as a saint. Did you know that up until 1940s I bekive you could damn near ride trolley cars across the USA? We had some serious public transport.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was Rockefeller and Henry Ford that fucked that for us. See Rockefeller was the major fuel maker in the USA at the time. He made kerosene for lamps in homes but with electricity coming into play he knew he had to shift gears.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ford actually made the model T to run on e85 cause it was easier and people could make it themselves at the time. Well Rockefeller seized that shit and got with ford to change the engine to run on gasoline.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the both of them bought all the Tolley cars and scrapped them. All of them! If you go into some small towns in the midwest you will still see the rail lines. Even major cities they have the rails.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of shit that is just forgotten but only cause those with power give us the illusion of choice when we don't have one.
