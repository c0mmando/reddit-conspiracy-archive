        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve never really been disturbed or afraid by anything; seeing people die brutal deaths in those snuff films that pervade the dark net, public speaking, the eventuality of death. Nothing really. It wasn&#39;t until I came across this sub that I became truly frightened for the first time in my life.</p>

<p>I guess it&#39;s because I&#39;ve always tried to be an objective person. I&#39;ve always tried to eliminate all of the false beliefs I held and construct an ontological paradigm that I believe accurately describes the reality in which we live. But through perusing this sub I&#39;ve discovered that I live in a world teeming with lies. A matrix. And that I have no control. I feel powerless and that scares me. Seeing all of the posts about people being murdered and their deaths being ruled suicides despite the compelling evidence that points to the contrary. The post that was just shared about Erin Elizabeth who is investigating the deaths of countless holistic doctors in Florida. And seeing the videos of her phone being controlled and her computer being tapped. It makes me wonder if there&#39;s any point to any of this. Even now on the surface web using reddit or Facebook or Google and knowing that everything I search, everything I pore over is unremittingly and methodically being documented. Even services like FreeNet or Tor or any other anonymous platform will inevitably be infiltrated by the government (Tor already has) and there will come a time when privacy is luxury, or maybe even fantasy. Will we ever break free from this? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if any of you have seen the movie &quot;The Conspiracy&quot; but there&#39;s this scene where one of the protagonists sort of mentally breaks down: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0TqQhBeDP0&amp;t=45m20s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0TqQhBeDP0&amp;t=45m20s</a>            </p>

<p>It&#39;s just made me think a lot about things. About if any of the despots or tyrants (or anyone for that matter) throughout history that have ever commanded prodigious power or came close to ruling the world like Adolf Hitler, Stalin, Sadam Hussein, Idi Amin, Pol Pot, were actually powerful. Or if they just were just an actor in someone else&#39;s play. </p>

<p>This clandestine, invisible hand that guides and supervises our every action, manipulates our every thought and has the ability to kill and silence anyone who opposes them. As someone who has been an atheist for 10 years I think I finally know why I&#39;m so afraid: Because for thousands of years human beings have sycophantically adulated man-made deities in the sky and for the first time in human history there exists an entity -- a small group of the wealthiest elite -- that meet the definitive characteristics of God. All-knowing, all-seeing, omnipresent, and all-powerful. </p>

<p>I just don&#39;t know how I&#39;ll ever view things the same ever again. I know this sub has been devoted to covering political material for some time. I just had to get this off my chest. </p>

<p>Once you take the pill, you wont. Mate, just take a few breathes and just relax. You got a dog? Take it out for a walk in nature. Embrace the actual world around you. They are trying to rob you of this. We belong in nature. The clip from your clip is correct: &quot;They run things, always have, always will&quot;. Doesn&#39;t mean anything though, to self. If you are genuine which I think you are, take it in strides and just breathe. They can have their cabal, but they can never truly have you (unless you let them - which is what they want). Peace and love.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, things like DMT can definitely crack the window open to the other side. However Spiritual practices like advanced kriya yoga, ego death via mystical practices, merging with the Holy Spirit/Higher Self can give you permanent access to the other side, so you live with one foot in each realm</p>

<p>If you <em>really</em> want to be afraid, realize that its not just one small group, but many, all vying with each other for power. In part that&#39;s good because they can keep each other in check. Unfortunately, in the places they all (or mostly) agree, the little guy is pretty much SOL. And when one of those group&#39;s power suddenly shifts up or down it can have dire repercussions. </p>

<p>It would be interesting to try to map these groups. Who they are, how they are interlinked and rank them according to power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its like a mafia,  it depends on consensus,   and it depends on superior information.    Why not run society like a plantation,   where the plebs are exploited like farm animals?    Especially if you are a psychopath.    Its been the pattern.    Why do you mention people like Saddam,  but omit Dick Cheney types?    Because in the greatest power on earth,   the US,   the real leaders are somewhat anonymous?   The politicians do have some real power,   but evidently they answer to others on Wall Street and in the Military Industry etc.</p>

<p>This is an information war,  it depends on secrecy and those willing to provide cover to the secrets.    Their power is really quite fragile.    It depends on the agreement of the 99%.    So,  the media is not going to be left to chance.</p>

The wealthy elite are powerful but they are <em>far</em> from omniscient let alone omnipotent. It is far more comforting to believe that a small cabal are running everything from the shadows than to recognise that we are a seven billion confused, scared, hairless apes clinging to a rock hurtling through space with no one really knowing what the fuck is happening or what they are really doing outside the shortest of short-term plans.

<p>I&#39;m afraid this is just a projection from the mindset of someone who cannot imagine a world without God. You may feel the need for a controlling authority, but most atheists do not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It can be terrifying to realize all at once, but it&#39;s something I have caught small pieces of all my life, and have hoped it did not become worse.</p>

<p>It is never helpful to live life with fear, but without knowing what to do, it&#39;s hard not to.</p>

<p>I&#39;d suggest simply keeping your head down, not rocking the boat in any great sense, and focusing on being a small power for your local community and government.</p>

<p>Eventually the global elites will fall into the same old pattern of human existence, and be at each others throats as they each try and be the one supreme ruler.</p>

<p>It may not happen this decade or the next, but it is an inevitable pattern.</p>

<p>The thing I truly fear is the likely result this will have on the planet and all of us.</p>

<p>As someone who isn&#39;t an atheist, but agnostic, I still can feel where you&#39;re coming from. Instead of believing in some weird story created by men hundreds or thousands of years ago, believe in the beauty of the organism we are all a part of, and try to put your best self forward into your life.</p>

<p>If we each do this, we can all live a beautiful life in the short time we have. Let go of what you can&#39;t control, and focus on what you can. You can let yourself lose your mind at the insanity you see around you, or you can accept it as part of reality, and make a choice about what you&#39;re going to do or not do about it.</p>

<p>Even if you choose to do as others have, and your silenced by being labeled a crazy conspiracy theorist, or you are killed for speaking out, you can live a much happier life, by simply not living in fear.</p>

<p>&quot;I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone, there will be nothing. Only I will remain.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand OP as I&#39;ve been there before too. Don&#39;t let the fear take over. Sure they run the world in mysterious ways and do their bidding, but they can&#39;t affect you if you don&#39;t allow it. This is a gorgeous world to live on and you can easily find your own happiness doing your own thing. If it worries you that much, buy some guns and ammo like I did for peace of mind. Stay strong and don&#39;t let fear overcome you because that&#39;s when they win.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aha, you will say.  “So they are evil!”  If what they are doing is evil, yes.  But it isn&#39;t evil because they did as they willed, or because everything they do is evil.  It is evil because it goes against that innate morality, and they know that as much as you do.  But they have untaught themselves morality—or tried to—in the same way.  In most cases, they aren&#39;t embracing evil anymore than you are.  They are tellingthemselves that evil doesn&#39;t exist.  In that way, they can do what they do without calling it evil.  </p>

<p>And even as they are doing evil things, they are still not Satanists.  Again, there is a big difference.  ASatanist does evil things on purpose, and believes they are good.  A Satanist will have flipped morality,enjoying doing harm, causing pain, and destroying beautiful things.  But as little respect as I have for hose running the world, I do not think that applies to them.  They don&#39;t appear to me to have the character it would take to be Satanic.  Satanists don&#39;t push moral relativism, for one thing.  Moral relativism is for the weak of will, not the strong of will.   Satanists would embrace the negative consequences of their actions, but those running the world prefer to  ignore the negative consequences. They are constantly in denial, telling you and themselves those things aren&#39;t really happening.  They are only a little less squishy than you are, the major difference being that their births have given them the power to do things,  even while  they are being indecisive and pusillanimous.     </p>

<p>There may be real Satanists running the world: I have no way of knowing.  But I see no evidence of it. A world run by Satanists would be far less squishy at all levels.  It might be a horrible place, but at least it would be firm to the touch.   </p>

<p>As I see it, the current Elders aren&#39;t Satanists.  They are just thieves.  They want to steal as much easy money as possible, as far as possible without you noticing.  They then use Satanism as another scare tactic, in case you notice.  They want you to think they are powerfully evil people, so that you don&#39;t even think of taking them on.  In other words, it is all a bluff.  Yes, they currently control a lot of armed people and may rub you out if they feel they have to.  I am not saying they won&#39;t.  But as individuals, they are not powerful wizards.  They are just the opposite.  This is what Frank Baum was telling us in The Wizard of Oz, though few got the message.  They are weak and shallow people in a precarious and vulnerable position, and they know that.  Their position will always be vulnerable because they are always fighting that innate sense of right and wrong inside everyone, even themselves.  You may think you cannot win, but it is they who cannot win.   Because they have set themselves against Nature herself, even as they win they lose.  As they reach out to take in their hands all they have worked for centuries to achieve, it slips away like mist.  What they had thought would taste sweet tastes only bitter.</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t lose your sanity, hope, or courage, friend.  Notice the insanity around you.  Help others notice it.  And we shall not be locked in this pseudo-control, panopticonic prison forever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything you said, and I&#39;d add the following.  They are gnostics.  Gnostics believe yahweh was evil (old testament god) and they are probably right.  I mean a god that needs you to sacrifice your son to prove you love him is a narcissistic, self-conscious borderline-personality-disorder god who is so anxious he fears abandonment so deeply he asks you to do those things.</p>

<p>At any rate, so God is bad and Lucifer is good, because lucifer is to them, hermes, a bejeweled god of intelligence and craft, a god that lets you handle the fire undamaged (&#39;tubalcain&#39;, &#39;enoch&#39;, &#39;prometheus&#39;) and doesn&#39;t punish you for pushing the envelope.</p>

<p>They also believe that polar extremes being reciprocally self-referential are part of the same continuum and therefore they are the same thing &#39;but different in degree&#39;, that&#39;s the hermetic principle encoded steganographically in the masons symbols of compass and square as a secondary, minor meaning of &#39;degrees on a continuum&#39;.  This is the principle of polarity or nondualism as it&#39;s called in buddhism.</p>

<p>Ultimately what I&#39;m getting to is this, and it&#39;s a restatement of The_Noble_Lie&#39;s idea that they don&#39;t think they are evil:</p>

<p>they think good/bad are qualities in all things, like yin and yang and the blackandwhite checkerboard of the freemasons that you see in practically every other pop video (there&#39;s a reason for that!)  Furthermore you see the iconography of the up and down arrows like the elevator. If you overlay up and down arrows you have the star of david.  You also have platonic fire+water.  Upright triangle is fire, downward triangle is water, representing the phallaus (fire) and womb (water)... in their system male is solar, firey, female is lunar and watery.  The result of fire and water is steam, which is expansion, pressure, technology....in gender terms also birth and creation.</p>

<p>Forgot to say, those are alchemy terms.  The aristocrats communicate in symbols, because that&#39;s what egyptians did.</p>

<p>They are alchemists who believe that the highest &#39;work&#39; or &#39;craft&#39; they can do is to pursue a &#39;unity of opposites&#39;, the &#39;coincidencia oppositorum&#39; in alchemy talk, which manifests as hegelian dialectic (thesis+antithesis==&gt;synthesis; or problem+reaction=&gt;solution), or for example forcing christians to participate in a symbolic islamic pilgrimage to mecca, which is the WTC memorial, a black square that people amble around in a spiral fashion...we know this given wtc was a work of islamic architecture by a japanese architect and we know this was their purpose by the name of wtc7 being the &#39;soloman building&#39;.</p>

<p>At any rate, these people are part of a network of aristocrats (freemasons and related secret socieites, the international &#39;ruling class&#39; some call &#39;illuminati&#39;) who are affiliated with people directly related to Jesus by blood (rothschild, italian mafia, papal, british royal saxecoburggoetha family), and so they are divine and therefore their <em>will</em> is more important than ours.  That makes us a de facto underclass to them, an actual different species that is lesser.  So they do what they want</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hitler was definitely an actor. Even with his own beliefs the Germany that came out of WW1 was a desperate one by design. That was meant to happen. All the elites of Europe knew what would come of an enslaved Germany. And the West vilified Hitler in mythological, cartoonish fashion. Most of what happened had very little to do with him and more to do with circumstance and planning and the desire of banks and corporations to make as much money as possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder if some reddit posts are propaganda meant to remind us of what evil entities are capable of with the purpose of making people feel hopeless.  Even though it would be good if all <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users were trustworthy and sincere, there&#39;s always the possibilty some aren&#39;t.  This isn&#39;t personally aimed toward you, but whenever I read this type of post it comes to mind.</p>

<p>As someone who has been an atheist for 10 years I think I finally know why I&#39;m so afraid: Because for thousands of years human beings have sycophantically adulated man-made deities in the sky and for the first time in human history there exists an entity -- a small group of the wealthiest elite -- that meet the definitive characteristics of God. All-knowing, all-seeing, omnipresent, and all-powerful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed!</p>

<p>Worse still, they carry all of the worst attributes of the &quot;God&quot; of the Abrahamic religions. </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/23651-the-god-of-the-old-testament-is-arguably-the-most">Richard Dawkins gave an apt description</a></strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>“The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully.”</li>
</ul>

<p>At least in Biblical times it was only an <em>imaginary</em> entity. Now it has manifest in reality - a hybrid humanity and technology that bears all of the worst traits of each.</p>

<p>Truly a terrifying Hydra.</p>

<p>Actually this has always been the case. I know you&#39;re just now a recovering atheist and it might be a bit much to digest but just look into the occult and it&#39;s history in the western world.</p>

<p>We as humans are Gods, even the bible tells us that the kingdom of God is within us all. Lucifer was the artist/creator. Through embracing Lucifer (our human ability to conceptualize and create) you can rule others who are unaware of the extent of their own powers.</p>

<p>Symbols, Language, Music, Culture, Psychology</p>

<p>Despite what the rationalists want to believe it&#39;s quite easy to rule and influence the world and it doesn&#39;t take grand schemes. Throughout time many people have glimpsed this power and even consolidated it, entire families are passed down this knowledge and are groomed to be masters unto slaves. </p>

<p>This is why many rationalists/atheists are obsessed with reducing us to animals or explaining our behaviors using models based on other animals (like apes), because it&#39;s just too much to acknowledge that we are Gods, that things like capitalism/communism/liberalism/government aren&#39;t rational and self regulating scientific models, they work through belief and intention alone, magick. </p>
