<li><p>An illusion it will be, so large, so vast it will escape their perception.</p></li>
<li><p>Those who will see it will be thought of as insane.</p></li>
<li><p>We will create separate fronts to prevent them from seeing the connection between us.</p></li>
<li><p>We will behave as if we are not connected to keep the illusion alive. Our goal will be accomplished one drop at a time so as to never bring suspicion upon ourselves. This will also prevent them from seeing the changes as they occur.</p></li>
<li><p>We will always stand above the relative field of their experience for we know the secrets of the absolute.</p></li>
<li><p>We will work together always and will remain bound by blood and secrecy. Death will come to he who speaks.</p></li>
<li><p>We will keep their lifespan short and their minds weak while pretending to do the opposite.</p></li>
<li><p>We will use our knowledge of science and technology in subtle ways so they will never see what is happening.</p></li>
<li><p>We will use soft metals, aging accelerators and sedatives in food and water, also in the air.</p></li>
<li><p>They will be blanketed by poisons everywhere they turn.</p></li>
<li><p>The soft metals will cause them to lose their minds. We will
promise to find a cure from our many fronts, yet we will feed them more poison.</p></li>
<li><p>The poisons will be absorbed trough their skin and mouths,
they will destroy their minds and reproductive systems.</p></li>
<li><p>From all this, their children will be born dead, and we will conceal
this information.</p></li>
<li><p>The poisons will be hidden in everything that surrounds them,
in what they drink, eat, breathe and wear.</p></li>
<li><p>We must be ingenious in dispensing the poisons for they can see far.</p></li>
<li><p>We will teach them that the poisons are good, with fun images
and musical tones.</p></li>
<li><p>Those they look up to will help. We will enlist them to push our poisons.</p></li>
<li><p>They will see our products being used in film and will grow accustomed to them and will never know their true effect.</p></li>
<li><p>When they give birth we will inject poisons into the blood of their children and convince them its for their help.</p></li>
<li><p>We will start early on, when their minds are young, we will
target their children with what children love most, sweet things.</p></li>
<li><p>When their teeth decay we will fill them with metals that will kill their mind and steal their future.</p></li>
<li><p>When their ability to learn has been affected, we will create medicine that will make them sicker and cause other diseases for which we will create yet more medicine.</p></li>
<li><p>We will render them docile and weak before us by our power.</p></li>
<li><p>They will grow depressed, slow and obese, and when they come to us for help, we will give them more poison.</p></li>
<li><p>We will focus their attention toward money and material goods so they many never connect with their inner self. We will distract them with fornication, external pleasures and games so they may never be one with the oneness of it all.</p></li>
<li><p>Their minds will belong to us and they will do as we say. If they refuse we shall find ways to implement mind-altering technology
into their lives. We will use fear as our weapon.</p></li>
<li><p>We will establish their governments and establish opposites within. We will own both sides.</p></li>
<li><p>We will always hide our objective but carry out our plan.</p></li>
<li><p>They will perform the labor for us and we shall prosper from their toil.</p></li>
<li><p>Our families will never mix with theirs. Our blood must be pure
always, for it is the way.</p></li>
<li><p>We will make them kill each other when it suits us.</p></li>
<li><p>We will keep them separated from the oneness by dogma and religion.</p></li>
<li><p>We will control all aspects of their lives and tell them what to think and how.</p></li>
<li><p>We will guide them kindly and gently letting them think they are guiding themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>We will foment animosity between them through our factions.</p></li>
<li><p>When a light shall shine among them, we shall extinguish it by ridicule, or death, whichever suits us best.</p></li>
<li><p>We will make them rip each other&#39;s hearts apart and kill their own children.</p></li>
<li><p>We will accomplish this by using hate as our ally, anger as our friend.</p></li>
<li><p>The hate will blind them totally, and never shall they see that from their conflicts we emerge as their rulers. They will be busy killing each other.</p></li>
<li><p>They will bathe in their own blood and kill their neighbors for as long as we see fit.</p></li>
<li><p>We will benefit greatly from this, for they will not see us, for they
cannot see us.</p></li>
<li><p>We will continue to prosper from their wars and their deaths.</p></li>
<li><p>We shall repeat this over and over until our ultimate goal is
accomplished.</p></li>
<li><p>We will continue to make them live in fear and anger though images and sounds.</p></li>
<li><p>We will use all the tools we have to accomplish this.</p></li>
<li><p>The tools will be provided by their labor.</p></li>
<li><p>We will make them hate themselves and their neighbors.</p></li>
<li><p>We will always hide the divine truth from them, that we are all one. This they must never know!</p></li>
<li><p>They must never know that color is an illusion, they must always
think they are not equal.</p></li>
<li><p>Drop by drop, drop by drop we will advance our goal.</p></li>
<li><p>We will take over their land, resources and wealth to exercise total control over them.</p></li>
<li><p>We will deceive them into accepting laws that will steal the little
freedom they will have.</p></li>
<li><p>We will establish a money system that will imprison them forever, keeping them and their children in debt.</p></li>
<li><p>When they shall ban together, we shall accuse them of crimes and present a different story to the world for we shall own all the media.</p></li>
<li><p>We will use our media to control the flow of information and their sentiment in our favor.</p></li>
<li><p>When they shall rise up against us we will crush them like insects, for they are less than that.</p></li>
<li><p>They will be helpless to do anything for they will have no weapons.</p></li>
<li><p>We will recruit some of their own to carry out our plans, we will promise them eternal life, but eternal life they will never have for they are not of us.</p></li>
<li><p>The recruits will be called &quot;initiates&quot; and will be indoctrinated to believe false rites of passage to higher realms. Members of these groups will think they are one with us never knowing the truth.
They must never learn this truth for they will turn against us.</p></li>
<li><p>For their work they will be rewarded with earthly things and great titles, but never will they become immortal and join us, never will they receive the light and travel the stars.</p></li>
<li><p>They will never reach the higher realms, for the killing of their own kind will prevent passage to the realm of enlightenment. This they will never know.</p></li>
<li><p>The truth will be hidden in their face, so close they will not be able to focus on it until its too late.</p></li>
<li><p>Oh yes, so grand the illusion of freedom will be, that they will never know they are our slaves.</p></li>
<li><p>When all is in place, the reality we will have created for them will own them. This reality will be their prison. They will live in self-delusion.</p></li>
<li><p>When our goal is accomplished a new era of domination will begin.</p></li>
<li><p>Their minds will be bound by their beliefs, the beliefs we have established from time immemorial.</p></li>
<li><p>But if they ever find out they are our equal, we shall perish then. THIS THEY MUST NEVER KNOW.</p></li>
<li><p>If they ever find out that together they can vanquish us, they will take action.</p></li>
<li><p>They must never, ever find out what we have done, for if they do, we shall have no place to run, for it will be easy to see who we are once the veil has fallen. Our actions will have revealed who we are and they will hunt us down and no person shall give us shelter.</p></li>
<li><p>This is the secret covenant by which we shall live the rest of our present and future lives, for this reality will transcend many generations and life spans.</p></li>
<li><p>This covenant is sealed by blood, our blood. We, the ones who from heaven to earth came.</p></li>
<li><p>This covenant must NEVER, EVER be known to exist. It must NEVER, EVER be written or spoken of for if it is, the consciousness it will spawn will release the fury of the PRIME CREATOR upon us and we shall be cast to the depths from whence we came and remain there until the end time of infinity itself.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Whoa.</p>

<p>I would add only 1 thing: we&#39;ll invent a theory called &#39;coincidence&#39; and use it to discredit any possible theory in the past/present/future.  When this wears thin, we&#39;ll have smart social critics like guy debord, marshall mcluhan, terence mckenna, umberto eco, dan brown, and adam curtis invent a &#39;self-emergent illusional system&#39; (&#39;the trap&#39;) which is a rebranding of the same &#39;coincidence theory&#39;, and use social sciences, pompous language like neologisms and sticky phrases to advertise this factitious concept.  Their theories cannot be disproven because they are interpretations of factual information.  However, their falsehood relies on an omission of history of conspiracy.</p>

<p>I think they all did. Their core ideas were brilliant for a new country based on laws and freedom, however, they (and their handlers) had other motivations. You mention a Crown Corporation and you are spot on. The US was to be the military power of the Tri-Sovereign States (imo).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. In hermetic texts i have read all thing must have three parts and have duality. I have tried to stay away at from a lot of the textsby crowley et al cause I don&#39;t want to confuse myself. (easily done. Something about flutterbys...) Reading the real texts and realizing real lies. Looking at what I am sure those paperclips were doing brings me fully to what I am now seeing as psionics. In all forms of magic there is duality, hence we need to master our minds and steal our damn tools back. Ya wanna help me make and vet a list of tools that go waaaaay back, cause all the stuff they want us to think is real is just their prepackaged ready to serve garbage. Kinda like McDonald&#39;s. I am still working out exactly what voodoo they use but they do not have our outrage or our numbers. Also , u/Magnora and I were talking woodenspoon evolution last night, we need to use wands as well. Tell them we know. Kinda like giving them  good books to read. </p>

<p>It&#39;s been a while, from what I remember, someone had used a Star Wars Intro Creator, threw the text in there with some hallow reverb voice straight out of a pinhead movie, the effect was awesome.
To be honest, no way would I choose Freeman, he wrecked it for me with the Hillary commercial. Probably lean more towards Dan Carlin and his simplistic approach to get the point across, &quot;we are all going to die, nothing you can do about it, powers that be are the winners in all this, get out there and enjoy life, you only get one go at it, so make the most out it&quot;. </p>

<p>adjust our lives to avoid all the dangers thrown our way. this is a pretty good starter list. you can&#39;t help the higher Self if the physical self is dying.</p>

<p>There are few things completely wrong with it from an esoteric standpoint. For one, the LHP/acts of evil does not allow one to attain immortality. It is the path to the lower realms, not the higher realms and path of black magic requires one to steal the life-force of innocents just to maintain themselves.</p>

<p>Also, we are not &quot;all one&quot; that&#39;s only half true, and the emphasis in this set of statements in on the false half.</p>

<p>Finally, there is no secret elite bloodline, whenever excessive effort has been made to keep bloodlines pure disease and immune system defects were the result. For a population to be strong, there must be a sufficient diversity of genes, so if such a royal bloodline were to exist the offspring by this point would be weak and feeble, and definitely lacking the vigor to oppress the entire human race.</p>
