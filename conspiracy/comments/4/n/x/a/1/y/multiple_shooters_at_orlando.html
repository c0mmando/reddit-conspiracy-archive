       A friend of mine was at the nightclub the night of the shooting in Orlando. Luckily he got out unhurt. And he claimed that there were two shooters at the nightclub. He said the two shooters are friends that always go to that nightclub, like always go to it almost as if they're gay themselves. He even said he recognized them because they're always walking up and down the streets near the nightclub. He said that one of the shooters put the gun in their sweater and escaped into the crowd to leave the scene while the other shooter stayed back..... He is convinced he knew what he saw. And its funny because the media is spinning off as a lone wolf event, and they're even saying its a hate crime against gays even though Omar (one of the known shooters) might even be gay himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: Oh yeah, and he said he's afraid to report this to the police because he fears the government or the other shooter might try to kill him.

       Well, more than likely the police killed a lot of hostages when they blew up the wall then rolled in with an armored personnel carrier.  Oh and when they opened fire with over 100+ rounds to kill the gunman.

       Possibly, but remember that this was a gun-free zone, so no one inside was armed. Then the people who were shot inside had 3 hours to bleed out before the police started the raid.

       Obviously criminals don't care that it's a gun free zone. In fact, criminals seem to gravitate to these gun-free zones because they know that the people inside will almost certainly not be armed.

       only thing I can think or that i thought when i saw the recent articles saying there is going to be an arrest on a second person soon, is that you think they would wait til after the arrest to announce it. Just so the person they are going after doesnt take notice and attempt to get away or try something different to hide.

       Exactly. Not to change the topic but I always found it unlikely that this supposedly tiny, hypersensitive kid with Aspergers could carry out such a deadly attack in a couple of minutes. Especially when the initial reports said that he was reloading way before his magazines were empty, like you would in a video game.
      </p>
      <p>
       And ESPECIALLY, because the supposed "long gun," aka the AR-15, that CT Chief Medical Examiner said was the gun which everyone was shot with was IN HIS TRUNK the whole time and none of the guns had his DNA on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we're going with the "people actually got shot angle," I think it's much more likely that it was carried out by a couple of skilled mercenary types, possibly the dude in the woods and Adam Lanza, if he even existed at all, was a patsy.

       Don't forget Adam Lanza's supposed hit rate. Wasn't it something like 96%? Not even the best shooters in the world can do that.

       Good call, I almost forgot about that.

       154 shots fired in 5 minutes with something like 96% accuracy. Hmm...

      <p>
       And in addition to the accuracy, the timing is wild when you take reloading into account.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's at least six magazines or more considering they claimed that he changed magazines multiple times, "like you would in a video game," not emptying the clip:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Authorities determined that Lanza reloaded frequently during the shootings, sometimes firing only fifteen rounds from a thirty-round magazine. He shot all but two of his victims multiple times."

       This is what I want to know more about. Forget even witnesses saying there was more than one because they could be lying
But just look at the fact that the guy would've had to reload like 6 times with video game like speed and somehow pulled it off

       Would you rather i lie and say it was a friend? Im from orlando, i know a lot of people in orlando, and i heard this from a good friend whose friend was actually there. I trust the source. I posted a link yesterday with screen shots of my facebook with old coworkers grieving over paul henry, one of the victims that i knew personally. Im not making this shit up.

       I have been doing a ton of reading about this second shooter and all signs point to there being 2. My thought is that authorities know but are playing it close to the vest. In Boston the brothers didn't go on their second rampage until their identity was released. Learning from Boston it would've smart to keep it quiet so that any additional shooters let their guard down and don't harm anyone else if they have nothing to loose. Just my 2 cents...

Check my post history, im no shill, just someone who wants to know the truth about what happened to my friend.

       This is where conspiracy theories always go sideways in my opinion. It's totally plausible to discuss multiple shooters, media manipulation of events, censorship, scapegoating whole cultures, etc. It's not a very fruitful debate to deny that anyone actually died. I fully believe the shooting happened, and I fully believe those people died as a result.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who organized the event, how they organized the event, and why they organized the event remains to be answered for me. One guy who did it for religious reasons doesn't seem like a legitimate motive to me, nor a feasible task. To shoot over 100 people in a matter of seconds without automatic weapons or years of marksmanship sounds highly implausible to me.

       That's easy to say when you're in a different state and get satisfaction from conspiracy theories. When you actually live in Orlando and personally know the first responders, what they saw, and what the local ER's had to manage, it's different. This stuff is real and horrible in every sense.

       People seek out informations regarding events they were close to.  It isn't shady, it's just a confirmation bias.  It would be different if you started interviewing random people from around the country and they all knew someone but in a thread dedicated to the subject, of course people with relevant information are going to seek it out and share their perspective.

       There's a theory that says something like every human is separated by six degrees of separation.  Meaning everyone on the planet knows someone that knows someone, who knows someone that knows someone, who knows someone that knows someone connected to the incident.

       Lots of people from around the country go to Disney for their college program. When you have thousands of young college people from around the country going to the same place, it's not that odd that in this age of having hundreds of "friends" on Facebook, people know someone who knows someone who was affected.

       How many hostages did the police kill? They admitted they did kill hostages, but never give numbers.
      </p>

       "We had a team of crisis negotiators that talked to the suspect, trying to get as much information as possible, what we could do to help resolve the situation ... He wasn't asking a whole lot, and we were doing most of the asking," Mina said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mateen soon began talking about explosives and bombs, leading Mina to decide about 5 a.m. to detonate an explosive on an exterior wall to prevent potentially greater loss of life. The explosives did not penetrate the wall completely, so an armored vehicle was used to punch a 2-foot-by-3-foot hole in the wall about 2 feet from the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       "We knew there would be an imminent loss of life," Mina said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hostages started running out, as did Mateen, who was killed in a shootout with SWAT team members. It turned out there were no explosives.

       I find it really interesting they didn't breach from a door/window with a less lethal stun device or conduct a more thorough examination of the wall and build the charge more accordingly. I can see erring on the side of safety but there's such a myriad of options for breaching that I feel like this could be poor execution.

       It's pretty common circumstance now due to two reasons...Waco, TX &amp; then Columbine. At Waco, they came in guns-a-blazing and well, we know how that turned out. Columbine was such a major fuck up that they waited too long and allowed the two teens to kill way more than they should. Given the circumstances they knew (possible bomb) 2-3 hours was sufficient time to devise a plan and execute to save as much life as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       You kind of have to remind yourself that this is real life....not some movie where SWAT are all bad-ass, perfect soldiers. They are trained police (wo)men who are scared shitless but still running in there to save as many people as they can.

       I think they are already suspecting a second gunman and close to making an arrest. At least that's what I read a few hours ago.

       Assuming one shooter, and "Dylan Roof" level of accuracy, we're looking at hundreds of rounds from a single AR-15. 30 round mags. Did he have an ammo box with him?

       Nothing about this shooting makes sense in the context of a single shooter event.

       ...or, you're looking at 102 rounds/4 mags.  He had hours, and had close ranges to work with.  A single non-fatal shot per person could still cause deaths when they're bleeding out for hours.

       If you are telling the truth, tell your friend to make a sworn affadavit saying everything he knows, then spread it on the Internet. A video interview (they have video affadavits, right?) would also be nice. No chance of danger if you already layed your cards on the table.

Economics Teacher: [takes attendance] Bueller? Bueller? Bueller?
Economic Student Simone: Um, he's sick. My best friend's sister's boyfriend's brother's girlfriend heard from this guy who knows this kid who's going with the girl who saw Ferris pass out at 31 Flavors last night. I guess it's pretty serious.

       Obama is smiling about this one I'm sure.  There's anti gun radicals foaming at the mouths on social media everywhere.  It's all playing a part in his agenda...martial law...take away all guns and leave everyone defenseless.  More targets for his little JSOC team...just wait until he starts deploying them domestically.  Domestic drone strikes are getting closer and closer.

       Gary Johnson is by far the best candidate and the candidate whom my views align most with. I just wish he'd stop saying and doing such stupid things on the campaign trail. I.e., being stoned, calling Trump a racist, calling Trump a pussy, kissing the camera, etc. Everything he's doing is like the textbook opposite of the right way to run a campaign.

       Not really, it's all going along with his/our government's agenda.  To think he actually controls or has much influence on our government is ludicrous.  He's merely the face of it.

       What does gun control have to do with the "military industrial complex"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Military companies (Raytheon, Boeing, etc) don't make anything from civilian gun sales.
      </p>
      <p>
       The very few companies who make guns for the military (colt, Beretta) make very, very little of their sales from civilians. They don't give a shit either way.
      </p>
      <p>
       The companies who actually depend on civilian sales (Ruger, Remington, Browning, Winchester, Bushmaster, DPMS, etc, etc, etc) are not part of the " military industrial complex". They are tiny by comparison, and do not supply the military.
      </p>
      <p>
       So please, explain to me how gun sales are some conspiracy by the "military industrial complex".
