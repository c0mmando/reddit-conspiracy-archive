        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In Conspiracy circles you hear about the Illuminati, the Cabal, the Elites, the NWO, the cryptocracy, the deep state, the network, the international ruling class.  </p>

<p>These synonymous orgs are painted on the one hand as totally non-believable by <em>progressive, secular, scientsmic, atheist relativists</em>.   This group of individuals believe in <em>&quot;coincidence theory&quot;</em>, a conspiracy theory that believes that conspiracy theories are simply not believable, that government is trustworthy, science is infallible.  They reject evidence and cherry-pick facts, refusing to be made wrong by mutating language itself with NLP tricks.  Their belief generally is that <em>&quot;events happen as merely an expressed coincidence of highly complex systems&quot;</em>--a temporary order out of highly dynamic chaos.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Interestingly enough, <em>&quot;Ordo Ab Chao&quot;</em> is a latin phrase for <em>&#39;Order out of Chaos&#39;</em> and motto of 33rd degree freemasons.  Whom we have historical evidence to conclude <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_Due">Italian, Swiss, Argentine masons</a> were responsible for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna_massacre">Italy&#39;s 9/11 in the 1980</a>, the bologna massacre bombing of a train station, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Years_of_Lead_(Italy">after decades of false flag events</a>) by Italian crime syndicates the P2 lodge was proven to be connected to.  </p>

<p>The problem with Coincidence Theory is that it&#39;s wrong.  A stark critique of *Coincidence Theory is it fail to address true history, as in the above one example, among so many (right sidebar: proven conspiracy list).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These <em>Coincidentarians</em> are the same people acting as forum spies (why else would they find it acceptable to be paid to lie to the public?), and they may also be those people who are unwittingly inculcated into forum spying for free.  I offer only those two factions, because anything beyond those two designations are legitimate users who have a different model of the world around them.  These people are--at the least--not liars.  They are interested in the truth as well, but have different opinions on it.  And that&#39;s certainly their prerogative as an American, because that&#39;s how a &quot;democratic marketplace of ideas&quot; (which reddit is mostly, if not America by extension) is supposed to work.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are people who believe the aforementioned Illuminati/____ group are one small ethnic group (israel / zionists), or the other (russian intelligence), or a catholic conspiracy.  And on the third hand, there are people who believe a &quot;grand conspiracy&quot; that consistes of either coopetition by disparate mafias including those aforementioned, and some who believe they are all coordinated under one common-belief that is either fascism, nazism, gnosticism, or orwellian socialism.  These disparate networked (horizontal peers) versus hierarchical (vertically integrated / monolithic) share a common belief, which is that regardless of the &#39;grand conspirators&#39; org chart, they are after the same goal: one world government having citizen with few freedoms.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, these &#39;believers&#39; will say, &quot;well WHO are these people?&quot;  </p>

<p>A: They are <em>globalist corporatists</em> (ie: <em>fascists</em>);  ruling class aristocrats who have a <em>eugenicist</em> agenda; a tendency towards anglophone rule; a tendency towards hegelian (&#39;ends justify the means&#39;) modality of thinking; and they believe ideologically in neither Capitalism nor Socialism; and have a sympathy towards gnosticism as a religion; and some attempt to make their work part of a larger work of <em>Alchemy</em>--yes, <em>alchemy</em>.  They believe in plutacracy; some even believe it&#39;s a &#39;divine right&#39;.  Ultimately, they share ideology closer to Nazism than to &quot;Democracy&quot;, a concept that has <em>never once been deployed in the modern world</em>, not since ancient greece.  They attack our culture, denigrate our understanding of history, undermine our knowledge and critical thinking ability, turn us against each other as a means of control, hijack our political processes, and deny us justice in obvious intrigues, as a power-move to shut-us-down, psychologically.  </p>

<p>In a nutshell, these people are the new <em>Odessa</em>, and 9/11 was a coup d&#39;etat by Nazi SS corporate ideologues, coordinated through agents who have subverted our IC, and coordinated by George H W motherfucking Bush. Believe it.  </p>

<p>This can be verified if you know your history; and if you don&#39;t then start with Prescott Bush and Allen Dulles and go from there, using Mae Brussel and John Steele as your guides</p>

<hr/>

<p>Here is a list of those &#39;common goals&#39;:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Gnostiticism</strong> (Lady Gaga, Checkboards, Roses, Doves, Eye of providence, New Age, Isis; They want you to adopt a <em>gnostic</em> worldview.  What&#39;s that?  One that believes in alchemy.  Unification of opposites.  &#39;As above so below&#39;--order out of chaos, holographic reality, fractals, infinity, cycles, kabbalism, astrotheology, God is Evil / Lucifer is good; embrace the serpent / shadow / your darkside; redeem spirit in the material; apotheosis)</li>
<li><strong>Relativism</strong> (&#39;cultural marxism&#39;, Frankfurt School; Things are all part of the the same thing but different in degree; we are all one, all connected; all ideas are welcome; there are no wrong answers)</li>
<li><strong>Mythogenesis</strong> (History is rewritten; Terror narratives being pushed, Jesuits burning books, putting jesuitical agents as benedictine monks in charge of rewriting them; school textbooks being rewritten; wikipedia being &#39;rewritten&#39; by establishment goons; thewaybackmachine being &#39;wiped&#39; of prvocative / informative past snapshots)</li>
<li><strong>Singularity agenda</strong> or <strong>Identity Apotheosis agenda</strong> (gay &gt; trans &gt; youth rule (&quot;aeon-ism&quot;) &gt; pedo &gt; animism (inaninimate) / dissociative &gt; beast / species / &#39;genes&#39; &gt; robot)  <em>The &quot;Get you to the robot&quot; plan</em>.  Why?  Because Lucifer / Demiurge is an infinitely advanced AI program that simulates the world, when you identify, you &#39;become god&#39; and break out of the loop.</li>
<li><strong>Singletonianism</strong>  : They try to break up family and the <em>idea</em> of a family (destroy marriage) and get you to become a single, singleton individual because they are easier to manipulate and control.  Plus as a singleton you have to buy <em>1-of-everything</em>, so all businesses benefit from singletonianism.  If the establishment is threatened by you, as a singleton, you have no social network to rely on for <em>power</em> or <em>protectionism</em>.  Facebook is a fake social network: they control it and they can turn it off when they have sufficiently mapped out the social graph of the entire world and mined the social data for as much as they can.  The moment they realize that the value of the long-tail info is less than the value to run the site (and it doesn&#39;t make enough money to support itself), they will shut down facebook and retain their vast databases and then you will have nothing.</li>
<li><strong>Thanateros</strong> (Love Death): America is a death cult that loves death.  That&#39;s why all the skull and crossbones and the goth stuff and all the evil imagery in pop culture.  It&#39;s also why it&#39;s called District of Columbia---<em>columba</em> is latin for dove, which is associated with holy spirit, death (columbarium --a dovecot used as mauseleum), so it&#39;s literally a word that means dove-death-spirit.  Dove / columba / columbia is thus a psychopomp with the dove as the vehicle by which the soul travels to the afterlife.  Statue of Liberty is borrowgoddess <em>Columbia</em> who represents Latin Libertas and ultimately egyptian Isis / Astarte the pan-near/middle east &quot;Queen of Heaven&quot; who represents life/death/freedom, so in a way the statue of liberty is the statue of &quot;Freeing souls from the body&quot;; this thanateros agenda is about the exaltation of death and passage into death.  Hence the &quot;skull and bones&quot; society of Yale in whose inititation involves ritual killing of the initiate and placing them into a coffin and <em>ostensibly</em> retaining the skull of geronimo in their display case.</li>
<li><strong>Collectivism and the death of the individual</strong>: even though people are to be singletons, they are also supposed to have a group-mindedness.  They are to be isolated while dreaming of and anticipating a favorable relationship within a group.  They will spend their spare time thinking of how to positively contribute to the group, instead of pursuing self-interest.  This is 1984 folks.</li>
<li><strong>Big Brother / Big Sister Exaltation</strong>: it will accomplish the singletonian / collectivist agenda by holding up a fascist, totalitarian image as God.  This won&#39;t be a person because a person is fallible.  They will exalt the system itself as infallible.  I suspect they will call this big brother &quot;G&quot; kind of like uncle same.   There are pop culture refences to &quot;G&quot; already, but it means &quot;gangsta&quot; or  &#39;grand&#39; / &#39;thousand&#39;.  G is also the freemasons who are running this whole thing.  I believe they will refer to governmetn as &quot;G&quot; or &quot;big G&quot; or something and everyone will worship G.</li>

<p>It breaks down the left and right path or sun and moon path.</p>

<p>I believe there are many detered from magick because the left hand path has been slandered and the right hand path doesn&#39;t work for me. Personally, trawling through esoteric texts and trying to digest it all when you have no experience or reference frame to motivate you to go forward doesn&#39;t yield the best results. I find it much better to just through yourself at experiences and do your shadow work fto find out where your internal moral parameters are. </p>

<p>I think that&#39;s why Christ exists is to allow you to explore your shadoe and break social conventions, and to assist you in processing the guilt associated with defying these social constructs. As long as you continue to feel guilt, you likit your creative capacities and bring about suffering. Through Christ&#39;s forgiveness, it allows you to see what works for you without acruing excessive guilt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Christ prescribed the death penalty to anyone that partakes in magick, witchcraft, or sorcery.  If you think Christ died on the cross so that you could willfully sin without guilt, you&#39;re barking up the wrong tree.  The left and right path are a false dichotomy.  All magik power comes from the demonic.  Both paths are evil.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live. (Exodus 22:18)</p>

<p>Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God. (Leviticus 19:31)</p>

<p>And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people. (Leviticus 20:6)</p>

<p>A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood shall be upon them. (Leviticus 20:27)</p>

<p>He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.  But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and <strong>sorcerers</strong>, and idolators, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.

<p>How am I <em>misinterpreting</em> that sorcerers will have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone?  Seems pretty darn clear to me.  The old testament is &quot;fear indoctrination&quot;?  I wonder how you would have responded to Jesus&#39; preaching then.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. (Matthew 10:28)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Woah Jesus!  Stop all the fear mongering with that old testament stuff will yuh?!  How does &quot;fear indoctrination&quot; even make sense when someone receives everlasting life just by believing on the Lord Jesus Christ?  It even says right in Revelations that the <em>fearful</em> have their part in the lake too.  I&#39;m not fearful because I already have everlasting life.  I&#39;m trying to pull you out of your delusion.  </p>

<p>The universe works off of God&#39;s law and God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.  Sorcery and magick are perversion and inversion of God&#39;s law.  They only function through the manipulation of unclean spirits.  Denying the Bible means you&#39;re just inventing your own idea of God.  The Bible calls that &quot;vain imaginations&quot;.  He gave us the law for a reason.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. (1 Samuel 15:22)</p>

<p>If ye love me, keep my commandments. (John 14:15)</p>

<p>Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law. (Romans 13:10)</p>

<p>For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous. (1 John 5:3)</p>

<p>And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it. (2 John 1:6)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry this is so long but I feel like I need enough examples that I prove my point.</p>

<p>The King James Bible isn&#39;t Catholic.  The Catholic church burned William Tyndale at the stake for attempting to translate the Bible from the original Greek and Hebrew.  The Catholic church&#39;s Latin Vulgate was they&#39;re own perverted Bible that the other modern Bibles are based on.  I&#39;m not telling you to go join some church.  I&#39;m not saying you need some priest or pope.  I&#39;m telling you to read the word of God yourself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren.  And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven. (Matthew 23:8-9)</p>

<p>For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; (1 Timothy 2:5)</p>

<p>Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.  For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.  Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. (Hebrews 4:14-16)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Love isn&#39;t the way to redemption.  Following the law isn&#39;t what saves a man.  Your righteousness is as filthy rags before God.  He doesn&#39;t care about what you do.  There is none righteous, no, not one.  For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.  No one earns salvation.  It&#39;s a free gift given to those that believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God. (Romans 3:10-11)</p>

<p>For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; (Romans 3:23)</p>

<p>For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: <strong>Not of works, lest any man should boast</strong>. (Ephesians 2:8-9)</p>

<p>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. (John 3:16)</p>

<p>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. (John 5:24)</p>

<p>Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas, And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? And they said, <strong>Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved</strong>, and thy house. (Acts 16:29-31)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s that simple.  Good deeds don&#39;t outweigh bad.  You can&#39;t atone for your sins yourself.  If you understand that and accept salvation as a free gift that was paid for with the blood of Jesus Christ, that faith is counted for righteousness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness. Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. (Romans 4:3-5)</p>

<p>He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. (John 3:18)</p>

<p>He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him. (John 3:26)</p>

<p>He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. (1 John 5:10-12)</p>

<p>Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. (Acts 4:12)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I&#39;ve expanded my mind in studying alchemy, but if I&#39;m not mistaken the up and down arrow of the masons symbol of compass and square and pentacle/pentagram duality are about both the immaterial and material in union. That&#39;s why you have kabbalistic Madonna as &#39;the material girl&#39; as the original 80s &#39;Diva&#39; and godmother of pop gnosticism, built into her name, iconography and what not--that&#39;s her role.  There have been so many &#39;diva&#39; imitators, from spears to luciana to rhianna to lady gaga, they all use the checkerboard, rose, lotus, fire, twilight language and covering the eye.  The cover story is the material and body-sensation poppy frivolty; but the underlying message is the &#39;redemption of spirit into the material&#39;, ie: a body-diva, or apotheosis of an ordinary girl in the world into a goddess; for those with the &#39;eyes to see it&#39; (people with symbolic, occult literacy).  Pop stars like Gaga let us know all the time about this gnosticism, just look at the video Judas.  Or american horror story hotel where she plays lilith (lady lucifer).  Also, if you have occultic literacy, you&#39;ll find AHS hotel to be absolutely a great work of our times, othewise it may be lost on you completely.</p>

<p>The &#39;doubt alchemy&#39; part is the role of science and scientism; the whole of the enlightenment was to help educate the plebs so they would build the complex material technologies without the dangers that they would appropriate magicks.  That&#39;s why magick doesn&#39;t exist--it only exists if you believe it to, which most do not, so it does not.</p>

<p>The hope of the magical astrotheological, kabbalistic aristocrats was that plebs would get us to the point at which alchemical cultural engineers could &#39;immanetize the eschaton&#39;, join the world of the real/material with the world of imagination/spirit, creating a heaven/hell on earth.  The fusion of science with the art of alchemy, redeeming the light of the darkness itself, <em>lumen naturae</em> the unyielding candle of a truth in the infinity of the void.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Old physics is a limited hangout. An evolutionary dead end (whether by design or not is up for debate). I&#39;m inclined to believe by design since CERN and many of the large telescopes etc are owned by the Vatican.</p>

<p>It really is just that. The mile and second are sacred numbers in this simulation as they&#39;re based off proportions of the circle.</p>

<p>Those numbers that reoccur in this dimension, also reoccur at higher dimensions and that manifests as significant nodes in the web of interconnectedness.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason why cities are built on sacred geometric principles with institutional reinforcing monuments/churches being placed at significant nodes. It programs the terrain in the next domain of consciousness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry for the necropost reply.  No I&#39;m not.  I&#39;m not against gnosticism at all.. in fact the more I read about it the more I &#39;became&#39; a type of gnostic.  That said, I do not believe hegelian is the answer if the means are foul.  In other words I don&#39;t believe the &#39;ends justify the means&#39;..both must be wholesome to create true and pure history in the act of union (of opposites).  This is a difference between the globalists and myself, I suppose. They don&#39;t have a problem murdering a few million innocent arabs just so we can <em>ostensibly</em> have a peaceful world (their cover story).</p>

<p>Also I think we have to be very careful how to handle transition into starshiphood and AI mergers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Diversity is a relativistic idea.  Feminism is not &#39;girls at the exclusion of men&#39; or &#39;let&#39;s kill off all the men&#39;, it&#39;s equality for females and minorities including gender and sexual minorities.  Which implies diversity, which implies choice, which is the opposite of what you&#39;re saying about it being fascism.   There is truth to the fascism part though and the idea of a &#39;femi-nazi&#39;, and that is from the liberal authoritarianism of those equality demands leading to aggressivness; jingoism in the deployment of this idea.  it&#39;s like if someone showed up at your house with a gun and said, &quot;do you accept jesus as your lord and savior, as well as the possiblity of mohammed, moses, buddha, and several other of the worlds religions?  If you don&#39;t accept this level playing field, we&#39;ll need you to step outside sir&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>Also can you tell me what your deal is with me and this thread. I&#39;ve lost all understanding of what you&#39;re up to.  Did you like my thing or didn&#39;t you?  Did you have a real problem with it or do you have a problem with me?  Or with yourself?  Are you a troll and you&#39;re calling me one?  did you spend an hour writing out something useful for this community or did you click downvote and downvote all my comments to &#39;1&#39; on this thread because you have some ego collision or you&#39;re being paid to do so (because someone did, don&#39;t know if it was you but you&#39;re my #1 suspect right now because you clearly have a beef with me).</p>

<p>And now for the biggest question, why are you marked as friend to me? Do I need to correct this and put you on the global blacklist? Did we get along elsewhere and then you flipped a bit or something?  Seriously. Im&#39; going to have to consult the thinktank on you <a href="/u/stopnoanddont">/u/stopnoanddont</a> and see what their assessment is.</p>
