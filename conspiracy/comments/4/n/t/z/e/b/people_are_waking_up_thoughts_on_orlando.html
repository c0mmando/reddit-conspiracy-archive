       Despite the massive amount of censorship from MSM and Reddit, people are still getting information from witnesses and official reports that point to a false flag in Orlando yesterday. A big shoutout to everyone on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and alternative media outlets working to make the truth available. I've seen possibly hundreds more people already questioning the official story and seeking more information. We are making a difference.

       The government is gonna take guns from the sheep? So how many more of these "plays" will the government need to conduct to pass this agenda if "voting is all a scam" anyway, they wouldn't need to do this shit. You guys need to take a course in logic.

       It would look very bad if our supposed "representatives" were to pass laws that seem to fly in the face of public sentiment. Therefore, public sentiment must first be swayed before the planned legislation can be passed.

       Therefore, to keep things from looking bad, we're gonna kill people all the time to make guns illegal just like the drugs that we eradicated from this earth after declaring em illegal.

       Or maybe some asshole shot up a nightclub. The odds of it happening in "real life"  were pretty fucking high when crazy people can access high powered assault rifles.

       Besides, those people couldn't rely on gun touting Armageddon basement soldiers to rescue them. They had to wait for the government.

       So you're saying TPTB want to make guns illegal just like drugs? Sure, although there are different agendas at work there. They want to make both illegal but for different reasons. Also, many people in power have no problem killing others in order to promote their own agenda and self-interest.

      <p>
       Why do you think this? Is it because you've seen so many people shooting up public places in the past few years? What if I told you the majority of them were pretty much made up - broadcast into the media to make you think there are a lot of crazy people with rifles running around?
      </p>
      <p>
       In your own "real life" (NOT ON TV), how many crazy people with rifles have you encountered?

       My classmate was shot twice last week across the street from the bar I was at. My best friend called me crying yesterday because his friend was killed at the nightclub in Orlando. You're a fucking idiot. Go move to a big city and get out of your mom's basement shelter.

       Hmm, I'm in Los Angeles, and we do have criminal shootings here, but I'll tell you that the "crazy man with a rifle" is not something that happens every day.

      <p>
       I don't know about your friend's friend's situation, but if you were personally affected by the Orlando shooting that is still no reason to dismiss the idea that the government would kill its own.

       Ok, I'm totally serious here and not trying to make light of anything, but where do you live that your classmate was shot last week, your best friend's friend was killed in Orlando, and you also went to high school with one of the guys in the ISIS videos?

       Also the high amount of tragedy that you seem to encounter has no bearing on whether or not a government would choose to kill or terrorize its own people. If anything, government agendas

       I read that already. It's very conspiracy driven. So it's either that the government is killing people because they want to ban guns or the government is killing people because they are allowing psychopaths on terrorists watch lists to buy guns. Which one is it? Either way you can say it's conspiracy. I think it's reality.

       I didn't say that it's that narrow an agenda. You did. But if that's what you think, that's cool. Let me know why you think that.

       The fact that you can't fathom there are people in this world who kill other people with guns is ridiculous. Please explain why the agenda is not as narrow as I stated in your eyes. I'm trying to make sense of  your vague, open ended "doesn't mean the government is behind it" statement.

       Haha. I never said that. It's so weird the things you keep coming up with.

       Wow. You're really going off the rails now. You gotta pull your trolling/shilling together, man, or I'm going to lose intellectual interest. Your comments have to actually reflect and antagonize what I'm saying. You can't just grab something that
       <em>
        you mentioned
       </em>
       and use that as argumentative fulcrum. Maybe I don't care about that point. Maybe I even like the point you made. The point is, you've got to select your attack points. Look for things that the person cares about. Look for things that might make them angry or emotional. That way, your opponent loses intellectual function. And that should be one of your main goals. Your job as a troll/shill is to make people stop thinking, because when they stop thinking, they're more easily influence by emotional appeals. At the very least, try to make them angry.
      </p>
      <p>
       So far, you've haven't been so well because it's too obvious what you're doing. But let's keep trying, OK?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, about your "narrow" point.  I'm pretty sure the government has at minimum at least
       <em>
        three
       </em>
       agendas (not just two) running at any given time. Heck, my personal life is more complex than that. And I'm pretty boring.

       Good one.

      <p>
       But I wasn't attacking you. Did you see that I tried to give you pointers to help you out?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now as far as your arguments go, I'm not seeing any arguments to undermine. Last comment you asked me a question, and I  answered it. If you don't believe me, ask me another question or present another argument (hopefully on topic). I'll answer it directly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, please step up your game. That single link response is barely worth my time. :)

       Haha. Thanks. That's the conclusion I was coming to about two comments back. I just wanted to see how his replies would play out. Apparently, his MO is to reference emotional and/or tragic events to divert and deflect any critical analysis.

       The biggest red flag I got was when I saw the interview of a Latina mother about her son possibly being killed or in the hospital.. It was so odd because she had a blank expression, really calm, and it seemed like she had no idea what was going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       And her son is supposed to be dead? I would have never guessed. My mom would be freaking tf out.
