        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So Saturday night/Sunday morning I was getting some news notifications that there was a shooting in a nightclub. I thought &quot;so what, probably 6 people died and that&#39;s it&quot;.  I go to sleep. I wake up around 7 am Sunday and see some more stories about a nightclub shooting. I think, they&#39;re still showing this stuff how is this news it will be forgotten about by the end of the day. </p>

<p>I go to the laundromat and again I hear the tv talking about the shooting. I think again wow they are really pushing this what is the big deal. Sure enough I walk up to the tv and there I see it &quot;50 dead, worst shooting in American History&quot;. I say wow, thats what the story was how could I be so dumb. </p>

<p>So I start watching the coverage. It&#39;s on cbs and it&#39;s a national/ special news coverage. So I start watching. 
First thing that seems wierd to me is the little clip showing a fat guy with an American t shirt and about 6 other guys carrying a guy. The street they are on is absolutely deserted. There are cop cars with no light on and it is just deserted. I think that&#39;s strange, you&#39;d think there would be more people on the streets looking dazed. But literally no one, just a pick up truck comes picks up the &quot;injured&quot; person and that&#39;s it clip ends </p>

<p>2) lack of video from inside the club. It&#39;s 2016 you&#39;d think someone would post a video from inside the club somehow. In Belgium we had video from inside the airport the same day. With the shooting at the ti concert we had crystal clear video of the shooter. How are there no videos from inside the crime scene still.</p>

<p>3)the shooter calling 911. Ugh when are they going to release the tapes. If they don&#39;t release it it&#39;s a conspiracy.</p>

<p>4) identifying the bodies and contacting relatives. 24 hours after the attack cbs reported there were still bodies inside the club. They also reported families not knowing if their relatives were injured or dead. I&#39;d say that would be the biggest deal you&#39;d have in a mass shooting. This didn&#39;t take place across a city. It happened Ina singular place and the hospital is down the street. How do you not have everyone accounted for 24 hours after the attack. People on the news saying I don&#39;t know where my friend is, I called him he doesn&#39;t answer. Ugh pretty sure your friend is dead. And plus that crazy crying lady did not sound authentic at all. </p>

<p>And lastly the actual shooting and police response. I dont know anything about guns but the last shootings the shooters brought way more than one assault rifle and - handgun. Killing 50 people?  Id say it would take 3 bullets to kill one person and that guy did not have enough ammo. The response is shady as well. The shooter came out of the club shot with cops went back in and took hostages </p>

<p>And the police magically killed him with bystanders there also. And the only damage is a bullet through a helmet. </p>

<p>This is my first false flag shooting that I actually believe is very fishy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good points. I was struck how the death toll was reported as &quot;20&quot; not long after the attack, and this was ramped up to &quot;50&quot; thereafter. </p>

<p>Perhaps the original 20 figure wasn&#39;t pressing enough fear buttons and they decided it was time to ramp up the response by unveiling &quot;the worst mass shooting in American history&quot;.</p>

<p>I am glad something about this event has finally tipped you over the &quot;incredulity barrier&quot;, but if you go back to some of the other mass shootings (and even the Zaventem bombings) and lift the curtain, you will find many inconsistencies with those too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you also believe the 2004 tsunami was a conspiracy?  Early reports stated &quot;more than 11,000 dead&quot; which eventually became around 230,000 people:</p>

<p>If you think that early media reports regarding the number of dead is enough to question the legitimacy of events, then literally every event where there has been a large number of deaths can be called into question.  </p>

<p>Believe it or not, it actually takes time to canvass a mass-death scene in order to confirm the number of dead.</p>

<p>Literally every case where there are mass-casualties the initial fatality numbers are lower than the final count.  What is your standard for determining which of these are legitimate and which are not?</p>

<p>By the way, the death count has increased to 51 now, spooky stuff!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I bet he thinks confirming these things are a cake walk you should get right in the first go. That was a burning question at that time and they gave an estimate at the first press conferences. About 20. God damnit i saw this live, just because you woke up to it and are seeing bits and pieces from here and there, it doesn&#39;t mean the conspiracies in your head are true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I responded above. I don&#39;t agree with the guy who says 20 wasn&#39;t enough so they ramped it up to 50. </p>

<p>And the only reason I mentioned getting bits and pieces before seeing the final news report is because I can&#39;t believe I glanced over what would have been the largest mass shooting in American history. I just thought it was eerie that I have seen so many shootings this decade and the one where I get sick of reading I don&#39;t even click on it turns out to be the worst shooting ever.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t blame you because of the time it happened. At first it felt as though it would be over soon, but then it just kept going. I knew it was going to turn out bad when it kept going. I happened to follow the whole thing live. See my other thread about it: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4nuomc/i_watched_the_orlando_debacle_unfold_from_the/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4nuomc/i_watched_the_orlando_debacle_unfold_from_the/</a></p>

<p>I do agree with your comment on no video turning up from inside the club. This video, supposedly from earlier that night surfaced on Orlando Police Twitter feed, posted by some people who were awake around the world at that time: <a href="https://www.periscope.tv/w/1OdJrmOjzApGX">https://www.periscope.tv/w/1OdJrmOjzApGX</a></p>

<p>So there maybe video that we haven&#39;t seen yet. Also the link to that tweet who posted the periscope video: <a href="https://twitter.com/Jazina/status/741946311272992768">https://twitter.com/Jazina/status/741946311272992768</a></p>

<p>The only reason I feel this way is because I saw this thing unfold as it went, so I feel there are more simple reasons for some of the things we believe as being conspiracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but I felt the feeling of no one knowing what was going on, it was very real and there was plenty of evidence from independent parties like the periscope videos that tally with the live TV reports. As opposed to someone waking up and piecing things together from the news available, someone who also has an apprehension to believing conspiracy. I know the difference because I too read conspiracy and sometimes wonder what if. But this time it is very different for me having followed the thing live closely and reading all your posts here. If you look at my post history, I have shown evidence to what I&#39;ve seen at the time for some of the arguments some of you have put up. I&#39;m not a shill. I&#39;m just like you, except maybe now I&#39;ve learnt how not to go too far with this stuff. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What a dumb analogy. One is a natural disaster, and the other is a politically charged high-profile ISIS shooting. One is impossible to fake, another is easy. There is no real incentive to fake deaths for a tsunami, there are many incentives to fake a Muslim extremist attack: war expenditures, continued spending of billions in the middle east, gun grabs, background checks, no fly lists, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point is that you are going to have a hard time finding any situation where there are a large number of deaths and they get the number of casualties right immediately, it happens literally every time.  The tsunami was used as an example because it demonstrates how ridiculous it is to consider it to be proof of the illegitimacy of an event.</p>

<p>Oh look, the Orlando number has now been decreased to 49, I guess somebody came back to life!  Or you know, early reports are notoriously unreliable, which has been proven time and time and time again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I&#39;m just going to play Devil&#39;s Advocate here.  </p>

<p>If there was no shooting - what did the club do.  Close down that night?  Or was the club at full capacity and all the people in there are part of the conspiracy?    </p>

<p>The other thing is - let&#39;s say you are a blood thirsy psychopath, that is going to stage a false flag event, to perpetuate wars where 1000s upon 1000s of people are going to die.  Are you going to make 500 drunk people sign non-disclosure contracts?  Or are you going to shoot 50 people?   </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry - I just don&#39;t think it is logistically possible that this was staged, unless some kind of evidence comes to light that the club was not letting people in that night.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That seems <em>possible.</em>  It being entirely fake and staged just seems plain and simply not possible.  </p>

<p>I do believe that some people are capable of keeping secrets (high ranking military, intelligence, etc.).  I don&#39;t believe a night club of drunk, mollied-up gay dudes are that demographic though.   </p>

<p>It is still a little weird there isn&#39;t footage of this though.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One way that something like this could be possible is if only a small amount of people that were actually in the club that night were in on it. Guy comes in with an AR and starts firing off blanks. Everybody is terrified and starts running for the exits. Once outside, they are no longer able to witness the events within the club.</p>

<p>Obviously a decent amount of people would need to be involved, but that would be way more likely than everyone in the club being in on it. That way, there is at least some aspect of legitimate panic/fear/trauma/etc. because most of the people there just thought they escaped a real shooting.</p>

I always find it fascinating when people are more willing to jump onto the conspiracy train even though the tracks haven&#39;t been laid and there&#39;s no conductor, just train cars full of people unwilling to accept the possible truth. Not everything is a conspiracy and you hurt actual progress when you condemn a person&#39;s actions as hidden agendas seeking to fulfill their secret ambitions.</p>

<p>Literally every case where there are mass-casualties the initial fatality numbers are lower than the final count.  What is your standard for determining which of these are legitimate and which are not?</p>

<p>By the way, the death count has increased to 51 now, spooky stuff!</p>
