<p>&quot;Is Reddit Dead? Welcome to the Propaganda Machine&quot; (cross postfrom <a href="/r/Anticonsumption">/r/Anticonsumption</a>)</p>

<p>By <a href="/u/RainbowsAndDespair">/u/RainbowsAndDespair</a>:</p>

<p>Much like the sidebar says, the Reddit that once existed is dead. I wanted to try and put together how this happened, and so I ended up writing a lengthy piece titled “Is Reddit Dead? Welcome to the Propaganda Machine.” If you don’t want to read it, I’ll highlight most of the points here. I&#39;m interested in hearing what others have to say. Maybe some stuff I missed. Some stuff I got wrong. Etc..</p>

<p>1) We sometimes forget how huge Reddit is. In 2015, Reddit had 542 million monthly visitors (234 million unique users), ranking 14th most visited web-site in US and 36th in the world. With that kind of user base comes a huge amount of power and influence.</p>

<p>2) The premise of Reddit has been hijacked. It’s no longer the people creating the system, but what has become the system looking to create the people.</p>

<p>3) It’s an effective, concentrated model of what Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky discussed in “Manufacturing Consent”, and the consequent stages of what Edward Bernays pioneered in the early 1900’s and what was so aptly portrayed in Adam Curtis’s BBC documentary “The Century of the Self”: The formulation of the public consciousness is not so much of a direct endeavor but the tunneling of the citizen’s possible thoughts toward a desired outcome. When the public gets there, the average citizen will think it’s by their own independent and critical-thinking means.</p>

<p>4) In fact, I was surprised at just how easily the current state of Reddit resembles the outline of Chomsky’s five filters for editorial bias in the propaganda model.</p>

<p>5) Much is being done to encourage simplicity in a difficult and complicated world and to discourage thinking outside the box. If you do think outside the box, it creates an environment where you feel alone and isolated in doing so. Most of the time, though, any “outside thinking” is illusory because you’re being shuffled down that tunnel of thought and to your deathbed where you wish you wouldn’t have spent so much time concerned about things in which you find out don’t matter as much as they appeared.</p>

<p>6) When the profit isn’t enough, they will try to further control you. The profit is never enough.</p>

<p>7) Anonymity isn’t likely what you think it is: It has been rebranded. Your identity has been shifted. The name on your driver’s license only matters when it comes to your ISP knowing who to send the bill to. On the internet, your real identity is your IP address, your browser fingerprint, and the accumulation of your data from what sites you visit clear down to the camera-specific and geolocation metadata embedded into those photos you took on vacation a few years ago and posted online.</p>

<p>8) Shoes, beer, movies, presidents, and war – they’re all being sold the same way.</p>

<p>9) In 2008, Obama’s campaign presence on Reddit was huge and wildly influential, and that’s part of the reason he beat out the likes of some major well-known manufacturers for Advertising Age’s marketer of the year. But consequently, now we have an ugly mess in 2016 from all parties trying to capture that influence, and the accessibility factor has apparently been lowered to the lowest common denominator.</p>

<p>10) Mega-corporations are here, in Reddit’s pockets, moreso all the time, but their attempts at inserting content can be laughably bad sometimes. What’s been made clear, though, is that it doesn’t matter as long as they get views. Now that news websites are also hosting native advertisement disguised as news articles, the line continues to blur between you and a reality the advertisers want you to believe.</p>

<p>11) A new thing I’ve noticed on AskReddit: What at first appear to be legitimate responses then insert specific brands into the text as a form of advertisement. Most of this stuff is apparent because of its disproportionate use.</p>

<p>12) It’s seldom about getting you to enjoy what you already have, but getting you to desire what you don’t have: To fill your games library, or your bookshelf, or your closet. What you don’t have is always better, faster, healthier, cleaner, purer, sleeker, sexier, smarter…. You can solve all of your problems, if only you’d open your wallet. You don’t have any problems? The internet is very good at creating them. The internet of things very much wants you to become an identity of things, and they want your religion to be their specific brand. The better you is always up ahead.</p>

<p>13) The Reddit voting system is so skewed, the value of the individual voter is so lost, the voting system might as well be called fake. The organic, democratic, precedent set by the early days of Reddit turned out to be a training session for a corporate plaza atmosphere, and now people are left pushing placebo buttons similarly to how pedestrians push placebo crosswalk buttons in busy cities.</p>

<p>14) In “The Century of the Self”, we are taught that the main goal is to get consumers to make irrational and emotion-based decisions, even if those decisions are at odds with what they value.</p>

<p>15) The internet was once a place different than the place it is today, but now the books have been written on how to manipulate the online masses, and what is apparent is that the internet isn’t only the greatest communication tool the world has ever known, but the most effective propaganda tool the world has ever known – and that’s not a hyperbolic statement.</p>

<p>16) It’s much more than a “If you don’t like it then leave argument.” Not everyone has the time or the capacity to understand what is going on in this new age of propaganda on the internet, but these are also the people who will be swept along and will ultimately have an impact on the more knowledgeable person, whether with that knowledge he or she quits any individual service or not.</p>

<p>17) The trust is gone for me. Even in the smaller subreddits, the skepticism is already there. Maybe the future is to embrace it all. I find that sad, because so much is pushed to get us to not think or converse in-depth, but to get us to associate idea and solutions as overly simplified and/or product-based. In the end, it’s a hollow sense of fulfillment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of this is true.  </p>

<p>But I for one will continue to counterpropagandize.  You know what I find most helpful in this activity?  Facts and history and citations.  It&#39;s absolutely amazing how powerful those dagum things are.  They absolutely confound the establishment because they&#39;re so difficult to discredit.  Oh but they try, usually by changing language itself, mutating science, discrediting the source or discrediting the messenger.  <em>Doubtmaking</em> they call it.</p>

<p>Anyway, my point generally is that <em>you have to create your own culture</em> from within the fuming husk of dead and decaying one rife with problems.</p>

<p>You have to become a postcultural voice in this world of illiberal empire, ignoring the culture vampires, obamas ministry of truth and the disinformationalizing sound bites of corporate sponsored media harpies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Afraid of the backlash.  They usually try and be sneaky and subtle about it by manipulating Reddit and the mods, or subterfuge.

    <div class="md"><p>But since the MSM pretty much has it in for Trump, I don&#39;t see how they couldn&#39;t get away with shutting down the <a href="/r/thedonald">/r/thedonald</a> sub.

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit is a place where hivemind groupthink and dank memes get rewarded with upvotes. If you deviate from the general consensus of the particular subreddit you&#39;re posting on, you are spammed with downvotes. If you disagree with a moderator&#39;s point of view and cause too much trouble for them, you are more than likely to be banned from that subreddit, often with your posts and/or thread deleted or locked. Votes are often maniupulated by bots and/or alt reddit accounts. Your opinion only matters if you get enough upvotes and will only matter for as long as the thread stays up on the &quot;hot&quot; frontpage. Almost all popular subreddits have a legion of toxic users and trolls who spew negativity and lies any time they can because the biased (liberal / left-leaning) moderators allow them to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Except the front page where all the subs compete to have their content reach it. Which is why there has been active efforts to stop the Trump subs upvotes in some cases. And we even saw r/european get pretty much shut down.

    <div class="md"><p>Uh, this is not news. Of course reddit will be seized upon as it is a huge link share site that disseminates information to millions of people daily.</p>

<p>This is not shocking or even news worthy. There are basically no changes in the human condition or what motivates people in all of history. Only technology has changed. Humans and their attitudes towards most things have not.</p>

<p>Paotastrophe was the clear change demarcation point. Bring in the jerk, make sweeping changes, people complain, fire the jerk but the changes stay, people are happy because you fired the jerk, done.</p>

<p>Same political moves used in any situation really. This is why you have in the US a president who is supposed to be the opposite of the guy before, but really, he&#39;s carried on with everything that the previous guy put in place. </p>

<p>This is how things are. I wish they&#39;d be more brutally honest quite frankly. Power is power after all. No reason to hide it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that many of these long-term, easy to remember default subs are heavily moderated by people who don&#39;t necessarily have the interests of information proliferation at heart.  While new subs have gained popularity and have made it to the front page (like <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a>) page frequently, this is an exception to the trend.  The key is to continue to try to provide new and interesting content and build from there.  The system that underpins reddit is obviously part of the problem, but it also simultaneously provides the tools to overcome it.</p>

<p>That definitely sounds plausible, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the voting method throughout reddit is somehow compromised.  At the same time, it still demonstrates that the ability to counteract the dominant narrative on the site still exists.</p>

My reasoning being that your normal reddit user doesn&#39;t have access to a script, multiple fake accounts and possibly and army of proxy servers.

somebody asked a question what the best video game is?</p>

<p>a number of people answered &quot;deus ex&quot;. although i never ever heard about that game.</p>

<p>so i downloaded it. it was some sort of dystopian cyberpunk RPG adventure shooter game. you have all kind of weapons and implants to buy or pick up along the game.</p>

<p>including tranquillers, crossbow, crowbar, knife, firearms, and other bullshit.</p>

<p>at first i asked myself why is it considered the best video game? i concluded probably bcos it has something to do with rebeling against the system.</p>

<p>then yesterday i realized that this game was really about transhumanism. the final satanic agenda to eradicate biological life form?</p>

<p>dont get me wrong, i laughed at the idea about AIs too at first. but somehow it became a what if question. afterall reality is stranger than fiction, they say?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first thing forum spies do is they cast doubt, which usually includes ad hominems, and sweeping statements about how sweeping op&#39;s statement is.  If they want to get fancy, they copypasta fake science from bigcorps.  People don&#39;t know science anymore, which is a proven fact because the illusion of 9/11 isn&#39;t wholly refuted. What this means is that fakescience is usually upvoted because people don&#39;t know anything but it sounds legit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t this exactly what we are all complaining about though.. Someone comes with a counter opinion and we jump on him and act like dicks because his viewpoints are different. I dont necessarily agree with his opinion but we could at least have a dialogue about it rather than shut it down....... Not that his backhanded comment really lent much to be discussed but still.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, let&#39;s discuss this one:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2) The premise of Reddit has been hijacked. It’s no longer the people creating the system, but what has become the system looking to create the people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What makes this true at all? Go look at <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> and tell me what  on the front page looks like the system trying to &quot;create the people&quot;.</p>

<p>The very top post right this instant is a discussion of censorship, and it&#39;s on <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>.</p>
