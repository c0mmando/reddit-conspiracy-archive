       At the time I will assume the deaths are real and crisis actors were there to completely control this from the start, but other assumptions are appreciated.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've watched everything unfold over the last few hours and I have seen information consistently disappear, A LOT of it, this was beyond any effort I have ever seen to create a narrative, to be clear I do not care about Islam but this needs to be said, the Islam extremism is completely artificially injected in here, this man had ties to the FBI and a security firm (G4S), this was not religiously inspired, they do everything they can to suppress the amount of shooters too and have no good reason for waiting hours before entering:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&amp;v=HZ35V0etHiM">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&amp;v=HZ35V0etHiM
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The stories got drastically edited where they first also said 2 shooters, then it was like 40 shots, then 100, then they immediately found an ID on the man, then he suddenly told his name during a call to 911, and supposedly during that call he also said he was with ISIS, that was claimed by the FBI before the name mention was even made, I think this will be the most damning piece of evidence, and needs to absolutely be acquired by an independent investigator, this is government ordered slaughter beyond anything we would have ever seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems like they had crisis actors outside waiting to give interviews right after and the right people at the right time to make videos, to make it seem as 1 shooter, as I said it also seems like they had the plan to completely control the narrative from the start with 1 shooter and as a terrorist, but that went wrong as shown above, that they instantly had multiple officers find an ID on him, we all know where that comes from, we need to try get officers to corroborate this, all records of this have been wiped I could find online and I only got a scre0enshot I think.
      </p>
      <p>
       U.S. officials outside the FBI from the start seemed to realize the extent of this and tried to change what was going on and said there was no credible link to IS despite FBI claims although always in secrecy I assume for fear of retaliation, afterwards you had rather quickly the amaq agency claiming responsibility in the name of IS, just to be clear here, that's all bullshit, IS has no top hackers, they started a US/NATO program specifically for cyber warfare and recruited people for it, claims from this 'news' agency are CIA/NATO, they tried to make it credible with this announcement because their original claim had failed and they rushed this out as someone had pointed out, but still reports got out from US intelligence that this proves nothing and there was no reason to assume any link.
      </p>
      <p>
       After this they got in high gear and pumped up this story:
       <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/06/12/orlando-gunman-tied-to-radical-imam-released-from-prison-last-year-say-law-enforcement-sources.html">
        http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/06/12/orlando-gunman-tied-to-radical-imam-released-from-prison-last-year-say-law-enforcement-sources.html
       </a>
       so they now claim credible links and the senator who previously had no good reason to assume IS links suddenly became credible.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the casualties are indeed this high, this is government organized slaughter with intent to create chaos, we need to demand completely independent investigation possible and if you can, try get the following going:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The witness claiming 2 guns needs to be found, his testimony is very damning and brought to light.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the 911 call has to be provided and shown it was exactly like they said, because the original claims were the ID was on the suspect.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Same with the other IS links they now claim, this all needs to be verified completely
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why there was a controlled explosion
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They are claiming they won't release tapes between them for now during their supposed hostage rescue mission, bullshit, we will never see them otherwise, very important too
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Claims were made of ar-15 and handgun, the witness his description was quite clear that automatic rifles were being used.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The same guy who kept the door shut is not being honest, he knowingly kept it shut according to the other witness.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       You can tell that they are constantly using the same people for interviews and they don't know what they are talking about, the story changes with them all the time and no emotion at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's more important than ever we get answers, and these points are the most important ones I can come up with because this reeks false flag, any suggestions or theories are accepted.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI is now even asking for anyone to come and see them "you might not know what you did or did not see"
      </p>
      <p>
       This seems like another attempt to create a credible profile with multiple witnesses that he was a Muslim and inspired as thus
      </p>
      <p>
       We should demand independent investigation of the FBI, this is the absolute minimum, as long as they control it we will never know the truth.

       I'm watching MSNBC discuss how he got in the bar with an AR15 and "had a drink" before the attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Earlier I was hearing that he fought with the off-duty officer who was doing security.
      </p>
      <p>
       What?
      </p>
      <p>
       Between these bits is a picture of an AR15 and the constant dribble that "this is the primary weapon used in mass-shootings" with run downs of past incidents and victim counts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Talk of him being a terroist is definitely 2nd to him being able to get an AR15.
      </p>
      <p>
       It really feels like the narrative is, "If he couldn't get this rifle, he wouldn't have killed so many."
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, 3 hours for the police to go in and confront him? Seriously? Did they just wait for him to run out of bullets/stop killing?

       I didn't realize that was before he went in. How it got spun into him "having a drink" first is beyond me.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other thing that bothers me is that it took 3 hours for the police to get in and stop him. I understand the difficulty in maybe identifying and subduing the shooter in a dark environment, but 3 hours?
      </p>
      <p>
       Shit like this just makes me want to carry while not legally allowed to do so in places like bars/nightclubs.

       They have completely shown this is a fraud exactly on the ar-15 point, not because of their clearly biased stance, but how it's described.
      </p>
      <p>
       That fucking shit head who shut the door, he said it was a continuous shooting, he literally confirmed an automatic weapon was used, civilians can't buy those, I'm gonna get that piece just to have that black on white, what he was using was not an ar-15, I love how they screwed themselves over on this one.

       I would bet my life that the average person that doesn't own a gun cannot tell between a full auto rifle and someone rapidly firing a semi automatic rifle. Have you ever talked to someone that has never shot or been around guns? They know almost nothing and all their info comes from movies. Most people that don't shoot would be amazed how fast a semi auto weapon can be fired.

       This is doing nothing but perpetuating ignorance and fear. Just what they want! A picture of a mean ol Glock has been added to the stock AR15 picture they show every 5 minutes too.

       They make triggers that use the force of blowback from the chamber to shove the trigger back into firing position faster. Semi's can be shot at impressive speeds with little extra skill.

       I thought that required material that would require an extra check or buy, well I learn every day, would this actually hold up very long like the situation he(they) was in?
      </p>
      <p>
       But I just realized what a stupid idea it is to even try prove anything there and get anywhere with it, just the fact you have multiple independent witnesses claim multiple shooters were there is all we need to ask.

       Actually valid questions. Studies have shown that up to 70% of American children are NOT genetically related to both parents, often through infidelity that's undiscovered.
      </p>

       So yes, there actually is no way short of a confirmed DNA test to take your parents at their word. You have a ~30% chance of being right in doing so.

       OK you guys are really going for a stretch here. I live in Orlando for my whole life. the explosion was a stun grenade. and the media is not telling ppl the whole truth. there are 2 shooters on the loose. that makes 3 shooters total which makes a lot more sense

       So, I will have to look into this further myself, but just wondering if anyone else has heard anything like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I live near Orlando.  I was just talking to my mom about what happened and she mentioned that my brother was downtown at a different club Saturday night.  According to him (via her), everyone was being told by police that they had to leave around midnight and that they were really pushy and rude about it and he didn't realize why until they got home and saw this on the news.
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I've been able to find, that seems too early for the two events to be related (news puts the shooting starting at 2am), but I don't know of any other reason police would be evacuating a nearby club (or more perhaps?) hours before they close on a Saturday night.  As I said, I would like to talk to him about it, but haven't gotten a chance yet being that I just heard this a few minutes ago.  In the meantime, I figured I'd share this here to see if anyone else might have any information as to some unrelated reason this would have happened.  And if anyone has heard similar stories from people or were downtown that night, even better.  *Also, keep in mind that this may be a misunderstanding by my mom or my brother being drunk and confused.  I promise I'm not posting bullshit intentionally if this turns out to be nothing.

       Something like this I would absolutely expect to be on video. If police are kicking people out of a popular club 2 hours early, people are going to be pissed off and want to record it. Lack of video of the shooting seems at least somewhat plausible, as people would be scared for their life, but in the situation where cops are just forcing people out of a club, someone's going to record that.

       I hope collaboratively, all news, photos, testimonies and every other evidence can be collected and shared. 50+ dead over a 3 hour period and no one rushed the guy? Couldn't identify the bodies (apparently they don't allow ID's in that club unless you're the gunman)? Same with inside footage, 300 people there, 200 survived and no one has put a video or pictures up yet (that I've been able to find)? It would take a special kind of person to believe the narrative being fed to us. Unfortunately, everyone I know seems to be that special kind of person. Reminds me of the news telling the nation that it was Osama Bin Laden before the dust had even settled.. Literally!

       I've talked about the video part, I found a video right after that was tweeted to them, 300 is an exaggeration because I don't think that many would fit and it was not filled to the brim, but there was certainly quite some people

       Sadly they got those removed and I did not save them, I hope I can find them, I'm searching

       All you saw was the club, it was very dark in there and I'd say it was semi-busy, you'd see some people all over the place but certainly not completely packed like they say, but nothing really happens it are short videos.

       I did see one video on liveleak.com but it didn't show much of anything either. One person was laying on the floor and there weren't that many people. I suppose it could have been taken after the event but if someone was going to take a video inside, I think they would have shown the extent of damage.

       Also, I do feel that I would rush the guy, hit him over the head, stab him with glass... something. I'm not a save the day hero or a fighter or anything of that sort, but I still feel I would do at least that. Maybe try to get a group to do it. There was 3 hours to do that and none of 300 people or a group of them did it?

       If you actually watch it or have the sligntest idea of how snapchat works you'd realize she was already recording and just happened to catch it in the background. It's pretty obvious she didn't even notice it at first either.

       The guy with the flag shirt and the fedora can be seen in 3 clips that I have seen so far:
      </p>
      <p>
       Here he is amongst the dead and wounded (and cops and other first-responders) appearing to render first aid:

       </a>
       (at about 0:27)
      </p>
      <p>
       Here he is carrying a victim down the sidewalk and delivering the least candid line imaginable ("What brought us to Orlando, huh?"):

       Also notice in this one that he can later be seen standing around the "victim" that he carried.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here he is being interviewed:

       I swear to God, yesterday I saw a reply in the megathread with a person who claimed they held the door shut. They said they held the door because there were about 30 people in the alleyway, which the door led to. The people outside had to jump a fence, and he was holding the door shut incase the shooter's were trying to come out that way. He said he would be guilty for the rest of his life if he found out people died because of it. I cant find the thread it was in or remember the guys name. I'm honestly surprised reddit isn't all over it already, bc im not the only one who saw this.

       why were the wounded people being carried towards the club from down the block? Did they get shot in the club or down the street? all seem to have leg wounds so I don't think they ran there since they were all being carried. And whats with the pickup truck? are there no ambulances in orlando? These are things i'd like to know.

       When the shooting started everyone ran in different directions. Some people made it down the block and just hid there even if they were shot. Once all the cops showed up they started bringing the injured toward the rescue staff.

       google the club and check the street view. you can see they were carrying the people from down by the open mri place and the dunkin donuts. club is in the direction they were carrying them on left hand side of the street in the videos.

       So as a local, I agree that this video shows something rather asinine... But it also cuts out some important information about what is further up that same road. ORMC (Orlando Regional Medical Hospital), which is really one the biggest and arguably best ones in the area.
      </p>
      <p>
       Small google maps of the distance between that local and the hospital.
       <a href="http://tinyurl.com/gtslsy8">
        http://tinyurl.com/gtslsy8
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I had left ORMC earlier that night from visiting my mother who had been in the hospital for the past 5 days, at approximately 12:45AM. By the time that we had gotten home and setup to get to bed my mother had begun messaging us that ORMC was on full lock down because of an active shooter, that at that time (~2:00-~2:30) was being reported in the building as possibly being in the hospital.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to me, it seems completely reasonable that you would head with any injured person, north, up that road, back past the club, to the congregation of emergency vehicles and or to the hospital that is not but 3-4 blocks up the road. The ER being on the south side of the building on that road.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just wanted to post some context for those not familiar with the area.

       That is ridiculous and there isn't a hint of evidence to suggest that is the case beyond your suspicion, but I won't hold you to providing evidence. The fact is the false flag theory doesn't even hold up under it's own logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people had just been massacred, where are all the families crying out for justice claiming the government was behind it. That is what you say in a real false flag like 9/11, but in typical hoax fashion the loved ones of the Orlando Shooting "victims" go right along with the official narrative some even go so far as to push the gun control agenda without even being provoked.

       Along with the video, we are slowly hearing more and more people who say the same thing, they aren't even given any time on TV, instead all we hear is the crisis actors, I saw this whole thing develop from start to now, they had no link whatsoever and this was reported by multiple officials so they had to create something to link him to IS and the fact they used a group for that which has been linked back to themselves and was created under their own administration says enough, I'm gonna look it up but someone who speaks Arabic says it feels like it was a message they had made rather quickly or not paid much attention to the subtle details that matter to imply an actual link, it felt like they just claimed something they did not even do, so when that was bust.
      </p>

       They suddenly have this entire story out of nowhere with no evidence.

       I know, and that's why I'm trying to establish fact from fiction right now, I saw what happened, I could see they desperately tried to get an IS link going, they could not produce the slightest actual evidence and still can't, I could see the proper information melt before my eyes in google as article after article got redacted, it was disgusting.

       Do you mean it will not hold up in the future because of this or now?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because right now if we push for evidence, they simply do not have it, that's why I'm asking everyone to ask for an independent investigation, the FBI has already established their facts.

       Both, it doesn't hold up period. I spent a lot of time debating whether these events were false flags or hoaxes, but since Tucson they all seem to be nothing more than staged drills involving crisis actors and compromised law enforcement.

       Early on, they were saying, "There are reports that he yelled 'Allahu Akbar' just before opening fire. We're... not sure where that story started. It started circulating, and we don't have any confirmation that that actually happened."
      </p>
      <p>
       Then a bit later, they just had a mysterious confirmation that that is in fact what happened, but still couldn't really reference any sources except government officials.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's just one example of this whole thing not sounding right. That with the complete lack of any footage, especially for an event that dragged on for three hours, the interviews with people who were clearly low-budget crisis actors (even the most convincing person was obviously fake), and the fact that somehow they managed to hit on just about every single major issue that they've been pushing for years (gun control, ISIS, LGBT, mass surveillance, war on terror, etc). It was waaaaay too convenient for the government. I call bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I only had to watch about 10 minutes of live coverage to be convinced that it was either all made up to begin with, or orchestrated by the government. The confirmation of the shooter's background and employment with a contractor who is known to do dirty government jobs only further proves in my mind that this is all a false flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given the public outcry, especially by the LGBT community, I'm pretty sure we just watched what's left of our freedoms die yesterday.

       I live in Orlando and have been to this club myself... It's not like a typical club you would picture... Just a huge room basically with dance floor bar, the usual... Pulse actually had several different rooms you could go into with different themes and decor. Now, if the shooter is in a room two rooms away from you for example dont you think SOMEONE, in this day and age where social media rules, would have went live on Facebook, made a snapchat, face timed a loved one to announce what was going on? Someone would have easily been able to do this without the killer hearing or seeing if that's what they were scared of... (Since people are saying it's not surprising no one got it recorded, or since no one has come Forward with anything along those lines, its because people were to scared to think or consider social media) I call bullshit... Social media is life this day and age. Also, interesting to me that they haven't really talked about what they found inside the club, and we haven't been allowed to see the gun used... I could go on and on and i have never even considered conspiracy theories before about anything... The more i watch the news the more doesn't make sense though, even to a commoner like me.

       All I have to say about the event is this:
I'm bothered that in our current political/statist climate that when something like this happens, I have no time to be outraged at the perpetrator, and I have no time to sympathize with the victims or their families, because I'm scrambling frantically to see what the fallout is going to be for ME, how MY rights and privileges are going to be f-ed with by grandstanding politicians and attention-seekers and career-makers. 
All too often a tragedy for some like this can be turned into a catastrophe for all, mostly innocent people, by bad laws in response to 'do something' to 'solve the problem'.

       So, they're trying to supress the fact that there were multiple shooters by having thier 'paid crisis actors' talk about thinking there might've been multiple shooters.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they're supressing info and putting forward a pre-planned narrative, and the evidence for that is the fact that the narrative keeps changing.
      </p>
      <p>
       This 'changing narrative' stuff always happens in the chaos of reporting a spree shooting. The one thing all witnesses agree on is that they didn't really know what the fuck was going on; changing reports of the number of shooters happens just about every time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd be more suspect if there
       <em>
        wasn't
       </em>
       a chaotic, confused narrative that varied from witness to witness.

      </p>
      <p>
       He has access to all the intelligence so can get an honest view on things and the way he talks about these things it's hard to tell if he is involved and if so, how, or that he is just playing along, but especially now I think his tone does not help anyone, he should know this already raises tensions, so why raise them even further.

       If this were a staged event, and if the instigator were a government actor (remember that it might not be the US government, just as  it probably wasn't the US behind 9/11), it would follow a long pattern of public violence to achieve political goals.  Edward Bernays pioneered this with his work for United Fruit Company in the 1950s, engineering a coup of Guatemala for corporate interests by manipulating public fear of communism.  A similar template could be at work here, except using Islam as the scapegoat instead of communism.

       There are a number of corporations and governments who stand to gain handsomely by inspiring anti-Islam sentiment in the American public.

       A vaguely islamic guy uses an 'assault rifle' to murder gays and racks up the biggest kill count in Us History...they couldn't have written that better if they tried. It's a quadrifecta.
      </p>
      <p>
       it checks all the boxes, and just like 9/11, the MIC can spin this into trillions in spending. Heck, this could start a whole new phase in the War on Terror. It'll certainly at least spur a try at an assault weapons ban, that anti-gun groups can fundraise billions off of. It's a bonanza. Hell, they might even get a New Civil Rights Act out of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And keep in mind, those outcomes are with ZERO staging/false-flag. Those things would all still happen, and be hardcore exploited, regardless of the reality of the event. It's just our current political system. No crisis, especially one this big and globally reaching, will be let go to waste. This is a huge gift to the current regime and even if they had nothing to do with it at all, they still get the gift.

       Sometimes people do said crazy shit, and it ruins the lives of hundreds of millions of innocent people not involved in any way via the fallout.

      <p>
       As one of those hundreds of millions who's probably going to get my rights, privileges, freedoms, and tax money raped by the response to this 'event', I'd like to get a better sense of why it happened than 'shit happens'.
