       I've traveled 14 states in the past 3 weeks for work, including California, all states in the Northeast, and most of the South. I've seen Trump signs and bumper stickers here and there, especially in the South, and I've seen Sanders signs and stickers all over. On trains I've seen Sanders buttons on people's backpacks and stickers on their laptops, and dozens of trucks with Trump stickers. But throughout my travels I've seen only ONE Hillary Clinton signage of any sort -- a lone bumper sticker on a car in New York City. Where are the Hillary supporters?
      </p>
      <p>
       One explanation is that Trump and Sanders supporters are much more enthusiastic than Clinton voters, who are going through the motions.
      </p>
      <p>
       But perhaps there's another explanation -- perhaps the voting is rigged. Perhaps there are, in fact, very few Hillary Clinton supporters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Has anyone else experienced the phenomenon of the apparent missing Hillary supporters?

       Lets not forget that time when that old man McCain actually had a shot at the presidency and TPTB had to place Sarah Palin on the ticket to kill it. That's pretty greasy stuff too. Since Oct. 26, 2001 it's all 100% theater.

       I agree. 2004 election was real bad with 2 Skull&amp;Boners.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2016 election is still ahead. The Repub primaries turned out to be honest in the end. The Dem primaries - turn out pretty low, I understand. 2 candidates each with their own strong negatives.

       I, too, have noticed the absence of Hillary supporters.
Democratic primary turnout is 40% lower than last election cycle (and even those anemic numbers were driven by Bernie fans, not Hillary supporters). Subtract the Bernie fans and turnout was what? 67% lower? And her [rare] rallies are routinely underpopulated, and held in half-filled venues. See here:
       <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/01/three-days-before-caucus-hillary-clinton-stumps-to-half-empty-room-in-dubuque-iowa/">

       She hasn't even given a press conference in 7 months.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a woman who hides, and is given to Nixonian secrecy. She doesn't like hobnobbing with the "unwashed masses" or being touched by them--and the feeling is obviously mutual since so few people are showing up at her scheduled events.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like you, I've noticed Trump and Bernie signs everywhere. Hillary signs are like finding a four-leaf clover. You feel so lucky if you spot one. (It's the oddest phenomenon: She's outspent every other candidate, and by a wide margin--but has the fewest signs and the smallest events. Either she's running the most ineffective campaign in history--or she has no fans, and is embezzling money from the campaign and re-directing it toward the Clinton Foundation's coffers.)

       It is extremely evident that the elections are rigged. Bernie and Trump are far too appealing to their target demographics for anyone to throw a blind "I have no idea" vote for her. Voting takes effort. People don't vote unless they
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       want to support a candidate. In my view, people are more likely to go for a blank vote than to vote for Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's worthy to note that, despite this, there is still massive voter suppression (or, at least, a lot of it is reported in
       <a href="/r/SandersForPresident/">
        /r/SandersForPresident/
       </a>
       ). Perhaps this is because they want you to direct your hate at Clinton instead of the establishment when, in reality, Hillary can't rig an election, only the establishment can.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's quite smart actually, they're even keeping the FBI case as an ace up their sleeve: in case they expect rebellion, just boot Hillary out of the race. If they were to do this, it would be very detrimental to their wealth, but it would still be better than getting hanged in the public square

       My work requires me to travel to all the major Texas cities and many small towns in between. I've seen a few dozen Trump stickers and exactly 3 Hillary stickers. There are front yards dedicated entirely to signage for the Bern, I've lost count of how many Bernie stickers I've seen. Just like in 2012 it was Ron Paul everywhere and I didn't even know what Romney's logo looked like until he was 'nominated'.

       Of course the votes are rigged (by design). I'm a voluntaryist but I don't have a bumper sticker or a flag waving it on my property. Outside of reddit (young liberals) many wish to vote that cunt into office (why? no idea). I wish my fellow country men and women would realize the game is rigged and toss all the shmucks out (Bernie, Clinton, Trump, etc etc). Kokesh has the right idea... You should look into him...

       I have also noticed it.

      <p>
       I suspect that it's a combination of things.  Yes, I really do suspect good old voter fraud.  I also think that a lot of people vote Hillary because they won't vote for the "socialist" and they won't vote for Trump.
      </p>

       Regardless, this election has been a shocker in terms of bias by the DNC...

       More anecdotal evidence for the pile:
      </p>
      <p>
       I work in real estate and travel across the state of Texas rather frequently. My social circles are pretty diverse by most standards, and I have never met or seen a Hillary supporter, or bumper sticker, or yard sign. I've overheard chatter in sub shops, smoke shops, tattoo shops, barbershops... All over the past few months... Bashing trump, slamming clinton... They just generally hated everyone.

       If this election cycle did anything; it woke up a bunch of people to the reality of our societal systems. A lot of information has come to light over the last year. A lot of corruption, things that make people scratch their head and say "wait a minute.". When Vanity Fair post an article that said "If you're a democrat and don't support Hillary Clinton; you're probably a sexist", I knew what this whole election cycle was going to be all about. Manipulation. From all end of the spectrum. No one will openly confess their support for Hillary, because they will get debated to no emd on why she is completely wrong for this country. Most people's response is "i want to make sure the next justice is blue not red"

       Literally no one is voting for this stupid bitch.  She's on par with how "popular" Jeb Bush was.  Remember all of the people (mostly zionist s..
Friends of Israel) who were claiming another Bush would be elected, even though no one could stand the soulless asshole.  Well, identically to how Jeb was/is viewed, Shillary literally ALSO has ZERO support from the citizens.  These fucking idiots are going to destroy their entire game by FORCING this worthless FELON and TRAITOR Into the presidency with literally ZERO support. She won't see more than 3% of he popular vote, yet still may win.
      </p>

       I'm hearing more and more formerly sheep like individuals remark about how much bullshit these staged elections are.  The masses of the treat unwashed are waking up in droves.  I'm glad I'm able to witness the people, by and large, ready to throw in the towel, and refuse to play these obviously bullshit games.  Like pretending their vote is acrually counted and matters.

       Yes, but odd that in the real world -- outside the MSM websites -- there are so few markers of her supposed front-runner status. If she's so popular, where are her supporters? Where's the physical evidence? Why are her rallies barely more than 200 people in some instances, while Sanders and Trump are packing in 20,000 people? Hell, where are the fucking Hillary yard signs?

       We're starting to sound like "top minds."  Consider that we likely mostly fall into a specific demographic.  I would chalk Hillary's win up to low-information voters and older people who are liberal, but not that liberal.

       It really isn't.  "The silent majority" is a longstanding phenomenon in our country.  Many politicians have tried to claim it as a "moral majority" of americans who care deeply, but quietly.  In reality, I would wager it's all low-information and apathetic voters.

       Apathetic voters shouldn't be voting in the primaries though. I know there is some Democratic tribalism going on. People voting for her simply because they think she has best chance to win, and want Liberal domination of the SC. Willing to overlook her history of scandals just to win. But it's true her numbers just don't seem to line up with her success.

       I've made a few very similar comments over the past few months. Hillary has no real support, just the media claiming she is leading or winning. Even Fox News is saying Trump will be hard pressed to beat Hillary. The fix is in - the only vocal support I have seen is from a sub here for lesbians and a black radio dj saying he supported Hillary but was calling her out for the other politicians cpt comment. She's a disaster waiting to happen or should I say planned to happen. If people don't make more noise now and get her removed I fear the worst in the next 4 years. She has no popular majority and it should be painfully obvious even though the media keeps saying she's winning.

       The popular support isn't there and there are no bumper stickers. It's all media bullshit that more people are noticing than expected. Almost every primary has had some shenanigans with her losing the numbers but getting the credit. People just flat out DON'T like her and they sure as hell don't trust het.

       From the South here,where I work there are several people voting for Clinton (If you believe break room chatter) they believe Sanders is a Socialist,and Trump a blowhard.But there in depth knowledge of Clinton is limited,so she is getting votes by name recognition alone.

       I have always looked at the pres as the lessor of two (or three) evils. But if she is the most evil by definition, how is she king of the hill? Because the US doesn't see Trump or Sanders as the right glove for certain groups in the east. In fact, to fight the fights we're involved in currently, I think it requires evil at the most fundamental political level possible. Now who are we thinking about? There is still one small issue with gender and improving foreign relations, but I'm not touching that.

       I've been using the theme of this thread as a comment for the past 3 months. There's no way there are as many Hillary voters and supporters as they claim there are, even if based soley on yard signs and bumper stickers. She supposedly carried this state, and I maybe see one pro Clinton anything once a week.

       There aren't Hillary "supporters", but people who just vote for her anyway because they feel like everyone else is too extreme.  Sorry to break it to you... it's no real conspiracy.

       Shills are needed when a candidate has no or few supporters. They're paid to pretend there is mass support when there is in fact none.

       Paid public relations firms aren't supporters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary has to pay for fans--because she has none.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Trump, by contrast, doesn't have to spend a penny and his legion of REAL fans will shitpost and create all sorts of videos, memes and other content for him.)
      </p>
      <p>
       He never has to pay for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary does.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Which is why his campaign could be run on a shoestring budget and she's spending like a drunken sailor. To win the primary, I think Trump spent $47 million. Hillary spent $270 million.) Why the disparity? Trump actually has supporters. Hillary has to pay for the
       <em>
        appearance
       </em>
       of supporters by hiring public relations firms.

       Think of how Orwellian the situation is: Millions of fake Twitter followers pretending to read tweets written not by Hillary herself, but by an intern at a public relations firm posing as Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fake candidate, fake followers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Friggin' bizarre when you stop to think about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       (And tragic when you consider how many millions of dollars are spent on this theater when the money could have been put to better use, feeding the sick and poor. Heck, had she just done
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       with the money it would have been better for her public relations! Like what Trump did when he raised money for the vets. But Hillary's so used to mis-spending other people's money, she doesn't give a thought to how wasteful it is. Imagine the way such a woman would run up US debt. Profligacy and incompetence, thy name is Hillary Clinton.)
