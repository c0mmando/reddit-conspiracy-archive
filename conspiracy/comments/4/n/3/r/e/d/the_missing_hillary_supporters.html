        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve traveled 14 states in the past 3 weeks for work, including California, all states in the Northeast, and most of the South. I&#39;ve seen Trump signs and bumper stickers here and there, especially in the South, and I&#39;ve seen Sanders signs and stickers all over. On trains I&#39;ve seen Sanders buttons on people&#39;s backpacks and stickers on their laptops, and dozens of trucks with Trump stickers. But throughout my travels I&#39;ve seen only ONE Hillary Clinton signage of any sort -- a lone bumper sticker on a car in New York City. Where are the Hillary supporters?</p>

<p>One explanation is that Trump and Sanders supporters are much more enthusiastic than Clinton voters, who are going through the motions. </p>

<p>But perhaps there&#39;s another explanation -- perhaps the voting is rigged. Perhaps there are, in fact, very few Hillary Clinton supporters.</p>

<p>Has anyone else experienced the phenomenon of the apparent missing Hillary supporters?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I, too, have noticed the absence of Hillary supporters.
Democratic primary turnout is 40% lower than last election cycle (and even those anemic numbers were driven by Bernie fans, not Hillary supporters). Subtract the Bernie fans and turnout was what? 67% lower? And her [rare] rallies are routinely underpopulated, and held in half-filled venues. See here: <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/01/three-days-before-caucus-hillary-clinton-stumps-to-half-empty-room-in-dubuque-iowa/">http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/01/three-days-before-caucus-hillary-clinton-stumps-to-half-empty-room-in-dubuque-iowa/</a></p>

<p>She hasn&#39;t even given a press conference in 7 months.</p>

<p>This is a woman who hides, and is given to Nixonian secrecy. She doesn&#39;t like hobnobbing with the &quot;unwashed masses&quot; or being touched by them--and the feeling is obviously mutual since so few people are showing up at her scheduled events.</p>

<p>Like you, I&#39;ve noticed Trump and Bernie signs everywhere. Hillary signs are like finding a four-leaf clover. You feel so lucky if you spot one. (It&#39;s the oddest phenomenon: She&#39;s outspent every other candidate, and by a wide margin--but has the fewest signs and the smallest events. Either she&#39;s running the most ineffective campaign in history--or she has no fans, and is embezzling money from the campaign and re-directing it toward the Clinton Foundation&#39;s coffers.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is extremely evident that the elections are rigged. Bernie and Trump are far too appealing to their target demographics for anyone to throw a blind &quot;I have no idea&quot; vote for her. Voting takes effort. People don&#39;t vote unless they <em>really</em> want to support a candidate. In my view, people are more likely to go for a blank vote than to vote for Hillary.</p>

<p>It&#39;s worthy to note that, despite this, there is still massive voter suppression (or, at least, a lot of it is reported in <a href="/r/SandersForPresident/">/r/SandersForPresident/</a>). Perhaps this is because they want you to direct your hate at Clinton instead of the establishment when, in reality, Hillary can&#39;t rig an election, only the establishment can.</p>

<p>It&#39;s quite smart actually, they&#39;re even keeping the FBI case as an ace up their sleeve: in case they expect rebellion, just boot Hillary out of the race. If they were to do this, it would be very detrimental to their wealth, but it would still be better than getting hanged in the public square</p>

<p>I suspect that it&#39;s a combination of things.  Yes, I really do suspect good old voter fraud.  I also think that a lot of people vote Hillary because they won&#39;t vote for the &quot;socialist&quot; and they won&#39;t vote for Trump.</p>

<p>Regardless, this election has been a shocker in terms of bias by the DNC...</p>

<p>I work in real estate and travel across the state of Texas rather frequently. My social circles are pretty diverse by most standards, and I have never met or seen a Hillary supporter, or bumper sticker, or yard sign. I&#39;ve overheard chatter in sub shops, smoke shops, tattoo shops, barbershops... All over the past few months... Bashing trump, slamming clinton... They just generally hated everyone.</p>

<p>But also no one was ever talking about Bernie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If this election cycle did anything; it woke up a bunch of people to the reality of our societal systems. A lot of information has come to light over the last year. A lot of corruption, things that make people scratch their head and say &quot;wait a minute.&quot;. When Vanity Fair post an article that said &quot;If you&#39;re a democrat and don&#39;t support Hillary Clinton; you&#39;re probably a sexist&quot;, I knew what this whole election cycle was going to be all about. Manipulation. From all end of the spectrum. No one will openly confess their support for Hillary, because they will get debated to no emd on why she is completely wrong for this country. Most people&#39;s response is &quot;i want to make sure the next justice is blue not red&quot;</p>

Well, identically to how Jeb was/is viewed, Shillary literally ALSO has ZERO support from the citizens.  These fucking idiots are going to destroy their entire game by FORCING this worthless FELON and TRAITOR Into the presidency with literally ZERO support. She won&#39;t see more than 3% of he popular vote, yet still may win.</p>

<p>I&#39;m hearing more and more formerly sheep like individuals remark about how much bullshit these staged elections are.  The masses of the treat unwashed are waking up in droves.  I&#39;m glad I&#39;m able to witness the people, by and large, ready to throw in the towel, and refuse to play these obviously bullshit games.

Even Fox News is saying Trump will be hard pressed to beat Hillary. The fix is in - the only vocal support I have seen is from a sub here for lesbians and a black radio dj saying he supported Hillary but was calling her out for the other politicians cpt comment. She&#39;s a disaster waiting to happen or should I say planned to happen. If people don&#39;t make more noise now and get her removed I fear the worst in the next 4 years.

    <div class="md"><p>Paid public relations firms aren&#39;t supporters.</p>

<p>Hillary has to pay for fans--because she has none. </p>

<p>(Trump, by contrast, doesn&#39;t have to spend a penny and his legion of REAL fans will shitpost and create all sorts of videos, memes and other content for him.)</p>

<p>He never has to pay for it.</p>

<p>Hillary does.</p>

<p>(Which is why his campaign could be run on a shoestring budget and she&#39;s spending like a drunken sailor. To win the primary, I think Trump spent $47 million. Hillary spent $270 million.) Why the disparity? Trump actually has supporters. Hillary has to pay for the <em>appearance</em> of supporters by hiring public relations firms. <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/4/21/1518537/-Clinton-SuperPac-Admits-to-Paying-Internet-Trolls">http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/4/21/1518537/-Clinton-SuperPac-Admits-to-Paying-Internet-Trolls</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think of how Orwellian the situation is: Millions of fake Twitter followers pretending to read tweets written not by Hillary herself, but by an intern at a public relations firm posing as Hillary.</p>

<p>Fake candidate, fake followers.</p>

<p>Friggin&#39; bizarre when you stop to think about it.</p>

<p>(And tragic when you consider how many millions of dollars are spent on this theater when the money could have been put to better use, feeding the sick and poor. Heck, had she just done <em>that</em> with the money it would have been better for her public relations! Like what Trump did when he raised money for the vets. But Hillary&#39;s so used to mis-spending other people&#39;s money, she doesn&#39;t give a thought to how wasteful it is. Imagine the way such a woman would run up US debt. Profligacy and incompetence, thy name is Hillary Clinton.)</p>
