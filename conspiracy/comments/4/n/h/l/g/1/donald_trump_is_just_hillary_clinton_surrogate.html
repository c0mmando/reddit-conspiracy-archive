<p>Trump has destroyed the GOP. He&#39;s Hitler incarnate, according to MSM. He&#39;s a babbling buffoon that lives for the attention.</p>

<p>And meanwhile MSM has all but canonized Hillary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this will be debunked by the end of June, when Trump comes out with a spotlight on Clinton corruption.  If this doesn&#39;t happen, it doesn&#39;t happen.  But I really think Trump is about to go for Clinton&#39;s throat.  </p>

<p>He claims that this or next Monday he&#39;ll hold a press conference exclusively on the corruption and moral bankruptcy of Hillary Clinton.  So we&#39;ll see how that goes.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>May be Trump is playing from both sides. He is a business man and reality star. I am just not sure he really expect to be president when he started this campaign. But I am sure he wanted to promote himself for monetary gain and this is like the best venue to do it. He is winning with his brand recognition even if he loses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure he expected to be president, either.  But I honestly get the impression that he is genuinely frustrated by the clearly awful decisions the US gov has been making, and as a businessman thinks there are simple solutions to our massive debt.  </p>

<p>This is a country that made him his fortune, and I think he actually cares about keeping this as a &quot;land of opportunity&quot; for his children and grandchildren.  </p>

<p>Also, he&#39;s got a massive ego and seems to really want to be in the history books.  Wouldn&#39;t it make more sense for him to try and be the &quot;superhero&quot; president and be remembered favorably?  </p>

<p>I agree that he&#39;s probably a little underprepared for the reality of the office, but when it comes down to it our options are pretty much Criminal Globalist Psychopath or Douchey, Egotistical, but Genuine Outsider.  I&#39;d hedge my bets with the second, despite not loving his positions on many things.   </p>

<p>Yep I guess that&#39;s how it can equate, in the head space of non-sense. Selling jobs overseas for corporate interests be it NAFTA or soon to be TPP over the interests of workers isn&#39;t marxism, not by long shot.</p>

<p>Oh you lovely man! That statement proves to me you&#39;ve never read marx, and unlike you I&#39;ve read quite a bit. Again reality proves your <em>cough</em> alternate viewpoint wrong. Understand the terms not just the stigmatized visage of your head space. Like in the late 1800&#39;s the geo political atmosphere of the worlds superpowers wasn&#39;t one of selling off their own nations wealth and prosperity for it&#39;s elite&#39;s, at the time they still had colonies and other markets to exploit for their growth and regulation to prevent that even if that were the case. Marx would literally have no commentary on what you just said. Cut to Reaganomics where he walmartized our economy for quick profit gain at the cost of the prosperity and self determinism for the nation as a whole. Regan&#39;s era was the time of deregulation, which fuNked the average American. And instead of repealing such a shortsighted economic viewpoint the democrats be it Clinton or Obama embraced it! Why did they have to embrace it? Because after deregulation there were 4 major media establishments when in the early 80&#39;s during the beginning of deregulation there were about 40. They have to pander to their corporate owners no if&#39;s and or butts about it.</p>

The bourgeois family will vanish as a matter of course when its complement vanishes, and both will vanish with the vanishing of capital. Do you charge us with wanting to stop the exploitation of children by their parents? To this crime we plead guilty. But, you say, we destroy the most hallowed of relations, when we replace home education by social.”</em></p>

<p>OH LOOK. Marx actually thinks the family is an evil capitalist institution intent on destroying the masses! Commies hated family so much that they replaced &quot;Fraternite&quot; in writings on the French revolution with “Comradeship”.</p>

<p><em>“The bourgeois sees his wife a mere instrument of product. He hears that the instruments of production are to be exploited in common, and, naturally, can come to.”</em></p>

<p>OH LOOK. The foundations of feminism! Women are so exploited!</p>

<p><em>“Bourgeois marriage is, in reality, a system of wives in common and thus, at the most, what the communists might possibly be reproached with is that they desire to introduce, in substitution for a hypocritically concealed, an openly legalized community of women. For the rest, it is self-evident that the abolition of the present system of production must bring with it the abolition of the community of women springing from that system, i.e,, of prostitution both public and private.”</em></p>

<p>OH LOOK. The foundation of ‘strong women who need no men’!</p>

<p><em>“The supremacy of the proletariat will cause them to vanish still faster. United action, of the leading civilized countries, at least, is one of the first conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat.”</em></p>

<p>OH LOOK. It’s evil if you are proud of your heritage. You are racist and ethnocentric!</p>

<p><em>“The charges against communism made from a religious, philosophical, and, generally, from an ideological standpoint are not deserving of serious examination.”</em></p>

<p>OH LOOK. If you&#39;re not with me, you’re against me! Off with your heads! How dare you examine my teachings!</p>

<p><em>“There are, besides, eternal truths such as freedom, justice, etc., that are common to all states of society. But communism abolishes eternal truths.”</em></p>

<p>OH LOOK. The foundation of subjectivism!</p>

<p><em>“The proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, by degree, all capital from the bourgeoise, to centralize all instruments of production in the hands of the State–i.e., of the proletariat organized as the ruling class–and to increase the total productive forces as rapidly as possible.”</em></p>

<p>The proletariat superstate will lead us to paradise. More welfare stamps for everyone!</p>

<p><em>“The communists are further reproached with desiring to abolish countries and nationality. The working men have no country. We cannot take from them what they have not got. Since the proletariat must first of all acquire political supremacy–must rise to be the leading class of the nation, must constitute itself the nation–it is so far, itself national, though not in the bourgeois sense of the word.”</em></p>

<p>Remember, having any form of national country is evil! All races are equal!</p>

<p><em>“No sooner is the exploitation of the laborer by the manufacturer, so far, at an end, that he receives his wages in cash, than he is set upon by the other portions of the bourgeoise–the landlord, the shopkeeper, the pawnbroker, etc.”</em></p>

<p>OH NO! A worker getting paid in cash? A functioning economy where people buy and sell and meet their obligations? Exploitation!</p>

<p><em>“Our bourgeois, not content with having wives and daughters of their proletarians at their disposal, not to speak of common prostitutes, takes the greatest pleasure in seducing each other’s wives.”</em></p>

<p>Remember, kids, being middle class somehow makes you prone to adultery and polygamy, Don&#39;t be rich! Rich people are evil!</p>

<p>Thanks for admitting you have no rebuttal, because there is no rebuttal, because Marx’s own writings disprove your shitposting claims.</p>

<p>They would be wrong, as European society created civilization.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But again why am I even arguing this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because you’re paid to? Because you’re too dumb to recognize the truth when it’s presented to you? Because you have no comprehension of logic or reason and thus refuse to allow anything to hurt your feelings, even if it’s truth contrary to your worldview? There’s a host of reasons, but I don’t give a fuck about any of them because you’re just plain wrong and have been proven so.</p>

<p>Donald used to be democrat.</p>

<p>He seems to have always been pretty moderate.  Liberal on some issues, conservative on others.  He took some time before deciding to run as a Republican, and considered an independent ticket.  A lot of people, myself included, were surprised to see him join the GOP officially and he does seem to have to separate his own beliefs from the party&#39;s beliefs on some subjects.  </p>

<p>But, honestly, that doesn&#39;t mean anything.  It&#39;s good to have moderate leaders who aren&#39;t consumed by party ideology.  Trump does seem to align slightly more with the Right than the Left, but at the moment the most important thing is that he aligns with his own reason and judgment rather than whatever the money tells him to align with.  </p>
