<p>Yeah, he asked it in the title, and you didn&#39;t really answer. The investigation isn&#39;t even complete.</p>

<p>You have to go to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4nh7w7/how_has_hillary_not_been_indicted/d43tz93">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4nh7w7/how_has_hillary_not_been_indicted/d43tz93</a> about 6 posts down to not get a HURR DURR response.

    <div class="md"><p>In a perfect world or even a decent world, that would be true.  But the elites don&#39;t want laws to apply equally to everyone.  The laws are a means of control and discretionary.  The elites want to control the non-elites.  Hillary screwed up by getting caught, but the elites will rally around her to ensure there are no meaningful consequences.  Had you or I done the same thing, we would be in the can on espionage and terror related charges.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re absolutely right! The rules don&#39;t apply to them. Just like when Bill used his presidential pardons to get all his corrupt buddies off the hook. All the people protecting Hillary now are the same people she will be protecting when she&#39;s in charge of it all. They&#39;re practically lining up to back her. It&#39;s sick. But at least people like you see that it&#39;s happening and are talking about it. The more of us there are that can clearly identify the problem, the less power they hold over us. </p>

If you sent me classified information on a network that wasn&#39;t accredited for that classification - be it wrong classification level or security level - I am obligated to report you.  If I do not, I can face penalties.  And then if I forward or reply to your email (assuming the chain is left intact), I&#39;m just as guilty of committing a cross-domain violation as you are.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that Clinton is going to to face penalties for her actions, but whoever told you that she&#39;s safe from charges if she didn&#39;t originate the email is fucking wrong.  And doubly so when you consider she set up the information system to begin with with the intent to bypass laws, regulations, and IT security controls (which she has openly admitted to).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well here is the thing...how did everyone else get the classified information if not using her authority? If it&#39;s her subordinates she should have fired them or told the FBI to investigate them, at the very minimum she should have ask anyone at the state department for an opinion about it.</p>

<p>Instead she continued to use a private server...which we still haven&#39;t gotten answer of why in the first place she needed a private server? She had access to plenty of secure severs she could use. </p>

<p>This should be open and shut. But money and influence is getting in the way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whoever, being an officer, employee, contractor, or consultant of the United States, and, by virtue of his office, employment, position, or contract, becomes possessed of documents or materials containing classified information of the United States, knowingly removes such documents or materials without authority and with the intent to retain such documents or materials at an unauthorized location shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both. 18USC§1924</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have enough evidence to convict Hillary under this section. </p>

<p>Plausible deniability isn&#39;t an option here...it simple does not matter...she had an unauthorized server which contained confidential information that in it self is a crime the fact that the information could only get there by virtue of her position is icing on the cake. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand the feet dragging what could a lawyer say to this?</p>

<p>Then we add this </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whoever, being entrusted with or having lawful possession or control of any document, writing, code book, signal book, sketch, photograph, photographic negative, blueprint, plan, map, model, instrument, appliance, note, or information, relating to the national defense, (1) through gross negligence permits the same to be removed from its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of his trust, or to be lost, stolen, abstracted, or destroyed, or (2) having knowledge that the same has been illegally removed from its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of its trust, or lost, or stolen, abstracted, or destroyed, and fails to make prompt report of such loss, theft, abstraction, or destruction to his superior officer—
Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both 18 USC 37 §793(f). (The Espionage act) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if she or any of her staff were aware of an attack on the server and did not make a prompt report of it they are guilty of a crime they had a legally binding obligation to attempt to inform the right people. If any of her staff did make a report and she ignored it...maybe the staffer could get off but she would be unable to defend doing nothing (and by nothing I mean not informing her department of the breach in a meaningful way, and getting someone to look into it <em>officially</em>  rather than simply &#39;in house&#39;) then it&#39;s should be game over really, but money and influence...</p>

<p>This person could be our next president...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She circumvented US security firewall so she could do dirty deals away from the eyes and ears of the us government and us intelligence.  As a person with very high  mindedness to security, that is provable by her behaviors as senator and first lady (weekly bug sweeps at white house...telling the secret service to &#39;go down the hall&#39; so she and bill could fight and talk about ???? (child rapings?)).   </p>

<p>She circumvented the security firewalls knowing the risks of theft of these documents by hackers.  And those documents <em>were</em> hacked.  And so she&#39;s culpable.  </p>

<p>What&#39;s most important is she did this <em>knowingly</em> and with <em>high mindedness to security protocols</em>.  So the excuse of &#39;I didn&#39;t know that would happen&#39; is a obvious lie.  We can prove intent.  And since privileged documents WERE stolen, and it IS HER FAULT, and she did it KNOWINGLY, it&#39;s very easy to make the charge that this was purposeful ESPIONAGE, punishable by death.</p>

<p>Or at least the same punishment as Chelsea Manning. We should sew a dick on hillary and lock her in solitary confinement for a year and keep in blackops prison for the rest of her life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She placed privileged material outside of the protocol-protected jurisdiction of the US governments security firewalls placing the material in danger of being exfiltrated by foreign nationals, which it was.  She did this knowing the danger of this, because we can prove in so many ways that she had a very keen knowledge and mindful dedication at every second of every day to security protocols, since her time as first lady she demanded scrutiny and close attention to protocols she herself enhanced, demanded, including weekly sweeps of the white house for bugs.</p>

<p>My point is she knew full well what she was doing, what the implications were, what the dangers were.  Knowing this, it&#39;s easy to say she purposefully put materials outside of the government firewall for 2 reasons: 1) to have communications so private that not even the us government or us intelligence would be able to undermine or listen in on, 2) to exfiltrate said materials to foreign nationals and intelligences...traditionally this is called espionage and it&#39;s high treason.  It&#39;s easy to prove and she should be put in front of the firing squad and shot to death.  But instead we call Snowden a traitor.   It seems privacy and espionage and treason is allowable if you&#39;re a mason double agent working for Global because America as a country is just for show...there are no boundaries for the elite, and it seems we&#39;ve been in a new world order since birth.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very easy to prove the claims above.  I have 2 books on Hillary&#39;s high security mindedness at my home right now that is sufficient evidence to prove this, and I&#39;m just one person who has not researched Hillary to the depth as many many others have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a perfect world or even a decent world, that would be true.  But the elites don&#39;t want laws to apply equally to everyone.  The laws are a means of control and discretionary.  The elites want to control the non-elites.  Hillary screwed up by getting caught, but the elites will rally around her to ensure there are no meaningful consequences.  Had you or I done the same thing, we would be in the can on espionage and terror related charges.</p>
