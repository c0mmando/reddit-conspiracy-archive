    <div class="md"><p>At this stage, it has been a joint Christian-Jewish crusade for a very long time.  U.S. pols, bureaucrats and officials alike weren&#39;t duped or suffering mental defect when they made the decisions they did with Israel.</p>

<p>Very few U.S. Presidents since Israel&#39;s founding has really liked Israel all that much.  You can clearly hear the hate and disdain Nixon had for the Jews, and he&#39;d crack anti-Jew jokes when Henry Kissinger was sitting right in front of him.  The real symmetry with Israel is between the elected representatives, the security services, corresponding private sector industries (like arms manufacturing) and the U.N. representatives who have shielded Israel with its veto power, which is authorized, ironically, by the President.  </p>

<p>There are many who would prefer to distance themselves from Israel, but I fear the day when they realize we don&#39;t have their back anymore - an Israel out in the window probably turns to Russia in a heartbeat, hence why Netanyahu has seen to it that he and Vladimir Putin meet up and communicate with one another directly.  If people think Israel backed by the U.S. is scary just wait until they see Israel backed by Russia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nixon was a badass! Love it.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s Jewish banksterism the US and Russia have been stuck responding to. Crypto-currency seems like maybe it provides a good escape from Jewish bankster power. Maybe.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see Russia falling for Jewry ever again, but anything is possible.</p>

<p>And I think Christians need to take a look at the Talmud and quit assuming Jews are &quot;nice guys.&quot; It should be obvious that Christianity and Jewry have zero in common nowadays. Leftist rhetoric about all paths leading to the same summit clearly hasn&#39;t taken a look at the Talmud.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Christians don&#39;t even need to pick up the Talmud.  If they&#39;d actually read their Bibles they&#39;d realize that Judaism is the synagogue of Satan.  Knowing the Talmud is just the final nail in the coffin.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For ye, brethen, became followers of the churches of God which in Judea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of <strong>the Jews: Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men</strong>: Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sin alway, for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost. (1 Thessalonians 2:14-16)</p>

<p>Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son. Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: (but) he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also. (1 John 2:22-23)</p>

<p>I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and <strong>I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan</strong>. (Revelation 2:9)</p>

<p><strong>Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie</strong>; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee. (Revelation 3:9)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most Christians have never read and don&#39;t even care about the Bible.  They want to invent their own idea of God.  They have no spiritual discernment.  They go to church for pep talks from a guy in a dress.  Say something like, &quot;God doesn&#39;t love everyone&quot; with Biblical citiations and they go ballistic.  I consider myself Christian but I try to distance myself from the title. I usually just say I believe the Bible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God. (Romans 2:28-29)</p>

<p>Interesting stance. I definitely don&#39;t think the Bible is lying. What&#39;s weird to me is it seems like Jews rejected Jesus - who is of their own race - and the &quot;Gentiles&quot; were the ones that picked up the philosophy, ran with it, and put it to use. &quot;Gentile,&quot; imho, refers more to Pagan-European-Whites than any other demographic.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like Jesus came up with some blueprints to build a specific house, but the people he intended it for rejected it. Like what if Indians &amp; Asians rejected Buddha, but Buddhism was wildly popular throughout white Russia? The race-switch is jarring.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The race switch isn&#39;t really jarring when you&#39;ve read the entire Bible.  Race was never important.  The whole point of the messiah was to bring salvation to all of mankind.  That&#39;s why God says to Abraham that through him <em>all families of the earth</em> would be blessed.  The new testament makes it all plain.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice. (Genesis 22:18)</p>

<p>And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed. (Galatians 3:8)</p>

<p>Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made.  He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ. (Galatians 3:16)</p>

<p>For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.  For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.  There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.  And if ye be Christ&#39;s, then are ye Abraham&#39;s seed, and heirs according to the promise. (Galatians 3:26-29)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even in the old testament being an Israelite or a Jew didn&#39;t have to do with race.  Anyone that would become circumcised and keep the passover could become one.  The point was never their genealogy, it was their willingness to believe and keep God&#39;s law.  The Pharisees invented the idea that they were special because of their lineage. When Jesus came on the scene, the Pharisees were far removed from the teachings of the old testament.  They exalted the traditions of the rabbis which is literally what was written to form the Talmud around 500AD.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying, <em>Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders?</em> for they wash not their hands when they eat bread. But he answered and said unto them, <em>Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?</em> For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death. But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. (Matthew 15:1-9)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Modern Judaism continues the traditions of the Pharisees.  Jesus only ever preached the old testament.  He didn&#39;t show up preaching something different from what they&#39;d been given.  The Jewish &#39;elite&#39; had just supplanted their own traditions in place of the Bible (analogous to the Catholic church and most protestant denominations today).  He basically told them the reason they didn&#39;t believe him was because they didn&#39;t believe Moses.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me. But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words? (John 5:46-47)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re saying it&#39;s the Pharisees that sent Jewry off-the-rails towards crazy racism?</p>

<p>I do think race is at least relevant to the extent that people ought to know what their own proclivities and propensities are. The fact that Jews keep jumping up and down saying they&#39;re of the &quot;Jewish race&quot; and I&#39;m &quot;not,&quot; I&#39;m &quot;white,&quot; I should at least take a look at what it is that is.</p>

<p>Let me put it this way... whatever race you are, if you decide to be Christian you will be Christian in that particular style. The same would be true with any religion. Different flavors of ice cream don&#39;t really negate the fact that they&#39;re all still &quot;ice cream.&quot; And each flavor has a right to have some self-awareness of which flavor they are. That&#39;s my opinion anyway, not something I found in the Bible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not just the Pharisees.  The children of Israel were constantly straying, worshiping other gods, and developing a superiority complex.  Right after God delivers them out of Egypt they had Moses&#39; brother mold them golden calves as gods.  God makes them wander in the wilderness for 40 years because they refuse believe Him and follow the laws even after all the plagues and miracles.  After the nation is established, Israel started worshiping other gods to the point where God splits the nation in two and disowns 10 of the tribes.  The tribes of Judah, Benjamin, and remnants of the others who were still loyal became the southern nation of Judah (this is when people start being called Jews).  Judah fucked it all up after a while too and was delivered into Babylon for 70 years.  Once they came back they do alright for awhile but inevitably stray again.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a consistent pattern throughout the old testament.  People hated God&#39;s law then just like they do now.  Most of the time Israelites/Jews were not doing right by the Lord. They would worship Baal, Molech or other gods of the surrounding nations, fall into sin, and only get back on track when a Godly king would take the throne or when the proverbial shit hit the fan.</p>

<p>Jews today don&#39;t even have complete genealogies going back that far. They don&#39;t know what tribe they&#39;re from.  People were also of all colors in Israel.  Moses&#39; second wife was Ethiopian and Song of Solomon describes him as &#39;white and ruddy&#39; with his lover being &#39;black but comely&#39;.  The idea of a Jewish &#39;race&#39; is pretty dumb in my opinion.  There was constant mixing between nations of other people.</p>

<p>The new testament is pretty plain that lineage doesn&#39;t matter either way.  All nations of the earth are of one blood and we aren&#39;t supposed to give heed to genealogies.  Even if someone was physically descended from Abraham.  Jesus rebukes the Pharisees for thinking so in <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwibwNSU3qXNAhWMWz4KHYB8Aa0QFggcMAA&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.biblegateway.com%2Fpassage%2F%3Fsearch%3DJohn%2B8%253A37-45%26version%3DKJV&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGo2G2skhvyRGsfRO_VIhzeYpSlzQ&amp;amp;sig2=PRtuyuRIsoMZVbcmd2A96w&amp;amp;bvm=bv.124272578,d.cWw">John 8:37-45</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation; (Acts 17:26)</p>

<p>Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do. (1 Timothy 1:4)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Man&#39;s whole duty is to love God and keep the commandments.  After that people can have whatever traditions as long as it doesn&#39;t conflict with God&#39;s law.  Problem is that Christianity today doesn&#39;t just differ on traditions.  Most denominations mess up salvation which is the most basic aspect of Christianity.  That all have sinned and come short.  That man cannot be saved by good works or deeds.  That the only way to receive salvation is by trusting on Christ&#39;s sacrifice and not one&#39;s own righteousness. Most Christians will say a person has to &#39;repent of sin&#39; or do good deeds to get to heaven.  That&#39;s not what the Bible says.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God. (Romans 3:10-11)</p>

<p>For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; (Romans 3:23)</p>

<p>For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. (Ephesians 2:8-9)</p>

<p>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. (John 3:16)</p>

<p>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. (John 5:24)</p>

<p>Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas, And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? And they said, <strong>Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved</strong>, and thy house. (Acts 16:29-31)</p>

<p>I was thinking about something along those lines maybe a week ago. Bear with me, because I&#39;m going to go a bit esoteric. I&#39;ll also describe what I&#39;m going to describe going from general to specific.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, there are two structures to society - &quot;how people get along&quot; - however you want to put it. 1) Order. 2) Chaos. And I was thinking the two most popular extreme manifestations of that are Nazi Germany and Marxist Bolshevism. (I&#39;m not a believer in the holocaust, so we&#39;ll set that aside for my purposes of continuing my point.) But you figure the swastika symbol for example, it was based on &quot;order&quot; and &quot;auspiciousness.&quot; That&#39;s what national socialism (nazism) was intended to be about. All orders tend to gravitate toward a form of some kind of hierarchical structure, a pyramid. There&#39;s really no getting around it, it&#39;s just how it is. But in a peaceable orderly society, the difference is that the people at the bottom are just as <em>fulfilled</em> as the people at the top. It has every thing to do with <strong>fulfillment</strong>, and zero to do with who is at the &quot;top&quot; and who is at the &quot;bottom.&quot;</p>

<p>Enter Marxist thinking... Marxist thinking is very popular with those that believe they are at the &quot;bottom.&quot; It also has to do with people at the &quot;top&quot; who are <em>paranoid</em> that the people at the &quot;bottom&quot; will want revenge against the people at the &quot;top.&quot; Marxism is all about the people at the bottom trying to level the playing field to get a piece of the pie from those at the top. It&#39;s envy and jealousy, to put it plainly. They are envious of what they perceive to be the &quot;fulfillment&quot; the people at the top are enjoying.</p>

<p>Fulfillment is important because what is the opposite of fulfillment? <strong>Hollowness</strong>. Many Westerners feel hollow without even knowing that&#39;s what it is they are feeling. In my opinion, &quot;alexithymia,&quot; the inability to identify and describe emotions in the self - is epidemic. It is a symptom of hollowness. How many people work shit jobs they don&#39;t really care about and aren&#39;t very engaged in? Many. How many people work at shit jobs that feel their management is either currently selling them out or is planning on selling them out? And for all the <em>sacrificing</em> they do for their bosses, they feel that they <em>deserve</em> x, y, &amp; z. Isn&#39;t that interesting that the concept of any job, any nuclear family structure supported by a breadwinner, most breadwinners feel like they are making <em>sacrifices</em> for their family and <em>because</em> they are making these sacrifices that they are <em>owed</em> something. This is very similar to what you&#39;re saying about how people think that &quot;doing good deeds&quot; will get them to heaven.</p>

<p>You could well say that the symbology of Christ&#39;s crucifixion is to show fulfillment is already within your capacity where you are at right now within your station in life. The sacrifice proves that you don&#39;t need to sacrifice yourself, and if you thought you needed to for even a moment, you could just remind yourself of the crucifixion and remember you don&#39;t have to. But what do people do? They forget about that. They hollow themselves out, they sell themselves out, they make deals with Hollywood producers to get <em>more</em>, they sacrifice their principles, they compromise what they believe in, they compare themselves to others, they become envious, they become jealous, and they do it all to <em>get</em> something. And at the end of the day a lot of those people kinda feel <em>bankrupt</em>. Emotionally, spiritually, what-have-you.</p>

<p>That Brother Nathanael guy on YouTube calls Judaism a bankrupt religion. Funny, in a way, that the bankrupt are the ones running the world banks. Also kinda sad.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad I figured that out. I&#39;m kind of in the entertainment business on the side and if I ever got &quot;discovered&quot; and was offered a deal I couldn&#39;t refuse, I know well ahead of time what that&#39;s all about, know where my values are and where I stand. I also divorced myself from feelings of envy and jealousy of people who have &quot;made it&quot; in the entertainment business. Good for them, that&#39;s their path, and my path is totally different. Some of the very nice side-effects from this realization: relief, joy, and longer moments of feeling good when I&#39;m feeling good.</p>

<p>One question though - did I misinterpret the meaning of the crucifixion at all? I think that&#39;s right, and I think that&#39;s what I remember other preachers saying before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not a bad way of looking at it.  The idea of society as a pyramid structure is almost turned completely on its head within the Bible.  In the Bible Jesus is the cornerstone.  The base of the structure.  The foundation.  Those who seek leadership are to make themselves a servant.  The best boss is the one that works harder than anyone else.  A guy that comes in early and leaves the latest.  Someone that takes burden upon himself.  Leading by example rather than kicking back and demanding obedience.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant. And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted. (Matthew 23:11-12)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;ve got it figured on envying others as well.  A good little proverb,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them. (Proverbs 1:32)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People often become envious of a fool&#39;s prosperity but they inevitably end up like some bum that wins the lottery.  Come back in 2 years and they&#39;ve managed to lose all the money they&#39;ve won and somehow come out worse.  The grass is rarely ever as green as we imagine on the other side.  It may be ten or even 50 years from now but everyone that gains prosperity through mischievous methods winds up empty in the end. Good to hear you&#39;ve figured this out as far as the entertainment industry goes.  A lot of people fall down that hole lusting after fame.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped. For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. (Psalm 73:2-3)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the end, nothing in the world will satisfy.  People with fast cars want faster cars, people with fame want more fame (or wish they never had it at all), and people with money want more money.  None of it will fulfill a person. The only thing that will feed the soul is the bread of life. The word of God. The Bible. Jesus Christ. Everything in this world will pass away.  The eternal is all that matters.</p>

<p>Not to disparage the world.  God wants us to live good lives, have a family, work hard, and generally be prosperous.  God rewards and blesses and all that.  The Bible is essentially a guide to how to be a prosperous human.  The Creator&#39;s blueprint for the world.  When you believe the Bible and believe on Jesus Christ, you receive everlasting life. Then you&#39;re left with the freedom to follow God&#39;s law or ignore it after that.</p>

<p>While I don&#39;t think your interpretation of the cross as a symbol is exactly wrong, I&#39;d just want to stress the literalness of what the Bible teaches.  Christ didn&#39;t die on the cross just to teach us something.  Christ died on the cross to fulfill the promise that was made from the foundation of the world.  <strong>Everlasting life</strong>.  That whosoever beliveth will <strong>never perish</strong>.  That one can have eternal life simply by humbling himself, accepting he deserves death for his sin, understanding he could never earn entry to God&#39;s kingdom, and accept the free gift that was paid for by Jesus with his sacrifice.</p>

<p>Christ lived a perfect life so as to be the ultimate offering for our sin.  He took the punishment we all rightfully deserve for the sin we commit in our own lives.  All men that have sinned have condemned themselves to hell.  the Bible says whosoever loveth and maketh <strong>A</strong> lie shall have their part in the lake of fire.  This is called the <em>second death</em>.  There is no escape from this fate save through believing on Jesus Christ.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. (Acts 4:12)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just as side notes, I haven&#39;t heard Brother Nathanael&#39;s teachings on salvation (most important aspect of gauging someone&#39;s faith in my opinion) but he does good work exposing Judaism.  I also don&#39;t ascribe to the official Holocaust story.  David Irving convinced me pretty well that there wasn&#39;t systematic gassing and cremation.  I believe Jewish Freemasonry to be one of the biggest players behind the scenes.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested in a good preacher, I&#39;d suggest Steven Anderson.  Most of his preaching is straight reading from the Bible.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hycjHApNNOM">Once Saved, Always Saved</a> is a good place to start.  Probably the best preacher with the most material out there I&#39;ve found.  He&#39;s got two really good movies on Youtube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=typ2pl2L47k">Marching to Zion</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFtI_mVOXbQ">New World Order Bible Versions</a>.</p>

<p>That guy is the bomb! I&#39;m already subscribed to him on YouTube.</p>

<p>Kinda weird how I got into all this - I just wanted to know about Judaism and it catapulted <em>hard</em> toward Christianity.</p>

<p>Riddle me this about &quot;never perish.&quot; For quite a while I was kind of an atheist/existentialist kind of guy. I figured &quot;this is it.&quot; That didn&#39;t mean I was bent on going nuts - I still lived what I would consider a moral life that I could live with because I like to sleep at night. Even though I was atheist, I kind of harbored the same Christian morality on the inside. My point is that I got to a point that I accepted death will come at the end of my life. (It wasn&#39;t killing me, no pun intended.) If some kind of life-after-death was to happen, I&#39;d deal with it in the event it arrived to my soul/spirit what-have-you. Obviously I hoped I wasn&#39;t going to hell, but it wasn&#39;t keeping me up at night any more than tornadoes, goblins, and meteors strikes do. Plus, worrying about hell didn&#39;t seem like a particularly good way to incentivize myself into living a particular way. I figured if I was going to believe, I wanted it to be more on my terms and I wanted a real attraction. Eg, I don&#39;t want to love somebody because I dislike all my other options, I want to love somebody because I actually love that person <em>for real</em>.</p>

<p>There is technically a thing out there called &quot;Christian Atheism&quot; or &quot;Atheist Christianity&quot; - wherein people kind of run with Jesus&#39;s philosophy but don&#39;t sweat theism, maybe because on some level it seems too far fetched to them. This sort of thing is more popular with Buddhism, in that atheist-based Buddhism is a popular thing.</p>

<p>I get that there&#39;s no hard proof and no science to help me believe if I want to believe - and the &quot;epistemology&quot; is kind of personalized from person to person - so I don&#39;t really sweat that.</p>

<p>So my question is more of a personal question for you, because I presume you <em>believe</em>. Does believing make you feel more emotional, and if so do the emotions ever bother you? Also, were there certain relationships and areas in your life that you felt like you had to go back and correct, or did you keep moving forward?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, that&#39;s awesome!  Pretty rare I find someone that&#39;s ever heard of him around here.</p>

<p>Honestly I was the same as you.  I grew up being taken to a Lutheran church and hated it. Pretty hard-line atheist from mid-teens until I was about 23. I really wasn&#39;t bothered by the idea of death and hell but I&#39;d been moving towards New Age spirituality.  Weirdly, New Age catapulted me into Christianity.  I was kind of annoyed by how many different belief systems always mentioned Jesus.  It was always &quot;Jesus was an avatar of the great spirit&quot; or &quot;Jesus was enlightened with secret knowledge&quot; or &quot;Jesus learned black magic in Egypt&quot; and I finally decided I needed to read the New Testament myself.  I remembered a clip on TV where Obama mocked the Bible and called the Sermon on the Mount &quot;radical&quot; so I read Matthew 5-7.  It was radically different than all the other stuff I&#39;d read before.  I took comparative religions classes and had looked at Buddhism and a lot of other Eastern religions and I felt like they didn&#39;t even compare.  So I started digging.</p>

<p>Eventually that sermon I posted a link to finally got me to understand and I <em>believed</em>.  Not really because I was scared of hell but &quot;everlasting life&quot; seemed like a good deal so I played with the idea and it kept resonating louder in me.  Didn&#39;t really make me more emotional.  Didn&#39;t change my relationships too much.  I&#39;m just an average 25 year old dude. Decent job, crappy car, no debt (that&#39;s not average), but it&#39;s not like I had some great weight to get off my shoulders.  I just went searching for the truth.  Went from aliens to conspiracy pages to New Age to the Bible.  My family thinks it&#39;s weird even though my mom and sister still go to church.  I&#39;ve talked to some of them about salvation but they were never interested in hearing.  I&#39;m vocal about my values but I haven&#39;t really come out to my friends as &quot;Christian&quot;. I generally only tell people if they ask.  Been about a year since I began identifying as such.</p>

<p>The only thing to really change was my world view.  I was pretty liberal and suddenly I was shifting more towards conservative.  Liberty is a core value in the Bible.  Puts me at odds with most of my family and friends but oh well.  They believe the official version of 9-11 too so it&#39;s not like we had much to talk about before.  It&#39;s just one more &quot;crazy&quot; belief.</p>

<p>Honestly, I don&#39;t think you can read the new testament and come away with the idea that Jesus had a &quot;philosophy&quot; that could be considered separate from theism.  At the same time, I don&#39;t think theism is this hold your hands up to the sky crying kind of junk.  I still don&#39;t go to church because I can&#39;t find a halfway decent one near me.  I&#39;ve started to slow down since I&#39;ve taken in the primary information.  I&#39;ve been in this for a year so I&#39;ve read through the Bible and watched enough sermons (both good and bad) that I feel grounded.  Gone from 3-4 sermons a day to 1 and I&#39;m taking my second read-through slower.  I know it&#39;s taboo around here but I&#39;ve shifted my time more towards looking at flat earth theory. Even Steven Anderson thinks that one&#39;s crazy lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The main thing about Steven Anderson that bothers me is his sense of &quot;schadenfreude.&quot; If it wasn&#39;t for that, he&#39;d probably have more listeners. Plus for myself personally I don&#39;t like feeling schadenfreude or having it being any kind of motivator.</p>

<p>Back to the race issue... In some ways I think that Christianity and Judaism both share a sense of one-world-religion, but they have very different &quot;styles,&quot; for lack of a better term. Jewry is so far to the left that it despises all races (with the exception of whatever the &quot;Jewish race&quot; is) and wishes to see every race homogenized into one race. So Jewry is like a left wing free-for-all. You could say for example, that a mixed race child that is half black and half white is softer and more docile than a child that is pure black. So the Jewish idea is to mix blacks with whites to both dumb down the whites and soften the blacks. And eventually you get some kind of mono-race.</p>

<p>But with Christianity, it seems a little more clubby. You&#39;re either a guy smart enough to know how to live peaceably in this world or you&#39;re not. It is possible that if your IQ is low enough, you just won&#39;t make the cut. Prior to Christianity getting to where it is today, it did its own share of NWO organizing with events like the crusades and the inquisition. In a way, you could say Christianity united European whites, at least enough for each country to reasonably get along with each other and do business with each other.</p>

<p>With Christianity, the idea is that as long as everybody believes in this <em>one thing</em>, people will get along great. But the key is it is a specific thing you have to believe. It&#39;s written down, and easy to read. It was very much like Eddie Izzard&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZVjKlBCvhg">&quot;Cake or Death&quot;</a> routine. Whereas modern atheistic/secular Jewry has a very romantic BLUE PILL idea that somehow, genetically, we all want the same thing out of life - we&#39;re all going the same place - and &quot;all paths lead to the same summit&quot; because that&#39;s what&#39;s in our DNA. And if that isn&#39;t currently the case right now, with enough race mixing that will eventually be the case. And the theory is you don&#39;t even have to present the option of &quot;Cake or Death,&quot; their theory is that everybody is going to want cake. Which, I hate to say it, but the red pill facts really do indicate that some people really <em>will</em> choose death over cake.</p>

<p>People talk about a race war between the whites and the Jews, and I really think the war is mostly acted out on a psychological stage these days. &quot;Psy ops,&quot; as it is called. But it is to the point where I think whites can only say they prefer cake over death in a whisper voice behind closed doors. And to the Jew, it doesn&#39;t matter if the white person thinks their cake is Christianity, Neo-Paganism, in-group white preference, or any kind of racial preference that doesn&#39;t include &quot;Jew.&quot; Once the Jew hears a white person saying they want &quot;cake&quot; the Jew will scream &quot;RACIST!&quot; at the top of his lungs. Reading between the lines, it means the Jew is rejected because he&#39;s been identified as <em>psychologically driven</em> to reject a set of <em>objective</em> values. And perhaps that&#39;s it. Maybe the Jewish race simply has absolute moral relativism coded into their DNA. If you think of how bizarre and sadistic some of their practices were before being outlawed by normal societies; those practices could only have been birthed via genetic moral relativism.</p>

<p>And if you think in terms of &quot;naming the demon&quot; in order to control the demon, the typical Jew absolutely hates to be called out for being Jewish. If you say &quot;the Jews run the banks,&quot; they hate it. If you say &quot;the Jews own Hollywood,&quot; they hate it. If you say &quot;the Jews own the media,&quot; they hate it.</p>

<p>So racially, I guess I don&#39;t worry about genealogies but I do know the difference between cake and death.</p>

<p>That was the Catholics and Jesuits.  Neither are Christian.  Neither observe the Bible.  The Roman Catholic church was Rome&#39;s attempt to stifle Christianity by mixing it with their established paganism and burning every Bible believing Christian that didn&#39;t go along with it.  If you watch New World Order Bible Versions you&#39;ll get a bit of Catholic history with them murdering anyone that attempted to translate the Bible so that it could be read.  They developed their own Latin Vulgate that made a multitude of changes from the original Greek.  Again, ask a Catholic how to get to heaven and they&#39;ll tell you to get baptized, go to mass, confess your sins to a guy they call &quot;father&quot; that wears a dress, and do good works.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren. And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven. Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ. But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant. (Matthew 23:8-11)</p>

<p>And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces, (Mark 12:38)</p>

<p>Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts; (Luke 20:46)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is what I mean by most denominations of Christianity being total bunk.  ESPECIALLY CATHOLICISM.  The second commandment is not to make any graven image and yet they decorate their dens with statues of men.  They give reverence to saints and a &quot;pope&quot; rather than to God.  They call Mary &quot;queen of heaven&quot; and &quot;mediatrix&quot; but the Bible says there is ONE mediator between man and God, the man Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>The Bible doesn&#39;t really teach that if you believe everything will be hunky dory.  Christians still sin.  They still do everything bad that a normal person does.  The main point is that you won&#39;t receive eternal damnation and you&#39;re aware of what the truth is.  Plenty of examples in the Bible of believers that screwed up and did terrible things.  King Saul started off a great guy and by the end of his life he was ordering priests of the Lord to be slaughtered in droves and consulting witches.  Still went to heaven but far from a perfect guy.</p>

<p>You&#39;re all caught up on this race thing but <em>there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek</em>.  They don&#39;t have some defect encoded in their DNA.  Most Jews today are Khazars anyway.  They&#39;re just taught moral relativism from childhood and that they&#39;re better than all the &quot;goyim&quot; that think otherwise.  The problem is their religion and ideology.  Doesn&#39;t have to do with DNA.  &quot;Racial Jews&quot; can repent of their satanic religion and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ like any other person.  The problem is their conditioning makes it especially hard for them to come to the truth.  Most have a superiority complex towards the &quot;goyim&quot; and believe that they&#39;re already going to heaven because they were &quot;born right&quot;.  Playing into the race game is just stooping to their level.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Steven Anderson is really schadenfreude.  Mostly just blunt.  Reminds me of Proverbs 1.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you. Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof: I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me: For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD: They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof. (Proverbs 1:22-30)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Finding out about Khazars now. Maybe that&#39;s what it is I want to avoid. I think it&#39;s pretty easy to avoid though. Ew. There&#39;s claims on youtube videos where it says they called themselves &quot;serpent people&quot; - wondering what the source is for that.</p>

<p>I think one of the things I know about sin, when I got into criminal mischief as a kid, I always knew and accepted that if I chose to do something bad, that it was bad, and I didn&#39;t try and rationalize it as good. A lot of the hippies that wanted to do mischievous stuff in college with me, they kinda pissed me off by rationalizing the shit we were doing as good and acceptable. I was like, &quot;Not only is it BAD, if you think it&#39;s good, you&#39;re going to get us caught!&quot; Eventually, I quit doing as much mischievous stuff.</p>

<p>I think the stuff Steven Anderson said recently on YouTube about how it was &quot;good&quot; that all those gay people died in Orlando - - that wasn&#39;t really cool. For me, that just lacked a baseline respect for life. Those people had family and friends and whatnot, just like everybody else does. So the whole schadenfreude there kinda creeped me out.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say I&#39;m throwing out the baby with the bath though. Steven Anderson has done some amazing work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, Anderson&#39;s pretty hard on sodomites.  From a Biblical perspective, they are committing a sin worthy of death.  I wouldn&#39;t call it &quot;good&quot; but God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.  I haven&#39;t watched anything of his recently but I remember he didn&#39;t pull punches after the Paris attacks either.  I&#39;m still on the fence as to whether the Orlando shooting was even real though.  Lots of signs of it being a hoax.  Not a single ambulance in any footage unless you count the police&#39;s fucking flat bed pick-up truck.  There are a few that <em>look</em> like ambulances but they&#39;re &quot;fire rescue&quot; vehicles.  Too unreal.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I had a similar mindset as well.  I was pretty liberal so I tolerated and accepted all kinds of deviant behavior but I hated when people would revel in it.  Like, I would drink but could never understand the mindset of people that gloried in getting blackout drunk.  Or people that thought they were amazingly special for being gay.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t looked too much into the Khazar business myself.  You can probably tell that I don&#39;t put weight on race or lineage lol.  I just think it points out how foolish the idea of Jewish racial supremacy is when most of them never even came close to having a descendant that lived in Judea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Googling lead to Wikipedia and several pages later I find this:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda#Alleged_CIA_involvement">According to Bergen, known for conducting the first television interview with bin Laden in 1997, the idea that &quot;the CIA funded bin Laden or trained bin Laden... [is] a folk myth. There&#39;s no evidence of this... Bin Laden had his own money, he was anti-American and he was operating secretly and independently... The real story here is the CIA didn&#39;t really have a clue about who this guy was until 1996 when they set up a unit to really start tracking him.&quot;[328]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Bergen may want to reexamine the open historical record again before he says &#39;1996&#39; as the start date of C.I.A. &#39;knowledge&#39; of Osama bin Laden.  According to C.I.A. operatives and agents, OBL was being surveilled in Sudan in 1991.  He and his henchmen became a problem and the C.I.A. left Sudan.  A whole lot of OBL stuff happened prior to 1996.  He was mentioned in the Western mainstream media several times in the early 90&#39;s - his stance on Iraq, U.S. presence in Saudi Arabia and overall disagreement with Saudi royalty, which resulted in his expulsion from his birth country.  He also issued an anti-U.S. &amp; Israel fatwa in 1992.  Yeah...Mr. Bergen&#39;s quip ought to be removed from the article or, better yet, highlighted as wrong.</p>
