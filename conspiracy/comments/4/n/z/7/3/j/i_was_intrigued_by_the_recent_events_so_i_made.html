        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>WHAT HAPPENED? </p>

<ul>
<li>Hillary named nominee  by media before she even competed against bernie</li>
<li>Reddit going crazy and people suspecting bias</li>
<li>Media going crazy </li>
<li>hillary is being scandalous (More than usual)</li>
<li>Orlando shooting</li>
<li>Wikileaks claims evidence against Hillary</li>
<li>Planned attack at gay parade!</li>
</ul>

<p>THEORY:</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton and administrators knew about or staged the Orlando attacks and related incidents to cover up election scandals. Media might be cooperating. </p>

<p>THERE ARE SO MANY CONSPIRACIES HERE</p>

<p>OTHER LA PRIDE PLANNED ATTACK!</p>

<p>[Exhibit A] - Media Bias</p>

<p>The Media wants to catch attention from viewers. It wants to distract them! One of the ways it is doing that is by calling the Orlando shooting the biggest in history. THIS IS A LIE. Here are 4 examples of shootings far worse:</p>

<p>East St. Louis Massacre - 200+ deaths
Arkansas Massacre - 854 deaths 
Tulsa Massacre - 176 deaths
Rosewood massacre - 150 deaths</p>

<p>This is misinformation in an effort for the media to distract the viewers.</p>

<p>[Exhibit B] </p>

<p>The timing! Just as Hillary and Bernie and battling it out this comes up! This happened a few days after Hillary was getting in trouble for cheating and manipulating the media.</p>

<p>[Exhibit C] </p>

<p>A CNN article incuded the name of a witness (<a href="http://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2016/06/12/orlando-nightclub-shooting-witness-tapper-intv.cnn/video/playlists/orlando-nightclub-shooting/">http://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2016/06/12/orlando-nightclub-shooting-witness-tapper-intv.cnn/video/playlists/orlando-nightclub-shooting/</a>) That witness is an actor! </p>

<p><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ck2BvbvXEAEklrZ.jpg:large">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ck2BvbvXEAEklrZ.jpg:large</a></p>

<p>[Exhibit D] </p>

<p>The cops are having trouble identifying victims. YOU’VE TO HAVE AN ID CARD TO GET INTO A NIGHTCLUB!</p>

<p>[Exhibit E] </p>

<p>Not only is WikiLeaks going to release documents that will uncover some information about Hillary. It has been shown that Google has helped Hillary in their ads. It has already been seen that Google has  manipulated ads toward the left side. That was evidence leading up to this giant media stunt!</p>

<p><a href="http://bipartisanreport.com/2016/06/13/breaking-wikileaks-founder-promises-hillary-clinton-arrest-and-indictment-after-next-leak/">http://bipartisanreport.com/2016/06/13/breaking-wikileaks-founder-promises-hillary-clinton-arrest-and-indictment-after-next-leak/</a></p>

<p>They think that they can arrest Hillary with the evidence given!
[Exhibit F]</p>

<p>People were seen blocking the doors of the night club. This can be seen in videos of the shooting such as this one: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=b0b_1465770774">http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=b0b_1465770774</a></p>

<p>There are a lot of people claiming that people were blocking the doors and helping from the outside. CNN said one of the possible door blockers was the actor in Exhibit A!</p>

<p>[Exhibit G] </p>

<p>Huffington post is giving a $25k award for evidence that the Orlando shooting was a false flag. This is significant but not sure where to place it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2016/06/58403.html">http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2016/06/58403.html</a></p>

<p>[Exhibit H] </p>

<p>Two images of the shooter wearing a NYPD shirt in selfies:</p>

<p>Claims there were 2 shooters</p>

<p>[Exhibit K]</p>

<p>The media covered the idea of 2 gunman and barricaded doors and stuck to the mainstream plan of one gunman.</p>

<p>You can’t talk about the NSA on the tech subreddit it will limit it? </p>

<p>Recent attacks: can’t mention the key words:  “orlando + hillary” </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s safer (and more accurate) to say these things are &#39;establishment&#39; biased rather than attributing it to basement-level partisan nonsense, which is really only something to keep citizens squabbling amongst themselves and to keep them divided.</p>
