    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s actually kind of brilliant if you think about it. They clearly have an agenda that involves them not wanting people to talk about the shooter being Muslim. Now, by showing blatant censorship they&#39;ve succeed. No one is talking about the shooter anymore. They&#39;re all talking about the censorship. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>what indication is there that there was an islamic shooter, other than what the FBI is speculating?  </p>

<p>is there any reason to believe so?  did they find islamic jihad training manuals in his car?    did he brag to neighbors about his terrorist connections and make a big deal of it? LOL.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just checked the live feed and this was the latest post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>U.S. Senator Nelson tells reporters that he has heard that there is &quot;some connection to ISIS&quot; in relation to the shooting
He says this information is from Intelligence Committee staff</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Specifically, they have identified the shooter and his father has been speaking to the media and said that it wasn&#39;t &quot;motivated by religion, but he believes his son was motivated to do the shooting after seeing two men kissing a few months ago&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all a pretty big fucked up jumble so I&#39;m taking everything with a grain of salt, but multiple reports are saying that the FBI was already monitoring him as an &quot;ISIS sympathizer&quot;, though they had no indication that he was planning an attack. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To play devil&#39;s advocate, if he wasn&#39;t communicating with anyone about planning the attack then there wasn&#39;t really much of a way for them to catch him. I also read that he was apparently a security guard and had a licence(or permit? I&#39;m not American) to get access to the assault rifle that he used during the shooting. Again, grains of salt until all the details get formally released to the press, but it&#39;s already being called the worst shooting massacre in American history so there&#39;s probably going to be quite a bit of backlash to come from this. </p>
