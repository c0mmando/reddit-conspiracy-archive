    <div class="md"><p>This is from a conservative org. </p>

<p>&quot;...But the New Deal does provide evidence of that passion. President Franklin Roosevelt did, at some junctures, defend his tax reforms as a means to slow the concentration of wealth, especially in large estates. &quot;Such inherited economic power is as inconsistent with the ideals of this generation as inherited political power was inconsistent with the ideals of the generation which established our Government,&quot; he told Congress in 1935.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Moreover, Roosevelt insisted that wealth was socially constructed. &quot;Wealth in the modern world does not come merely from individual effort,&quot; he said. &quot;It results from a combination of individual effort and of the manifold uses to which the community puts that effort.&quot; He quoted every progressive&#39;s favorite robber baron to make his point. &quot;As Andrew Carnegie put it,&quot; Roosevelt intoned, &quot;&#39;Where wealth accrues honorably, the people are always silent partners.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>In Roosevelt&#39;s view, the social nature of wealth gave government a vital interest in taxing large incomes and hereditary fortunes. In fact, progressive taxes were a social necessity, not just a political or economic convenience. &quot;Social unrest and a deepening sense of unfairness are dangers to our national life which we must minimize by rigorous methods,&quot; he said. &quot;People know that vast personal incomes come not only through the effort or ability or luck of those who receive them, but also because of the opportunities for advantage which Government itself contributes. Therefore, the duty rests upon the Government to restrict such incomes by very high taxes.&quot;</p>

<p>Roosevelt&#39;s rhetoric aligns neatly with Piketty&#39;s analysis of U.S. fiscal history. But Roosevelt&#39;s 1935 tax talk was something of an aberration. Few U.S. political leaders at any level -- and even fewer presidents -- have ever articulated such broad redistributive claims for tax policy...&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the height of ignorance. FDR gave a reason for a government takeover. If you have a small government that more or less stays out of people&#39;s business the very rich don&#39;t bother with politics.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t deny that this may have been the reason he did but it had the opposite effect. He played a major role in creating todays oligarchy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know, it always shocks me how low the body count in the average shootings are.</p>

<p>I think with a bit of training something like this could easily be accomplished. </p>

<p>Just consider a night club.  It&#39;s packed full of people, shoulder to shoulder.  Gunman enters, shoulders his weapon and begins firing.   At a rapid rate on a semi-automatic weapon, with 30 round magazines you can  do a lot of damage to a large body of people.</p>

<p>If he&#39;s practiced his reloads he can have a new magazine in within 4-5 seconds. </p>

<p>Just a thought.</p>

<p>An AR15 can fire 180 rounds per minute in ideal conditions. All of the people in the nightclub were together.</p>

<p>Clearly the AR can shoot fast. </p>

<p>To boot, many of the rounds may have pierced bodies and gone into other people. As long as he had 1-3 magazines and everyone was crowded together....</p>

<p>It&#39;s plausible.</p>

<p>he also had a sidearm.</p>

<p>Not that there isnt anyone else involved, but it doesnt fit the narrative to have a muslim do this. It would be more effective to blame it on a white hickish Trump supporter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes i agree but im also seeing alot of disinformation about some right winged groups particularly in germany.</p>

<p>I read an article that covered one of these groups protesting i think in Dresden actually, and the author of the article literally kept refering to this group as neonazi group. They did this so intently my friend who originally read it to me actually thought the group called themselves neonazis.</p>

<p>This right winged group were not neonazis, they were german nationalists (i know i know Nazis were german nationalists) that had banners talking about cravking down on immigration and how they want a german future for germany. Nothing racist or xenophobic at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honest question, because I find it very hard to understand the way people think in this subreddit. If all of these tragedies are supposedly complicated government conspiracies, how come there always seem to be such sloppy, hasty reporting regarding the events, and why do you all feel that this proves that it&#39;s a false flag? Wouldn&#39;t such an elaborate cover up that almost everyone buys into not be a lot better organized? Doesn&#39;t it make perfect sense that when there&#39;s a tragedy that&#39;s being reported on by literally every news station in the world, that there would be conflicting reports since every news station is trying to be the first to report it? </p>

<p>How does sloppy news reporting automatically equal conspiracy? It points to the exact opposite.</p>

That&#39;s like saying mcdonald&#39;s is selling dollar hamburgers because they want to share and help poor people. No. They use garbage ingredients for a reason. In their case, its to make money. In this case, its to incite confusion/anger/arguments, which then indirectly generates more income for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mean magazine, not clip.<br/>
30-40 round magazines are pretty common for AR builds.  AKs too.  30 round avg. Was it 5.56/223 caliber rifle or higher?  The shooter could have gotten more than a few two-for-ones in that environment with everyone so closely packed together. The bullet penetrates both sides of one body and then enters another.  This is especially true if it was any higher of a caliber than the 5.56 Nato round; and still plausible regardless. 
This will almost certainly be used to help push the prohibition narrative against extended magazines forward.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a nightclub, at close range, it&#39;s not a question if that many people got hurt/killed.  Bullets pass through people, and pass through just about anything you&#39;ll find in a nightclub.  Everyone was running away from him I&#39;m sure you can imagine, these numbers are not unbelievable. The second gunman/doorman is the real question. </p>

<p>It seems a lot of people have never used a firearm in these Reddit posts, and that is fine, but don&#39;t jump to conclusions that it&#39;s impossible.  Speed reloads can be practiced very easily without ever going to a range. </p>

<p>I read an article that covered one of these groups protesting i think in Dresden actually, and the author of the article literally kept refering to this group as neonazi group. They did this so intently my friend who originally read it to me actually thought the group called themselves neonazis.</p>

<p>This right winged group were not neonazis, they were german nationalists (i know i know Nazis were german nationalists) that had banners talking about cravking down on immigration and how they want a german future for germany. Nothing racist or xenophobic at all.</p>
