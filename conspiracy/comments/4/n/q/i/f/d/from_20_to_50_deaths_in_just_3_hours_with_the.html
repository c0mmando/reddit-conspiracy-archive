    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t seen video, but FYI, many high end phones take shitty video in poor/low light. OIS helps a lot with this, but not all phones have it. Even the $700 iPhone 6S doesn&#39;t have it. The 6S Plus on the other hand does. HTC phones tend to do well in most lighting conditions, but not many people have those. I&#39;m not sure about Galaxy phones tbh, but I&#39;d imagine they&#39;d at least be decent. I had a Sony Z3 which has a 20mp camera and 4K recording, but it was dog shit in low/poor lit areas.</p>

<p>Tl;dr Most phone cameras suck in the dark.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, not every business has surveillance systems. Not sure where you get that from. Many cameras you see in small shops are fake. They are put there to make you think there are cameras when there really aren&#39;t. Even in department stores have many fake cameras. Only a portion of what you see are real.</p>

<p>As far as this club goes, I would imagine a warrant would have to be obtained since the footage is the property of the club owner. Not to mention the whole place is a massive crime scene that needs to be kept in tact for the duration.</p>

<p>Yes, lots of people will want to arm themselves, but with a population of millions, the other half think differently. Instead of thinking logically (arm myself) they think emotionally (won&#39;t someone think of the children?!). </p>

<p>This administration will use this alleged shooting for a gun control push. <strong>Later today when King Obama hits the podium you watch him stand on the unseen bodies and advocate gun control.</strong> I wager the family farm on it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course they will make political hay of this but if this was a manufactured event for the purpose of pushing gun control the easiest way to push that idea would be by having a white lunatic shoot up a building with firearms he legally purchased using a loophole.  When it&#39;s an act of terror there is a counter-argument.  If it was done by a white guy as a hate crime using guns that he bought legally but wouldn&#39;t have been able to buy if there was stricter gun laws then you can easily make the case for gun control and the other side can&#39;t point to terrorism as a way of explaining how no laws could have stopped it.  Obama is trying to pretend that Islamic terrorism isn&#39;t even real so why the hell would he use Islamic terrorism to push gun control?  That would make no sense at all.  He will divert attention from the terror angle by talking about guns but if this was a manufactured event the Islamic terrorism angle wouldn&#39;t have been included in the first place.      </p>

<p>I can see your point, but having an Islamic shooter also serves the purpose of further dividing the public. The anti gun crowd will blame guns regardless of the shooter&#39;s color or religion, and the other side with blame Islam. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The number jumped from 20 dead to 50 dead because they were afraid of possible explosives being in the building so they wanted to sweep the building with a robot before entering to get an actual body count.  The 20 dead was an estimate from what cops could see without taking a count.  They saw what they thought as at least 20 bodies.  After they cleared the building and were able to get inside and physically count the dead the number rose to 50.  </p>

<p>I was watching the press conference where they announced the number was upped to 50.  That is information that some members of the press were given prior to the press conference.  This is how news works.  Not everything is a government conspiracy.  Hop on a plane and fly down to Orlando and see for yourself.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like going to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> whenever anything like this happens to see what ridiculous made up shit you all come up with, so sue me. I wouldn&#39;t call myself insecure, just genuinely curious as to how there are people who truly believe all of this ridiculous stuff; if you really looked through my comment history you would know it&#39;s not exactly a subject I obsess over. I DO really like football though, thanks for noticing.</p>
