<p>Why take injured bleeding people back all the way down infront of the club?  Pretty sure they could have had ambulances waiting to receive people on either side of the blockade.  This was a show for the MSM.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in Orlando and had a WTF moment when watching that video you posted because I agree with why you posted it.</p>

<p>That said, I&#39;ll play devils advocate on this.  </p>

<p>I KNOW people who were there.  Some of them, scared for their lives, ran / limped / were carried by friends and strangers AWAY in ANY direction from the area. </p>

<p>The video was shot SOUTH of PULSE.  The hospital is NORTH of PULSE.  This means that to get to the hospital, you have to pass by PULSE heading NORTH.  </p>

<p>Am I suggesting that this wasn&#39;t a planned / staged event?  No.  But I know that these people wouldn&#39;t have signed up for this if they knew what was coming.  </p>

<p><strong>Side note:</strong>  They didn&#39;t have enough ambulances for this.  They called other agencies 10 miles away to assist.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>This doesn&#39;t really make sense either.  If they were truly shot/bleeding, why make them walk all the way down the other side of the blockade?  At one point, they bring a truck in to put someone in.  Why not do that with everyone on that side?</p>

<p>It just looks like they were all told to walk past were the cameras were.  Which doesn&#39;t really make any sense from a triage standpoint.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>in the videos you will see a police officer in a truck pulling up and getting them and then taking them back down by the club. they probably had the ambulances stopped and told them to stay back and take cover while the shooting was taking place. once the shooting stopped the people that had escaped were told to come back to where the ambulances were blocked off. in a crime scene they usually leave an opening for things like that but when its a shootout they try and block off as much as possible even using ambulances as cover</p>

    <div class="md"><p>if you were escaping a club would you run around the front of it where cops are returning fire? and im sure some of the people that ran that way that didnt get injured thought &quot;we should help our fellow man and get them to the ambulance&quot; for all we know there were police in the area of where they were coming out of directing them to go a certain way. there is so many ways it makes sense</p>
