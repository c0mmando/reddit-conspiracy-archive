       Then he said to them, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'Each man strap a sword to his side. Go back and forth through the camp from one end to the other, each killing his brother and friend and neighbor.' "The Levites did as Moses commanded, and that day about three thousand of the people died.

       Yeah same God as Muslims too
 So you literally just posted a quote that refuted your entire argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or we can look at it from a logical stand point and say Jews are old testament Christians are new testament and Muslims are the quran.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know of any verses from the old or new testament that allow lying if it means spreading the religion? Does the origin story of Jesus involve him fucking any pre pubescent girls?

       Yes it does refute your argument. You tried to liken certain bible versus with the Quran allowing killing of infidels.  You then said they had the same god.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if the bible versus that you quoted show their god allows for the killing of the infidels (they dont) and they have the same God. then Muslims are free to kill infidels which seems to be what you're trying to disprove.

       Kek. Yes so religion is used to rule people so what?  Islam was used to oust the other rulers who weren't teaching their pawns that raping prebuscent girls and killing people who think differently gets you 72 virgins. Doesn't mean we can't shit on muslims

       Joshua 8:24-26

      <p>
       When the Israelite army finished chasing and killing all the men of Ai in the open fields, they went back and finished off everyone inside. So the entire population of Ai, including men and women, was wiped out that day—12,000 in all. For Joshua kept holding out his spear until everyone who had lived in Ai was completely destroyed.

      <p>
       “To me” is meaningless unless I follow the factual definition. All you have as an “argument” is misrepresentation of what has been said. Either this is because you don’t comprehend what has been said or because you know that you’re wrong and can’t win otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read the Bible. See what it says a Christian is. Then compare its listing against groups that call themselves Christian and see if it matches up. If it doesn’t, they’re not actually Christian. No fallacies, no retardation. That’s just literally how a
       <em>
        definition

       works.

       The original argument, is that the Abrahaminic religions have the same God, which is debatable. It certainly seems to be the same jealous asshole that setup mankind in the 'Garden' just to watch us fail an impossible task.

       That discussion led to other users providing proof of the demand to kill certain peoples, in the Old Testament, something you say only occurs in Islam, in the Quran (which is funny, considering how you act about the Torah.) They showed that indeed, similar statements are available in the Bible, so you claimed that those verses are somehow magically outside the scope of what a Christian is, and therefore irrelevant.

       I know many Catholics who are Christian. I know many Catholics that aren't. But you would rather label an entire group, and ignore the true complexity of your definition of Christianity.

       Oh, but you do. I know I'll have to draw the lines for you. You see, by reusing the exact same strawman, for the nth time, you make it too easy, too apparent, that it is a strawman. You set yourself up as the sole authority on what it means to be Christian. So it's pointless to argue against that self-reinforcing delusion. Instead, you are dismissed for your inability to present an actual argument.

       Find some aspect of the Christian tradition that can't be traced to an older source. Virgin birth, star denoting that birth, wiseman from the east, descended from the line of David, born in the Bread House (Milhouse?) son of god, both divine and man, etc.

       Christianity is a culmination of Paganism, with roots in Judaism. In the same way, Islam is a branch of Christianity that doesn't believe in Christ's divinity (Something they agree on with Judaism.) that has been bastardized by every imam since inception. It's all a shit show. Religion should be avoided.

       Ad homs are the insects inside your fingernails that make that white shit in your nails. That's accurate because 'ad homs' aren't a thing, so I can just make up a definition for them. Ad hominem comments, however, are something you deal in readily.

       That's just patently false. You can't help but have interpretation. Hell, the protestant reformation was (also) about the common man's ability to interpret scripture for themselves (Helps when it's not in Latin.) You interpret the interface you use to reply on reddit, constantly, as you use it.

      <p>
       That's right. The testament that didn't even exist as a codified set of books... that is what founded Christianity. Many of those books were not even in existence at that time, but somehow, they were able to become the founding documents of Christianity. I never knew the Bible also traveled backwards through time. That would explain how some of its followers behave.
