    <div class="md"><p>Yeah same God as Muslims too
 So you literally just posted a quote that refuted your entire argument.</p>

<p>Or we can look at it from a logical stand point and say Jews are old testament Christians are new testament and Muslims are the quran.</p>

<p>Do you know of any verses from the old or new testament that allow lying if it means spreading the religion? Does the origin story of Jesus involve him fucking any pre pubescent girls?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it does refute your argument. You tried to liken certain bible versus with the Quran allowing killing of infidels.  You then said they had the same god. </p>

<p>So if the bible versus that you quoted show their god allows for the killing of the infidels (they dont) and they have the same God. then Muslims are free to kill infidels which seems to be what you&#39;re trying to disprove.</p>

<p>“To me” is meaningless unless I follow the factual definition. All you have as an “argument” is misrepresentation of what has been said. Either this is because you don’t comprehend what has been said or because you know that you’re wrong and can’t win otherwise.</p>

<p>Read the Bible. See what it says a Christian is. Then compare its listing against groups that call themselves Christian and see if it matches up. If it doesn’t, they’re not actually Christian. No fallacies, no retardation. That’s just literally how a <em>definition</em> works.</p>

<p>Followed by a reply... so I can safely assume I&#39;m still not misrepresenting the facts.</p>

<p>“To me” is meaningless unless I follow the factual definition.</p>

<p>Which would be?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All you have as an “argument” is misrepresentation of what has been said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, quoting comments always leads to misrepresentation. But I haven&#39;t misrepresented anything, as you have shown.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Read the Bible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>About 2 decades ahead of you, there. A Christian is simply a person that drinks the spiritual Kool-aid and lets &#39;Messiah&#39; penetrate their heart and mind, for unverifiable salvation. Just like any snake-oil salesman&#39;s mark would do.</p>

<p>The original argument, is that the Abrahaminic religions have the same God, which is debatable. It certainly seems to be the same jealous asshole that setup mankind in the &#39;Garden&#39; just to watch us fail an impossible task.</p>

<p>That discussion led to other users providing proof of the demand to kill certain peoples, in the Old Testament, something you say only occurs in Islam, in the Quran (which is funny, considering how you act about the Torah.) They showed that indeed, similar statements are available in the Bible, so you claimed that those verses are somehow magically outside the scope of what a Christian is, and therefore irrelevant.</p>

<p>The issue was that you were using the &#39;No True Scotsman&#39; fallacy to cover your ass when you were caught misrepresenting the facts.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I know many Catholics who are Christian. I know many Catholics that aren&#39;t. But you would rather label an entire group, and ignore the true complexity of your definition of Christianity.</p>

<p>No, I said that Islam calls its tenants to slaughter <em>all</em> non-believers.</p>

<p>Nope. Definitionally outside the scope of what a Christian is, by virtue of the old covenant being annulled by Jesus.</p>

<p>Tell them that. They go to Catholic church for mass. They have a Catholic catechism. They confess to a Catholic priest, but they don&#39;t believe that the Pope is intercessor between Jesus and that individual. </p>

<p>Any group is made up of unique configurations that don&#39;t align with the entire group. That&#39;s why I try to state that making those broad, general statements, is usually an exercise in embarrassing yourself.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You’ve learned nothing. You are worthless.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve learned much, but I&#39;ve known for a long time to not value the opinions of strangers. What fruit of the spirit compels you to tell another of God&#39;s children &quot;You are worthless.&quot;</p>

<p>I would surmise that you don&#39;t have a working definition of Christianity because you don&#39;t know what it means anymore. Instead you lash to an ideal monolith and cast your evil spells of hate and ignorance on any who can hear.</p>

<p>Find some aspect of the Christian tradition that can&#39;t be traced to an older source. Virgin birth, star denoting that birth, wiseman from the east, descended from the line of David, born in the Bread House (Milhouse?) son of god, both divine and man, etc.</p>

<p>Christianity is a culmination of Paganism, with roots in Judaism. In the same way, Islam is a branch of Christianity that doesn&#39;t believe in Christ&#39;s divinity (Something they agree on with Judaism.) that has been bastardized by every imam since inception. It&#39;s all a shit show. Religion should be avoided.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just patently false. You can&#39;t help but have interpretation. Hell, the protestant reformation was (also) about the common man&#39;s ability to interpret scripture for themselves (Helps when it&#39;s not in Latin.) You interpret the interface you use to reply on reddit, constantly, as you use it.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t tell me there&#39;s no interpreting. I invented interpreting. If anyone&#39;s interpreting, it&#39;s me baby.</p>

<p>It started with your claim that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have no evidence for your delusions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I replied with:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...That&#39;s the quality I have come to expect. &quot;You don&#39;t have evidence that I&#39;m not a unicorn!&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short, of course I don&#39;t have evidence to support a delusion because I recognize what it is. A false belief. Why would I need evidence to support a false belief? Do you need me to cite the definition of &#39;delusion&#39; for you?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So marxists didn’t slaughter a quarter of a billion people last century.</p>

<p>No one is even disputing that. You claimed that the act was not radical. I claim that it can be interpreted as a radical act, and that most people would.</p>

<p>...condescending, as you are aware. You can do better.</p>

<p>But this allows me to enlighten the steadfast reader:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Torah isn’t the founding text of Christianity. The NT is.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s right. The testament that didn&#39;t even exist as a codified set of books... that is what founded Christianity. Many of those books were not even in existence at that time, but somehow, they were able to become the founding documents of Christianity. I never knew the Bible also traveled backwards through time. That would explain how some of its followers behave.</p>
