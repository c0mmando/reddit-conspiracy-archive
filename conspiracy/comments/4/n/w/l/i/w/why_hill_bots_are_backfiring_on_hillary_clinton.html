       It's obvious really. Its like people writing fake reviews on their website. You can tell they are fake reviews. Many (maybe not all) can see right through them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same with the Hill Bots. They come in here trained for propoganda and try to undermine the interests of the general public. Good job Hillary. Mind control is unAmerican.
      </p>
      <p>
       But..... like all selfish decisions, there is what we call the "backfire". Every time a politician or even a private citizen does something selfish that inflicts harm on another, it backfires. Yet, the user doesn't realize this and believes they weren't slick enough and they should try harder next time. Only, after many, many backfires does the user understand that all acts against another comes back to them (both positive and negative).
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama claims Hillary is smart and maybe she has book smart, but she lacks the most important aspect of a progressive politician and that is wisdom. In fact, many politicians lack wisdom as wisdom understands selfishness backfires.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter how long anyone gets away with something, it eventually catches up to them even if its positive. If someone does something positive for a long time with little reward, suddenly, they see the effects of the work in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       If politicians simply understood this, we could avoid a lot of heartache because even they are protective of themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't have time to wait for the corrupt politicians to understand this though. It is time to take our country back now and it looks like you all are doing a good job with all the videos, blogs, law suits, protests, communication, ect...
      </p>
      <p>
       THIS YEAR SHALL BE THE PURGE OF ALL HILL BOTS OR BUST!

       Its your type of thinking that restrains people from action. If you believe the world cannot change, then it cannot change for you because that is what you expect until one day when you are pleasantly surprised. First and foremost, the amount of power given to politicians is mind boggling. If that power was divided among the people who vote on everything, it would leave no room for shitty behavior because everyone would be involved with policy making.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter what you do, if you give too much power to a small group, that group will always have a chance of getting corrupted. Sometimes they are legit but later corrupted and later legit again and so on. The idea is to maintain power in the hands of the people. We need to re-haul the system. This is a new world we live in today.
