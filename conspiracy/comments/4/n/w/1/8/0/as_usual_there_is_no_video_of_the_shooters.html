       In 2016 it is simply unfathomable that there is not amateur footage of these events pouring out on social media.
      </p>
      <p>
       I simply do not buy the story that 50 people are killed without a single camera rolling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nor do I believe that one man could kill 50 people in a crowded club without being neutralized by someone.

       Good old unreliable eye witnesses. They were there, they did not get it right. Now law enforcement and the authorities, who were not there, those people you can trust. They know what they are talking about.

       The difficulty is that, under pressure, it is hard to extract reliable information from people who were there because memory does not work like a VCR. It's impossible for someone to remember facts without remembering a narrative. The narrative is either constructed while facts happen, or added after the fact from other details, reflection, tainting by hearing accounts of others who were there.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we had unbiased investigators, all they would do is collect all the narratives from all people present, filter out the obvious accounts that are mistaken, and synthesize a reconstructed narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course the problem is when the official story line, supposedly gathered from "facts" (as in, eyewitnesses, video recording from people and/or CCTV) is not backed up by what is shown and said on TV.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case? I have no clue.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you actually have a bunch of people who were there saying "There was more than one shooter, some were holding doors closed" but the official story is "There was only one guy." it feels a little fishy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the speed at which the authorities are releasing that information is a little fishy. The while thing took hours to unravel, and there were a lot of survivors/subjects to interview, lots of facts to gather. But about 24 hours later it's all "Yep, just that one guy. He's dead now. Case closed."

       Im sure everyone will think im a shill, but i actually knew one of the people killed: Paul Henry. We used to work together at orange lake at their inbound call center. He was a real person, and now he is dead. This isnt some kind of faked incident with actors, one of my friends is no longer alive, and it is very real.  Look through my post history, im usually on board with some of these conspiracy theories, but this incident hit close to home and I know for a fact it actually happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure what i can offer as proof, but i guarantee if you dig enough you will realize this incident was real, because it actually is.

       i thought these guys were saying that the shooting was real (you gotta have real people dying when you're doing these things), and then the use of actors was for the media to cover-up anything odd that might've been noticed, and to start pushing political narratives to garner support for certain laws.

       I'm not sure why people say events like this are 100% fake or 100% how the media says it happened. Say, Sandy Hook. Did those children die? Some people say yes, Lanza killed them, or no, the whole thing never happened. I say that it's totally possible that the government killed the children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same goes for this event. Without really doing any research, I believe you that you know someone involved, but it could be possible that this Omar guy was not the only shooter, or he may have been under government mind control, or just a patsy. Or if he was a genuine self-radicalized Islamist, then
       <strong>
        obviously
       </strong>
       he was under mind control in that sense.

       I couldn't agree more. Im familiar with scopolamine, and i firmly believe that many of these shootings and tragedies did not go down like the media says it did. I just know that one of the first reactions in the conspiracy world is that it is all an act and the whole thing is staged. Since i have first hand info i thought it would be beneficial to clear up some misconceptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally i believe there were multiple shooters, and i believe that we aren't getting the whole story. I just wanted people on here to at least know the victims are real, even if some of the other info isnt.

       My condolences.  Truly sorry for your loss.  Not all of us believe this was fake. In fact the majority of us don't.

       However, we do believe there is some really sleazy shit going on here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most important piece so far is that the cops are having difficulty identifying the victims in many cases; which is super unbelievable since you need an ID to enter a club.

       I can kinda understand that. A trampling might make it hard to match a face on a card to a face that's been stamped on or shot. And while wallets might be safe in a pocket, a woman who drops her purse might not have the ID handily on her. Just playing devil's advocate here.

       It doesn't take everyone. Just a few brave souls. And what about the bouncers? There are usually bouncers at the door and in the club, often they are in constant contact via headsets.

       Without backup, the shooter would have been mobbed before he could get more than a few shots off.

       When someone is firing a gun in a crowded room, people aren't going to band together and subdue the attacker. People aren't like ants or bees where they sacrifice individuals for the protection of the rest.

       Hhhmm lets see.... A bunch of us are sitting here and have time to plan out 7an attack vs a bunch of us are having a good time and start being attacked. Which group do you think has a better reaction time?

       Mental gymnastics? I think you need to work on some mental yoga to attain some flexibilty. Maybe then you will understand that there are infinite possibilities to how something occurs rather than the single reaction that you are pinning your entire argument on.

       An ar15 is capable of firing 800 rounds per minute. Factor in that an ar15 is only able to fire as fast as the shooter can pull the trigger, and a soft estimate could be 2 rounds per second. Now, factor in that a normal magazine holds 30 rounds (subtract 2 so that the spring doesn't jam and you have 28 rounds per clip). So every 14 seconds add another 5 seconds for magazine change (another soft estimate). 4 magazines of 28 rounds would take approximately 71 seconds or 1 minute 11 seconds. And thats assuming that the shooter has slow, non practiced actions. So in a little over a minute its simple to fire off 112 rounds. Enough to do the damage that happened with some leftover stray bullets. If that doesnt suit you, double the time for twice the bullets and claim that &gt;100 shots went into the wall.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, yes i do know how long it would take to shoot and kill 50 people. Less time than it takes to brush your teeth in the morning.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, the shooter would not have been mobbed. I dont know where you came up with the idea that people run toward a weapon being fired, but this does not happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not casting doubt that this was a "scenario". Im just telling you that your thought process to come to that conclusion is seriously flawed.

       Firing rounds off as fast as you can and taking aim to kill are not quite the same thing...
      </p>
      <p>
       The notion that 50 victims suffered fatal wounds is just movie script nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the same kind of bad writing that got the Sandy Hook narrative in trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone familiar with firearms knows that shooters just aren't that efficient.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a lot more places you can get shot that won't kill you immediately, than there are fatal shots.

       Anyone who knows anything about firearms knows that firing a weapon in a crowded room doesnt require any aiming to kill someone. 50 people dead and 50 wounded is about the right ratio for unloading clips as fast as you can.

       No, this is what happens when you dont know the first thing about firearms and get your hairbrained, idiotic opinions corrected. Learn a little. People like you are the ones who create the stigma that goes along with the label conspiracy theorist. You havent researched a damn thing, and you are trying to pass off your opinions as a legitimate argument to prove a theory. If you notice i never stated the theory was wrong. Just the supposed "evidence" used to draw the conclusion.

       I've fired a lot of weapons, semi and full auto.  I don't see anything too suspicious about the numbers.  He also seems to be forgetting that .223 bullets tend to go through their targets and can hit more targets.  This is a common complaint about the caliber from the military.  It over penetrates.

       About 2 minutes.  But there were also about 50 people injured.  So let's say that makes 4-5 minutes of shooting and anyone running
       <em>
        towards
       </em>
       you gets your full attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two seconds is enough time for a practiced, but non-professional individual to acquire a new target and place a lethal shot.  The Texas CHL qualification test uses this as a general guideline, and almost everyone passes that test after minimal training.  And that's with a handgun at various indoor distances.  A semi-automatic rifle will only increase accuracy, magazine capacity, and reduce recoil, making it easier to place multiple shots per target in the same period of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is entirely plausible, with either a handgun or a rifle.

       Maybe there were a few people that tried to stop him, but ended up getting shot dead. It's certainly possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, it is also
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       probable that no one tried to stop the shooter because they were too fucking busy trying to get away or hide from the shooter. Plus, it was dark, loud music was playing, people are shouting to be heard over the loud music, many were probably drunk, some have said they thought the first few popping sounds were from someone setting off firecrackers. People were confused, scared, and just wanted to get away.

       You clearly haven't seen a pissed off drag queen in action. Nothing better than watching an outnumbered group of queens kick the shit out of some redneck biker types who made the same mistake in thinking you did.

       Use some damn common sense: those most likely to be attacked very often take measures to combat that. Many of us grew up fighting. Many of us spent our early years on the street after being kicked out.

       Gay people are no different than straight, some are weak some aren't. Some can and will fight, some won't. And many, if not most, aren't effeminate. Those are just the ones you notice.

       This will be a very un PC comment, but I will just say from my experience of the gay guys I know.  They really are  adverse to physical confrontation.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't meant to be demeaning at them either.  They have many good qualities.  But physical aggression isn't one of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I know this is also just my experience, and I know many of you are about to tell me how the toughest, most courageous guy you ever knew was gay - I am just giving my own observations on my own life experience - I don't find is unbelievable at all that gay dudes didn't charge a man with a gun.

       I saw what appeared to be a saved snapchat video from inside, "During the shooting". But it just had dancing, not even gun fire, so I'm not sure why it was described as such. Need more footage from inside, not outside.

       The video I watched was a single video snap, full length. It just had people dancing on the floor, recorded from a raised vantage point off to the side. Then it ended before anything noteworthy.

       The shooter may have had assistance, but even without, it would be easy to unleash that kind of carnage with that gun and some large clips.

       Also note, you don't need a perfect head shots to kill people who are bleeding out for an hour after getting hit.

       I am not yet willing to dismiss the possibility of a second party being involved. I'm thinking he was carrying extra magazines, already loaded, and that many of the injuries are the result of people panicking &amp; trampling each other trying to get out. We must remember that this was a large amount of drunk people, in a relatively small, loud space.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question concerns the club's security practices- what is their bouncer situation on an average weekend? I have never been to a club that did not have bouncers &amp; actual cops hired for the weekend crowds. I obviously don't know if this is typical, so Redditors, are there cops working security at the clubs you've been to?

       I am guessing, given that the only hint you gave was the word magazine, that you are taking issue with my choice of 'magazine' over 'clip.'

       That's true, but I stated the obvious to clarify why much time wouldn't be needed to reload, since there have been a few people who believe it's a false flag using reload time as part of their disbelief.

       Wasn't disagreeing, just providing what my theory is in regards to the high number of injuries. though never having been in a similar situation, I am pretty certain I'd unthinkingly trample a stranger when in full on flight mode.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree, everyone has a camera in their pocket, you'd expect someone to have filmed something.  That said, I have never once recorded anything in a club, besides posing for a pic or two, &amp; if it were me- I probably would have hauled ass outta there, not stop to record it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It don't believe that the club, or surrounding businesses, wouldn't have security cameras, but perhaps they are not releasing footage because of the ongoing investigation?
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously I have no video to provide, but as my comment suggests, I do have questions regarding the security, both of Pulse &amp; dance clubs in general. This seemed as reasonable a place to ask the question as anywhere.

       Social media is censored.  Don't we complain about that every day?

      <p>
       Killing 50 people in any closed area with an automatic weapon is extremely easy.  And you don't know that someone didn't try to stop the shooter.  It's possible some did and were shot for their effort.
