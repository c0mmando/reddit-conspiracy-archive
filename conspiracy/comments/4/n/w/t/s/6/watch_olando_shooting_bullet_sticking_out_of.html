        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Idk if you guys know guns or ballistics, but a .223 projectile is only about an inch long and travels at over 3,000 feet per second. The size of the &quot;bullet&quot; he claims to be stuck in someone&#39;s leg is bigger than the entire projectile AND casing of a .223. This is also the professional actor! I honestly didn&#39;t know what to think before about all this. But the fact that this guy was apparently shooting 20mm canon rounds traveling at insanely slow speeds out of his evil and scary ar15, is enough to tell me this more than likely didn&#39;t happen.
Edit: Sorry, I thought I had the link in here.

    <div class="md"><p>Corrct me if im wrong, there is no shot of the &quot;bullet&quot; in the video. This guy is just recalling something sticking out of a guys leg and assumed it was a bullet. A bullet of that size (what he shows with his fingers) would be a large enough caliber that it wouldnt be &quot;stuck&quot; in his leg. It would have blown through the leg and kept moving. I think this is a case of the interviewee (maybe actor) misremebering or exagerrating. </p>

<p>Or, maybe after the excitement, someone picked up a loose round and jammed it in the guys leg. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to the point of sticking out. If the round has made it through all the flesh and bone to the point of the nose of the round sticking out, it&#39;s going to keep moving.

    <div class="md"><p>I doesn&#39;t show the bullet, but over exaggeration is impossible concerning this. I own an ar15 and have shot it enough to know how fast that round moves. It&#39;s not going to stick out of someone&#39;s leg. It&#39;s either going to stay in the flesh because it has already penitrated something else and lost velocity, or it&#39;s gonna keep moving. And if something was indeed sticking out of their leg, what would it have been? We all know how man sharp pointy objects they put in bars around dancing drunk people lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Props for not being one of those &quot;I knew someone who died so you&#39;re ignorant and evil&quot; people. I always keep an open mind. The fact is that everything we say is all speculation. None of us were there so we can&#39;t know. Personally, after Sandy Hook I don&#39;t trust anything of these shootings. It very well could have happened. But if it did, I believe the government allowed it to happen.</p>
