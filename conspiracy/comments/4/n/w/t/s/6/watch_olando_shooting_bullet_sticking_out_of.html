       Idk if you guys know guns or ballistics, but a .223 projectile is only about an inch long and travels at over 3,000 feet per second. The size of the "bullet" he claims to be stuck in someone's leg is bigger than the entire projectile AND casing of a .223. This is also the professional actor! I honestly didn't know what to think before about all this. But the fact that this guy was apparently shooting 20mm canon rounds traveling at insanely slow speeds out of his evil and scary ar15, is enough to tell me this more than likely didn't happen.
Edit: Sorry, I thought I had the link in here.

       Corrct me if im wrong, there is no shot of the "bullet" in the video. This guy is just recalling something sticking out of a guys leg and assumed it was a bullet. A bullet of that size (what he shows with his fingers) would be a large enough caliber that it wouldnt be "stuck" in his leg. It would have blown through the leg and kept moving. I think this is a case of the interviewee (maybe actor) misremebering or exagerrating.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, maybe after the excitement, someone picked up a loose round and jammed it in the guys leg.

       Not rendering an opinion either way, just wanted to make the point that a bullet that blows through one persons leg could potentially be slowed down enough to get stuck in someone else's leg.

       Thats a plausible explanation. But the size of round he was describing would  be more likely to travel through people and out the wall.

       Not to the point of sticking out. If the round has made it through all the flesh and bone to the point of the nose of the round sticking out, it's going to keep moving. And there's a pretty big difference in a .223 projectile, which is about an inch long, and the 4-5 inch "projectile" this man claims he saw.

       I doesn't show the bullet, but over exaggeration is impossible concerning this. I own an ar15 and have shot it enough to know how fast that round moves. It's not going to stick out of someone's leg. It's either going to stay in the flesh because it has already penitrated something else and lost velocity, or it's gonna keep moving. And if something was indeed sticking out of their leg, what would it have been? We all know how man sharp pointy objects they put in bars around dancing drunk people lol.

       There is no possible way for you to determine that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bullet could have passed through a glass wall, a drink in someone's hand, grazed someone's calve or even punched through a bone.  There are a multitude of scenarios that could have leeched a variety of energy off the bullet in travel.

       You're right, and I just said that. I'm not debating that a round can lose velocity and become lodged into a person. I'm saying that if the round had enough velocity to make it completely through the leg, it will keep moving.

       I doubt you'll believe me, but i personally know one of the victims, Paul Henry. This really happened. He wasnt an actor, he was a call center employee, a very nice guy, and now he is no longer with us because of some asshole and his superstitions.  By all means keep digging, but do so with an open mind. This really happened and it's an absolute tragedy.

       Props for not being one of those "I knew someone who died so you're ignorant and evil" people. I always keep an open mind. The fact is that everything we say is all speculation. None of us were there so we can't know. Personally, after Sandy Hook I don't trust anything of these shootings. It very well could have happened. But if it did, I believe the government allowed it to happen.

       Thats totally possible. I have no idea if it was a government plant that killed everyone, i have no idea if it was one or multiple shooters. It could totally be just one crazy muslim like the media is saying.  All i know for sure is that my friend is dead, and im very sad and angry about it. He was such a positive person to work with, and always made everyone laugh. This whole thing is so fucked.

       The bullet could have passed through a glass wall, a drink in someone's hand, grazed someone's calve or even punched through a bone.  There are a multitude of scenarios that could have leeched a variety of energy off the bullet in travel.

       Understandable. I know there are a lot of shills that surround these things usually. I just wanted to clear up some misconceptions and i even posted proof in another thread. Sorry if i went overboard.
