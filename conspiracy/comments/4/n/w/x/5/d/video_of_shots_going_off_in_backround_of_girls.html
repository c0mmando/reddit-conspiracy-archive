       Real quick, people are a bit confused about the "door holder(s)". There seems to be 2 of them, one guy was holding/blocking the door from the inside telling people (kid in the bulls hat) to stay inside. He said this was in the opposite wing of where the shooter was. THEN there was the kid  in the back alley holding the door shut from the outside saying people were banging on the door trying to get out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sounds to me like there was someone belping the shooter keep people in as well as possibly a second shooter (again, kid in bulls hat story, says he heard 2 guns) which explains maybe why we keep hearing about 2 other "shooters" besides the dead one.
      </p>
      <p>
       The multiple shooters im just throwing ideas out there but definitely 2 different people were blocking 2 exits.

       Definitely not designed for sport, like hunting or competitive target shooting. Also, saying that it's only an
       <em>
        assault
       </em>
       rifle when full-auto is being disingenuous, when we should really be defining '
       <strong>
        assault magazine
       </strong>
       '. This shooter assaulted and killed a lot of people. He may have assaulted and killed even more with full-auto capability, but had he been limited to, say, only 10-round magazines, he would have been pausing to reload even more, presenting brief portals of precious opportunity to stop him.

       A comic take on the term "assault rifle". An assault rifle is any rifle that fires any combination of semi-auto, full-auto or burst-fire (set number of automatic bursts, typically 3).
      </p>
      <p>
       The NRA likes to define and confine the debate parameters of gun control by focusing on semi-auto vs. full-auto and/ or burst-fire
       <em>
        assault
       </em>
       rifles. However, as that debate has largely already been settled, the current focus of those in favor of better gun control is magazine capacity, especially high-capacity magazines (generally any magazine clip that holds more than 10 bullets). I'm just sayin' why not call them "assault magazines"? See how those semantics work?
      </p>
      <p>
       In whichever case, many  seem to be of the mind that a shooter with 100 bullets @ 10 x 10-round magazines and a
       <strong>
        full-auto
       </strong>
       weapon can kill more random people in a crowd faster than a shooter with 100 bullets @ 3 x 33-round magazines and
       <strong>
        semi-auto
       </strong>
       . I'm calling bullshit.

       Like I said, AR-15s (ok &amp; M4s too) are
       <strong>
        designed for military assault
       </strong>
       and 99.99% are sold to standing armies all over the world. They are
       <strong>
        not designed for sport
       </strong>
       , but of course there are target shooting competitions for enthusiasts.

       Go to r guns and see how many people wanna kill people with there ak or ar15. Everyone I know shoots it for fun. Not just target shooting. The ones in the military are burst or fully auto. Everybody I know shoots these things for fun and dosnt kill anybody.

       You think I support 10 round mags? That's what I meant about your term "assault mags" I think when your gonna take away someone's right to own guns . Then your the problem. That's what the quote is about. You wanna take away guns for temporary safety. You deserve neither

       Thank you for asking. I, too, am reminded of the one single video from the Bataclan. I just find it so hard to believe in this day and age where we film anything and everything with our phones that there isn't more footage.

       Yeah you'd think there would at least be a video from someone outside. But I can't imagine anyone who was inside pulling out their phone in that situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking from personal experience, I was recently robbed and taken hostage by two gunmen in a convenience store (fortunately I made it out of there with only very minor injuries and the robbers were surrendered after the place was surrounded by cops). It was me and the clerk in there and when you're in a life or death situation like that the last thing you'd think about is pulling out your phone.
