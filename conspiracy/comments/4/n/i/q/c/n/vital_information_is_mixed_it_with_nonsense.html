        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This strategy, employed more and more by the powerful as the years pass, will be the downfall of the mainstream internet as an enlightening communication device. The only safety from this is through obscurity, by going to obscure websites where there are no paid trolls fucking up the information stream.</p>

<p>All the &quot;controversial&quot; news is no longer available on <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> but is instead maligned to this subreddit. If it&#39;s on <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> or <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> or whatever, you can almost guarantee it&#39;s also on CNN and MSNBC. Reddit is MSM, and they now march in lockstep in sharp contrast to the reddit of 5+ years ago. </p>

<p>So with all the &quot;edgy&quot; news pushed to subreddits like this, with a label like &quot;conspiracy&quot;, it acts as a polarizing force to the readers of reddit. It gives the implicit idea you have to be a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; to even read this sub, just by the wording alone. Even though it often contains very important and valid news stories that aren&#39;t touched by the MSM. </p>

<p>As an experiment, let&#39;s pretend you are the head of the US government&#39;s military&#39;s PR division, and you notice that there&#39;s a big collection of very accurate and damning news stories collecting in one place on the internet. They can&#39;t outright ban the sub without making a backdoor deal with reddit&#39;s owners, advance publishing, and that is very risky from a PR perspective if exposed and could also be expensive. Instead of doing that, they can just dilute the existing information that is so damning. They can dilute it not only with lesser unimportant news, but also with incorrect nonsense. The tighter they can pair the damning news with the nonsense news, the more they can get people to dismiss the damning news. They can intertwine it on the sub&#39;s frontpage posts, or within posts or comments. </p>

<p>I&#39;m talking about this in the abstract, but here&#39;s an example. Imagine a self-post on this subreddit reading: </p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;9/11 was an inside job, and it&#39;s clear the Saudis and Bushes cooperated to bring down the twin towers and building 7 with mini-nukes. They also faked the planes using hologram technology they got from aliens, they weren&#39;t real planes.&quot; </li>
</ul>

<p>Analyzing this, there is a mention of building 7, and a mention of the fact it was an inside job, even mentioning the Bushes. This is compelling, and grabs one&#39;s attention. However, it is paired with the other nonsense that is obviously wrong, so it leads the reader to believe that &quot;believing the bushes and saudis did it&quot; is on par with believing the government has alien technology to make holographic airplanes appear. So they will reject that belief because it is paired with the crazy belief. They don&#39;t want to be &quot;one of those people who believes in those sorts of things.&quot; </p>

<p>And furthermore, if you hold some of those non-crazy beliefs yourself, you start to feel as though <em>you</em> may be crazy. I don&#39;t believe the government has alien technology or that mini-nukes make any sense to explain what happened, but this post apparently combines them, which makes me think to myself &quot;Is this how I appear to other people?&quot; and you may be afraid to say something in the future because the person you&#39;re talking to might associate your claims with these other much wilder claims. Or even worse, you may start actually believing in holographic planes, and begin doing their work for them by spreading these idiotic beliefs mixed right along in with the truth. </p>

<p>So if you were someone powerful and you and your organization had secrets, and the secrets were getting out, wouldn&#39;t you pay a couple college students to troll message boards for you to convince 90% of people it&#39;s BS, and make the other 10% look crazy? There are even companies you can hire that will do it for you, you just simply pay them and give them a general script, and they hire the college students for you. It&#39;s an entire industry. It&#39;s like renting a mercenary army of trolls to divert the information stream, for profit. </p>

<p>Now realize it&#39;s not only the military&#39;s PR, but the government, many corporations, and many other initiative-based organizations.  Not only in our country as well, but the governments and corporations all around the world! This is why reddit has become so bizarre over the last few years, especially subreddits like this one. Hundreds of competing interests, trying to bend the information stream in their own ways. </p>

<p>You want to look at the end game of this, go to Tavistock (aka GLP) and look at the posts. That whole forum is dripping with this strategy, to associate the bizarrely true with the truly bizarre, muddying the waters until no one can have a rational conversation over all the information manipulation. No one knows what is true and what isn&#39;t, so they fall back on simplistic ideas like racism. This plays right in to the hands of the powerful, racism is a perfect distraction from what they are doing. People start buying in to the nonsense and preaching it themselves. You want real-life CIA brainwashing, well here it is, a whole forum of it to look at every day. This is what they want <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to look like, and more and more I see them accomplishing their goals. It also drives out the people who can&#39;t tolerate it, so we lose many rational users that made this community great. It slowly erodes the good people and good posts, and replaces them with for-hire verbal garbage as the years drag on.</p>

<p>Many of you already know all this, but many of you don&#39;t know, or haven&#39;t heard the full story. This is a very real problem, and the more aware we are of it, the more we can be fully aware of what is happening. Sometimes I think people walk away from reddit thinking &quot;Man, humanity is insane&quot; without fully understanding how manipulated reddit actually is, and how much intentional nonsense is put online to destroy clarity in communication among the masses. Important stuff is getting lost in the noise. People think the noise is real. It&#39;s just a distraction though, and it&#39;s time people stop thinking online communication is organic, and realize that this shit is absolutely gamed to hell by people with money. Our individual critical thinking is our only defense. To develop that skill, we must have posts like this that call out reality for what it truly is, even if just as a reminder. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The mods have stickied this post by <a href="/u/magnora7">/u/magnora7</a> because it makes important points about critical thinking and objectively analysing the information you see on this subreddit (and indeed any other). It&#39;s a good post, and we believe it is a subject worthy of discussion.</p>

<p>However, a stickied post  is not an &quot;official endorsement&quot; by this sub, and the OP&#39;s subtle framing of the narrative of 9/11 into acceptable and &quot;crazy&quot; (sic) theories is unfortunate, and should be parsed using the critical thinking techniques that the OP himself has suggested.</p>

<p>To be clear, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> does not officially endorse (or deny) any specific narrative of the events of 9/11 - or any other putative conspiracy event. Individual subscribers are expected to make up their own minds.</p>

<p>Your comment seems fair enough as it is, but I don&#39;t see why the regular voting process isn&#39;t sufficient enough for it like everyone else&#39;s.  Do mods comments really need such prominent placement above everyone else&#39;s comments?  </p>

<p>Along with a mere...99.9% of the rest of us on this subreddit? You, however, have a record of pushing a specific narrative (which the OP also appears to be pushing) which seems designed to shut down certain avenues of dicussion. Nobody has all the answers, and the people who argue that theirs is the &quot;official&quot; conspiracy theory of 9/11 and everybody else&#39;s ideas are &quot;crazy&quot; tend to make me suspicious.

<p>Your judgments as to what constitute &quot;wild speculation, absent proof&quot; do not entitle you to shut down avenues of discussion with which you disagree; that is the point sabre is making.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amen bro.  I&#39;m just glad that your post got stickied because it is right on and what people should and need to know.  So that has me feeling optimistic.  But the fact that &quot;admins&quot; have to sticky their points of view on top of a comment thread seems top down in nature to me and against the spirit of reddit in general.  Also the fact that my comment is hidden seems strange to me and makes me pessimistic about the dynamics of the conspiracy subreddit and its leadership.  </p>

<p>They kicked me off the mod team after I stuck up for the people&#39;s voices and after I was voted in by the users themselves.  They want to control it and look at the users as the opposition rather than as people they are lucky enough to represent.  Just like our government in their mentality towards the population.  Sad and evident from what I could tell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I think there is a lot of infighting going on with the mod team here on this subreddit, as your expulsion is further evidence of. It only takes 3 mods to get something stickied, so I&#39;m guessing that happened and then some of the other mods who are in to the no-planes or mini-nukes went in to damage control mode and stickied that comment in response, since (I&#39;m guessing) they were unable to un-sticky the main post without causing a big stir. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s overall a good sign, but it seems clear there&#39;s a lot of disagreement about this issue among the mods. That&#39;s fine, as long as there&#39;s some sort of balance. But I&#39;m guessing, like the rest of reddit, the mod team on thie subreddit is slowly being taken over by corruption</p>

<p>Well, that&#39;s news to me. I missed the mod vote to sticky your post, but noticed your post was employing a technique it was purporting to condemn. Suggesting that any deviation from your limited hangout 9/11 narrative is &quot;obviously wrong&quot; is manipulative and deceitful. </p>

<p>Truth will always exist in a clean slate, when you approach the world as a system whose truth is self-evident, than you are free to all the knowledge that a man can know.  But if you approach it with a model that must verify what you think is true, then you are going to run into points of discrepancy that require a vast complex story to explain.

    <div class="md"><p>You can do that too, of course, but these people never allow themselves to be proven wrong. You can debate them for the benefit of other readers though, but be forewarned you will never win any debate with them, they will always move the goalposts to keep you going. And honestly a lot of times it only provides more forum space for them to espouse false ideas. If people think the truth lies between what you&#39;re saying and what they&#39;re saying, then they will still believe in tons of disinfo. It&#39;s best to just ignore disinfo when you see it, or just call it out as disinfo, rather than debate it. Especially if it&#39;s a worn-out disinfo topic like flat earth or hollow earth, there&#39;s really no use in debating it. That&#39;s my 2 cents after 8 years of using reddit and dealing with these people. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>and I want to reply &quot;That&#39;s not what I said, I said that the mini-nuke and holographic planes theories are nonsense.&quot; </p>

<p>but I can guarantee you we would get in to a multi-comment thread about the details of mini-nuke 9/11 theory, and if I continue to engage, it would make up most of the comments on this thread. This distracts from the topic at hand that I&#39;m actually trying to talk about, and keeps other people from commenting because they look at the thread and it looks derailed, and derailed by nonsense. </p>

<p>For this reason I feel ignoring is better than arguing. Arguing just gives them acknowledgement they don&#39;t deserve, and gives them the space and opportunity to fill the comments with derailing content. They often try to get the last word, so you can argue back for ages and it never ends. It just seems a bit fruitless, and actually perhaps destructive toward trying to stay on topic and have good discussions. </p>

<p>Is this really fair? I agree with you that we can&#39;t have absurd notions mixed with plausible conjecture, as this is a classic State/corp sponsored shill tactic of &quot;muddying the waters&quot;. But you are saying that you are correct and another is wrong. </p>

<p>I know it&#39;s difficult to objectively categorize what should be a topic open for discussion vs. what should be rejected outright (aside from some bright lines like aliens, Elvis or Prescott Bush clones, etc.). For instance I think believing in holographic planes is wayward thinking, yet I have not arrived at a final conclusion regarding the exclusive use of thermite/thermate/nano-thermite and no use of nuclear energy whatsoever (there are just too many unanswered questions to me). However, as much as I&#39;d like a spirited debate on the topic, it seems that this sub is intolerant to it&#39;s mention. If I bring it up, I&#39;m either treated like a moron, or suspected as a shill (linked to Khalezov and all opinions about him, etc., etc.).</p>

<p>Our suspicion about any position held should grow proportionately with the level of consensus/approval of that position. Not because the position may be a &quot;false theory&quot; that was planted by those who want to muddy the waters, but because when you have a &quot;certainty&quot; held by &quot;a majority&quot;, <em>there is a good chance that a fair amount of confirmation bias got you there.</em></p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You realize you are associating people who hold unpopular beliefs with the trait of lousy debate etiquette. That&#39;s just shitty. It may be true in some cases, but you are making those who have the &quot;wrong&quot; positions sound like jerks across the board.</p>

<p>If you, magnora7, are the same guy with the long post from a year ago describing your arduous journey enduring bullshit by Reddit and others, all the while fighting for truth without censorship (under other username variations of magnora), please know I have respect for you and what you have attempted to do, not to mention the enlightenment you have brought to many because of that post. [Plus, if I haven&#39;t said it someplace else in this thread, your message in the OP is noble <em>and</em> well written, and deserves to be stickied.]</p>

<p>But I just think we need to be careful in our evaluation of what&#39;s ok to discuss, and what&#39;s &quot;off the table&quot;. It&#39;s like your comment on ideology elsewhere in this thread. I believe we need to be wary of clinging only to &quot;acceptable&quot; positions...otherwise, I think, we throw out the baby along with the bathwater.</p>

<p>There are three kinds of &quot;shills&quot;: Paid shills, ideological shills, and those that are both paid and ideological zealots (see any Israel-related thread in WorldNews for examples).</p>

<p>The ideologs are far more dedicated and pernicious than simple hired goons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good observation, these super-far-out beliefs often go together in people. That&#39;s very true.</p>

<p>I think though, in addition to disinfo agents, there are real people who get addicted to what they perceive as &quot;hidden info&quot;, and they start to believe anything they hear that goes against conventional wisdom, believing they&#39;re seeing the true reality everyone else is too stubborn to see, but in reality are just getting super confused by unprovable nonsense. The disinfo companies uses these &quot;hidden info&quot; addicts to fill their heads with garbage that they pass around to others. It&#39;s like free advertising. So not only does the information stream get corrupted by nonsense, but some of the <em>people</em> reading the information stream get corrupted by nonsense too, and regurgitate that back in to the community, believing it to be true. These people are just as dangerous as the disinfo people if not more, because they honestly believe the disinfo as gospel truth and will promote it as such. But they&#39;re not paid commenters, they&#39;re just regular people addicted to what appears to them to be hidden info. So it&#39;s not all paid commenters pushing untrue things, and it&#39;s important to keep that in mind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But i still don&#39;t get what that has to do with advertising or how that makes money. There has to be some sort of mechanism by which associating certain news items with &quot;crazy&quot; results in increased ad revenue. What is that mechanism? You talked about &quot;military pr&quot; in your op. What is it that they sell on Reddit by making conspiracy theorists look crazy? </p>

<p>How is it supposed to work?</p>

<p>Edit: you said &quot;increased eyeballs&quot; or something to that effect to explain how this scheme works and then you said the news item gets ignored by being relegated to this sub. Those are mutually exclusive. Again, I have to ask how this scheme is supposed to work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok could you please be more specific? Like who is &quot;them&quot;? Big corporations? The US government? Because you seem to be talking about both interchangeably. And I get that maybe that&#39;s how you think of them but the fact is that selling military service is not quite like selling dish soap. You still have to explain WHO is employing these supposed agents. You could do that by maybe producing a recruitment ad or letter. Not just for astroturf, but for this &quot;posting crazy theories&quot; jobs. If these people exist, theres bound to be some of those floating around. Maybe there&#39;s one or two people who have done the job who don&#39;t mind talking about it. Produce their testimony as evidence.</p>

<p>Im really trying hard to help lead you towards being more specific and providing evidence but you&#39;re making it really hard dude. Everything you&#39;re saying is extremely vague and ~sounds~ speculative. But I&#39;m still giving you the benefit of the doubt that you&#39;re sitting on some actual evidence. You&#39;re gonna need to start providing actual evidence soon, which you didn&#39;t do at all in the op but you&#39;ve been talking a lot about critical thinking in the comments. Evidence will be a crucial part of that. What you have is a hypothesis. Youre making very broad claims and producing no evidence. </p>

<p>If you want to be taken seriously outside of a post on a conspiracy sub, what you might do is find a specific example of someone who is definitely a shill. Like something you can prove and show who they were working for. Was it the DoD? Was it Glaxo Smith Kline? Theres gotta be something hard. Otherwise it kind of does seem like you&#39;re just saying this is all true without actually knowing one way or the other.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve been nice and engaged with me in a civil way. People here are ~really~ into what you are saying but I think it&#39;s a disservice if you don&#39;t provide actual stuff to backup your claims. You have to be a LOT more specific. Like &quot;this reddit user posted this and this, then this person accused them of being a shill. We looked into it and produced documents proving they work for American airlines&quot;. That&#39;s a silly example but you see what I mean. It kind of sounds like you&#39;re just sort of making stuff up because it ~sounds~ true and it fits your worldview. If you actually want to be critical, you have to be doubly critical of your own hypothesis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s provable is that Reddit is being used as a propaganda and advertisement tool. (Google &quot;buying reddit upvotes&quot;).</p>

<p>The demographic of people interested in this is very widespread, so singling them out would not make them appear as the sole culprit, ever.</p>

<p>Sometimes you can catch a glimpse at what&#39;s going on behind the scenes, with mods of big subreddits going on power trips without being stopped by their fellow mods for no discernible reason. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a market for selling reputable reddit accounts in various subreddits. </p>

<p>In some ways a government is similar to a company: It needs to keep its workers in line (&quot;prevent anarchy&quot;, riots etc.) while minimizing expenses and it also needs to keep a good reputation to be able to work well (nobody will trust a government that is thought to be corrupt or insincere).</p>

<p>All these can be achieved by attention control, which is what this kind of thing really is.</p>

<p>These actors are out there (since there&#39;s clearly a demand for these services, as proven by the existence of reddit account selling for the purpose of posing as a reputable user to spread misinformation or direct attention and upvote selling). </p>

<p>What&#39;s unclear is who is paying them; anyone can likely do so fairly anonymously, so that&#39;s where the trail ends. You can accuse those with a plausible motive, but it&#39;ll only ever stay a suspicion, and if there are enough other actors to occupy your attention you&#39;ll never get anywhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The simplest explanation is still the most plausible one. People have wacky ideas. Some of them are wackier than yours, but yours are probably wackier than someone else&#39;s. And they naturally congregate on conspiracy sites to post stuff because that&#39;s what those sites are <em>for</em>. Saying there&#39;s a conspiracy behind people who post implausible ideas is actually so implausible that it <em>discredits OP for even posting it because it makes him look like he&#39;s trying to discredit more plausible theories</em>.</p>

<p>Very meta. OP was right all along, but he was also the shill that he was warning us about. He just did his job too well.</p>

<p>But see what I mean about not having to pay people? You and OP are both posting implausible theories with nothing to back it up but are acting as if it&#39;s already proven beyond doubt. I hate to break it to you, but by your own logic you&#39;re a shill. At least you have a fat paycheck coming :)</p>

<p>I want you to know I spent an incredible amount of time rewriting this so it was less mean. I tried. Thank you for being civil. </p>

<p>Off topic but do people just <em>hate</em> Dylan Avery around here or what?</p>

<p>The term “truther” referred originally to 9/11.  Now any type of rational inquiry is labeled ‘truther’ by gatekeepers.  <a href="http://boingboing.net/2015/09/17/donald-trump-is-an-anti-vaccin.html">Vaccine</a> “truther”; <a href="http://www.wbez.org/blogs/achy-obejas/2013-01/sandy-hook-truthers-warn-about-obama-gun-plan-104965">Sandy Hook</a> “truther”.  <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/03/04/3344011/birth-control-ricki-lake/">Birth Control</a> “truther”.  <strong><em>The term has been weaponized to transfer the taint of the ‘conspiracy theorist’ ad hominem onto a variety of markets of inquiry, each discrediting the other.</em></strong>  </p>

<p><a href="http://911blogger.com/news/2009-03-02/politico-conflates-obama-birthers-911-truthers">Politico conflates Obama “Birthers” with 9/11 Truthers</a>.  Whoopi Goldberg conflates <a href="https://youtu.be/gQW2yool2NU?t=48">truthers with holocaust deniers</a>.  Geraldo Rivera conflates truthers with <a href="https://youtu.be/klddgvDCVkw?t=7337">gay restroom sex seekers</a>. Most egregious of all, Rachael Madow mentions <a href="https://youtu.be/qUkjIpgthWs?t=74">“protocols of the elders of zion”</a>, comparing 9/11 Truthers to <a href="https://youtu.be/qUkjIpgthWs?t=74">anti-semitic conspiracy theory radicals.</a></p>

<p>What is most ironic is that ‘truther’ should even be a derogatory term, as if we are to find the <a href="http://www.infowars.com/1984-style-war-on-language-has-begun/">mutation of our language</a> acceptable. It almost implies that everyone else is a lie-ster, false-ster, non-truther, and that is good.  &quot;Ignorance is Strength&quot;.  Orwellian Think about that.  This is what we’ve become.</p>

<p><strong>Gaslighting / Conflation-Confabulation</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting"><em>‘Gaslighting’</em></a> is a term that describes a willful, intentionally-deceptive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confabulation">confabulation</a> of another person’s relationship to the truth of a matter, as a form of mental abuse.  The phrase comes from the classic film, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZMoIZPC5NA"><em>“Gaslight”</em></a>, in which a con-man attempts to fleece his wife out of her inheritance by exploiting her trustful nature and manipulating her understanding of the world around her.  It is one of the most evil, deplorable activities within which a person or group can engage.</p>

<p>Confabulation involves mixing fact with fiction so that the target is intentionally confused.  It&#39;s a willful psychological attack on a person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Relevant: 
The guy blocking the door was also interviewed.  If you listen to interview he starts talking about blocking door at the 3:15 mark.
Copypasta from an askreddit thread:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>one guy in a live stream interview on TV with the news station said that he and several others went out an exit door into the alleyway and then turned around and barricaded the door so that it couldn&#39;t be opened. he then went on to say that he kept hearing banging noises on the door and he can &quot;only hope that it wasn&#39;t people trying to get out.&quot; Uh, yeah, it was probably people running from the shooter and trying to go out the EXIT DOOR only to not be able to get out and have to turn around to meet their fate - death.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand that in a panic situation things like this happen, but if he ran into an alleyway, why block the door and trap the people inside? Why not just keep running ?</p>

<p><strong>Edit for additional info:</strong>  Those of you talking about there being a fence in the back, yes, there was a fence around the alley, but the guy clearly said that after they barricaded the door, they eventually <em>&quot;crawled through a hole in the fence.&quot;</em>  So he could have easily <strong>NOT</strong> barricaded the door.</p>

<p><strong>My wife located the full interview where he says all of this, here:</strong>  <a href="http://kstp.com/news/florida-nightclub-shooting-eyewitness/4166140/">http://kstp.com/news/florida-nightclub-shooting-eyewitness/4166140/</a></p>

<p><strong>I TRANSCRIBED IT</strong>:  When we got a ten second break [from gunshot sounds, probably during reloading?] we went through this alleyway which led for only employees and me and this random guy tried blocking the door, cause at that point like I said the bullets were getting louder and closer so we blocked this door, and we did hear banging, and I pray it wasn’t anyone trying to escape, because I would forever feel guilty.  but at that point there was about 20 people infront of us crammed in this little alleyway, with a big hole in one of the fences, and just trying to topple over, just trying to escape, just trying to run.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the appreciation. Oh of course, I absolutely get tired and frustrated from it and have to take a break. Can absolutely empathize there. It can be difficult to cope. I even wrote a whole post about it a while ago that resonated with a lot of people, here is a link in case you may be interested: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/46ue9s/dealing_with_the_psychological_burden_of_knowing/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/46ue9s/dealing_with_the_psychological_burden_of_knowing/</a></p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not about operating inside or outside MSM, do whichever you fancy. But the point is reaching the most people with the most vital pieces of information, the information that is being ignored by the culture at large but is highly relevant. The stuff nobody sees yet, just because people haven&#39;t been exposed to that information yet. Those people need to be reached. </p>

<p>All you can do is you, if you get exhausted trying to help that&#39;s okay. But it is something that if enough people put enough effort in to changing the values of culture, it will happen. That&#39;s how cultural changes <em>always</em> happen. You can participate and shape culture gradually, but it is a gargantuan task and you are but one person, so you must pace yourself. It&#39;s a 10,000 mile marathon, but the wise know it needs running despite how daunting it is. A day at a time, a message at a time, a sentence at a time. That&#39;s all you can do, the rest is out of your hands, literally. Sorry for rambling myself, my post ended up being far longer than yours even haha</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The single biggest change in the law came with the new NDAA that negated the Smith-Mundt Act from 1947 that banned all propaganda domestically.  </p>

<p>In 2013 they &quot;updated&quot; the act under the guise of being able to offer radio shows for download domestically that were otherwise only available internationally and all sorts of other bullshit that were good ways to cover a turd in frosting and make us believe we wanted to eat it.  It&#39;s unbelievable in any way, <strong>in any way</strong>, that we allow propaganda.  There is simply no place for that in a democratic nation.  ZERO.  Not a &quot;we have to tolerate this&quot;, that&#39;s simply bullshit that literally is intended to <em>sway</em> a democracy.  </p>

<p>What the fuck are we doing.  Get a petition going to sign this shit, or get off the fucking internet as it deals with the government.  A free press simply cannot exist alongside a propaganda press.  How people aren&#39;t demanding change on the repeal of the NDAA and it&#39;s allowance of propaganda is unbelievable, until you look at some of the other examples where nations used propaganda... so I guess, welcome to what we allowed.  This is our own fault.  </p>

<p>Secondly, you just brought up a second reason why there were no planes. United Flight 175 (the 2nd plane) is estimated to have been traveling between 500 and 600 mph as it was approaching the towers, but a Boeing 767 cannot possibly travel that fast at such low altitudes.</p>

<p>I&#39;m with you there, the buildings were clearly rigged with demolitions.</p>

<p>But if they wanted to create the image of a plane hitting a building, why wouldn&#39;t they just use a real plane?

<p>A plane hitting a building, regardless of speed, would never penetrate a structure made of steel and concrete the way the 2nd plane on 9/11 supposedly did. </p>

<p>These planes can suffer serious damage if they even hit a bird in the sky, that is how fragile they are made and they have to be made that fragile because that is the only way for them to fly.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s two video of plane crashes. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZjhxuhTmGk">this one</a> a jet is traveling at 500 mph into a concrete wall and you can see the results. In <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=5fc_1465591113">this one</a> a plane falls onto of a car and smashes into a million pieces.</p>

<p>Now compare that with the video of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2sOEkms64">2nd plane on 9/11</a>. </p>

<p>Why does that matter? The planes exploded in to the buildings, then the buildings exploded and fell. The planes didn&#39;t <em>need</em> to penetrate the building. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s true. I think there need to be a statement. This subreddit is full of disinformants. Also misinformation. I totally agree with OP.</p>

<p>These troll agents are very good at what they are doing. The satanic cryptoglobalists are also very persistent.</p>

<p>Some might think I&#39;m misinformed myself. Sometimes it is a tricky situation. It&#39;s like an uncharted territory. People calling loon on each other.</p>

<p>But how else can you explain the elitist cabal other than <strong>SATANISTs</strong>? How do you explain why they are the way they are, and why they do what they are doing? People will always fall for the racial propaganda.</p>

<p>Magnora7, I&#39;ve seen you around the same threads I&#39;ve lurked deeply or contributed to, which leads me to repeat my question (which also relates to my favorite thread so far; <a href="https://redd.it/46ue9s">https://redd.it/46ue9s</a> )</p>

What the fuck makes you think you know the answers and what is the truth and what isn&#39;t, and who are you to tell others not to look into theories?

    <div class="md"><p>Yea...about that.  It&#39;s really easy to use physics to explain how a hologram can be coordinated with a real explosion, as a misdirection tactic.</p>

<p>Try (think) harder, next time.</p>

<p>Again I&#39;m not saying this is what happened, I don&#39;t have a solid opinion either way.  But that there is good evidence for and little evidence against, if you look at the footage, interviews, etc.  </p>

<p>If you want to contribute anything useful to this discussion, <strong>think of it more like a magician would.</strong></p>

<p>This one uses water as the screen, but if you havent seen it give it a watch: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anANEPt_a4E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anANEPt_a4E</a></p>

<p>Perhaps there is black technology to use either air, or finer particulate (say the smog of a city) or maybe there is technology which doesn&#39;t need a screen at all.</p>

<p>Or finally, the collisions may have all been CGI, no need for a hologram.  Maybe planes flying nearby as misdirection.  In this case, the CGI is coordinated on multiple footage using the initial flash you see when the nose first touches the building.</p>

<p>As if it&#39;s realistic for this type of entry flash to happen if that&#39;s a real plane.  Why isn&#39;t it blocked by the nose/body of the airplane?  And worse, why is it offset from where it seems the nose would enter?  I&#39;d very much appreciate u/bumblebritches57 and u/magnora7 answers to these two questions, if they don&#39;t mind, since I stumble on trying to provide an answer, which is why I even bother to bring it up.

<p>First off I wanted to say that I <strong>don&#39;t</strong> have a steadfast opinion either way.</p>

<p>BUT, I&#39;m NOT going to use &quot;No one has ever&quot; and &quot;This is difficult&quot; as a valid excuse as to why it <strong>couldn&#39;t</strong> have happened.</p>

<p>Are you to suggest that black technology doesn&#39;t far surpass what you or I think or thought was possible?</p>

<p>Maybe it did happen.  On the date of September 11th 2001.</p>

<p>Compositing is probably the easier problem compared to holograms.  Both very well might be sufficiently advanced, perhaps bordering magic compared to what is released to the public.</p>

<hr/>

<p>It should be noted that a 767 engine, according to Boeing, are interchangeable with 747 engines with &#39;some&#39; modifications. If we can look up the exact flight number and try to find the engine used before hitting the tower, that would give credence even more so.</p>

<hr/>

<p>United Airlines Flight 175 struck the South Tower. Its tail number was N162UA. It was a Boeing 767-222.</p>

<p>Flight 175 had two Pratt and Whitney JT9D-7R4D engines.</p>

<p>American Airlines Flight 11 struck the North Tower. Its tail number was N334AA. It was a Boeing 767-222ER.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Flight 11 had two General Electric CF6-80A2 engines.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The name of the component is HPT Stage1 Cooling Duct Assembly. There is a history behind this assembly as I began to read more. This component was part of the early JT9D-7 series engines that were used in development of Boeing&#39;s 747 line of aircraft. The &quot;7&quot; series engines have gone through many revisions but are exclusively used on 747&#39;s. Many years later, P&amp;W decided to work with NASA in the development in a new technology to improve engine performance and reliability. This improvement was made specifically to this section of engine. Tangential On-Board Injection (TOBI or &quot;R&quot; for Radial) was the newest improvement to reduce nozzle temperatures by over 2% which could open the door for a more powerful engines based on the &quot;7&quot; series engine. The new model of engine would be called 7R4+Revision Letter. The 7R4D engine is the one that is specified for United Airlines Boeing 767&#39;s.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The engine found at Church and Murray didn&#39;t seem to be a 7R4D.....it seemed to be a 7J. The only way to confirm this is to search for the engine and take a look at the diffuser casing to verify a match. This was another needle in a haystack but I found it......a photo of a stripped down 747 engine at an outdoor museum. The diffuser casing is a perfect match!</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://ckpi.typepad.com/.a/6a00e00982d2c988330120a568bf6c970b-500wi">http://ckpi.typepad.com/.a/6a00e00982d2c988330120a568bf6c970b-500wi</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>Take note of the arrows to see that they match the JT9D-7 series engine on the 747 shown in the photo. Click to enlarge.</p>

<p><a href="http://ckpi.typepad.com/.a/6a00e00982d2c988330120a5bf5ddd970c-500wi">http://ckpi.typepad.com/.a/6a00e00982d2c988330120a5bf5ddd970c-500wi</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>&quot;We have two data points indicating that the Murray Street engine is a Pratt and Whitney JT9D-7 series engine: the HPT Stage 1 Cooling Duct Assembly which the manufacturer indicates is for use only with the 7 series engine, and we have the diffuser casing of the Murray Street engine matching perfectly the diffuser casing of a 747 engine --for which model of Boeing aircraft Weezula says the JT9D-7 series engine was exclusively used.&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>All data so far seem to indicate that the Murray Street engine is not a JT9D-7R4D engine, as would have been on Flight 175. (And the Murray Street engine certainly is not a GE CF6 engine from Flight 11.)</p>

<hr/>

<p>&quot;So how did a 7-series 747 engine wind up on Murray Street?&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Testing the Hypothesis that Mini-Nukes Were Used on the WTC Towers - Steven E. Jones</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Empirical Facts:</strong> All nuclear weapons (especially FUSION/Hydrogen bombs) release copious high-energy neutrons which will activate steel and other materials. This is called neutron activation and cannot be avoided, and much of the induced radioactivity remains for decades.</li>
<li>I have studied fusion for decades, and have made frequent measurements of neutrons (as well as charged particles).</li>
<li>Several months ago, I tested WTC dust samples and a solidified metal sample for radioactivity using a Geiger counter: I found ZERO RADIOACTIVITY. This experimental evidence goes strongly against the mini-nukes hypothesis since neutron activation levels were zero.</li>
<li>I also tested some sand gathered from a nuclear-bomb test site decades ago for comparison – and the Geiger counter showed hundreds of counts per minute. This also shows the long life of the radioactive residues due to nuclear bombs – the sand still yields high Geiger-counter readings decades after the nuclear bomb blast.</li>
<li>Note that concrete pulverization is often achieved in controlled demolitions with chemical explosives, e.g., the Seattle Kingdome demolition.</li>
<li>Mini-nukes are not needed for pulverization nor for “top-down” demolition as observed for the WTC Towers.</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>the reason it matters is because it demonstrates that u.s./israeli intelligence has access to thermonuclear devices within the u.s. and the ability and willingness to deploy them against a civilian population. <a href="https://311truth.wordpress.com/">fukishima</a> was not an accident. nor was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhzIwDNGq2w">tianjin</a>. this is a pattern of using nuclear devices in terrorist attacks.</p>

<p>furthermore, it demonstrates the complicity of the press in conducting these operations, and their ability to use hollywood-style effects and crisis actors to deceive the public. (expect youtube and social media to be the media weapons of choice nowadays.)</p>

<p>these things matter. spreading the word about them may help prevent further nuclear false flags propelled by false media.</p>

<p>now.. i regret to inform you that the 9/11 truth movement has been largely subverted by ae911truth, a controlled opposition organization that exists to control the truth movement and render it impotent. and, of course, to shield both israel and the traitors involved from suspicion. we see them now pushing blame towards saudi arabia - the ultimate patsy.</p>

<p>they&#39;re calling for a new investigation, but we already know what happened. we should be making arrests and conducting trials. and executions.</p>

<p>how many arrests have there been of the real culprits? even one?</p>

<p>they are working for team evil. the same people who have corrupted our medical system and weaponized our food supply.</p>

<p>don&#39;t be fooled. they are not on team people. use them where convenient, but remember: they are our enemy. this is war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get it, but for example here there&#39;s a guy who replied to my OP, who has been voted to the top of the comments:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The real tl;dr: Alternative 9/11 theories are &quot;crazy&quot;, &quot;nonsense&quot;, &quot;idiotic beliefs&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and I want to reply &quot;That&#39;s not what I said, I said that the mini-nuke and holographic planes theories are nonsense.&quot; </p>

<p>but I can guarantee you we would get in to a multi-comment thread about the details of mini-nuke 9/11 theory, and if I continue to engage, it would make up most of the comments on this thread. This distracts from the topic at hand that I&#39;m actually trying to talk about, and keeps other people from commenting because they look at the thread and it looks derailed, and derailed by nonsense. </p>

<p>For this reason I feel ignoring is better than arguing. Arguing just gives them acknowledgement they don&#39;t deserve, and gives them the space and opportunity to fill the comments with derailing content. They often try to get the last word, so you can argue back for ages and it never ends. It just seems a bit fruitless, and actually perhaps destructive toward trying to stay on topic and have good discussions. </p>

<p>Along with a mere...99.9% of the rest of us on this subreddit?

<blockquote>
<p>Are we actually helping our cause for truth by operating within MSM? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not about operating inside or outside MSM, do whichever you fancy. But the point is reaching the most people with the most vital pieces of information, the information that is being ignored by the culture at large but is highly relevant. The stuff nobody sees yet, just because people haven&#39;t been exposed to that information yet. Those people need to be reached. </p>

<p>All you can do is you, if you get exhausted trying to help that&#39;s okay. But it is something that if enough people put enough effort in to changing the values of culture, it will happen. That&#39;s how cultural changes <em>always</em> happen. You can participate and shape culture gradually, but it is a gargantuan task and you are but one person, so you must pace yourself. It&#39;s a 10,000 mile marathon, but the wise know it needs running despite how daunting it is. A day at a time, a message at a time, a sentence at a time. That&#39;s all you can do, the rest is out of your hands, literally. Sorry for rambling myself, my post ended up being far longer than yours even haha</p>

<p>Edit: you said &quot;increased eyeballs&quot; or something to that effect to explain how this scheme works and then you said the news item gets ignored by being relegated to this sub. Those are mutually exclusive. Again, I have to ask how this scheme is supposed to work.</p>

<p>No one has ever, ever, made a hologram</p>

<p>You think there were planes flying as a misdirection, then the news, while live, did CGI on to several angles of cameras simultaneously? In 2001? Seriously? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>First off I wanted to say that I <strong>don&#39;t</strong> have a steadfast opinion either way.</p>

<p>BUT, I&#39;m NOT going to use &quot;No one has ever&quot; and &quot;This is difficult&quot; as a valid excuse as to why it <strong>couldn&#39;t</strong> have happened.</p>

<p>Are you to suggest that black technology doesn&#39;t far surpass what you or I think or thought was possible?</p>

<p>Maybe it did happen.  On the date of September 11th 2001.</p>

<p>Compositing is probably the easier problem compared to holograms.  Both very well might be sufficiently advanced, perhaps bordering magic compared to what is released to the public.</p>

<p>A plane hitting a building, regardless of speed, would never penetrate a structure made of steel and concrete the way the 2nd plane on 9/11 supposedly did. </p>

<p>These planes can suffer serious damage if they even hit a bird in the sky, that is how fragile they are made and they have to be made that fragile because that is the only way for them to fly.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s two video of plane crashes. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZjhxuhTmGk">this one</a> a jet is traveling at 500 mph into a concrete wall and you can see the results. In <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=5fc_1465591113">this one</a> a plane falls onto of a car and smashes into a million pieces.</p>

<p>Now compare that with the video of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2sOEkms64">2nd plane on 9/11</a>. </p>
