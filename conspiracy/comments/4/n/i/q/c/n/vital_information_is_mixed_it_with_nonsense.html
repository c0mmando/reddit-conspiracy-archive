       This strategy, employed more and more by the powerful as the years pass, will be the downfall of the mainstream internet as an enlightening communication device. The only safety from this is through obscurity, by going to obscure websites where there are no paid trolls fucking up the information stream.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the "controversial" news is no longer available on
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       but is instead maligned to this subreddit. If it's on
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       or
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       or whatever, you can almost guarantee it's also on CNN and MSNBC. Reddit is MSM, and they now march in lockstep in sharp contrast to the reddit of 5+ years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       So with all the "edgy" news pushed to subreddits like this, with a label like "conspiracy", it acts as a polarizing force to the readers of reddit. It gives the implicit idea you have to be a "conspiracy theorist" to even read this sub, just by the wording alone. Even though it often contains very important and valid news stories that aren't touched by the MSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an experiment, let's pretend you are the head of the US government's military's PR division, and you notice that there's a big collection of very accurate and damning news stories collecting in one place on the internet. They can't outright ban the sub without making a backdoor deal with reddit's owners, advance publishing, and that is very risky from a PR perspective if exposed and could also be expensive. Instead of doing that, they can just dilute the existing information that is so damning. They can dilute it not only with lesser unimportant news, but also with incorrect nonsense. The tighter they can pair the damning news with the nonsense news, the more they can get people to dismiss the damning news. They can intertwine it on the sub's frontpage posts, or within posts or comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm talking about this in the abstract, but here's an example. Imagine a self-post on this subreddit reading:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        "9/11 was an inside job, and it's clear the Saudis and Bushes cooperated to bring down the twin towers and building 7 with mini-nukes. They also faked the planes using hologram technology they got from aliens, they weren't real planes."
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Analyzing this, there is a mention of building 7, and a mention of the fact it was an inside job, even mentioning the Bushes. This is compelling, and grabs one's attention. However, it is paired with the other nonsense that is obviously wrong, so it leads the reader to believe that "believing the bushes and saudis did it" is on par with believing the government has alien technology to make holographic airplanes appear. So they will reject that belief because it is paired with the crazy belief. They don't want to be "one of those people who believes in those sorts of things."
      </p>
      <p>
       And furthermore, if you hold some of those non-crazy beliefs yourself, you start to feel as though
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       may be crazy. I don't believe the government has alien technology or that mini-nukes make any sense to explain what happened, but this post apparently combines them, which makes me think to myself "Is this how I appear to other people?" and you may be afraid to say something in the future because the person you're talking to might associate your claims with these other much wilder claims. Or even worse, you may start actually believing in holographic planes, and begin doing their work for them by spreading these idiotic beliefs mixed right along in with the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you were someone powerful and you and your organization had secrets, and the secrets were getting out, wouldn't you pay a couple college students to troll message boards for you to convince 90% of people it's BS, and make the other 10% look crazy? There are even companies you can hire that will do it for you, you just simply pay them and give them a general script, and they hire the college students for you. It's an entire industry. It's like renting a mercenary army of trolls to divert the information stream, for profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now realize it's not only the military's PR, but the government, many corporations, and many other initiative-based organizations.  Not only in our country as well, but the governments and corporations all around the world! This is why reddit has become so bizarre over the last few years, especially subreddits like this one. Hundreds of competing interests, trying to bend the information stream in their own ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want to look at the end game of this, go to Tavistock (aka GLP) and look at the posts. That whole forum is dripping with this strategy, to associate the bizarrely true with the truly bizarre, muddying the waters until no one can have a rational conversation over all the information manipulation. No one knows what is true and what isn't, so they fall back on simplistic ideas like racism. This plays right in to the hands of the powerful, racism is a perfect distraction from what they are doing. People start buying in to the nonsense and preaching it themselves. You want real-life CIA brainwashing, well here it is, a whole forum of it to look at every day. This is what they want
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       to look like, and more and more I see them accomplishing their goals. It also drives out the people who can't tolerate it, so we lose many rational users that made this community great. It slowly erodes the good people and good posts, and replaces them with for-hire verbal garbage as the years drag on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of you already know all this, but many of you don't know, or haven't heard the full story. This is a very real problem, and the more aware we are of it, the more we can be fully aware of what is happening. Sometimes I think people walk away from reddit thinking "Man, humanity is insane" without fully understanding how manipulated reddit actually is, and how much intentional nonsense is put online to destroy clarity in communication among the masses. Important stuff is getting lost in the noise. People think the noise is real. It's just a distraction though, and it's time people stop thinking online communication is organic, and realize that this shit is absolutely gamed to hell by people with money. Our individual critical thinking is our only defense. To develop that skill, we must have posts like this that call out reality for what it truly is, even if just as a reminder.

       The mods have stickied this post by
       <a href="/u/magnora7">
        /u/magnora7
       </a>
       because it makes important points about critical thinking and objectively analysing the information you see on this subreddit (and indeed any other). It's a good post, and we believe it is a subject worthy of discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, a stickied post  is not an "official endorsement" by this sub, and the OP's subtle framing of the narrative of 9/11 into acceptable and "crazy" (sic) theories is unfortunate, and should be parsed using the critical thinking techniques that the OP himself has suggested.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be clear,
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       does not officially endorse (or deny) any specific narrative of the events of 9/11 - or any other putative conspiracy event. Individual subscribers are expected to make up their own minds.

       Your comment seems fair enough as it is, but I don't see why the regular voting process isn't sufficient enough for it like everyone else's.  Do mods comments really need such prominent placement above everyone else's comments?

       Along with a mere...99.9% of the rest of us on this subreddit? You, however, have a record of pushing a specific narrative (which the OP also appears to be pushing) which seems designed to shut down certain avenues of dicussion. Nobody has all the answers, and the people who argue that theirs is the "official" conspiracy theory of 9/11 and everybody else's ideas are "crazy" tend to make me suspicious. Sorry.

       Investigative Journalism.  Dealing with Facts.  Who Benefited.  What kind of evidence would stand up in a court of law.  There's basic parameters to what constitutes quality investigative practices.  Then there's wild speculation with no proof, misinformation, disinformation, and misdirection.  I think we are smart enough to tell the difference.  Magnora made a good post here.  We don't need admins like you taking an authoritative role in the discussion process by sticking their point of view above everyone else's.

       Your judgments as to what constitute "wild speculation, absent proof" do not entitle you to shut down avenues of discussion with which you disagree; that is the point sabre is making.

       Amen bro.  I'm just glad that your post got stickied because it is right on and what people should and need to know.  So that has me feeling optimistic.  But the fact that "admins" have to sticky their points of view on top of a comment thread seems top down in nature to me and against the spirit of reddit in general.  Also the fact that my comment is hidden seems strange to me and makes me pessimistic about the dynamics of the conspiracy subreddit and its leadership.
      </p>
      <p>
       They kicked me off the mod team after I stuck up for the people's voices and after I was voted in by the users themselves.  They want to control it and look at the users as the opposition rather than as people they are lucky enough to represent.  Just like our government in their mentality towards the population.  Sad and evident from what I could tell.

       Yes, I think there is a lot of infighting going on with the mod team here on this subreddit, as your expulsion is further evidence of. It only takes 3 mods to get something stickied, so I'm guessing that happened and then some of the other mods who are in to the no-planes or mini-nukes went in to damage control mode and stickied that comment in response, since (I'm guessing) they were unable to un-sticky the main post without causing a big stir.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's overall a good sign, but it seems clear there's a lot of disagreement about this issue among the mods. That's fine, as long as there's some sort of balance. But I'm guessing, like the rest of reddit, the mod team on thie subreddit is slowly being taken over by corruption

       Well, that's news to me. I missed the mod vote to sticky your post, but noticed your post was employing a technique it was purporting to condemn. Suggesting that any deviation from your limited hangout 9/11 narrative is "obviously wrong" is manipulative and deceitful.

       Then you don't understand what a conflict of interest is. You should have declared you had a financial incentive (to push traffic to that website) when accepting the mod position, so that others could monitor whether your moderation was impartial - which it clearly wasn't.

       Your unwillingness to address the actual points of discussion at hand are a clear indication that you have a vested interest in driving a narrative; that type of behavior, veiling one's personal interests while attempting to present reddit as an organically curated space, threatens this website more so than anything done by the admins and corrupt default mods whom carry out orders at the behest of the owners of this god forsaken place.

       Can the mods put together a wiki or a few pages devoted to the most current working hypotheses on various events? I know it's a lot of work, but I'm relatively new to this community, and I've had a hell of a time trying to play catch-up on topics like 9/11, where the disinformation was mixed with good info for over a decade. As old ideas are reformed to accommodate new evidence, we could all benefit from an effort to make up-to-date models of events.

       The problem is people use the internet like they use television…that is, they sit…stare and absorb. Unfortunately "truth" is not something that can be given to you…you have to go find it.

       Thank you. What really bugs me is when people become emotionally attached to their opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever notice how people use "believe" and "think" as if they are interchangeable synonyms?
      </p>
      <p>
       Once someone "believes" something to be true it is very difficult to change the view…a "thought" on the other hand can be altered or completely changed as new info becomes available.

       We are a society of "believers" when we should be a society of "thinkers"

       I really like this "I believe" vs "I think" thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       It reminds me a lot of "I need" vs "I want", people often use one when they should mean the other, and it ever so subtly warps your worldview and also warps how the world responds to your request.

       That's an astute observation. I think we all cling too tightly to our ideologies. I think the over-reliance on ideologies is one of the worst aspects of American culture. It's a way to "outsource" one's thinking, to reduce effort.  Let the ideology and the other people who believe it do the thinking for you. Like a virus that overtakes the host, in a way.

       Truth will always exist in a clean slate, when you approach the world as a system whose truth is self-evident, than you are free to all the knowledge that a man can know.  But if you approach it with a model that must verify what you think is true, then you are going to run into points of discrepancy that require a vast complex story to explain.  The truth is self-evident, and usually the things shouted the loudest are hardly ever true, or they wouldn't need shouted in the first place.

       Ignorance is of a peculiar nature; once dispelled, it is impossible to 
re-establish it. It is not originally a thing of itself, but is only the 
absence of knowledge; and though man may be kept ignorant, he cannot be made 
ignorant. It has never yet been discovered how to make a man unknow his 
knowledge.

       You can do that too, of course, but these people never allow themselves to be proven wrong. You can debate them for the benefit of other readers though, but be forewarned you will never win any debate with them, they will always move the goalposts to keep you going. And honestly a lot of times it only provides more forum space for them to espouse false ideas. If people think the truth lies between what you're saying and what they're saying, then they will still believe in tons of disinfo. It's best to just ignore disinfo when you see it, or just call it out as disinfo, rather than debate it. Especially if it's a worn-out disinfo topic like flat earth or hollow earth, there's really no use in debating it. That's my 2 cents after 8 years of using reddit and dealing with these people.

       It’s not about them. It’s about everyone else. A paid shill will never give up, but people reading the conversation will see it copy and paste, repeat itself, and ignore citations and disproofs when given them.

       I get it, but for example here there's a guy who replied to my OP, who has been voted to the top of the comments:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The real tl;dr: Alternative 9/11 theories are "crazy", "nonsense", "idiotic beliefs"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       and I want to reply "That's not what I said, I said that the mini-nuke and holographic planes theories are nonsense."
      </p>
      <p>
       but I can guarantee you we would get in to a multi-comment thread about the details of mini-nuke 9/11 theory, and if I continue to engage, it would make up most of the comments on this thread. This distracts from the topic at hand that I'm actually trying to talk about, and keeps other people from commenting because they look at the thread and it looks derailed, and derailed by nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       For this reason I feel ignoring is better than arguing. Arguing just gives them acknowledgement they don't deserve, and gives them the space and opportunity to fill the comments with derailing content. They often try to get the last word, so you can argue back for ages and it never ends. It just seems a bit fruitless, and actually perhaps destructive toward trying to stay on topic and have good discussions.

       Well done on getting this stickied, it's a highly important point to make!  The 9/11 Truth Movement is being held back by all of the disinfo which goes around, when all we need to do is keep pointing out that WTC7 was a controlled demo, that's all that's needed to win.

       Is this really fair? I agree with you that we can't have absurd notions mixed with plausible conjecture, as this is a classic State/corp sponsored shill tactic of "muddying the waters". But you are saying that you are correct and another is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it's difficult to objectively categorize what should be a topic open for discussion vs. what should be rejected outright (aside from some bright lines like aliens, Elvis or Prescott Bush clones, etc.). For instance I think believing in holographic planes is wayward thinking, yet I have not arrived at a final conclusion regarding the exclusive use of thermite/thermate/nano-thermite and no use of nuclear energy whatsoever (there are just too many unanswered questions to me). However, as much as I'd like a spirited debate on the topic, it seems that this sub is intolerant to it's mention. If I bring it up, I'm either treated like a moron, or suspected as a shill (linked to Khalezov and all opinions about him, etc., etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
       Our suspicion about any position held should grow proportionately with the level of consensus/approval of that position. Not because the position may be a "false theory" that was planted by those who want to muddy the waters, but because when you have a "certainty" held by "a majority",
       <em>
        there is a good chance that a fair amount of confirmation bias got you there.
       </em>

       You realize you are associating people who hold unpopular beliefs with the trait of lousy debate etiquette. That's just shitty. It may be true in some cases, but you are making those who have the "wrong" positions sound like jerks across the board.

[Plus, if I haven't said it someplace else in this thread, your message in the OP is noble

       But I just think we need to be careful in our evaluation of what's ok to discuss, and what's "off the table". It's like your comment on ideology elsewhere in this thread. I believe we need to be wary of clinging only to "acceptable" positions...otherwise, I think, we throw out the baby along with the bathwater.

       Thanks for your comment. It is a delicate balance, and I can't claim to know all the answers. It is good to be open minded, but be careful not to be so open minded that your brain falls out! Only trust things if they truly make sense to you, even if I have said it. No one has any monopoly on truth, and it's up to us to use our sense of reason to piece everything together using the evidence that is available.

       There are three kinds of "shills": Paid shills, ideological shills, and those that are both paid and ideological zealots (see any Israel-related thread in WorldNews for examples).
      </p>
      <p>
       The ideologs are far more dedicated and pernicious than simple hired goons.

       They thing is, it hardly matters. These people are paid. No matter how many times their posts are shown to be nonsense, it doesn't matter. They just show up tomorrow and post nonsense again. Cause that's what they're paid to do. And do it again and again. Till we get tired of pointing out their lies.

       Good observation, these super-far-out beliefs often go together in people. That's very true.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think though, in addition to disinfo agents, there are real people who get addicted to what they perceive as "hidden info", and they start to believe anything they hear that goes against conventional wisdom, believing they're seeing the true reality everyone else is too stubborn to see, but in reality are just getting super confused by unprovable nonsense. The disinfo companies uses these "hidden info" addicts to fill their heads with garbage that they pass around to others. It's like free advertising. So not only does the information stream get corrupted by nonsense, but some of the
       <em>
        people
       </em>
       reading the information stream get corrupted by nonsense too, and regurgitate that back in to the community, believing it to be true. These people are just as dangerous as the disinfo people if not more, because they honestly believe the disinfo as gospel truth and will promote it as such. But they're not paid commenters, they're just regular people addicted to what appears to them to be hidden info. So it's not all paid commenters pushing untrue things, and it's important to keep that in mind.

       It would be cool if it were stickied, I'd appreciate that. But if not, we can also just repost this information again and again as time passes to ensure everyone sees it, that way we don't have to depend on mods or worry about when it gets un-stickied or anything. Just gotta keep passing the information around and reminding each other of what is true.

       I have a better theory: There's no shortage of people who believe ridiculous ideas and you don't have to pay them to post them online or bring them up at dinner or in the break room or an hour in to a conversation just when you thought they were kind of all right and you don't really mind going to your girlfriend's cousin's house once in a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also you said it was for profit. What profit? Is there money in making a post on an internet forum about how the moon landing was fake? If so, are there not a gajillion ~better and more reliable~ ways to make money? Selling plasma, gambling, prostitution, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately I think you just have it backwards. You payed Comcast or Charter or AT&amp;T a monthly fee so that you have an audience to read your lengthy screed. See how unnecessary your theory is? You're the one footing the bill and I bet no one even had to ask.

       If a big scandal breaks out, they relegate the news to a sub like this, then associate it with crazy. Then most people don't think it's a real story and it gets ignored. Profit/power retention

       But i still don't get what that has to do with advertising or how that makes money. There has to be some sort of mechanism by which associating certain news items with "crazy" results in increased ad revenue. What is that mechanism? You talked about "military pr" in your op. What is it that they sell on Reddit by making conspiracy theorists look crazy?
      </p>
      <p>
       How is it supposed to work?

      <p>
       Edit: you said "increased eyeballs" or something to that effect to explain how this scheme works and then you said the news item gets ignored by being relegated to this sub. Those are mutually exclusive. Again, I have to ask how this scheme is supposed to work.

       It's PR. It's messaging control. Having a better message makes people like them more, so more people join the army or buy their product, instead of learning for example about how Afghanistan is occupied primarily for the harvest of poppyseeds for the international drug trade.

       Ok could you please be more specific? Like who is "them"? Big corporations? The US government? Because you seem to be talking about both interchangeably. And I get that maybe that's how you think of them but the fact is that selling military service is not quite like selling dish soap. You still have to explain WHO is employing these supposed agents. You could do that by maybe producing a recruitment ad or letter. Not just for astroturf, but for this "posting crazy theories" jobs. If these people exist, theres bound to be some of those floating around. Maybe there's one or two people who have done the job who don't mind talking about it. Produce their testimony as evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im really trying hard to help lead you towards being more specific and providing evidence but you're making it really hard dude. Everything you're saying is extremely vague and ~sounds~ speculative. But I'm still giving you the benefit of the doubt that you're sitting on some actual evidence. You're gonna need to start providing actual evidence soon, which you didn't do at all in the op but you've been talking a lot about critical thinking in the comments. Evidence will be a crucial part of that. What you have is a hypothesis. Youre making very broad claims and producing no evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to be taken seriously outside of a post on a conspiracy sub, what you might do is find a specific example of someone who is definitely a shill. Like something you can prove and show who they were working for. Was it the DoD? Was it Glaxo Smith Kline? Theres gotta be something hard. Otherwise it kind of does seem like you're just saying this is all true without actually knowing one way or the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've been nice and engaged with me in a civil way. People here are ~really~ into what you are saying but I think it's a disservice if you don't provide actual stuff to backup your claims. You have to be a LOT more specific. Like "this reddit user posted this and this, then this person accused them of being a shill. We looked into it and produced documents proving they work for American airlines". That's a silly example but you see what I mean. It kind of sounds like you're just sort of making stuff up because it ~sounds~ true and it fits your worldview. If you actually want to be critical, you have to be doubly critical of your own hypothesis.

       What's provable is that Reddit is being used as a propaganda and advertisement tool. (Google "buying reddit upvotes").
      </p>
      <p>
       The demographic of people interested in this is very widespread, so singling them out would not make them appear as the sole culprit, ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes you can catch a glimpse at what's going on behind the scenes, with mods of big subreddits going on power trips without being stopped by their fellow mods for no discernible reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a market for selling reputable reddit accounts in various subreddits.
      </p>
      <p>
       In some ways a government is similar to a company: It needs to keep its workers in line ("prevent anarchy", riots etc.) while minimizing expenses and it also needs to keep a good reputation to be able to work well (nobody will trust a government that is thought to be corrupt or insincere).
      </p>
      <p>
       All these can be achieved by attention control, which is what this kind of thing really is.
      </p>
      <p>
       These actors are out there (since there's clearly a demand for these services, as proven by the existence of reddit account selling for the purpose of posing as a reputable user to spread misinformation or direct attention and upvote selling).
      </p>
      <p>
       What's unclear is who is paying them; anyone can likely do so fairly anonymously, so that's where the trail ends. You can accuse those with a plausible motive, but it'll only ever stay a suspicion, and if there are enough other actors to occupy your attention you'll never get anywhere.

       The simplest explanation is still the most plausible one. People have wacky ideas. Some of them are wackier than yours, but yours are probably wackier than someone else's. And they naturally congregate on conspiracy sites to post stuff because that's what those sites are
       <em>
        for
       </em>
       . Saying there's a conspiracy behind people who post implausible ideas is actually so implausible that it
       <em>
        discredits OP for even posting it because it makes him look like he's trying to discredit more plausible theories
       </em>
       .
      </p>

       Very meta. OP was right all along, but he was also the shill that he was warning us about. He just did his job too well.

       But see what I mean about not having to pay people? You and OP are both posting implausible theories with nothing to back it up but are acting as if it's already proven beyond doubt. I hate to break it to you, but by your own logic you're a shill. At least you have a fat paycheck coming :)

       164 comments. I don't know who the "paid shill's" are or who the "truth seekers" are. OP very well could be a shill, but, like it says in the post, everyone is responsible for their own critical thinking. This post has 164 comments of, I'm sure, a mix of the two, and most have failed miserably at critical thinking.

       Honestly, I
       <em>
        expect

       this sub to be full of disinfo. I also expect to have to do my own research and critical thinking. I'm not worried about this sub, I'm worried about Facebook, Google, and Twitter and the general population that thinks the idea of people purposefully subverting meaningful information that goes against the status quo is nothing but fodder for the tinfoil hat crowd. I know the internet is 90% bullshit - not everyone does. That's the scary part.

       The nonsense is that this sub has become /politics and has little to do with actual conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is now run by people who don't like hillary and use this sub as a soundboard for their hate of her.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have other subs for that. Hey, I can't stand her (like her better than trump though) but seriously? I come here to avoid the politics and would like to see more actual conspiracies discussed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mods have abandoned this sub in favor of making it all about politics. Damned shame. But here is the real rub in it all:
      </p>
      <p>
       Folks will tell you it doesn't matter if it is hillary or trump, they will talk about the government in a broader sense, which I am all for. But that has been tossed aside in favor of whining about one particular candidate some folks don't like.

       LOL. Look at the front page of conspiracy, all made up BS about clinton. There is a thread about a tweet she sent out. Sheesh, really? That is a conspiracy???

       Just admit it. Some people hate her and will believe anything about her and it all somehow is some grand conspiracy. Or....it is just people pimping their politics.

       So where are the fun conspiracies? You guys are taking all of the fun out of conspiracy theories and watering it down to "facts" and "objectivity" when that stuff doesn't exist. Show me a part of Reddit where I can express my conspiracies freely without being censored by these ridiculous moderators. I want to go back and forth with 9/11 truthers, not people complaining about 9/11 truthers! I was expecting fun and fear from this part of Reddit, but now I can see it's just one of those lame subs with rules.

       Relevant: 
The guy blocking the door was also interviewed.  If you listen to interview he starts talking about blocking door at the 3:15 mark.
Copypasta from an askreddit thread:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        one guy in a live stream interview on TV with the news station said that he and several others went out an exit door into the alleyway and then turned around and barricaded the door so that it couldn't be opened. he then went on to say that he kept hearing banging noises on the door and he can "only hope that it wasn't people trying to get out." Uh, yeah, it was probably people running from the shooter and trying to go out the EXIT DOOR only to not be able to get out and have to turn around to meet their fate - death.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I understand that in a panic situation things like this happen, but if he ran into an alleyway, why block the door and trap the people inside? Why not just keep running ?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Edit for additional info:
       </strong>
       Those of you talking about there being a fence in the back, yes, there was a fence around the alley, but the guy clearly said that after they barricaded the door, they eventually
       <em>
        "crawled through a hole in the fence."
       </em>
       So he could have easily
       <strong>
        NOT
       </strong>
       barricaded the door.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        My wife located the full interview where he says all of this, here:
       </strong>
       <a href="http://kstp.com/news/florida-nightclub-shooting-eyewitness/4166140/">
        http://kstp.com/news/florida-nightclub-shooting-eyewitness/4166140/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        I TRANSCRIBED IT
       </strong>
       :  When we got a ten second break [from gunshot sounds, probably during reloading?] we went through this alleyway which led for only employees and me and this random guy tried blocking the door, cause at that point like I said the bullets were getting louder and closer so we blocked this door, and we did hear banging, and I pray it wasn’t anyone trying to escape, because I would forever feel guilty.  but at that point there was about 20 people infront of us crammed in this little alleyway, with a big hole in one of the fences, and just trying to topple over, just trying to escape, just trying to run.”

       I appreciated your post and fully support what you are trying to convey, but am also feeling both mentally and physically exhausted today (especially with recent news on the mass shooting)... On that note, do any of you ever get tired or even frustrated in this attempt at filtering the nonsense and trying to make a conclusion from the facts? Most of the time, I become confused on creating these self  observations of something that only I (or very few) can comprehend. Are we actually helping our cause for truth by operating within MSM? Sorry for the rambling....

       Thanks for the appreciation. Oh of course, I absolutely get tired and frustrated from it and have to take a break. Can absolutely empathize there. It can be difficult to cope. I even wrote a whole post about it a while ago that resonated with a lot of people, here is a link in case you may be interested:

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's not about operating inside or outside MSM, do whichever you fancy. But the point is reaching the most people with the most vital pieces of information, the information that is being ignored by the culture at large but is highly relevant. The stuff nobody sees yet, just because people haven't been exposed to that information yet. Those people need to be reached.
      </p>
      <p>
       All you can do is you, if you get exhausted trying to help that's okay. But it is something that if enough people put enough effort in to changing the values of culture, it will happen. That's how cultural changes
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       happen. You can participate and shape culture gradually, but it is a gargantuan task and you are but one person, so you must pace yourself. It's a 10,000 mile marathon, but the wise know it needs running despite how daunting it is. A day at a time, a message at a time, a sentence at a time. That's all you can do, the rest is out of your hands, literally. Sorry for rambling myself, my post ended up being far longer than yours even haha

       In 2013 they "updated" the act under the guise of being able to offer radio shows for download domestically that were otherwise only available internationally and all sorts of other bullshit that were good ways to cover a turd in frosting and make us believe we wanted to eat it.  It's unbelievable in any way,
       <strong>
        in any way
       </strong>
       , that we allow propaganda.  There is simply no place for that in a democratic nation.  ZERO.  Not a "we have to tolerate this", that's simply bullshit that literally is intended to
       <em>
        sway
       </em>
       a democracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       What the fuck are we doing.  Get a petition going to sign this shit, or get off the fucking internet as it deals with the government.  A free press simply cannot exist alongside a propaganda press.  How people aren't demanding change on the repeal of the NDAA and it's allowance of propaganda is unbelievable, until you look at some of the other examples where nations used propaganda... so I guess, welcome to what we allowed.  This is our own fault.

        wouldn't you pay a couple college students to troll message boards for you to convince 90% of people it's BS, and make the other 10% look crazy?

       I don't disagree with you, I just have a hard time believing that the disinfo agents are Doug and Phil in their dorms, and not people closely associated with the CIA/FBI itself.

       Good on you. I feel like I spend too much time doing that sometimes, so instead I decided to make this meta-post about awareness of the fact that it's happening. I think others should do the same when they can, even if just in comments. Hell you could just copy-paste what I posted in the original post in threads where you're concerned, just unmask their game for everyone to see, over and over. Ignorance about this topic would quickly vanish.

      <p>
       Secondly, you just brought up a second reason why there were no planes. United Flight 175 (the 2nd plane) is estimated to have been traveling between 500 and 600 mph as it was approaching the towers, but a Boeing 767 cannot possibly travel that fast at such low altitudes.

       A proper argument uses good sources. Its a logical fallacy to call him a noob when he is correct in saying the burden of proof is on you. I'm geniuenly curious to the video you speak of. But come on, this isn't constructive discussion.

       This is more noob logic. Real conspiracy theorists know that sources are controlled and tainted. Nothing has inherent legitimacy in the world, which is why I do not refer to an expert for this argument.

      <p>
       If you do not know the laws of physics, here I will help you out. This is the important one in this case:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        When one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is why it is irrelevant how much velocity or momentum the plane had because regardless the weaker aluminum tube will crumble before the stronger steel and concrete since they are by physical necessity subject to the same amount of force in a collision.

       Airplanes would not only be unreliable to do hit a large skyscraper so perfectly on target as those planes supposedly did, but they damage they would inflict on the building wouldn't be anything like what those videos show.

       But if they wanted to create the image of a plane hitting a building, why wouldn't they just use a real plane?

       A plane hitting a building, regardless of speed, would never penetrate a structure made of steel and concrete the way the 2nd plane on 9/11 supposedly did.
      </p>
      <p>
       These planes can suffer serious damage if they even hit a bird in the sky, that is how fragile they are made and they have to be made that fragile because that is the only way for them to fly.

       a jet is traveling at 500 mph into a concrete wall and you can see the results. In

       Why does that matter? The planes exploded in to the buildings, then the buildings exploded and fell. The planes didn't

       to penetrate the building.

       again. In no way did the plane "explode into the building" in the video the plane clearly passes right through the steel columns and concrete structures with ease and explodes after the entire plane had entered the building.

       So it hit the glass and went between some beams. The whole building wasn't solid steel, just the framework
      </p>
      <p>
       But instead, you seriously think it's futuristic technology no one has ever seen? Have you ever heard of occams razor?  Again, why would they use holograms when they can use real planes? You still haven't answered that key question.

       Well, first of all not many people claim to have seen the first crash and why would they?
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, not many people would have seen the second crash given the trajectory of the 2nd plane, and I have seen many people come on this sub and say they saw the plane, but that is where it ends. They will not recount the memory or open it up to critical analysis because if they were to do so they would find their memory is a hazy vague patchwork of impressions and subject to much doubt as to whether they really saw a plane.

       I never advocated they used real life holograms. I don't think they used holograms. I think they used a special effect on television and that is probably it, though I am still considering the possibility they had other lower flying planes in the area around that time.

       So you think it was all TV effects, and NOTHING happened in real life until those buildings just randomly exploded, and all eyewitnesses are lying/mistaken that they saw a plane? That's so needlessly complicated, and doesn't explain anything that isn't explained by a much simpler theory.

       Occam's razor doesn't discount the laws of physics and in fact when the laws of physics and the reality of plane crashes are taken into account the "planer" theory becomes extremely complicated because somehow these four planes did things that planes and pilots would under normal conditions not be able to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, even by occam's razor the "no plane" theory wins.

       Hi, new person here. The reason they used holograms is because the whole scenario was a ritual, and needed to be timed correctly, and needed to have a 100% success rate. As for the people who claim they saw a plane, they act like bad actors. Then there's the 50% of people who say they did not see a plane, and are sincere in their behavior and interviews.

       It's true. I think there need to be a statement. This subreddit is full of disinformants. Also misinformation. I totally agree with OP.

      <p>
       These troll agents are very good at what they are doing. The satanic cryptoglobalists are also very persistent.

       Some might think I'm misinformed myself. Sometimes it is a tricky situation. It's like an uncharted territory. People calling loon on each other.

      <p>
       But how else can you explain the elitist cabal other than
       <strong>
        SATANISTs
       </strong>
       ? How do you explain why they are the way they are, and why they do what they are doing? People will always fall for the racial propaganda.

       I find it very hard to believe every video we've seen from all the different angles and people were somehow shopped with CGI planes...I need some compelling evidence to believe that, because it's far fetched. More plausible IMO is that the planes were real and potentially hijacked through the flight termination system rather than terrorists with boxcutters. What's with all these "mysterious" plane disappearances and crashes in recent history? Something is afoot and it's not CGI. We can agree to disagree though.

       You are the one making the claim that technology exists to make planes holographically appear in thin air in front of millions of people. That technology does not exist. Burden of proof is on you, because you're the one making claims against every bit of evidence and proof that exists.

       I'm not making claims about holographic planes. I'm saying people will create realities where they validate what was fed to them by the media. A friend saw some crazy footage changes to Oh my friend's friend was there and saw the planes crash, turns in to my friend was there and nearly got hit by a falling body.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only evidence to support the planes being the ones to make the impact are news reports and an incorrect model type engine being found (again reported through msm).
      </p>
      <p>
       You're the one shitting in the well trying to conflate no planes with alien holographic tech. I think you're doing it intentionally too.

       You are mate, not me. Your post is narrow minded and littered with elitism. What the fuck makes you think you know the answers and what is the truth and what isn't, and who are you to tell others not to look into theories? People should be free to discuss any theory without someone (like yourself) saying that it's wrong.

       If nothing else, we should all feel a sense of pride that we are critical enough in our thinking that we understand the news is paid for. That's why we actually get very few shills on r/conspiracy these days, because the investment has no return; we will never be convinced by a shill or a bot.

       Yes.  I wanted his opinion, because I do think that was the one thing off with regards to hist post.  Other than that, the message was good.  Another poster pointed out it would have been better to use an abstract example.  I concur with that sentiment.

       Yea...about that.  It's really easy to use physics to explain how a hologram can be coordinated with a real explosion, as a misdirection tactic.

      <p>
       Try (think) harder, next time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again I'm not saying this is what happened, I don't have a solid opinion either way.  But that there is good evidence for and little evidence against, if you look at the footage, interviews, etc.

       If you want to contribute anything useful to this discussion,

       This one uses water as the screen, but if you havent seen it give it a watch:

      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps there is black technology to use either air, or finer particulate (say the smog of a city) or maybe there is technology which doesn't need a screen at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or finally, the collisions may have all been CGI, no need for a hologram.  Maybe planes flying nearby as misdirection.  In this case, the CGI is coordinated on multiple footage using the initial flash you see when the nose first touches the building.

       As if it's realistic for this type of entry flash to happen if that's a real plane.  Why isn't it blocked by the nose/body of the airplane?  And worse, why is it offset from where it seems the nose would enter?  I'd very much appreciate u/bumblebritches57 and u/magnora7 answers to these two questions, if they don't mind, since I stumble on trying to provide an answer, which is why I even bother to bring it up.  Thanks in advance.

         No one has ever, ever, made a hologram that is bright and big enough to appear as a plane in the day sky. Hologram technology is not that advanced, it has to be nighttime and the smoke/vapor has to be pretty thick.

       have a steadfast opinion either way.
      </p>

       BUT, I'm NOT going to use "No one has ever" and "This is difficult" as a valid excuse as to why it
       <strong>
        couldn't
       </strong>
       have happened.

      <p>
       Are you to suggest that black technology doesn't far surpass what you or I think or thought was possible?

      <p>
       Maybe it did happen.  On the date of September 11th 2001.

       Compositing is probably the easier problem compared to holograms.  Both very well might be sufficiently advanced, perhaps bordering magic compared to what is released to the public.

       The name of the component is HPT Stage1 Cooling Duct Assembly. There is a history behind this assembly as I began to read more. This component was part of the early JT9D-7 series engines that were used in development of Boeing's 747 line of aircraft. The "7" series engines have gone through many revisions but are exclusively used on 747's. Many years later, P&amp;W decided to work with NASA in the development in a new technology to improve engine performance and reliability. This improvement was made specifically to this section of engine. Tangential On-Board Injection (TOBI or "R" for Radial) was the newest improvement to reduce nozzle temperatures by over 2% which could open the door for a more powerful engines based on the "7" series engine. The new model of engine would be called 7R4+Revision Letter. The 7R4D engine is the one that is specified for United Airlines Boeing 767's.
      </p>

       The engine found at Church and Murray didn't seem to be a 7R4D.....it seemed to be a 7J. The only way to confirm this is to search for the engine and take a look at the diffuser casing to verify a match. This was another needle in a haystack but I found it......a photo of a stripped down 747 engine at an outdoor museum. The diffuser casing is a perfect match!

       "We have two data points indicating that the Murray Street engine is a Pratt and Whitney JT9D-7 series engine: the HPT Stage 1 Cooling Duct Assembly which the manufacturer indicates is for use only with the 7 series engine, and we have the diffuser casing of the Murray Street engine matching perfectly the diffuser casing of a 747 engine --for which model of Boeing aircraft Weezula says the JT9D-7 series engine was exclusively used."
      </p>

      <p>
       All data so far seem to indicate that the Murray Street engine is not a JT9D-7R4D engine, as would have been on Flight 175. (And the Murray Street engine certainly is not a GE CF6 engine from Flight 11.)

       I'm familiar with some of the abberations in the official story, specifically the potentially strange engine found on the street.

        </a>
       </li>

      <p>
       which, taken together, almost completely describe the events of 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       explains the impossible plane physics, the ridiculous aluminum penetrating steel box beams and popping out the other side with the nose
       <em>
        intact
       </em>
       , the lack of wreckage falling to the street (aside from a few planted, mismatched pieces), the hilariously bad crisis actors..
      </p>
      <p>
       explains the earthquake just prior to collapse, the buildings turning to fluffy clouds of microscopic dust, the 100m craters under each building, the molten iron and rock for 3 months, the power source, the radiogenic cancer in 9/11 first responders and new yorkers, even the reason they wanted to blow the bridges -- that last one is very disturbing.
      </p>
      <p>
       we know what happened.

      <p>
       this. can. not. stand.

       so you gotta rip it down, gotta discredit it, by whatever means necessary.

      <p>
       interesting that you're using the age-old discredit technique of simply calling them 'crazy', 'insane', and conflating them with 'holograms' and 'space aliens' -- poisoning the well, a discredit technique that you yourself elucidate.

       You've nailed it. An anti-disinfo post that itself is disinfo. I'm not sure the OP meant it to be, but the flurry of mods and sticky have convinced me that they are eager to reinforce the 'mini-nukes and no planes is crazy' argument.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Also nice coincidence that I, myself, just discovered that link yesterday and it's, BY FAR, the most comprehensive theory about 9/11 and explains the physics behind it WITHOUT violating any known laws of physics. The ONLY theory that doesn't violate the known laws of physics. Guess it's getting too much attention and the sub needed a giant sticky to warn everyone that mini-nukes are 'crazy'.
      </p>
      <p>
       No theory is crazy. It can't be, it doesn't have a mind, it's just information. This sticky is an insult to the community.

       but to be honest, i would really like for us to get past accepting this as a reality and for us to move on to discussing the implications.

       the biggest one i see is this: u.s./israeli intelligence agencies have access to thermonuclear devices within the united states and the willingness to use them on a civilian population.

        Testing the Hypothesis that Mini-Nukes Were Used on the WTC Towers - Steven E. Jones
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Empirical Facts:
        </strong>
        All nuclear weapons (especially FUSION/Hydrogen bombs) release copious high-energy neutrons which will activate steel and other materials. This is called neutron activation and cannot be avoided, and much of the induced radioactivity remains for decades.
       </li>
       <li>
        I have studied fusion for decades, and have made frequent measurements of neutrons (as well as charged particles).
       </li>
       <li>
        Several months ago, I tested WTC dust samples and a solidified metal sample for radioactivity using a Geiger counter: I found ZERO RADIOACTIVITY. This experimental evidence goes strongly against the mini-nukes hypothesis since neutron activation levels were zero.
       </li>
       <li>
        I also tested some sand gathered from a nuclear-bomb test site decades ago for comparison – and the Geiger counter showed hundreds of counts per minute. This also shows the long life of the radioactive residues due to nuclear bombs – the sand still yields high Geiger-counter readings decades after the nuclear bomb blast.
       </li>
       <li>
        Note that concrete pulverization is often achieved in controlled demolitions with chemical explosives, e.g., the Seattle Kingdome demolition.
       </li>
       <li>
        Mini-nukes are not needed for pulverization nor for “top-down” demolition as observed for the WTC Towers.

       . this is a pattern of using nuclear devices in terrorist attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       furthermore, it demonstrates the complicity of the press in conducting these operations, and their ability to use hollywood-style effects and crisis actors to deceive the public. (expect youtube and social media to be the media weapons of choice nowadays.)
      </p>
      <p>
       these things matter. spreading the word about them may help prevent further nuclear false flags propelled by false media.

       now.. i regret to inform you that the 9/11 truth movement has been largely subverted by ae911truth, a controlled opposition organization that exists to control the truth movement and render it impotent. and, of course, to shield both israel and the traitors involved from suspicion. we see them now pushing blame towards saudi arabia - the ultimate patsy.
      </p>
      <p>
       they're calling for a new investigation, but we already know what happened. we should be making arrests and conducting trials. and executions.
      </p>
      <p>
       how many arrests have there been of the real culprits? even one?
      </p>
      <p>
       they are working for team evil. the same people who have corrupted our medical system and weaponized our food supply.
      </p>
      <p>
       don't be fooled. they are not on team people. use them where convenient, but remember: they are our enemy. this is war.

       Tyvm. I was a fan of CST in its earlier stages, but was quickly shoo'd away by the religious hivelike attacks I was encountering, but managed to stumble there a few days ago following a friends posts, and seen a mod threaten to ban for mentioning flat earth in the comments.

       I get it, but for example here there's a guy who replied to my OP, who has been voted to the top of the comments:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The real tl;dr: Alternative 9/11 theories are "crazy", "nonsense", "idiotic beliefs"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       and I want to reply "That's not what I said, I said that the mini-nuke and holographic planes theories are nonsense."
      </p>
      <p>
       but I can guarantee you we would get in to a multi-comment thread about the details of mini-nuke 9/11 theory, and if I continue to engage, it would make up most of the comments on this thread. This distracts from the topic at hand that I'm actually trying to talk about, and keeps other people from commenting because they look at the thread and it looks derailed, and derailed by nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       For this reason I feel ignoring is better than arguing. Arguing just gives them acknowledgement they don't deserve, and gives them the space and opportunity to fill the comments with derailing content. They often try to get the last word, so you can argue back for ages and it never ends. It just seems a bit fruitless, and actually perhaps destructive toward trying to stay on topic and have good discussions.

      <p>
       Along with a mere...99.9% of the rest of us on this subreddit? You, however, have a record of pushing a specific narrative (which the OP also appears to be pushing) which seems designed to shut down certain avenues of dicussion. Nobody has all the answers, and the people who argue that theirs is the "official" conspiracy theory of 9/11 and everybody else's ideas are "crazy" tend to make me suspicious. Sorry.

       There are three kinds of "shills": Paid shills, ideological shills, and those that are both paid and ideological zealots (see any Israel-related thread in WorldNews for examples).

      <p>
       The ideologs are far more dedicated and pernicious than simple hired goons.

       Thanks for the appreciation. Oh of course, I absolutely get tired and frustrated from it and have to take a break. Can absolutely empathize there. It can be difficult to cope. I even wrote a whole post about it a while ago that resonated with a lot of people, here is a link in case you may be interested:

      <p>
       It's not about operating inside or outside MSM, do whichever you fancy. But the point is reaching the most people with the most vital pieces of information, the information that is being ignored by the culture at large but is highly relevant. The stuff nobody sees yet, just because people haven't been exposed to that information yet. Those people need to be reached.
      </p>
      <p>
       All you can do is you, if you get exhausted trying to help that's okay. But it is something that if enough people put enough effort in to changing the values of culture, it will happen. That's how cultural changes
       <em>
        always

       happen. You can participate and shape culture gradually, but it is a gargantuan task and you are but one person, so you must pace yourself. It's a 10,000 mile marathon, but the wise know it needs running despite how daunting it is. A day at a time, a message at a time, a sentence at a time. That's all you can do, the rest is out of your hands, literally. Sorry for rambling myself, my post ended up being far longer than yours even haha

       You said they send disinformation agents to discredit conspiracy theorists for profit. How do you make a profit by making this sub look crazy? How does making you look bad translate into more ad revenue?

       But i still don't get what that has to do with advertising or how that makes money. There has to be some sort of mechanism by which associating certain news items with "crazy" results in increased ad revenue. What is that mechanism? You talked about "military pr" in your op. What is it that they sell on Reddit by making conspiracy theorists look crazy?
      </p>
      <p>
       How is it supposed to work?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: you said "increased eyeballs" or something to that effect to explain how this scheme works and then you said the news item gets ignored by being relegated to this sub. Those are mutually exclusive. Again, I have to ask how this scheme is supposed to work.

       First off I wanted to say that I

       Are you to suggest that black technology doesn't far surpass what you or I think or thought was possible?

       Maybe it did happen.  On the date of September 11th 2001.

       Compositing is probably the easier problem compared to holograms.  Both very well might be sufficiently advanced, perhaps bordering magic compared to what is released to the public.

       A plane hitting a building, regardless of speed, would never penetrate a structure made of steel and concrete the way the 2nd plane on 9/11 supposedly did.
      </p>
      <p>
       These planes can suffer serious damage if they even hit a bird in the sky, that is how fragile they are made and they have to be made that fragile because that is the only way for them to fly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's two video of plane crashes. In
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZjhxuhTmGk">
        this one
       </a>
       a jet is traveling at 500 mph into a concrete wall and you can see the results. In

        this one
       </a>
       a plane falls onto of a car and smashes into a million pieces.

       Now compare that with the video of the
