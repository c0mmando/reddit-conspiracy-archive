We&#39;ll just call them premeditated accidents. </p>

<p>With that in mind - Lets say you just invented a free energy device in your garage. no one knows but you and it&#39;s something anyone could build. Here is your dilemma. </p>

<p>1) Send the schematic over to your friendly neighborhood patent office where they can help you obtain a free premeditated accident referral. But, if you survive you may just be the next billionaire. </p>

<p>2) Try your hardest to massively release the schematics thus making a premeditated accident senseless. However, you lose any chance of capitalizing on the invention. </p>

<p>What would you do? How would you do it? What are the pros vs cons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow I have thought about this so many times.  I have young kids so am equally concerned about a potential &#39;Premeditated accident&#39;.<br/>
A friend of mine invented a free energy generator as part of her MEng university project.  Within 2 weeks of presenting it to her lecturer, she told us the invention had been bought by an energy company and she couldn&#39;t really talk about it.
But she seemed really happy and ended up leaving the course early.  I think they bought it from her. That was 10 years ago.</p>

<p>A few us who saw it have built similar motors.  Mine currently provides power for my garage. </p>

<p>But not interested in being suicided, so I&#39;m just gona figure out how to use it to reduce my energy bills.  Maybe in future I&#39;ll try build 20-30 units and just give them away for free and see what happens....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quite the opposite.  By releasing an invention publicly, means no one can ever patent it,  own it or prevent others using it.
A patent on something like this would open you up to attack and likely prevent the new technology from ever being released.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are other alternatives. You could seek out a powerful sponsor/partner who is in a position to assist with the patenting, development and monetisation of your product. Of course you won&#39;t know for sure if you can trust them, so you have to incentivise them sufficiently to make it overwhelmingly in their interests to work with you and look after you.</p>

<p>A likely candidate would be a wealthy tech company, or entrepreneur. Their main line of business must not be in competition with the product you are bringing to the table. If your product is symbiotic with theirs, you have a good chance of making money and...being in a position to enjoy it.</p>

<p>However, you&#39;re going to have to spend a lot of money on lawyers for this to be a viable route.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First I&#39;d try to get the patent, not for any motivation of profit but to keep the patent out of the wrong hands.  I would open the patent up to free use so that anyone could make use of the tech. Then I&#39;d try to massively spread the info online.<br/>
If I get got I get got, personally I&#39;m not that worried about it.  I&#39;d take one for the team on that one, but only if the tech was really worth it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent point - Imagine if all the jobs related to oil, solar, gas engines, processing plants, wind, etc were instantly made useless. While the fuel industry and car industry might last for a while some businesses would instantly take a hit on the stock market. Wind, Solar, Coal, Natural Gas (for energy production), would all stop. Not to mention the entire US power cable network. Imagine personal generators for each home. The job loss would be enormous! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure the judgement &quot;economic catastrophe&quot; is a fair assessment... but maybe it is.</p>

<p>Whatever transition humanity undergoes to escape the hamster-wheel the rich caste has placed the poor on, I&#39;m sure it won&#39;t be a &quot;pleasant&quot; experience... but I&#39;d say that anything that doesn&#39;t result in the continuance of this paradigm <em>has got to be</em> better.</p>

<p>To be honest, I don&#39;t think the resulting economic re-structuring (or any potential proliferation concerns) are a good enough reason to keep this technology hidden. It just means that one group has a tremendous advantage that another doesn&#39;t (which is the same problem we already have).</p>
