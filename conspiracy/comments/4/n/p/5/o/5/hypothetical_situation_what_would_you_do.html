       We're all aware of the current predicament - you invent something world changing and the next day big pharma, big brother, or big energy is planting a bomb in your car, dousing your house with radiation to give you insta-cancer, or straight up hiring a crack head to gank you. We'll just call them premeditated accidents.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that in mind - Lets say you just invented a free energy device in your garage. no one knows but you and it's something anyone could build. Here is your dilemma.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Send the schematic over to your friendly neighborhood patent office where they can help you obtain a free premeditated accident referral. But, if you survive you may just be the next billionaire.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Try your hardest to massively release the schematics thus making a premeditated accident senseless. However, you lose any chance of capitalizing on the invention.
      </p>
      <p>
       What would you do? How would you do it? What are the pros vs cons.

       Live in the woods, use TOR, post to github. Get some designers, developers, promoters to expand your digital presence via bitcoin (or any crypto currency - cash that shit out though, inventor). Sit back and watch the world burn (fulfilled really - elites are the burn victims). Rinse and repeat, if you are on Tesla's level.....

       Wow I have thought about this so many times.  I have young kids so am equally concerned about a potential 'Premeditated accident'.
       <br/>
       A friend of mine invented a free energy generator as part of her MEng university project.  Within 2 weeks of presenting it to her lecturer, she told us the invention had been bought by an energy company and she couldn't really talk about it.
But she seemed really happy and ended up leaving the course early.  I think they bought it from her. That was 10 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few us who saw it have built similar motors.  Mine currently provides power for my garage.
      </p>
      <p>
       But not interested in being suicided, so I'm just gona figure out how to use it to reduce my energy bills.  Maybe in future I'll try build 20-30 units and just give them away for free and see what happens....

       Personally I think the whole "Patent" thing was created to help TPTB be aware of potential threats to their multiple "money-opolies" especially in the free energy or medical technologies before the information can get to the public..

       Quite the opposite.  By releasing an invention publicly, means no one can ever patent it,  own it or prevent others using it.
A patent on something like this would open you up to attack and likely prevent the new technology from ever being released.

       Similarly, even if someone has a cool tech patent, you can still copy it.  You are just not allowed to profit from it. 
So feel free to hit the patent website and build anything cool as long as its for your own use only.

       There are other alternatives. You could seek out a powerful sponsor/partner who is in a position to assist with the patenting, development and monetisation of your product. Of course you won't know for sure if you can trust them, so you have to incentivise them sufficiently to make it overwhelmingly in their interests to work with you and look after you.
      </p>
      <p>
       A likely candidate would be a wealthy tech company, or entrepreneur. Their main line of business must not be in competition with the product you are bringing to the table. If your product is symbiotic with theirs, you have a good chance of making money and...being in a position to enjoy it.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, you're going to have to spend a lot of money on lawyers for this to be a viable route.

       Interesting answer but what if the organization you go to with the idea is part of the conspiracy. Perhaps they belong to the same gentlemen's club.

       There are no certainties, but your odds are improved if you can offer this organization a deal that is attractive enough for their bottom line, to justify doing this despite their affiliation to said gentleman's club.

       First I'd try to get the patent, not for any motivation of profit but to keep the patent out of the wrong hands.  I would open the patent up to free use so that anyone could make use of the tech. Then I'd try to massively spread the info online.
       <br/>
       If I get got I get got, personally I'm not that worried about it.  I'd take one for the team on that one, but only if the tech was really worth it.

       As someone else mentioned, if it were a free energy device anyone could copy the patent and build the device for personal use. The patent is really only going to prevent public sales. (There will always be black market sales, private use, and modifations)

       The introduction of a "free energy" device could change our entire socio-economic paradigm, and would probably make the idea of "being rich" ultimately irrelevant.

      <p>
       I'd free humanity with that kind of opportunity... or die trying.

       Excellent point - Imagine if all the jobs related to oil, solar, gas engines, processing plants, wind, etc were instantly made useless. While the fuel industry and car industry might last for a while some businesses would instantly take a hit on the stock market. Wind, Solar, Coal, Natural Gas (for energy production), would all stop. Not to mention the entire US power cable network. Imagine personal generators for each home. The job loss would be enormous!

      <p>
       With that said, do you think some might try and suppress the device to avoid such an economical catastrophe?

       I'm not sure the judgement "economic catastrophe" is a fair assessment... but maybe it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever transition humanity undergoes to escape the hamster-wheel the rich caste has placed the poor on, I'm sure it won't be a "pleasant" experience... but I'd say that anything that doesn't result in the continuance of this paradigm
       <em>
        has got to be
       </em>
       better.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be honest, I don't think the resulting economic re-structuring (or any potential proliferation concerns) are a good enough reason to keep this technology hidden. It just means that one group has a tremendous advantage that another doesn't (which is the same problem we already have).
