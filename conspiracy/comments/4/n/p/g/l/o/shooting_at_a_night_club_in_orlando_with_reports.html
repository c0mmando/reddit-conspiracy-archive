        these

       are now beginning to surface.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last number I've seen was 54 injured/killed, but unconfirmed numbers. It's more than odd it's been almost an hour and not one major US news network has picked this up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please remember that if you listen in on emergency frequencies, do not post specifics of police/fire/EMS movements as they are happening. I WILL UPDATE AS THE EVENT CONTINUES TO UNFOLD. All times will be in Central Time due to exactly how quickly new information is obtained. Orlando is in the Easter Time Zone, so all times are 1 hour difference from posted times. Please excuse any formatting errors, they will be cleaned up later.

       . It is interesting to note they don't state "the gunman" they continue with "inside the club" seeming to imply there is another, but that is nothing more than pure speculation. Standby for further.

Waiting until hearing further for actual hard numbers on victims. Personal estimate is between 50 and 60 injured and dead. At one point it was said over 40 trauma alerts were sent to one hospital alone (possibly the nearest Level 1 or 2 trauma center), added on with rescues in the double digits and an unstated number of deceased. 0552
      </p>
      <p>

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       E33: Confirmed over 40 injured by OPD, estimated another 20+ dead inside the building per OPD press conference. 0631

      <p>
       E34: Alright, I wanted to go to bed when all of this started but I figured you guys would want to know all the stuff that happened too. So I stayed up way past my bed time. I'm going to sleep now but thanks guys. Also a shoutout to my brothers in Orlando Fire who did an awesome job today (last night?) . I'm definitely making it a point to stop by a few of their fire houses if I'm ever in the city. If any of you are reading this, remember your defusings and debriefings. If you need a brother, reach out and I've got you. Good night. 0735
5E35: Omar Mateen is the gunman's name, he pledged alliance to ISIS. 50 people are dead, another 53 injured.

       A shooting is always meant domestic peace time shooting. YOU took it literally and included the Alamo.

       50 people, is A LOT... I mean a whole LOT.  Even before news broke of this asshole being an ex security guard, I knew it would be someone heavily trained with firearms to be taking out that many people.  Even if you're in an enclosed area like he was, killing that many people, shows of someone who knew what they were doing, felt extremely comfortable around a firearm, and extremely comfortable killing.  I wouldn't be surprised to learn he was radicalized overseas, and fought overseas as well.  This isn't some disgruntled kid, who can never get laid, so he buys a gun, takes it to school and exacts his revenge... no, this is calculated, this is studied, this is prepared.  He knew what he was doing and unfortunately, did it extremely well.  I am a HUGE pro gun person, and this one actually scares me with regards to the 2nd amendment.  This is big... all the others haven't scared me at all in regards to the guns and laws, but something about this one, is gonna enact some serious change... and shockingly, right before Obama is getting out of office...

       Maybe they have grown some integrity. Everyone knows there are CDC guidelines to try to prevent viral behaviors like suicides and in my opinion there isn't enough censorship to protect us from ourselves. Stop reporting so damn much on these shootings. It'll reduce the recurrence and potential for immortality through fame. Freedom of the press ends where it turns our schools and public places into war zones.

       It's conditioning you to not speculate with your fellow redditors or community.  They don't want a bunch of people corroborating information like three shooters or two shooters or one.  They want to control the narrative.

      <p>
       Mass shooting?  Next step is to lock all the threads down.  Want to talk about this with your neighbors?  Nope, no talking with your neighbors about this either.  This is getting weird.

       I don't frequent this sub very often, I'm mostly in the aviation subs but I enjoy skimming through here from time to time when horrific stuff like this happens. I live in central Florida, not Orlando but very close to it and a couple things strike me as weird. The specific bar where all this took place is a good distance from where all the other bars are at and on any given weekend-night there are thousands of people at all the bars. It seems like if someone really wanted to kill as many people as they can, that's where they would go. Granted there are tons of cops in downtown Orlando around the bar streets on the weekends I guess that could have stopped an attack. Almost seems more like a hate crime attacking a gay night club when hundreds of bars down the street have way more targets.

       Also a central florida native here. The gay night club attacked isn't a well known bar in that area, like I have driven by that intersection 100's of times and didn't know it was even there. (Also note i'm not gay which might have something to do with it) My family had your exact thoughts earlier. The scary report i heard was that the man who did it was apparently on the FBI watch list. That's why the FBI's freaking out right now in Orlando. Edit: Grammar

       Orlando native. Its a pretty well known spot. Probaly the top gay bar in Orlando afaik, except the one on OBT down on the west side. It was almost certainly more of a hate crime than an attempt to kill as many people as possible.

       Yup, I don't get all these comments people saying it's not well known. I'm not even gay and I know about Pulse. The only other one I can think of that might have more immediate recognition is Parliament House, but I'd definitely say it's in the top 5 most well known gay bars in Orlando.

       I had a couple friends that would make the drive from the coast out to pulse 2 times a week. I'd say it's a pretty popular. Splitting hairs though, this isn't supposed to be an argument amongst us, it's a moot point.

       I mean every bar owner says they have the "hottest club in town" but i see what you're saying. My point rather, was that it's not in a bar/clubbing atmosphere like Church St or Wallstreet. It's more secluded in a shopping plaza

       Very true, but when you look at where the lbgt clubs are here in Orlando, they tend to be more on the outskirts,  Revolution is on bumby, pulse is on south orange, and Parliament House is on OBT close to Fairvilla.  I'm not sure the reason why it's like this, but that is how it is.  I think the practice of putting lbgt clubs in inconspicuous places started in NYC, which then was how gentrification started, but mostly to make sure their Patrons could feel safe whether they were open with their sexuality, publicly or not.  Sorry for the rant.  Went down there earlier and it's incredibly bizarre.  Not as if anything funny is going on, but the shock that something this crazy happened in my hometown.

       I think that's where it ends and you are right. Just depends on what a person values and finds important.

       I think the writing has been on the wall for quite some time. After the Paris farce, I was on this sub predicting the same thing happening in America this year, although, I did also predict that there would be multiple simultaneous attacks. Granted, that would be more difficult to pull off, assuming this is some sort of false flag / hoax operation.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's far too much political stuff going on between now and the end of the year, with the election, the Hillary investigation, TPP/TTIP, occupation in Syria...that you just knew some shit would hit the fan to keep the focus off it all. This is probably just the first of a slew of shootings we'll see from summer through fall.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama may be headed out of office, but Clinton is probably even more adamant about tighter gun laws. I guess we'll see.

       I have a friend who doesn't believe the Orlando shooting happened and I'm on this sub to read what others have written about it. He mentioned the phrase "false flag" also and doesn't think there is enough evidence. What are your thoughts?

       Well here's the thing - we won't get much, if any, concrete evidence to support anything. Me personally, I don't truly think it's a complete hoax, but the ONLY reason I say that is because a longtime friend of my mom's claims to have lost a nephew in the attack. That's a somewhat vague, shill-sounding thing to say, but I can't imagine this person lying.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, this is, without question, a false flag. If you're just popping on to the sub for the first time, and are unfamiliar with how most of us perceive geopolitics, then it might be a bit hard to grasp. But the mainstream media is in cahoots with whoever is perpetrating these events, whether it be the CIA, Mossad, ATF, DHS, whoever, and they won't hesitate to regurgitate whatever they're told.
      </p>
      <p>
       I DO think the Paris attacks were probably a full-on hoax. The photo from inside the Bataclan is a joke, the venue was recently purchased by wealthy Jews, and the only people heard from who were inside were industry insiders and actors. The "suicide bomb" that went off in a cafe, which killed NO ONE but the bomber, by the way, did so little damage to the inside of the building, you'd think someone just threw a plate and a glass.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, we are witnessing Broadway theater on a massive scale, the likes of which the world has never seen before, and with all the disinformation that flows out after these attacks, we have to resign to the fact that we simply do not know what happened. But I'm glad you're looking into this - I think anyone with a critical mind can look at this news coverage and wonder..."is this person being honest? Why are some witnesses being ignored? Why are they letting media into the shooter's home just two days later?"
      </p>
      <p>
       It simply does not add up. Instead of investigating the facts, mainstream and social media is instead focused on how the attack can be prevented, and what laws need to change, which is
       <strong>
        exactly
       </strong>
       what the UN-installed government wants.

       There's been some recent debate about this terminology...the basic idea is that "false flag" pertains to
       <strong>
        anything
       </strong>
       that is done by one group of people and blamed on another, whether or not there are murders. A "hoax" is a completely fabricated event where no one died. So while a "hoax" is not interchangeable with a "false flag", the two are not necessarily mutually exclusive.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words..."false flag" is a safer way of referring to anything we're lied to about, without sounding insensitive in case it wasn't really a hoax.

       They are not going after the left. They don't see it that way. There is us the population and the them, the men behind the curtain. They create events and push agendas. They are why you categorizes people into left or right. This looks more about gun control than anything else.

       Okay yes and wouldn't a war against the countries they hate the most kill even more people? That's what I'm saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       And wouldn't the left who have been against a Syrian invasion/ground war more than the right. Hate it when they put more forces in.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's the best way to counter the lefts hate for war ... By killing 50 gay people in a gay bar. That would swing the sjw/left vote way further.
      </p>

       Edit : your right about gun control that's why it's always an m16 or ar15. Notice how it's never an ak like most Muslim terrorists use.

       This doesn't make sense.  If the Jews are trying to paint a picture of Muslims being dangerous wouldn't they profess loudly at every opportunity that he was Muslim?  Doesn't it make more sense that the site is moving in a more PC SJW direction and so the mods are skewing information that way?  And since Muslims are viewed largely as the societal underdogs the mods of these PC subreddits might want to protect their image by suppressing information that might spark hatred towards the group/religion as a whole?  That's the kind of self-contained small-scale conspiracy I can get behind.

       Is this the part where you claim that tv is scheduled Jewish programming that alters the viewer's perception of reality and you're better than the sheeple because you post to an Internet forum which, also according to you, is likewise run by your evil arch-nemesis Hebrew International?  Or will you try to say that your baseless depthless comments hold more water than my own baseless depthless comments?

       "Hasbara style"?  Do you realize how stupid that sounds?  Do you think throwing sideways swipes at anything related to Jews even where it doesn't make sense somehow makes you enlightened?  I can do that too, but then I'd be stooping to the level of matzah

       It is unknown on all but question 3. Granted I am not from the area, and just happened to be in this subreddit when I read that this all started going down. I don't even live in the same time zone as Orlando.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the US major news outlets to report on it took well over an hour. The
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       thread was what I first heard about it. I instantly began keeping the opening to the post in a notepad folder and flipping through major news websites. The BBC website had more information than any domestic news outlets until about three hours ago, which the incident has now been going on for roughly five hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       Initial reports is some victims are stating there were 2 shooters. OPD has not confirmed the one dead gunman is the only gunman. EOD stated on the major incident channel that "the vehicle is the only suspected device." My question is how did he manage to get a "long arm" like a rifle or shotgun past security?

        1) Was there some kind of a "swat team training exercise" near by when it happened?

       <p>
        2) Has there been irregularities with the communication systems in the area 24-48 hours before the event?
       </p>
       <p>
        3) How fast did the corporate owned mass media arrive at the scene?
4) How did the perpetrators look, what kind of clothe did the wear and is there any reliable photo evidence?

       Am I missing something?  Did this comment get edited by the OP and it was originally asking some stupid, inflammatory questions?  These all seem like legitimate questions to me.  Why the downvotes?

       I don't think they like being questioned. I think it provokes their angst, if you ask them to take even a mildly critical look at what is going on. They rest is just knee jerk behavior and fear surfacing in an attempt to stay inside their pretty little bubble. I kind of feel sorry for them!

       I just found it strange that you were at like -2 when I came upon your post.  I was like "Did he ask some completely irrelevant question and then edit it and replaced it with fully valid questions or something? cuz I see

       reason to downvote what he posted."

       Once upon a time maybe. Not anymore. r/conspiracy has been turned into echo chamber for fools and idiots, a mere shadow of its former self, abandoned a long long time ago by the intelligentsia.

       Orlando resident here.

       The Orlando shooter seems to have a Muslim name ("Omar Mateen"), so they're already trying to make ties to Islamic fundamentalism and terrorist groups despite the fact that it was most likely a hate crime.
      </p>

       This all comes within a week of a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that concealed carry is not protected in the constitution, allowing them to make it difficult/impossible for Americans to apply for and receive CCW permits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Central Florida has some pretty lax gun policies--University of Central Florida students are even allowed to carry their guns in their cars on campus. I have a glaring suspicion that this will all soon change, with legislators citing "the deadliest mass shooting in US history."

       It always makes me wonder when there are initially reports of 2 shooters, but then it ends up there was just one. We saw this with the Aurora shooting and now this one. There were reports that one shooter left the club and started running down the street towards the hospital while shooting, which is why the hospital was put on lock down. Now, the media is saying that there was a lone wolf gunman that was killed inside the nightclub. IF there wasn't a second shooter, I'm interested to hear the reasoning for why the hospital was put on lock down.

       The was apparently a police officer working inside the club who initially returned fire. Easily could have been mistaken for a second shooter at first.

       Plausible, but that doesn't fit the scenario I heard unless the cop got scared and started running down the street away from the club while shooting, which I'm sure would be against protocol as innocents were in the streets trying to escape.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from the reports of two shooters in recent incidents, the idea of accomplices has been a very grey area for the police. For example, the most glaring instance in the past few years has been the idea that John Wayne Gacy had one or more accomplices as some of the victims found buried in his basement came up missing while Gacy was, in fact, out of town. A few years ago, it was reported that Chicago was preparing to arrest a person they suspected was working with Gacy, then it fell off the radar, and never spoken of again. Why the secrecy? Things just get curiouser and curiouser...

       Yeah Gacy said he had 'accomplices' and the only survivor said he believed as second person was present in the house.

       Not sure what it implies, I'd guess a want to wrap up the case or lack of evidence, but strange indeed.

       For more information on the massive cover ups surrounding Gacy, Son of Sam, and many other "serial killers", read The Ultimate Evil by Maury Terry, and Programmed to Kill by David McGowan. Really gives perspective on every mass media promoted act of violence in this country, including this most recent shooting.

       At this time it is a possibility. I've been googling for a police scanner feed since I started the thread. I can't find one, but my googlefu isn't the greatest. It was also reported that there was another gunman inside of the hospital nearest to the club. The hospital was put on lockdown for a while. All I currently have is the OFD command feed, so my information is more based on patients. Thanks

       I have a screenshot on my cellphone from last night, while the event was still in progress.  It states, "The New York Daily News has reported that one witness saw "at least two assailants open fire with what sounded like a semi-automatic firearm inside the nightclub and outside the south Orlando venue from a vehicle".

       Get ready for the usual social media cycle following a terror attack:
Let's not just assume it's Muslims merely because witnesses heard shouting in Arabic! It could be anyone!
Ok, fine, it was Muslims, but clearly they weren't REAL Muslims, just some crazy people using religion as an excuse!
Here's some statistics on non-Islamic terror attacks. Remember, those happen too!
What about the KKK and the Crusades? Did you forget about those? Proof that all religions are the same!
Muslims are the real victims here. Their peaceful religion has been hijacked by some crazies that make them look bad.

       I find it strange how hung up people are about the censorship part because it's some muslim. Let's be honest here, this just furthers the elitist agenda because that censorship in itself will only increase hate against that group and it will only divide people further. Plus we'll see the gun debate brought right back to the forefront and it'll be part of the election cycle for sure.

       Not sure how this is going to play out or if it will look like a false flag... but as soon as I turned on CNN, gun reform talk. A woman mayor(?) talking about assault rifle magazine clips and shit when all the facts aren't even out.

       Do you think we'd be better off with less restrictions to guns?  I believe we need to reduce firearm proliferation -- majorly.  Limit the manufacture of guns, limit the importation of firearms, limit the access to ammunition, ban videos of sports shooting on youtube and other websites --like FPSRussian because they entertain and create a wreckless gun culture that only fuels proliferation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firearm proliferation does not thwart foreign invasion, does not thwart surveillance on citizens, or thwart diminished rights ... all of these things occur with gun proliferation.  Access to education and equality in society are the only things that thwart gun violence or violent extremism in general
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing that proliferation of guns provides is the enrichment for stakeholders in the arms industry.  I think it's funny that people in this sub are afraid or dismissive of socialism and capitalism but it's capitalism that created US fascination with gun culture ... yet any discussions of curtailing capitalism doesn't address the gun culture.

       I'm not for takings guns away but what would people with Guns do in this situation? Should everyone be carrying all the time? And even then, the element of complete surprise and shock and being placed under fire...!is every member of society supposed to know the tactics of a trained marine? There needs to be better security at these places. More guns in the hands of everyday pedestrians doesn't solve this problem. And we need to look at the underlying mental illness problem that is so big in our country.  We have legislation that makes it hard for people to get the help and treatment they need but then those shame people have easy access to dangerous weapons. We will continue to see these types of events as long as we do nothing about it. One place to start is making it easier for people to access mental health recourses. And maybe we start addressing religious extremism because that always seems to play a factor in these events.  It's becoming more and more clear that religiously minded individuals "not all" tend to have a passion to stop violators of their beliefs and we are seeing the results of delusional thinking.

       What do you mean by
       <em>

       gun control?  Obama hasn't passed a single stitch of Federal gun laws in his entire tenure.  He came into office with a super majority in the House and Senate so he could have passed anything he wanted to and he didn't.  The "Obama is coming for your guns" was just a slogan that the NRA and gun advocates used to get people to run to the store and stockpile guns and ammo and donate money.  If he wanted to actually pass sweeping gun legislation he could have done it when he had the super majority and nothing could have stopped him.

       While I don't buy into the idea that "Obammer gunna taek muh guns." line, his priority when he got into office was Obamacare. He knew it would be a fight, and it was. He spent a lot of political capital on it, good or bad. He's only recently began focusing on guns, but if her were going to try and pass gun legislation of any kind, now would be the time to do it. Historically it has always caused candidates who were openly anti gun to lose votes in national elections. He doesn't have to worry about that now. Especially with the recent 9th Circuit court ruling, and ATF no longer allowing certain types of FFL licenses and pressuring bans on certain types of ammunition that have been allowed for import for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if he's
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       antigun, or if he's just doing it because it's somewhat in vogue and may help drum up support for the Dems in November. But either way, he'll mention gun control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I should also point out that the Executive Branch, which he is in control of, has disallowed import of types of ammunition (7n6), attempted to ban making certain types of ammunition (M855), no longer allows appeals to a NICS denial (so even if I were legally allowed to buy a firearm, but was confused with someone who wasn't, I am pretty much barred from buying a firearm from an FFL until this is fixed), ATF issuing contradicting rulings on hardware that fits into a legal gray area so that what they say
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       law because they could use original wording of an arguably unconstitutional bill and contort it to fit an extremely obscure definition to make legal gun owners potential felons (redesign was the word, and shouldering a brace was the action). On top of that there was the import ban on rifles that are rarely used in crimes and account for less than 1% of firearms deaths every year because they're "too dangerous." Then there's the fact that the BATFE holds contradictary viewpoints that "trusts are not people," and NFA trusts are a thing, but they'll try and prosecute a trust holder who they gave a tax stamp to because they don't want him having the gun they gave him the tax stamp for already. He may not have passed any bills, but he's done it through executive power.

       Of course he'll mention gun control because that's good campaign fodder for both sides.  The Republicans raise money saying they'll protect your 2nd amendment because Hillary wants to ban your guns and Hillary will raise money promising to pass "comprehensive common sense gun legislation."  This happens every single election and no meaningful federal legislation gets passed because a majority of the members of Congress receive donations from the NRA.  If Obama
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       was interested in gun control he had a super majority when he entered office and after Sandy Hook he had enough public support for a new federal universal background check law that he could have signed an executive order for it citing public polling data as enough reason to take matters into his own hands.  He didn't do that.  He said congress needed to get it done even though he signed a hundred executive orders for other shit.  No real gun laws get passed because if that happens both sides lose their fundraising ability on the subject.

       All that stuff is mostly a lot of "who gives a shit" stuff that the NRA doesn't even get worked up about.  I'm talking about actual federal legislation that would effect normal civilian gun owners.  When people talk about gun control they are afraid of gun bans and further limitations and national registries.  Having certain types of ammo no longer allowed to be imported etc doesn't really matter.  That's not a strong enough issue to raise funds over.

       The rising number of lawful gun owners being denied their right because the system can't tell them from the felon across the country isn't a big deal? I wonder if there would be an outlash over it if people weren't allowed to vote or have 4A rights or have freedom of speech because they were confused with a felon. People would flip shit because they are controlling your birthright.
      </p>
      <p>
       Artificially increasing the price of ammunition is all the ammo bans did. Which doesn't sound like much, but what would happen if the prices of computers were artificially doubled because it was deemed typed words were "too hurtful" when the computers aren't used in crime to a measurable degree.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are issues to raise funds over. Especially the ammo bans raised a bunch of funds for the NRA. The NRA might not be the greatest thing, but they're the biggest protector of gun rights in the US, especially the NRA-ILA. That's why even though I hate them, I'm a member. Just like I fucking hate the ACLU sometimes, but I'm still a member. Liberty is liberty. Freedom is freedom. That's all I, and most others, want.

       The NRA consistently whips people into a frenzy over whatever Democrat is running for office by telling you they are coming to ban your guns.  It's a cheap fundraising tactic.  There's never a democrat who isn't coming for your guns but it never happens.  Gun sales and NRA donations skyrocket and congress members get paid and that's it.  It's extortion:  give us donations or your 2nd amendment is gone.  I don't believe that.  I think there are enough members of Congress who would oppose a gun ban (and certainly enough citizens) without needing to be paid for it.

       If you would like an example of what Democrats would like to do in regards to gun rights, look at California. Every legislative session there comes more and more restrictions, and I have no doubt that if they can do that in California, it's only a matter of time (either a little or a lot...more likely a lot, gun-control is the long con) before they try things like that at the national level.

       California is not at all representative of democrats on a national level.  That'd be like saying Texas is the example of republicans on a national level.  Democrats in rural parts of PA and Vermont and New York State would never be ok with sweeping gun regulation.  States can do what they want but that wouldn't fly at a federal level.

       It very much is, since they have strong majorities and dont need bipartisan support.
      </p>

       In CA:  the most common type of ammo is banned from hunting use,  there is no right to bear arms at all, only to keep at home.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are actually currently pushing legislation with their majorities to ban all rifles with magazine locks that comply with restrictions,  ban pieces of metal that merely resemble a firearm,  and tried to ban all semi autos with detachable magazines.

       How the hell do you figure the most liberal state in the country is representative of democrats in rural PA who love guns?  There are plenty of democrats who are socially libertarian but wouldn't relinquish their 2nd Amendment rights.  California does not represent those democrats.

       CNN is continuously interviewing this hipster with a fedora who seems to know a lot about bullets. They also keep showing him helping paramedics carry a victim to an ambulance. The similarities to other mass casualty events is beyond coincidental.

       The headlines I've seen indicate that the authorities want to treat this "as a terrorist act".
      </p>
      <p>
       How the fuck do they come up with that? It's a shooting at a gay nightclub. Definitely qualifies as a hate crime and as a killing spree. But why are they rushing so quickly to slap the terrorism label on this?
      </p>
      <p>
       So, possible false flag... or just taking advantage of an opportunity to use the special powers they get when it's terrorism. It seems like they're trying to stretch the definition of terrorism to include almost anything... as well as getting the public used to living in an environment of fear.

       I'm a firefighter. If for whatever reason the shooter(s) read reddit, they may stumble across it if they are barricaded with hostages. Until the event is over, posting specific movements may lead to the loss of more lives. After it's over, go to town.

       It is a hilariously ridiculous thought to picture a guy shooting a rifle, stopping to scroll through his phone while casually reloading his Reddit app, learning the position of incoming tactical officers.
      </p>
      <p>
       But who knows, dude could have had someone in his ear. Point is, there's zero benefit to posting the info, and 0.000000001% risk, so, why bother.

       It's always with ar15 or m4 semi automatic rifles.

       Couldn't they have smuggled a fully automatic eventually. Isis has had fully automatics all the way back to when they were is panic state of Iraq in 2006.

       They couldn't send 1 fully automatic .. Isis does claim all these attacks so why is it always USA guns?

       They could easily smuggling one in 10 years . They used to or might still make 1-2 million a day! That is 30-60 m / month. 360-730 million a year.. Do you not understand how much money that is . They couldn't send 1 to USA by now or anything else other than USA  guns. Which they get from someone in the USA?

       I have not heard ISIS approved the attacks, merely that the gunman wanted it to be known that he agreed with them. If the shooter was unaffiliated, then he was working with whatever his budget was personally and no international network that can easily get fully automatic firearms smuggled into a country where they're illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides that, in the US AR15s are more cost effictive, ammo is cheap and plentiful, accessories are present. They are the most popular rifle in the US

       The other shooters are usually the ones affiliated with whatever shadow organization is sponsoring the attack. Almost all the big shootings have multiple reports of multiple shooters. One shooter killed 20+ and shot another 40+ while taking fire?

       There is also other explanations, such as when people who aren't used to these stresses find themselves in positions where these stresses are present, they usually "black out" and act on base instinct. In situations like officer involved shootings, for example, accounts given right after the incident can, and it's not uncommon for them to, differ greatly from what happened. The officer will think they fired three rounds, but actually fired twelve. Usually around 48 hours the mind has the chance to process all the information it took in during the stressed state and begin to put it in order. After 48 hours (or so), officers are usually able to walk through the incident in detail and give correct information. So it may have been two "snip-its" of memory that just make the person think they saw two shooters, but might have actually only been one.

       I'm sure there will be "conflicting" eye witness reports, just like san bernandino... and I would also bet they will blame it on the internet, and try to take away internet freedoms and enact more gun laws. We'll see.

        Another thing to ponder: David Rockefeller's 101st birthday is coming on June 10th (if my memory serves me right (I won't bother googling it right now)). Perhaps "someone" will "celebrate" it by pulling off a really spectacular "ISIS" attack. Or something along those lines.

       Why would they do that? It wasn't even really a conspiracy post, it was literally a live play of events as they happened while I was listening to scanner traffic. I only posted here because all the other subs I could think of already had active threads going and I wanted to keep a log of what was going on.

       I once found myself in the middle of the Village in NYC during pride week when I was on summer vacation during high school. For a kid from Kansas it was quite odd. I was told the village was home to a large LGBT scene in the city. Since I didn't know it was pride week, I just assumed the parades and stuff was like an everyday thing. Then I grabbed 5 guys and went back to my hotel to take a nap.

       But why there 2 hours a way from home. I can't think of any clubs 2 hours away from me let alone a gay club. I think you are right about the layout but how would he know that or come across that info. Even if he was looking for the ideal location and building structure, how would that pop up on his radar.

       I think he had been there before as a patron.

       Yup. People have this belief that the government wouldn't use individuals and throw them away. So they assume that anyone involved in these events is an actor with makeup. It's much easier for the government to just create real death and injuries.

       Well, that's definitely a possibility as well, however.  There seems to have been a lot of crisis actor fuckery that's happened as of the past few years.  That's for sure.

       I mean the government, or special interest groups, or clandestine blackop projects, or whatever, can be involved in all these things.

       At the end of the day, the real point here is that TPTB can use anything really (the government, corporate groups, to military ops, etc) to exact all manner of heinous, false flag shit against the population.

       "I just dont get it. These people cant really believe the extreme violent nonsense they preach...at least not most of them. Just seems like a built in excuse at this point to act like human garbage. Take out a bunch of people u have never met...in a park...and magically you are no longer a bitter jealous loser but a martyr who committed the ultimate unselfish act.
Life more often than not is a swift kick to the balls. But we are all here going through some form of the same bullshit. Taking out lifes frustrations on random strangers is just pathetic and sad."

       They could easily smuggling one in 10 years . They used to or might still make 1-2 million a day! That is 30-60 m / month. 360-730 million a year.. Do you not understand how much money that is . They couldn't send 1 to USA by now or anything else other than USA  guns. Which they get from someone in the USA?
