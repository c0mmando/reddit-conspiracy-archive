        The global security firm G4S, with offices in Jupiter, has confirmed that Orlando shooter Omar Mateen has worked for the company since 2007.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The nation's second-largest security firm is dropping the Wackenhut name, a brand that for decades was synonymous with watchmen in tan uniforms.
       </p>
       <p>
        After two mergers and the construction of a new corporate home in Jupiter, the former Wackenhut now is known as G4S, the name of its British parent.

       <strong>
        An Octopus Named Wackenhut
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_wackenhut.htm">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Wackenhut provided him with firearms training, and with a license that allowed him to easily obtain the military-style assault weapons he is alleged to have used.
      </p>
      <p>
       They had nine years of access to him in the clandestine settings of the secure government facilities he would have been assigned to guard. This would have provided the ideal window of opportunity for programming.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, they would have had conducted a detailed 'background check' on him and developed a detailed 'psychological profile.' This is how firms like Wackenhut operate. They may even have been monitoring him until the assault as part of internal security.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is made all the more likely by the fact that he had reportedly been boasting of ties to terrorist groups at work and to his co-workers in 2013. This predictably resulted in calls to the FBI and an investigation that was closed without any action being taken. Why wasn't his employment terminated following this affair?

       If true, this post and your link could be the most significant on r/conspiracy today.  Perhaps this is outline:
       <br/>
       1.  We want to disarm citizens, pass bills to tighten gun laws, and fan the flames of radical Islam to support our destruction of the middle east.
       <br/>
       2.  Call ALEC, they'll get your bill and find a way to get it passed.
       <br/>
       3.  ALEC - "Okay problem, reaction, solution.  We have an idea but it's gonna be ugly, call those evil bastards at Wackenhut to do the dirty work."

       I remember when it took more work than this to figure this stuff out. Are their hearts just not in it anymore or are they expecting a less intelligent more apathetic populace? Maybe both. I just had a friend get in touch with me over this, he is not known as conspiracy minded, he said I have to check this out, and that it was obvious. The unforeseen consequences of their attempt to nudge the rat to the cheese is only bringing more of us into the fold.

       It's obvious because we've figured out how it works, and we're talking to each other about it. It's pretty obvious when everyone is constantly pointing out to each other how this works. Our culture was just too naive before, and we have access to SO much more information now.

       I've been thinking about this today, and I think it's because most people get their news stories in written form on the internet now. Fewer people watch the live coverage, so they don't have to put as much effort into making that look real. And those of us who see how ridiculous their narrative is end up just looking crazy if we say something. They're confident in the public's willingness to trust the official story implicitly.

       Everyone should read this article. It really details the long history of criminality and perpetrated by
       <strong>
        <em>
         Wackenhut.
        </em>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been following this company for awhile. It stored an enormous database of personal information on
       <em>
        "subversives"
       </em>
       . It's been suspected in
       <a href="http://www.wired.com/2011/02/ff_octopus_conspiracy/">
        a number of murders.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Wackenhut is not simply an intelligence front. It is the epitome of privatized intelligence. It carries out black operations that state intelligence agencies refuse to. It is
       <em>
        "the shadow government."

       <strong>
        WAYNE HARRIS
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Eric Harris, one of the two gunmen at Columbine High School, was the son of
       <strong>
        Major Wayne Harris
       </strong>
       , a decorated Air Force officer who had reportedly been involved in
       <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080208103947/http://www.think-aboutit.com/News/TRUTHaboutwhathappenedatColumbine.htm">
        covert intelligence activities
       </a>
       <em>
        "going back nearly 20 years."
       </em>
       At the time of his son's birth,
       <a href="http://extras.denverpost.com/news/shot0502b.htm">
        he was
       </a>
       <em>
        "working at the Boeing Military Airplane Co."
       </em>
       in Wichita, Kansas.
       <a href="http://www.konformist.com/1999/colorado/mystery.htm">
        According to
       </a>
       researcher John Quinn:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This particular Boeing plant has virtually nothing whatever to do with making airplanes but is instead deeply involved with highly classified, black budget projects for the intelligence/military/industrial complex. In fact a lot of the kind of operations going on around Littleton.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And this is from
       <a href="http://thecabin.net/stories/042799/col_0427990061.html">
        the mainstream news:
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Wayne N. Harris had the brains and leadership ability that the Air Force put to use in some of its most important programs, including development of the B-1B bomber and its newest electronic warfare aircraft now in use over Kosovo.
       </p>
       <p>
        Harris was more of a technical expert in the officer corps than one of its swaggering fighter pilots. But when the Air Force was looking to develop new planes, it called on him.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Harris had largely grown up on the grounds of sensitive air force facilities. The last would be Plattsburgh Air Force Base, where he was officially stationed until 1993, when it had
       <em>
        "officially"
       </em>
       closed. Curiously, the Plattsburgh Press-Republican reported that the Harrises remained on the base until 1996. Not only did this conflict with the official timeline, but it placed the family there
       <strong>
        <em>
         three years after it was 'decommissioned.'
        </em>
       </strong>
       Quinn said that he had established contact with one of Harris' friends in Plattsburgh, as well as a man who claimed to have been employed in some capacity at the base. The man said that Harris had been one of many children on the base who were drafted into mind control programs, and his friend claims that Harris complained of being forcibly drugged in experiments on the base.
      </p>
      <p>
       After moving to Littleton, Major Harris had officially retired from the military. He immediately found employment at
       <strong>
        Flight Safety Systems
       </strong>
       , which maintains contracts with the Defense Department. His ostensible role there was to train pilots to fly
       <strong>
        large refueling aircraft
       </strong>
       - precisely the kind used in military operations. Flight Safety Systems
       <a href="http://www.wpbf.com/news/911-terrorists-lived-plotted-in-south-florida/35227086">
        reportedly trained some of the 9/11 hijackers.

      <p>
       <a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread12182/pg1">
        Many interesting rumours surround this base.
       </a>
       It is said to have eighteen or more subterranean levels, and to be a site of ongoing mind control projects. It is said that many employees - including high-level technicians - were committed to a mental institution after being
       <em>
        "accused of acting violently and irrationally"
       </em>
       .

        JAMES HOLMES
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       James Holmes, who was accused of being the
       <em>
        "lone nut"
       </em>
       behind the massacre at the theatre, was the son of
       <strong>
        Dr. Robert Holmes.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Holmes was
       <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/07/23/james-holmes-6-reported-facts-about-the-alleged-aurora-shooter.html">
        described in the media
       </a>
       as
       <em>
        "a software manager who had authored studies for the Navy and Marine Corps."
       </em>
       From 2000 until 2002, he was working for HNC Software, which had grown out of
       <strong>
        the Stanford Research Institute
       </strong>
       and had been partnered with DARPA since 1998 on a project aimed at developing
       <em>
        "cortronic neural networks"
       </em>
       - allowing machines to think and interpret data like human beings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Holmes' grandfather was also a man who belonged to the military intelligence community.
       <strong>
        Lt. Col. Robert Holmes
       </strong>
       graduated from the Army Language School in 1948,

       </a>
       <em>
        "one of the first"
       </em>
       to be trained in the Turkish language. According to Wayne Madsen, formerly of the NSA and ONI:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Typically, U.S. military officers conversant in Turkish served with either the Defense Intelligence Agency or the Central Intelligence Agency at either the U.S. embassy in Ankara or the Consulate General in Istanbul, or both.

      <p>
       Interestingly, the Army Language School - later the Defense Language Institute - previously trained a number of individuals associated with some of the worst crimes of modern history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Among its alumni:
      </p>
      <p>
       -
       <strong>
        Lee Harvey Oswald
       </strong>
       , who was trained in the Russian language there shortly before
       <em>
        "defecting"
       </em>
       to the Soviet Union. New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison believed this was a part of an espionage project.

      <p>
       --
       <strong>
        Ralph Meyers
       </strong>
       , an operative of Army Intelligence who would be stationed at a U2 base in Turkey and who is believed by some researchers to have been the man who shot and killed
       <a href="http://www.jfkmurdersolved.com/MisterX.htm">
        Officer J.D. Tippit.

        Saeed Alghamdi

        trained there.

       Lastly, a postgraduate student at the Language School was said to be the covert
       <em>
        "handler"
       </em>
       inside the Manson Family:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Mae Brussell informed him that a Naval Intelligence agent named Nathaniel Dight had associated with Tex Watson prior to the murders... L. Ron Hubbard had been with Naval Intelligence. The Committee to Investigate Assassinations had linked Lee Harvey Oswald with Naval Intelligence! Even the infamous Zodiac killer had left obsolete Naval Intelligence ciphers. Dight, Brussell claimed, was a Postgraduate at the Navy's Monterey Language School --where only intelligence officers were admitted. Dight, she said, had used the cover of a 'hippie artist' while working as an undercover agent provocateur to infiltrate Charlie's Family.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to Brussell, Dight was the Manson Family's main drug supplier. After the murders, Dight, '... cut his hair, put his shoes back on...' and return to the Monterey Language School, setting aside his hippie guise, which had served its purpose. Prior to shedding these hippie trappings, Dight had done artwork for an 'undergroun'd magazine that, Brussell asserted, '... was a conduit for CIA funds for medical research in mind control, intelligence money for electrode implants and for LSD experiments, according to documents I got from the Pentagon.'

       According to the Napa Valley Sentinel, which published a series of articles on government mind control programs in 1991:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Mind control experiments have been part of California for decades and permeate mental institutions and prisons. But, it is not just in the penal society that mind control measures have been used. Minority children were subjected to experimentation at abandoned Nike Missile Sites, veterans who fought for American freedom were also subjected to the programs.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       ...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Director of the Neuropsychiatric Institute and chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at UCLA, Dr. Louis Jolyon West was selected to run the center. Dr. West is alleged to have been a contract agent for the CIA, who, as part of a network of doctors and scientists, gathered intelligence on hallucinogenic drugs, including LSD, for the super-secret MK-ULTRA program. Like Captain White (see part three of the series), West conducted LSD experiments for the CIA on unwitting citizens in the safehouses of San Francisco. He achieved notoriety for his injection of a massive dose of LSD into an elephant at the Oklahoma Zoo, the elephant died when West tried to revive it by administering a combination of drugs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dr. West was further known as the psychiatrist who was called upon to examine Jack Ruby, Lee Harvey Oswald's assassin. It was on the basis of West's diagnosis that Ruby was compelled to be treated for mental disorders and put on happy pills. The West examination was ordered after Ruby began to say that he was part of a right-wing conspiracy to kill President John Kennedy. Two years after the commencement of treatment for mental disorder, Ruby died of cancer in prison.
       </p>
       <p>
        After January 11, 1973, when Governor Reagan announced plans for the Violence Center, West wrote a letter to the then Director of Health for California, J. M. Stubblebine.
       </p>
       <p>
        "Dear Stub:
       </p>
       <p>
        "I am in possession of confidential information that the Army is prepared to turn over Nike missile bases to state and local agencies for non-military purposes. They may look with special favor on health-related applications.
       </p>
       <p>
        "Such a Nike missile base is located in the Santa Monica Mountains, within a half-hour's drive of the Neuropsychiatric Institute. It is accessible, but relatively remote. The site is securely fenced, and includes various buildings and improvements, making it suitable for prompt occupancy.
       </p>
       <p>
        "If this site were made available to the Neuropsychiatric Institute as a research facility, perhaps initially as an adjunct to the new Center for the Prevention of Violence, we could put it to very good use. Comparative studies could be carried out there, in an isolated but convenient location, of experimental or model programs for the alteration of undesirable behavior.

       . If true, and if he worked there, that is a huge deal. He is said to be "unstable" by his ex wife and father, correct? Not the guy I want near our nuclear power plants

       Most people probably saw that one coming. That's exactly what I expected when I heard about this shit this morning - that there would of course be some weird connection to  some shady private international security corporations, just like that odd fucking thing in San Bernadino where the real reports from witnesses and initial law enforcement was about multiple white males dressed in black fatigues carrying combat arms -- then suddenly it becomes a "muslim terrorist" thing with "1 male/1female muslim blah blah blah". In fact maybe the corps like Wackenhut have become infiltrated by terrorists -- isn't that something they'd want to do, seeing as corps. like that handle base security at secret military bases like area 51 test range?
      </p>
      <p>
       this is some kind of scam that goes beyond just "1 lone muslim". I knew it was a scam when they started posting "he called 911 to inform them that he was a terrorist right beforehand" - it's just such an obvious set up scam (just like the war in Iraq was, but nobody wanted to believe that at the time either because "murica patriotism fake WMD blah blah blah no one would lie to us about). Something worse than 1 angry muslim has been happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looks like we're seeing the modern equivalent of Operation Northwoods and Gladio happening -- in Florida no less, just like Operation Northwoods false flag violence was planned to be.

       Wackenhut provided him with firearms training, and with a license that allowed him to easily obtain the military-style assault weapons he is alleged to have used.
      </p>
      <p>
       They had
       <strong>
        nine years
       </strong>
       of access to him in the clandestine settings of the secure government facilities he would have been assigned to guard. This would have provided the
       <strong>
        <em>
         ideal
        </em>
       </strong>
       window of opportunity for programming.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, they would have had conducted a detailed
       <em>
        'background check'
       </em>
       on him and developed a detailed
       <em>
        'psychological profile.'
       </em>
       This is how firms like Wackenhut operate. They may even have been monitoring him until the assault as part of internal security.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is made all the more likely by the fact that he had reportedly been boasting of ties to terrorist groups
       <strong>
        <em>
         at work
        </em>
       </strong>
       and
       <strong>
        <em>
         to his co-workers
        </em>
       </strong>
       in 2013. This predictably resulted in calls to the FBI and an investigation that was closed without any action being taken. Why wasn't his employment terminated following this affair?

       From the same article:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        18 year terrorism expert and CIA analyst, William Corbett, stated "For years, Wackenhut has been involved with the CIA and other intelligence organizations, including the Drug Enforcement Agency. Wackenhut would allow the CIA to occupy positions within the company [in order to carry out] clandistine operations." He went on to say Wackenhut provided the intelligence agencies with information and was paid in return "in a quid pro quo arrangement". This would explain in part the huge number of contracts awarded to Wackenhut in delicate areas of the national security, such as embassies and nuclear plants, and the $150 million increase in work under the Reagan Administration.
       </p>
       <p>
        Wackenhut was also involved in illegal US operations in Central America in the 1980s. By exploiting the Cabazon Indian reservation as a sovereign nation, they intended to produce and export explosives to the Contras, evading Congressional law to the contrary.[7][8]
       </p>
       <p>
        The director of international operations at the time, Ernesto Bermudez, admitted to having 1,500 men in El Salvador doing "[t]hings you wouldn't want your mother to know about."
       </p>
       <p>
        According to Edward Herman and Gerry O'Sullivan in The Terrorism Industry (ISBN 0679725598), "Wackenhut quickly got involved with right-wing terrorists who were themselves linked to state security agents" in Belgium. They left in the early 1980s after some of their guards were accused of luring immigrant children into basements and beating them.

       It's obvious because we've figured out how it works, and we're talking to each other about it. It's pretty obvious when everyone is constantly pointing out to each other how this works. Our culture was just too naive before, and we have access to SO much more information now.

       I've been thinking about this today, and I think it's because most people get their news stories in written form on the internet now. Fewer people watch the live coverage, so they don't have to put as much effort into making that look real. And those of us who see how ridiculous their narrative is end up just looking crazy if we say something. They're confident in the public's willingness to trust the official story implicitly.
