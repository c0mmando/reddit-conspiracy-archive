<p>You would think it would be evident in his computer files/phone/books/writings. I don&#39;t think he needs to call up the cops and let them know why hes doing this, otherwise, its a very considerate thing to do so we can piece this together a little easier! Thanks shooter!</p>

The most people have said, to not offend those people scarred of losing their oh so precious second amendment, is that a specific bill should have been passed which keeps SUSPECTED TERRORISTS from purchasing weapons easily (but I mean of course that&#39;s totally unreasonable, and who would actually want that right?) and banning one specific military grade weapon from being in civilian hands at the very least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO this event was either manufactured, or it was real and the PTB are trying to shape and co-opt the narrative. Either way, the psy-op goal appears to be striking fear in the hearts of the public over: (i) terrorists, thereby adding to the depleting fuel for the War on Terror™, or; (ii) guns, which they hope will provide more public support of prohibiting the possession of firearms.</p>

<p>Yesterday, sometime in the early evening I saw this story being reported for the first time by RT. No one else has released any coverage. Usually when an event like this happens, the media is like an orchestra, everyone playing their parts of the same song. But I didn&#39;t see that yesterday. That made me think this was not planned.</p>

<p>If it was real, then given the numerous anomalies/peculiarities in the manner in which it has been reported, it&#39;s like the government <em>doesn&#39;t want to let a good mass shooting go to waste.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we already know what ISIS actually is.   So claiming you did it for ISIS is like claiming you did it for the CIA or the DOD.</p>

<p>Irony aside,  the American Extremists Fundamentalists were all ready to pounce,  making conclusive pronouncements within hours.    </p>

<p>At this point,  the reality is already a spectacle,  a myth in the making.    Any investigation at this point will just be icing on the cake for an agenda that is already clear.</p>

<p>Too bad,  because the truth about this guy,  where he worked,   what he did,  will be increasingly difficult to expose,  no matter which way it points.</p>

<p>In other words,  there is already a story that is more important than the facts.    This has been the pattern since Oklahoma City.   So the effect on society cannot be nuanced.   Instead society is being steered into an inappropriate and probably crude response to a myth,  not a considered/measured response to factual details.</p>

Amedy Coulilbady, the third terrorist (who held hostages in a Paris Kosher supermarket) managed to find find the time to conduct an interview on French radio during the siege.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll believe it if the audio of the phonecall ever shows up. I found it strange that they only started saying he made a phone call over 12 hours later when he supposedly made it before the attack. If it was true it would have been blasted on the media as an Isis attack from the beginning.</p>

<p>Funny thing is, where is the main fighting right now? In Syria.</p>

<p>And what happened there?
The US couldnt do what they wanted because the Russians kicked their asses there.</p>

<p>So, this happens and you know the drill, somehow, soon, the shooter will be the justification to &quot;fight&quot; ISIS and the rest is very scary, if the Russians don&#39;t take it.</p>

<p>* Mateen called 911 around the time of the attack to pledge allegiance to ISIS and mentioned the Boston bombers, according to a U.S. official.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Orlando authorities said they consider the violence an act of domestic terror. The FBI is involved.  While investigators are exploring all angles, they &quot;have suggestions the individual has leanings towards (Islamic terrorism), but right now we can&#39;t say definitely,&quot; said Ron Hopper, assistant special agent in charge of the FBI&#39;s Orlando bureau. </p>

<p>Authorities are also looking into the possibility the attack was a hate crime, a law enforcement source told CNN.</p>

<p>From what I understand, the ISIS policy on &quot;lone wolf&quot; attackers is that they just have to pledge allegiance at some point in order to be considered ISIS warriors. As much was said in Spring 2015 by ISIS leaders. They will claim attackers who claim them. You do not need to &quot;ask for permission&quot;. That&#39;s why you see these individuals pledging allegiances mere hours before committing these acts -- an MO we will likely see more commonly from here on out.</p>
