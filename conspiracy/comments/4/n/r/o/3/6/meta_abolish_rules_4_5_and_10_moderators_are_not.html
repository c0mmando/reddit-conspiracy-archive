<p>Explain to me how the decoration of insulty-ness adds to the communicative value of an exchange, other than to provide an indicator of perspective?  If you need it to indicate your own relative position to the subject matter, fine.  Why not?  It&#39;s just accurate communication.  Used typically as a Response of Last Resort, it  pollutes the debate past a certain point.  Removing it removes all the pointless decorations that spawn from this.  It typically distracts from the core theme, as it moves the discussion from the topic to the people discussing it.  There is meta value in this sure, but again, spammyness tends to pollute.     </p>

<p>If the mods didn&#39;t remove needlessly offensive comments from trolls and disruptors, this sub would descend into anarchy very quickly, because one insult invariably begets another, and another. These rules mean that the mods also remove comments from regular/legit users, which is regrettable, but we have to be consistent.</p>

<p>If <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was a closed (private) sub, then your suggestion might be workable, but as things stand, the sub would be overrun with trolls if it wasn&#39;t actively moderated.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll let you into a secret - that&#39;s not the main reason the sub has these rules. For some people, the material on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> can be controversial, threatening and anger provoking. The &quot;no personal abuse&quot; rules are designed to keep discussions on topic by keeping them civil. An insulting comment invariably generates an even more abusive response, and this creates a thread which is no more than an exchange of insults - like a cancerous limb. If we don&#39;t have these rules, and enforce them, it is too easy for trolls, shills, TMORons and other pondlife to derail discussions.</p>

<p>In the past, the mods have discussed suspending all the sub/sidebar rules or a period to see what would happen (note: we can&#39;t suspend reddit site rules). I&#39;m not convinced a &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; type experiment would teach us anything we don&#39;t know already.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not true potato-rudder. The fact that they are moderators allows them to remove any post for any reason. The fact that they show us those removal logs means they are attempting to be transparent about this moderation. Perhaps you&#39;re just an ass-cheesing monkey-globber.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t like the &quot;attacking this sub&quot; clause.  Other than that, I say just add more specifics (probably in a new link) to avoid abuses.  As things stand nobody gets banned for &quot;you&#39;re fucking stupid&quot;-level insults.  Stalking and intentionally debasing the quality of discussion here by intentionally trolling <em>should</em> be banned, just better define the latter.  Other than the &quot;attacking this sub&quot; part of #10, I think it just needs clearer guidelines.  Easy enough.  One mod writes up a draft, they all get input on additions to or subtractions from the terms and then they vote on it (I suggest a super-majority of 60%-2/3rds requirement to accept it).</p>
