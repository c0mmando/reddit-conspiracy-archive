       Oh well.  Can't say I'm surprised.  It was filthy tactic after filthy tactic the whole way, but what can you expect from a corrupt, criminal candidate like hillary and the history she represents?  If she doesn't get indicted I will fully believe the general will be rigged in her favor.  And after that I'll just be saying my prayers because it's going to be one hell of a ride.

       Somewhat off topic, but anyone else betting there will be some kind of special event sometime this month?  Maybe the 16th or the 26th?

       Euro 2016 is about to start in France. I will be very surprised if nothing malicious happens...

       And as per HC, I think every

       subscriber knew that Bernie never had a chance. I mean there's still the convention in July, but let's be honest with ourselves - he is NOT getting the nomination, ever. Just as HC will never get indicted.

       You're doing the shills' work for them, though. Or, better yet. The shills worked you, and you're now their worker bot.

      <p>
       I don't mean to imply you're mindless or anything, or even wrong. You're probably right. But it really doesn't help morale and it negatively effects public opinion to talk like that... Kinda in the exact same way that some super delegates did the same thing by declaring Hillary the winner before she actually was.

       no because taxes and laws are good and so is the government in general, just some criminals trying to grab power for themselves (and for their wives and sons) and private corporations trying to
       <em>
        use
       </em>
       the system of government for themselves aren't great, but they aren't "the government".
      </p>
      <p>
       comparing our lives to the shit existence that came before us, before our government and states, we are doing pretty good for ourselves in a lot of ways. those laws and taxes would look pretty good if suddenly all the prisons were emptied and all the cops went home. You'd just start calling for laws and taxes again if suddenly they went away.
      </p>
      <p>
       humans are dangerous creatures, we need laws and we need law enforcement agencies, and they need taxes to function.

       luckily Al Gore was Dubya's frat brother and fellow Bonesman, so he didn't make too much of a stink about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       just like Trump is a clinton family campaign donor and friend, they set up false opposition scams every 4 years to provide the masses with fake political difference using caricatures like Obama/Romney, or Gore/Bush II, or Trump/Clinton II in a theater of democracy where all the acts are there but that's all it is - an act.
      </p>
      <p>
       a few billionaire families and social climbers like the bush/clintons get to fight over whose name gets recorded in the history books that year, just like the old princes of europe -- in reality, all those princes were family to each other, incestuous and intermarried, and the wars  were just the big business of the time - which is why they exile each other or take each other back into the fold after winning rather than doing anything else.

       Well he may have had a chance, it was called "make the rigging scandal viral" - it's the only argument he could make against clinton that wouldnt make him sound bitter to the major population (yes, there are a lot of reasons not to vote clinton or even jail her, but if he was to speak them in the current setting it would come off as "jealous").

       In regards to the election, it's the same damn thing every 4 years.  It has been obvious that Hillary will be president for a couple years now.  Each time a candidate emerges who has obviously been vetted by the super elite (central bankers, heads of industry, etc).  Then the following pattern escalates through these levels as necessary:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         They receive a disproportionate amount of air time on the MSM for the amount of support that they actually have.  Polls are also rigged in their favor to make others believe that they are the candidate to support.  This was more or less all that was necessary for Obama in the last two elections.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If #1 is not enough, shady practices occur at primary and even general election precincts.  We saw this happening to minimize support for Ron Paul in 2008.  This also occurred for George W in 2000 and 2004.  We have seen this with Hillary in the primaries.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If all of the above are not enough, the election can be rigged using the closed source Diebold voting machines.  This most likely occurred in the general election in 2004 for George W.  There were news stories (more so from international news outlets) about precincts that reported more votes for George W than the total number of votes that occurred there, but these stories quickly disappeared as the media celebrated how the country had rallied behind George W by giving him the popular vote as well as the win.

          Check this out if you don't believe this could happen.
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       If you pay attention, you will see this happening again and again every 4 years.  The election is a complete farce.

       There are several big questions that need answers here.  The first is why the former news agency known as the Associated Press (AP) has assumed the role of PR/spokesperson for Hillary Clinton, and why other news outlets are going along with the charade that AP is somehow authorised to "declare" that Hillary has won the nomination, as if AP were also the authorised voice of the Democratic Party itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second is that the APs declaration is not based on certainty. It is premature, and thus clearly designed to affect voter behaviour and perceptions in the final primaries. The APs telephone polling of superdelegates is not exactly binding on the Democratic Party. How the superdelegates will vote cannot be known for certain until the Convention itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, I want to know why so many other mainstream news outlets are reporting AP's "declaration" as a fact, before the race has been decided. Here in the UK, the Guardian, BBC, even Channel 4 news are repeating the APs declaration that "Hillary is the Democratic Party nominee" without questioning it or making it clear to readers/viewers that this is an
       <strong>
        unofficial, projected result
       </strong>
       , based on what some individuals may have said (but quite possibly didn't) over the telephone to Hillary's new PR firm.

        snide retort
       </a>
       to any criticism about the ethics of it all:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        AP concluded that Hillary Clinton had enough delegates to clinch the nomination after a painstaking but very straightforward exercise.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         We counted.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        By Monday evening, 571 superdelegates had told us unequivocally that they intend to vote for Clinton at the convention. Adding that number to the delegates awarded to Clinton in primary and caucus voting to date gave her the number needed to be the presumptive nominee.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         That is news, and reporting the news is what we do.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Nothing in that discourages or prevents voters in six states from exercising their right to go to the polls today and cast their ballots.

       I mean seriously, are they delusional or what? Here I was, thinking AP was an impartial and official source of current events and news. Hell, they do all of the vote counting in primary states (it's where every other news source gets their numbers). And then they pull this shit?

       A mix between propaganda by the AP and a lack of fact checking by the other news outlets that quote that article (malicious or otherwise, look up the media ownership info-graphic as a quick reference) is the cause of that.

       Investigative journalism, where a journalist investigates a story before compiling it into an article, is a lost art due to the costs to acquire such articles against the simplicity of reporting (article regurgitation).

       Sanders put up a good fight.  Webb and Chafee were eliminated after one debate.  O'Malley should have been the "safe" opposition didn't last long.  Sanders only got in after the "draft Warren" movement fell apart.

       Ultimately Clinton and Trump will do the same thing.  The main difference is that Trump is in the game for himself, and Hillary is happy to do whatever she is paid to do.  Reform is off the table for another cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I'm thinking that Hillary might work out better simply because she hasn't got another eight years, you can't fool mother nature or father time.  Her health has been failing for 2-3 years, and it takes about 8 years for your body to shut itself down.  If she's elected she'll stroke out within 2-3 years.  Its a job that kills healthy people, and she has a personality that invites complications and struggle.

       I think no matter what she'll be a Jimmy Carter-esque one-term president, who has a horrible term--probably with a serious depression/recession starting late 2016-2017--to be followed by at least 3 terms of Republican Presidents. It all fits within the 40 year cycle.

       I'm hoping he sits on his hands while applauding.  I don't think it matters now, reform is off the table until 2018 - 2020.  They can't keep the charade going that long, we'll be in some sort of "Inverted Martial Law" by then.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bernie is old and doesn't have much of a career left.  I think that the reason why he is pushing so hard right now is that he's going to do as much as he can to change the party then is going to hang it up after the election.  I don't think it will work, he crossed Hillary and is dead to the party as long as she is running it.  The knives will be out for him in DC no matter how this election goes.
      </p>

       He can go back to Vermont and be an elder-statesman.

       I'd have way less problems living under a figure like Putin or Assad, who's become one with the nation over time, than having to deal with the mental rape of the sheer hipocrisy and delusional denial involved with having a fake choice in a criminally dishonest system like 'muricah. Same shit, different taste.

       God, please, this is far worse than a dictatorship. They fucking hate North Korea, but making your son (Bush) or wife (Clinton) president for 8 years is the exact same nepotistic horseshit.

       it's funny because i have friends that still defend the system.  how she won and how she had the votes.  how the superdelegates are all the DNC fault and how we need to hold our officials responsible.
      </p>
      <p>
       i agree with them to an extent but all of this was rigged from the git go.  i sure can blame the DNC but who had the most to gain from delegates?  this is all planned way before anyone throws their hat in the ring.
      </p>
      <p>
       how do we hold officials responsible when donors buy them out the second they decide to run?  wait 4 years to vote someone else in or get fired from a job because you dedicate your time to recalling ONE cog in the political meat grinder.
      </p>
      <p>
       it's impossible and the system is working the way it was meant to work.   people will blame voter apathy and low turn out for politicians we have in office. but, imo, that's just a by product of the system fucking you everyday it can.

       The Do Nothing Party (72%) with no platform wins again by a landslide. From what I've gathered here, the higher that % climbs, then the closer they get to their ultimate goal...100% non-participation...at which point I assume some sort of new or refurbished Constitution will be introduced. Not sure how that will be achieved without voting, although I get the impression they don't give a flip for democracy, but rather something something anarcho-capitalism (libertarianism?).

       I have left reddit for
       <a href="https://voat.co/">
        Voat
       </a>
       due to years of admin mismanagement and preferential treatment for certain subreddits and users holding certain political and ideological views.
      </p>
      <p>
       The situation has gotten especially worse since the appointment of Ellen Pao as CEO, culminating in the seemingly unjustified firings of several valuable employees and bans on hundreds of vibrant communities on completely trumped-up charges.
      </p>
      <p>
       The resignation of Ellen Pao and the appointment of Steve Huffman as CEO, despite initial hopes, has continued the same trend.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an act of protest, I have chosen to redact all the comments I've ever made on reddit, overwriting them with this message.
      </p>
      <p>

       Jews in control of every news organization that participated in Monday's betrayal of democracy.  They don't give a shit that Bernie's a Jew... the Jews in control of our media are there to create consensus for war.  And Hillary's their gal.

       I totally agree.  The media handed Hillary the nomination by declaring her the winner despite the fact that Super Delegates can't vote until the convention.  Basically, they declared a winner based on a POLL, not a vote.  That's BS

       Placing blame on an ideology only alienates people, gives you someone to blame, and get angry about. You say liberals destroyed this country? I'd say conservatives destroyed it with two terms of president bush, and two unjustified wars in the middle east.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people who have ruined this country are on the same team. The fact that it os 2016, and people still think we have a choice when it comes to voting baffles me. You're leaders have been chosen for you. It is not his or her fault, it's yours and it's mine, because the only time we give a shit is during an election year.

       The super elite are on an entirely different level. When you make more in interest a year than most CEOs salaries, you are on an entirely different level.

       I agree with your entire comment except for the fact that conservatives and republicans are not the same thing. Conversatives wouldn't start a war in the middle east, because they're

       Thats the point! They claim to be something; "liberal/conservative" to get us to choose sides. You agree with my intier statement except for the part where i criticize the ideology you get behind.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could say the same thing about liberals as in "Liberals dont want perpetual war; they're liberals, and want peace." But the people who we've had to choose from and get to choose from this election cycle are all apart of the same team, the labels they place on themselves are only there for us.

       Calling Bush a conservative is like calling Hillary a liberal. They're both neo-cons.

       No, not liberals.  Fascists from both sides.  You have to understand something: the two party system is all political theater, bread and circuses--theres' a group of aristocrats who want a one-world government and they are actually, provably quite different in their private beliefs and affiliations than you think.  The underpinnings of this 'one party' group that has flavors of dem or repub, hip or yup, is
       <em>
        alchemy.
       </em>
       The Clintons are close friends with Henry Kissinger, a known empire globalist neocon.

       I know that's hard to take but there's mountains of proof.  These people have a secret network of power called the freemasons that connects them all, from the american ruling class secret society affiliates like yales skull and bones or scroll and key societies to masonic affiliates rotary club to kiwanis international, lion's club, fraternal order of police, etc; these are all fraternal orgs with a similar structure and form a network of distribution of power from the highmost levels (Knights Templar Masons, Knights of Malta Masons, And Royal Arch Masons) to the lowmost levels (fop, rotary, lions).  The lowmost levels are charity orgs that receive funding from masonic orgs as a way to distribute to the community and act as outreach buffer to make masonic orgs appear in society to be so helpful that any kind of 'nefarious activity' they would be accused of being engaged in to be "utterly preposterous"... (ie: 'they build burn wards for children...how dare you accuse them of kidnapping children').
      </p>

       Freemasons believe in alchemy.  They are derived from rosicrucianism.  I dont have to prove this as it's been done time and again and you need only to look for it (remember the 'davinci code'?  Much of dan browns work was actually historical)
