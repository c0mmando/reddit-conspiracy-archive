    <div class="md"><p>Democracies are shit... indeed.</p>

<p>So... you are, of course, looking at the huge number of failed direct democracies, littered through history.</p>

<p>Oh wait... they are RARE.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s see... there are three major ones I can think of...</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Ancient Athens - Birthplace of Solon, Pericles, Socrates, Pythagoras, Aristotle, Plato... Did not self destruct... was conquered by Alexander the Great.</p></li>
<li><p>Iroquois nation - Most successful tribe in the NorthEast... or, rather, confederation of democratic tribes. They were one of the only Indian Nations able to repel the Conquerors who invaded... for a time...</p></li>
<li><p>Switzerland - One of the most prosperous places on Earth.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Our founders were sold that line about democracies being shit, in order to convince them to form a republic, instead of a place of &quot;mob rule&quot;. Almost all scholarly work on government is done by the elite and elitist institutions. They have a clear bias against direct democracy that it simply does not deserve.</p>

<p>The chief flaw... the fatal flaw in MOST governing systems is the reliance on a simple majority instead of a consensus model. It does not matter whether you use a majority rule system in a representative or direct system. It is the same flaw in both cases.</p>

<p>150,000,001 people should not be able to get their way over the objection of 150,000,000... that is mob rule... but to move it one step away, and elect people to do the same thing... it doesn&#39;t address the mob rule problem... it simply changes to a &quot;mob of elitist dickheads&quot; instead of a mob of &quot;average joes&quot;.</p>

<p>You can take a course on Ancient Athens from Yale for free on YouTube. A direct democracy would be the obvious thing to try, if we got really fed up with &quot;The Republic&quot;... except people are convinced that it won&#39;t work.</p>

<p>This is such an easily dispelled myth, and it is IMPORTANT, in my humble opinion, because there is a real chance that a consensus model direct democracy would work better than a republic...</p>

<p>... I grew up thinking that direct democracy was destined to fail, and I never gave it a rigorous examination. Upon examination, I was proven to be the most incompetent boob.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-california-primary-more-californians-are-expected-to-vote-1465312484-htmlstory.html">5 million Californians are expected to vote by mail</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/california-voter-registration-surges-in-advance-of-primary-223903">Secretary of State Alex Padilla announced that <strong>17,915,053</strong> Californians had registered to vote, &quot;the highest ever total statewide voter registration heading into a primary election.&quot;</a></p>

<p>bottom line: i was mistaken about the 9mm NEW voters.  but the total number of people registered to vote in California nearly 18mm</p>

<p>... and only 4mm ACTUALLY voted ?!  (even though &quot;5 million Californians are expected to vote by mail&quot; ?!?!)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fresnobee.com/news/state/california/article82580307.html">Los Angeles County reported the highest number of provisional ballots ever cast in a primary — 240,000, compared with 50,000 in 2012 and 176,000 in 2008, when turnout surged.</a></p>

<p>so in spite of massive influx of new voters, an invigorated voter base, and record numbers of mail in votes... overall voter turnout was flat -- on par with 2008.</p>
