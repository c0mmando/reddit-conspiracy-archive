       This is truly absurd.
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news

       makes international headlines for being censors and the admins back them up and punish
       <a href="/r/the_donald">
        /r/the_donald

       for filling the vacuum and fulfilling the demand for real uncensored information about the attack in Orlando.

       Also I hope the users of conspiracy will understand that we will no longer be able to use stickies for posts made by non-mods or even our AMA guests.  We will have to find another way.  You can thank the admins for this horrible change.

       Yep. I was banned for calling Trump a moron and a con-man. I understand and accept the ban, and they have a right to censor their little sub, but that kind of bias is transparent and admitted. They don't owe anyone an apology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit's News sub is not supposed to be tainted by bias... but it is... ALL of Reddit is. The fact that they deny this is criminal.

      <p>
       Yeah, which is why I don't blame them for banning me. My comment did have other analysis and my reasoning behind calling him a con-man and moron. My point was that they do in fact censor. I was corroborating a claim with my experience.

       I did at the time. That was during the primaries. It was months ago. I'm banned for life from that one comment. Am I supporting the Establishment GOP? Fuck no. Those pussies can go to hell. I wanted to vote for someone who made a career of fighting the establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Am I voting for Trump now? Probably. I don't see anyone else coming along. I just think Trump will be a dumber version of George Bush and he'll be talked into doing stupid shit by Democrats and the Establishment GOP. He'll betray us.

       I was shadowbanned from the_donald because I explained how the  drivers license and a car analogy isn't equal to the second amendment.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The car analogy doesn't work. You do not need a drivers license to own, purchase or drive a car on private property. You only need it for driving on government maintained, publicly funded roads.
You also do not have a constitutional right to convenient transportation.
You do have a right to own a firearm. And that right, shall not be infringed. It was written clearly, by framers who spent the previous decade fighting a war against a tyrannical government who did everything possible to disarm its rebellious citizenry.
Creating financial and bureaucratic hurdles is infringement. No different than requiring a permit and a test before you can post on the internet."

       That is what is going down. You'll be seeing extreme heavy-handedness, a mass increase in censorship  - led by the PRIVATE SECTOR in the near future. Indeed, the changes noted above are likely part of this "anti-Hate speech" agenda that was introduced by Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Facebook and others, and will spread like a virus across the web.

       You're right, the Internet is the same thing as a gun. Thankfully we don't think that way in my country, so I don't have to worry about being shot, or cower in fear with my gun in my hand so the "bad guys" and "terrorists" can't come get me.

       Oh I never said any of that. Thank you for making assumptions. I am pro-gun control, but from a theoretical stand-point, human beings are themselves are the most dangerous weapon around. That's how ISIS can inspire people across the world to commit violent actions from their twitter account.

       Human beings can certainly be a dangerous weapon, but I would much rather face off against a man than a man with a knife, and I would much rather face off against a man with a knife than a man with a gun.

       Shootings wouldn't happen as often if guns weren't as available.
       <br/>
       Texas has enough problems, I remember Waco, do you?
       <br/>
       They happen in gun free zones because no one will fight back, duh.
       <br/>
       You don't. Just don't sell more and ban ammunition.
       <br/>
       I guess you get a knife cowboy.
       <br/>
       Mass stabbing a are a lot harder to pull off than a mass shooting. Otherwise the cops would carry knives.
       <br/>
       China isn't the US. We don't kill our own citizens with tanks.
       <br/>
       No, that's silly.
       <br/>
       All ideology is like religion. Gun fervor is no different.
       <br/>
       I am not afraid, but I do know how to review evidence and arrive at a conclusion. More guns = more shootings. It's a fact.

       Stabbings wouldn't go through the roof because stabbing someone is a lot harder than shooting them.
       <br/>
       Texas is also the largest state, with plenty of open and rural  spaces. Chicago and Austin are very different cities man.
       <br/>
       You can't 3d print metal.
       <br/>
       Stabbing are harder because guns are better at killing. Thats why mass shootings are more common than mass stabbings.
       <br/>
       You knives to cook dinner. What purpose does a gun serve other than killing people? Quit trying to make an equivalence between knives and guns. There's a reason mass shooters use an AR and not a machete.
       <br/>
       There's plenty of evidence to support that claim. The US has the most shootings and the most guns. Basic math.

The default subs have been heavily manipulated for many years.  It's not that it's OK, it's just that this is nothing new.  It's already been that way.

       Because I was saying how Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump are best for this country and how we need to do anything to prevent the establishment candidates like Hillary and Bush, Cruz, and Rubio from winning.  And how Bernie/Trump debates and race would be best for the country.

       Didn't they have a segment where this programmer for the electoral vote said that there's a way to rig an election that'll be unnoticed by anyone but the person who implemented the program . 
Had an uncle who ran for mayor in a small city in Mexico and he had the majority vote up until the lights "magically" went out and the vote changed from 23% v 56% to a 49% v 40% . It was primary party (PRI) vs third party (Verde).

      <p>
       Imagine if every politician from every country would do the same vote manipulation thingy; Reddit would not be anything else just political circlejerk (yes, there are a lot of countries on Reddit, from every continent). I am much more interested about technology, music, movies, jokes, games, whatever. Just not about them... ☺

       I get the reference but it would make more sense to render it as "They, Reddit, They" or "She, Reddit, She".  Well, that's what I think whenever I see it, even though I get the absurdity of saying "the" randomly makes it funnier, along with how much the average American associates German with Nazism.

       Honestly I don't know what to think anymore. I think this was their goal all along. Once people move past Reddit then where will they go?  Reddit is imploding but it's sad to think of what it could have been. Reddit used to be ANTI-SOPA / ANTI NSA but now everything is fucked. They are dividing in order Reddit  to concur and silence.

       Someone will start another site that catches momentum and be a bastion of hope... and then it'll get bigger and have enough traffic to come under the eye of corporations and the gov, and money offers will be made that can't be refused.  It'll go public and there will be hot potato chairmen of the board swaps until the original guys are  out and the new vision is complete.  If it doesn't go public, then people get suicided or fired and lies are manufactured until the control moves into the "proper" hands.

       But the scheme is so brilliant that it will need no government intervention.

      <p>
       Corporatism, under whatever name, is about to "come out" as a governmental body - controlling access to information, opinion and thought, not by law, but by policy.

       Spez is a complete unadulteraed sellout. Redditors don't matter as much as management decided [profiteering] concerns will dominate from here on out.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is only a matter of time before reddit rests in the same boneyard as AOL, Yahoo, Myspace and all the other websites that sold their users down the river for quick money in the bank account.
      </p>
      <p>
       And just like AOL, Yahoo, Myspace - a new better thing will come along and reddit will be the laughing stock of the internet past.
      </p>
      <p>
       Huffman needs to get his money now and get out fast. I give reddit about 2 years before the ship really sinks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good for Huffman. Bad for reddit. But everything really is all about the money isn't it? Integrity, truth and morals don't pay the fucking penthouse rent.

       What's this? His original post about thread stickies is gone  and this is what remains? He's a lying snake-in-the-grass.

       Wrong. Use uneddit and look at the content of the deleted comments. There was valuable, life saving information in there, and the info was published EARLY. They deleted it once it was known he was of Muslim faith, and while I can understand why (hatred solves nothing), censoring has the opposite effect.

       this is how the NWO is going to take over. They're going to have puppet women and minorities in positions of "power". If you call them out, they will label you as a "bigot" or "racist".

       They are often touching on subjects that are important, but no other subreddits can gain the momentum to talk about those subjects/articles/events, what have you. So we end up with

The Donald Reddit is allowing blatant lies to be used in titles with no corrobation in the posts.  People are too damn lazy to actually read what is posted....so, the titles stick.  This can't be good.  Neither can the censorship.  I don't know what the answer is, but Reddit seems pretty shit right now to me....

       My post here

       was just on the front page of
       <a href="/r/wtf">
        /r/wtf
       </a>
       not even an hour ago. That is to say - just one hour after posting, my thread was removed from the front page of
       <a href="/r/wtf">
        /r/wtf
       </a>
       . Now it is not even on the second or third page. As you can judge from the first few pages of
       <a href="/r/wtf">
        /r/wtf
       </a>
       , it does not take many points to reach the front page, nor to stay there.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't the first time this has happened to me. Last time I posted a picture of Rhodesia to
       <a href="/r/pics">
        /r/pics
       </a>
       , it was completely SFW. I was shadowbanned, no warning, no message, no nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other time I posted an offensive joke to
       <a href="/r/ImGoingToHellForThis">
        /r/ImGoingToHellForThis
       </a>
       and my post was removed. When I messaged the mods asking why they muted me and didn't respond.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no other subreddit to post this to. They have complete control over the entire website.

       Do you know how tiresome it is to see the inane thedonald sub posts littering the front page. It's fucking obtuse bullshit over and over and over again. I wouldn't vote for that giant orange piece of shit if you paid me and Clinton is just as worthless.
I question the american people's mental stability as a whole due to these two fucksticks being your goddamned candidates for the most powerful office in the free world. Seriously America, what the fuck is wrong with you?

       We DID vote in Bush and Obama... twice. Ron Paul wasn't stupid/shitty enough to vote for so we ignored him. So now we're left with the scum of the bottom of the barrel.

       With that said, Trump is the only candidate we've had in a long time saying some of the "correct" things and pointing out legitimate problems with plans to solve them. That's why he's getting my vote.

       I have some evidence for you right here, they have a shit ton of users on an automod shadowban list simply for their opinions on other subreddits.

       Go ahead, look at their automod.  look at what happens when I post on
