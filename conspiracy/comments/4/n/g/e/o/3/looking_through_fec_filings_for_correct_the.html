        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>While perusing the FEC filings for certain SUPER-PACs and their affiliates I came across some weird pay outs. (there&#39;s multiple other questionable payments by CTR, just start looking if you are interested). I began doing this prior to the CTR announcement of the $1 million dollar investment into online ‘efforts’  </p>

<p>I was curious who exactly the PAC was paying and for what. There was the general food and travel stuff, but then I noticed some other payouts that were large. For each payout I would then look into the group or LLC if it was not something I had heard of previously. I found a lot of interesting things.  </p>

<p>The thing is, it does no good for this to just sit, I have spent way to much time exploring and researching. But I do not have the ability to get this into the hands of those who will be able to actively look into at a greater depth.
Needless to say it is enlightening while still raising more questions than answers. I hope that you will all share it and possible get the right people to start asking questions.  </p>

<p>I didn’t begin looking into this because ‘Bernie Lost’ although I’m sure this post will end up in <a href="/r/enoughsandersspam">/r/enoughsandersspam</a> <a href="/r/TopMindsofreddit">/r/TopMindsofreddit</a>, or other places accusing of conspiracies. I began looking into it because I strongly feel that the massive amounts of money being funneled into politics/campaigns/pacs is eroding the very foundation of our Republic.  </p>

<p>By visting the FEC filing search page I began looking through Correct the Records disbursements via :<br/>
<a href="http://www.fec.gov/fecviewer/CandidateCommitteeDetail.do">http://www.fec.gov/fecviewer/CandidateCommitteeDetail.do</a> and would pull out any LLCs or companies I was not familiar with and look them up.  </p>

<p>The first questionable finding was this: <a href="http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?201604159012556720">http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?201604159012556720</a>  </p>

<p>&quot;Luca Strategy Group, LLC&quot;  </p>

<p>Paid $30,000 on 3/31/2016  </p>

<p>Address: 3007 19th St S, Arlington Virginia 22204 (a residential house, so the LLC was incorporated out of a home, two weeks prior to a payment of $30,000 right before the increased online effort announcement)  </p>

<p>According to the Commonwealth of Virginia &quot; State Corporation Commission&quot; records This LLC was incorporated on 3/16/2016, two weeks prior to payment by Correct the Record.  </p>

<p>The name of record for that group was formerly with the Bonner Group a group renowned for its fundraising.
But her husband has a long history of working within IT and is the COO of a “industry leading IT government consulting firm”, prior to that though he also appears to have a good bit of experience working in blackhat SEO (this was found through some google-fu I would rather not share, but you can find it if you look).  </p>

<p>This is just an example of some of the things I found, additional groups dealing with online strategy &amp; consulting: digital consulting firms that specifically work on brand management and community control in online forums etc, and provide subscription services to the software to manage such efforts  </p>

<p>Blue State Digital, or  </p>

<p>Rising Tide, or  </p>

<p>$13,000 to Angelo Carusone for digital and online consulting, (same guy who created the massive twitter effort to remove sponsors from Glen Beck, the leader of the “Stop Rush [Limbaugh]” Campaign, vice president of Media Matters A David Brock creation for ‘news’ and a general online attack dog. He was paid this amount, again, right before the large online effort by CTR  </p>

<p>$100,000 to the Franklin Forum  </p>

<p>These are just a few examples and dont even include the American Bridge for the 21st century PAC (but they overlap some)…go ahead explore some of the others and see what they do.  </p>

<p>The most interesting to me was this group:  </p>

<p>Forward Solution Strategy Group  </p>

<p>Forward Solution Strategy Group: <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/expends/vendor.php?year=2016&amp;amp;amp;amp;vendor=Forward+Solution+Strategy+Group">https://www.opensecrets.org/expends/vendor.php?year=2016&amp;amp;amp;amp;vendor=Forward+Solution+Strategy+Group</a>
Paid: $16,236.42 on 3/16/16 and over $220,000 in the last year. Again, right around the &#39;$1 million dollar online effort&#39; by CTR.  </p>

<p>Now Forward Solutions Strategy has no webpage. There is a Forward Solutions, which is apparently based in the Philippines]  </p>

<p>(<a href="http://www.forward.ph/">http://www.forward.ph/</a>), and I am not sure if that is the same company but doubt it, regardless that is not where payment was sent. Again payment was sent to a house in Virginia (which can be seen on the FEC docs).  </p>

<p>People who own the house have something to do with work visas and H1B, this company (Forward Solutions Strategy) has the same listed address of record as Sky Technologies, (you can see the same residential home address listed in the FEC filings). This LLC is the company of record for 22 H1B visas All for &quot;computer programmers or IT positions  </p>

<p>One of the names associated with this company (a husband and wife) appears to have been with the Department of Justice (DOJ) as a program management specialist at some point (or maybe still)  </p>

<p>My questions:  </p>

<p>Why is Correct the Record paying these two LLCs at home addresses, and why is Sky Technologies hiring a ton of H1B computer programmers?  </p>

<p>Is anyone else associated with this company, Forward Solution Strategy Group?<br/>
This company is also incorporated in Arkansas. look it up here: <a href="http://www.arkansascorporates.com/">http://www.arkansascorporates.com/</a>  </p>

<p>which is also backed up by the state of Virginia&#39;s LLc records; Here - <a href="https://sccefile.scc.virginia.gov/Business/T056375">https://sccefile.scc.virginia.gov/Business/T056375</a></p>

<p>*The person listed as the chief officer is also the EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CORRECT THE RECORD, (who has already been paid by CTR through salary)<br/>
 <a href="http://correctrecord.org/correct-the-record-executive-director-isaac-wright-wins-40-under-40-award/">http://correctrecord.org/correct-the-record-executive-director-isaac-wright-wins-40-under-40-award/</a>  </p>

<p>Why would Correct the Record be paying a business owned and operated by the executive director of Correct the Record, that also just so happens to be working with a company (out of the same Virginia address [a residential home] as a company hiring H1b employees (22 apparently) with computer programming skills?  </p>

<p>Personally, I think its all just a little weird, but that is why I am sharing with everyone. Maybe its some thing, maybe it is not. But it is intriguing enough for others to continue looking into this. I am not saying these companies are hiring shills, I am not saying they are utilizing computer and IT employees on H1B visas to do other things. I just thought the whole set up was weird. Again, I am not qualified to make a judgement, but i figured someone on here might like to assist or look into this further.  </p>

<p>I believe SUPER-PACS such as these are bad for democracy and bad for America. Thats why I got curious, and thats why I am sharing now.
edits: for formatting  </p>

<p>edit2: just another fun read in case no one else has heard about the drama over at the hillary sub I have my own suspicions about who exactly that account(s) belong too which seem to be backed up by other research, but thats another post and not necessarily one for this sub. I include it here, as i think it is relevant to David Brock and the SUPER-PACS (hint, hint)  </p>
