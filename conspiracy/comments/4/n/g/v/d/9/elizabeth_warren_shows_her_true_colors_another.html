       That's a possibiltity but if she wanted to be president then why wouldn't she run in the first place instead of saying she had no interest in being president? I think she would have easily won the nomination over Hilldog and Mr. Gutman.

       She didn't want to step on Bernie's toes I guess. Maybe there were some talks about her being his running mate. It's possible that Bernie supports this move, as he is very adamant that none of his supporters vote for Trump. Having Warren as VP will attract the Bernie supporters and keep his message alive at the same time.

       Interesting that someone that has largely been against the banks and Wall Street, which is about the only reason most people know her name, other than when she throws anti-Trump temper tantrums on Twitter, would endorse and position herself as the running mate of one the biggest supporters of big banks and Wall Street.

       Ron Paul was honest.  He'd say things he believed even if people disagreed.   Whether you agreed with his points is not the point.  He was honest.   Justin Amash also seems honest.   I cannot really find cases where they seemed to be dishonest.

       Thanks, I actually read it and damn that sucks. I didn't know they were still so associated, although it's funny the article spent most of it's time saying how "Paul libertarianism is not Koch libertarianism" and how they're using paul like bait to get people hooked on libertarianism, and then picking out of that crowd to move people more right-libertarian, which is what they actually want.

       Sucks. I've lost faith in all politicians except Elizabeth Warren, and she just endorsed Hillary so I don't even know anymore. I think elections should be of random people drawn from the population, not these moneyed well-connected politicians

       Thanks for actually reading and being reasonable. I worried about Warren when she didn't endorse Sanders and now you see why, she was waiting for the winner, that's not leading, that's typical political gamesmanship.

       Good points. It really is mind-blowing how deeply entrenched our political system is in big money when you look in to it. Do you think corporations run the government almost entirely for their benefit? Government has done some good things for the people in the past, protecting them from corporations... but this modern government is entirely bought-and-sold and corporations have gotten so good at playing the game of legislation, lobbying, lawyers and so on. It pays to do so, and has become a mainstream tactic for the big players.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       like that,  or is this a particularly bad period? How can we recover from this? It's hard to get anyone the power to change the law for the better of the people without first having to go through a screening process that is owned by big money.
      </p>

       I think we need to start looking at peaceful revolution in a manner like this:

       I grew up in the late 60s early 70s this is by far the worst the corporate control has been at least in public. There has always been this if you look into the original titans, Rockefeller, Vanderbuilt, etc. but now there doesn't seem to be any hiding it anymore and worse there are way fewer people fighting for our rights. When I grew up the middle class was strong and college was free, that contributed to the housing boom. Now it is blatant and anybody who actually tries to help the common man gets treated like Sanders and called a communist.

       I've heard many similar stories. I was born mid-80s and I've only seen the country go downhill since my birth, I wish I could've witnessed the 60s-80s, they sound pretty wonderful compared to what we've got now.

       Ehh...not really, Vietnam, Cold War, Nuclear war drills in school. At least there was hope then, that's why Nixon and Reagan got ride of free college, too many people reading facts and stuff. There was at least hope, after what happened to Sanders and the fake that was Obama I don't think real change will happen now until they literally break the country.

       Yeah, that's the thing I hear over and over. I know it wasn't a great time, but at least people had optimism and a feeling things were moving in a better direction, and they generally were! Now it's just exhausting and depressing, in a lot of ways... Feels like we're stuck in a rut for 3 decades while corporations buy out our government more and more, and few people have any ideas of how to fix it. I think we need a revolution like the nonviolent icelandic pots and pans revolution of 2009:

       At least then we stopped a war through public outcry and promoted civil rights, now war goes on whether you like it or not and civil rights are going in reverse. After the Sanders debacle I'm just bunkering up and waiting for the shit to hit the fan.

       I feel like I should probably start making plans to leave the country sometime in the next decade or two, regardless of who wins the next elections. That is unless the FBI actually follows through and Hillary is out of the race and Sanders is the nominee, but I highly doubt that because she's buddy-buddy with the FBI it seems. I'm not holding my breath. But who knows, lots of things could happen.

       You're right about that, I believe I saw that George Soros is selling assets and shorting stocks. Its like having a whole bunch of animals running past you in the opposite direction, if they're wearing suites it's a financial meltdown.

       Do you think there will be a war before america turns things around? Or do you think we will peacefully turn it around through generational turnover? I just feel like there's some very ugly stuff right around the corner, but maybe i'm just paranoid. You've been here longer than I have, what do you think?

       Im not sure a war, more like a financial meltdown and extreme poverty. More riots and violence in the streets. The war part may come to quell the violence or distract from the issues. War usually pulls winning countries out of poverty so it is possible.

       Every video i watch where people are supporting/endorsing Hitlery, they always talk about her traits and what kind of person she is, never about the things that she's done. Mainly cos the things she has done was ruining individual's lives since the start of her career.

       aww come on you guys she was one of my political heroes i honestly get why everyone feels this way but i think shes working with what shes got. Thats why she waited till literally the very last minute to endorse hillary because she wanted bernie to win. Once that became an impossibility due to the BS super delegate system she decided to do some good rather than no good by running alongside hilary clinton.
      </p>

       Shes uniting with clinton for the sake of going up against trump who is for whatever reason loved in this sub reddit. I dont think shes a sell out not warren i just cant see her as the type given her backround.

       It’s not impossible. Clinton doesn’t have the required number of regular delegates. They could still swing Bernie at the convention. They won’t, of course, but they absolutely COULD, which is the point. Had she and hundreds of other high profile democrats supported him, Sandernistas would have still had a chance. But she didn’t, because she hates him and never supported him.

       Because he’s not a foreigner and not a traitor. Those are our only other options. Because his platform is ‘enforcing the constitution’ and everyone else’s is ‘raping everything on which this country was founded and killing anyone who doesn’t like it’. This is not an exaggeration.

       You told me I need to educate myself on the country in which I live. I was almost able to take you seriously until you spoke highly of trump. A man is not to be judged on his 5-6 months worth of talking when his 69 years of life shows more then 6 months of lip service ever could.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has enriched himself of scamming other people out of money and stiffing multiple lenders all to enrich himself. He claimed to care about veterans yet only donated to them come time for election while supposedly being worth 10 billion dollars. Prior to that he made a donation of 50,000 dollars YEARS ago for a tax break. Your worth 10 billion dollars? and claim veterans are everything etc yet now that your running for president you want to donate millions to the veterans?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are people bought and manipulated that easily? veterans are used to allowing themselves to be pimped by government officials who dont give a damn about them so the ease of manipulating them did not suprise me by much. Pandering and pretending to care about veterans is an easy tactic used by people to garner supporters. They support you in public but talk about what dumb simple minded barbarian slaves they are behind closed doors.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am supposed to disregard this mans 69 years of life and believe that even though he has focused soeley on enriching himself that now he has had a moral epiphany and is doing what hes doing because hes a patriot and for the good of the country?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your either very desperate or foolish. I cant take anybody who supports donald trump seriously in any capacity. I might have taken your post seriously until you spoke highly of trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is you who needs to open your fucking eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       "look at my african american over there" lets go back to the "good old days" aka days where life was good for straight white males and bad for everyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no such thing as "the good old days" because the good old days were always bad days for somebody else in this country be it the natives who had there lands pillaged from them women who had no rights or blacks who were enslaved or gays who were lynched.
      </p>
      <p>
       America has NEVER had a "good old days" we are working twoards that but we cannot go back to something we have never had. On a really good day nearly everyone should be able to smile not just a few of us that is what would be a good day.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you support and you believe in donald trump as a vision of the future you are a fool. "hes a patriot" give me a fucking break being a "patriot" is slave mentality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Patriotism and nationalism is for dim witted fools and it will limit your minds potential. You keep voiting for donald trump though.
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole country is built on lies deciet theivery rape and murder so who better fit to lead a country with such a foundation other than a man who embodies those very things himself unapologetically.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe he is fit to lead this country and maybe its time for me to leave it. You do and believe what you want as will I. A "patriot" lol how childish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dont worry trump makes lots of people realize how disgusting the people who inhabit this country are the fact that a man such as himself has garnished such an outlandish amout of supporters shows just how disgusting the culture adopted by the citizens of this country are. Dont worry if elected his presence may disgust people so much they will leave and then your "good ol days" can come right on back.
      </p>
      <p>
       You open your fucking eyes apply some damn critical thinking and see it for what it is before you come at me with that "patriotic bullshit tripe".
      </p>
      <p>
       Also downvotes are cute but the truth is sexy i prefer the truth. A downvote is an escape from a responce because there is nothing to be said only what can be seen and that is trump is not a patriot and he is not a vision of the future and if you think he is you are a misinformed fool and there is no nice way to put it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I use to ask myself how people like hitler rose to power and manipulated the hearts of so many. Then i look at how truly fucking stupid easily manipulated and brainwashed some people are who are so lazy that they would listen to a man run his mouth for a couple months vs examining the mans 69 years of living life on the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       That will tell you more about who somebody is and what their intentions are than them running their mouth for a couple of months. Pathetic I think anybody who supports or believes in donald trump is just a sorry pathetic lost soul.
      </p>
      <p>
       The amount of people who believe in this man has made me loose faith in this country absolutley disgusting I will never forget this election never have I been so sick in my stomach for such a long time.

       I don't trust anything anyone says when their spelling and grammar is that poor. If you don't know the difference between lose and loose, how to use punctuation and capitalization, and can't organize proper sentences then I severely doubt any logical steps you might be explaining. Clarity and specificity are important in articulating your ideas.

      <p>
       Secondly typing on a phone that auto corrects and misinterperets button pushes is exhuasting and i dont feel the need to correct it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The funny thing is I got an a plus in A.P english and an A plus in every single literary based course for all the english classes I have attended in the united states.
      </p>
      <p>
       What does that say about how our education system is for that manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know how to format and all that jazz i did recieve a 1000 dollar scholarship for an essay contest. I just dont feel the need to go out of my way when I make a comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not formatting a resume nor am I submitting a term paper I am having dialog on reddit if people wish to believe im an idiot or that I am not trustworthy because of poor grammer it most certainly is their right though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I should ask my friend who cant spell or write in any capacity if he feels people like you are idiots because you cant do complex equations and calculus in your head in 5 second incriments regardless of how long the equation is. Or if he thinks your an idiot because you cannot build a computer from scrap haha you grammar nazis are just so cute.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example in the first sentance i typed i spelled build incorrectly because my finger accidently hit a different key. You think im going to go all the way back and correct that just to satisfy you? lol get over yourself. Im not competing for a grade a promotion or your approval of my grammar. :)
      </p>
      <p>
       The point of literacy to me is being able to communicate through means other than vocal conversation. If people could not understand what I try to communicate I would have very little karma because very little people would be able to understand the message im trying to convey.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people I care to communicate with understand my writing if you dont understand it your probably not somebody i was attempting to send my communication 2. Again please have a sip of some "get over yourself capachino".
      </p>
      <p>
       I hear it taste pretty good after you take the stick out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now excuse me I have some ill formatted mispelled walls of text to go compile. So funny my first college essay for english 101 was a paper I wrote about why there is no such thing as the "proper" way to write. My professor was so impressed with it she said she would keep it and I went back to her class a year later and she still had it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So obviously my communications or lack thereof do exactly what I intend for them to do. If you dont like it nobody is making you read it just saying.

       Didn't read all that. See my point? You might make some good points in there, but you'll never convince 7/10 readers when the wrapper is so terrible. It'll be that way everywhere in life. But keep on wasting the effort to write massive diatribes that most people will ignore, that's so much easier than fixing a single letter typo or hitting the shift key.

       For someone who talks about taking the easier path to not correct their mistakes, you seem to put a lot of effort into posts on here. If those aren't important then don't do them? Or if they are worth enough to do it in the first place, then maybe do it right?

       Don't worry about making promises for me, just have some more confidence in yourself. If something is worth doing, it's worth doing right. People care about your opinions, you just need to present them in a way that doesn't drive people away right away.

       Why do the people who love the line-by-line word always abuse the word "prove"?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't just quote a line and claim you disproved it by stating your disagreement in a single sentence below it.

       Citation?  No, I say he's always been good.

       (no citation here either, but it somehow conclusively proves the point.)

       If a bunch of people are telling you to prove your shit over an extended period, you might want to think about doing that.

       I can, for the following reasons:

      <ol>
       <li>
        I did.

       <li>
        You’re wrong.

       Or you could actually prove your assertions. Or disprove any of ours. That is, if you’re actually right (which you’re obviously not).

       My only thing is in lots of positions she has held the opportunities to be completley self serving have already come her way and she has not given in to them from what I have seen. Again I could be wrong but who knows.

       Your hero....Goofy Elizabeth Warren, when not charading around as Pocahontas doing rain dances to bring the storms of banking reform, is in fact a do nothing politician. Her only interest is furthering her political career even if it means falling in line behind someone who goes against everything she has built her political platform on. She's a sellout.

       If you like Warren I guess you like Bernie aswell. Here is the 2 minute clip of Ron Paul that made me not be excited about Bernie

       Warren is just another hack politician. She's a populist but is 100% establishmnet. I used to like her too. Obama has realllly soured me on this type of media and party darling politicians
