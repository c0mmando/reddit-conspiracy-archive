        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Now this is not a post to show how much i hate the military, I respect anyone&#39;s decisions and opinions. I have many friends that want to go into the military and also have family members that were in the military. (sorry its a pretty long story/post)</p>

<p>I currently live in a military concentrated town where I have not previously experienced. Because there is a military base near by it seems that there are way more people who want to be in the military and or &quot;worships&quot; the military. I had a discussion with my friend who is extremely military biased, where at the beginning we had a harmless discussion about 9/11 (just about harmless conspiracy theories) but somehow he took that the wrong way and said that I insulted the military and how I didn&#39;t care about the people who are fighting in Afghanistan (trust me I meant no harm  or disrespect towards anyone). But then after a few days he told his JORTC instructor who then confronted me after hearing about the false accusations that that person had said about me. When he confronted me he was trying to give me a lecture on how they are fighting for my rights/freedom.</p>

<p>Im gonna be honest here, since when did I have to respect someone because they&#39;ve decided to join the military. Most people who have joined the military are people who have nothing else to do in their life, or how they cant get into college or get a good job, usually slackers who cant get good grades, or maybe they have hardships and they just decide to sell their life away. And yes the former retired military JORTC instructor did agree with me on this one. 
But when he says the US military has defended my rights and freedom as a US citizen, when has that really actually happened during my lifetime, now I sincerely appreciate the people who do &quot;protect our rights and freedom&quot; but it really never happened in my lifetime.<br/>
What im really trying to get here is that how can we call these people our &quot;American heroes&quot;, justify shooting other human beings  for &quot;fighting for our countries rights&quot;. Lets be honest here we haven&#39;t done anything in the military that has to do with protecting our rights and freedoms, what have we really done in Afghanistan or other places where we put our noses for really no real purpose. Why it is to honor these people who most likely killed other innocent people, civilians. </p>

<p>Anyway thanks for letting me rant about this, I would have talked more about it but it would probably do more harm than good. Maybe im just ignorant, maybe im not.</p>

<p>FUCK the Military.</p>

<p>If they took their oath seriously to defend this country against &quot;all&quot; enemies foreign &amp; domestic, then half of the political branch in this country would have been mowed by machine gun fire by now. They only care when its the &quot;foreign&quot; bit. If they were truly doing their job then globalist terrorist like Kissinger &amp; Soros would have been removed a loooong time ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I support the troops, because they are people being manipulated by the people in power who have very persuasive things to say to the &quot;heroes&quot; of the world. The next time you have a conversation like this with a military brat, point to the VA, and ask them why if their country cares and honors them so much, why is the VA in shambles and one of the most unfunded pieces of the government arm? Ask them why veterans get stripped of their rights if they are deemed unstable by the traumatic events they underwent? Why are military officials the first ones thrown under the bus when a war is deemed unpopular? Point to Vietnam. The millions of veterans who undergo PTSD because they were forced to carry out an order that went against the soliders morals and ethics. Support the troops, do not support theor handlers, or the unjustifyable wars they fight. </p>

<p>The next time you are confronted by someone screamed honor and glory, ask them how it feels to secure resources that don&#39;t belong to our country, lose a brother over it, and ask them if it was worth it; never seeing a dime of the profit from those stolen resources.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You act as though no one but you has spent time on this. Let me assure you, when our military uses any tool of mind bending depth, that there are others that have told of it and lived it. I get the reasoning, understand the unity building, understand what it takes to do it, and still can say it is all immoral. Mostly to our service members. My dad volunteered at Edgewood, above all things I know the how&#39;s and what&#39;s of evil. Have you looked into any of that? Or into what they found and how that slightly expensive series of scientific experiments worked out? Or who was doing them? Maybe you should. Just like eating shit out of a trash can.

    <div class="md"><p>I get your rant and don&#39;t disagree, but I feel I must point out that our rights and freedoms aren&#39;t defended and maintained <em>only</em> on the battlefield. We have lost site of the fact that in a democracy it is up to each and every citizen to maintain and defend their rights and freedoms. We should not allow a military (or only those in the military), or government, or politician, or <strong>any</strong> entity other than ourselves to defend and maintain the rights and freedoms we enjoy. Doing so has contributed to where we are now.</p>

<p>Those who insist that the military is fighting and dying for our freedoms are brainwashed and spewing propaganda. Ask a combat vet (btw, not all service members see combat) what they thought they were fighting for and what they actually ended up fighting for. ;)</p>

<p>If you want to point a morality finger start at the top, you may find more than a few service members joining you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Military worship is strange. It&#39;s carried out by ignoring the bad, instead repeating a perceived positive outcome. In the US&#39;s case &#39;freedom.&#39; The military gives so called damaged people and psychopaths a legal outlet for their aggression. It really does offer a better alternative for some people. Life is very hard. People are brain washed into joining the military by mass propaganda of varying subtlety. You can&#39;t blame the soldiers, troops, whatever. It&#39;s the fault of a very elaborate system of power, colonialists essentially.</p>

<p>As sad as it may be, people will eventually believe whatever they hear the most, especially at younger ages. It&#39;s a cognitive reality. The colonialists figured this out along time ago. If your&#39;re going to point the finger, mass-media is the weapon to blame. Obviously there are multiple sources to this problem, but mas media is the ability to make the brain washing national. Even global in the sense that America is the closest thing to a physical embodiment of westernism.</p>

<p>The American military needs to be on the offensive to maintain global hegemony, because if they don&#39;t some one else will. The world has been locked into this situation since about World War I. If a country does not defend it self, including regular offensive preemptive strikes, it will be taken over.</p>

<p>They only end to this would be total global compliance to the abolition of killing. Enforced only by a unspoken social mindset that this indeed is the proper way to live. It is in fact, but people make excuses. The universality principal is useful here. If all people killed each other, would all people befit? The answer is obviously no. We should stop. Easier said than done though. </p>

<p>In the meantime we must resign ourselves to some obvious facts. War is hell. There is certainly hell on earth. Thankfully, even though they may be selfish beneficiaries, at least some people live in heaven. There is certainly heaven on earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>expressing politically incorrect opinions is just as dangerous here as in Saudi Arabia, the former USSR and in North Korea. don&#39;t do it. </p>

<p>don&#39;t bother talking about reality. the world you were taught that you live in is not the one that you actually live in. just be happy that you have the fruits of all the exploitation like a house/computer/internet/etc. they think that all comes to you from the military, and questioning the military is wrong. the military is there to protect you and &quot;your freedom&quot; (just not your freedom of speech or your basic legal rights that have been legislated away while the military was off in needless, pointless meatgrinders in the middle east that some nutjob crazies lied our civilization into).</p>

<p>instead you should question the harm being done <em>to</em> the heroic military through bad leadership and dangerous mentally ill politicians who are running the american military into the ground while sending billions of America taxdollars to dangerous violent islamic fundamentalists in the middle east like the state of Saudi Arabia, dangerous to the point where vets are literally lighting themselves on fire outside their local Veterans Administration building to protest their treatment, while being totally ignored by virtually everyone, because everyone wants to feign concern for the military but no one actually wants to have any of it.</p>

<p>don&#39;t question the heroic humanitarian freedom group, question the harm being done to it by a crazy &quot;other&quot;. as far as the poor people are concerned, they &quot;are&quot; the military, and &quot;they&quot; aren&#39;t bad people who want to do bad things, so they can&#39;t imagine that they are being used that way.</p>

<p>don&#39;t question &quot;them&quot;, question the harm being done <em>to</em> them by others in ways they may have previously been unaware of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a veteran, having served a little over 2 years in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as some time in Kuwait. I actually agree with you in many respects. However, since I&#39;m on my mobile I&#39;ll just get straight to what I wanted to shed a little light on, so to speak.
First off, pump the brakes with the whole &#39;many of them are there cause they have nothing else going for them in life, that they&#39;re slackers, and / or unemployable.&#39; That&#39;s an incredibly ignorant and unintelligent thing to lead with lol. Of course there are more than a few that would fit that description. But to then generalise a very large group with a blanket statement like that, or attempt to justify your discomfort with the troop support because of that belief is beyond closed minded and frankly, elementary and archaic in nature and intellect.
In my personal experience most people did it because furthering their education was simply just not feasible. They didn&#39;t come from wealth, and in some cases had already started a family or had loved ones they wanted to take care of and simply just could not. For example one of the very best guys I ever had the pleasure of knowing actually dropped out of his sophomore year in college when is junior high school sweetheart was diagnosed with breast cancer and had no insurance, and no real stable family life (foster homes most of her life). Joined straight away to take care of her, and they&#39;re both doing very well now. He&#39;s working on his masters now and has one year left. For me, I had already finished my associates, but still really didn&#39;t know what I wanted to do with my life other than marry the girl I&#39;ve dated since I was 12 and take us away from our hodunky city in the Midwest. The war on &#39;terror&#39; was still raging and all the ads and media hype of the pride, honor, valor, and courage it took to serve. That had been deeply engrained in many of us since a young age, and still is in today&#39;s youth. So I figured I&#39;d join up, have the rest of my college and some of my wife&#39;s paid for, travel away from the only place we knew, and forfeit myself to something much bigger than me while I figured out exactly what I wanted to do, meanwhile also gaining a unique skill / trade and some always beneficial discipline.</p>

<p>Now, people today lose sight of the naivety most had when  first joining. They allow their passions in politics, foreign relations, or simply just worldwide ethics to impair their judgments. I can say in all honesty I joined wanting to feel that pride, honor, and valor. However, quickly learned there was very little honor or valor in what we were doing. We had been lied to...all of us had been lied to. But our pride should be allowed to remain in tact because we still took that leap that we would sacrifice time, money, and if must, our life to preserve the welfare of our loved ones. Unfortunately many of us were just duped, like so many before us as well. And another thing to keep in mind is that so many of the veterans you&#39;re encouraged to just be respectful to, nothing more, were made veterans against their choosing during the draft. Shit, that could so easily be you tomorrow if some shit kicked off and they brought back the draft. Tens if not hundreds of thousands of men were forced to put their lives on hold for a minimum of 4 years. They&#39;d have to leave their families behind and go fight some people they&#39;d never met before and really had more in common with than the people who were telling them to go fight. Those poor men absolutely and unequivocally deserve at the very least our respect, but in my opinion much, much more. </p>

<p>What&#39;s really sad about this is that people should just fucking respect other people. Who gives a fuck the journey certain people took to get where they are!? You can&#39;t even say for certain that one is better than the other any way. Everyone&#39;s different and requires different stimulus and experience to grow. Don&#39;t show me respect because I&#39;m a veteran, show me respect because we&#39;re an evolved, intelligent species. We&#39;re brothers walking two different paths that are equally filled with uncertainty. And most of all, because I&#39;m sure as shit going to respect you, as well as every soul I happen to come across because I believe in the good nature inherently in people and will treat them as such until they prove otherwise. </p>

<p>Just respect all life and don&#39;t get your panties all in a bunch feeling like you&#39;re being forced to do anything more than be a decent fucking human being. Nobody is asking you to suck their assholes or expel any bit of your precious sweat, blood, tears, or money. What a sad way to live life that your so concerned over someone else getting a helping hand or a special recognition that you&#39;d revert to degenerative and belittling the group as a whole just to save your ego the shame it thinks it might feel. I hope you&#39;re young my friend. I&#39;d be lying to you if I said I wasn&#39;t pretty full of some dumb fucking ideologies or perceptions of people or situations. It&#39;s part of growing up, and then having the intellectual humility to be like &quot;yeah, I was a fucking moron, that was wrong.&quot; Because if you&#39;re not, well then sir, you&#39;re an idiot. 😉</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like your anger is misplaced.  People who join the military do it for a lot of reasons.  Some have no other choices.  For a while - a long while - criminals in America had the choice of jail or the Army.  Petty criminals, I mean.  So yes, there is a part of the military that are just not suited for civilian life.  They need to be directed and ordered and paid for standing around or chipping paint.  The world needs its ditch diggers, after all.  </p>

<p>But there are some who join out of patriotism.  They desire to fight for their country.  They want to travel, to pay for college, to support a family and the military is a very good way to get all that done, you just have to sell your soul for a few short years.  It&#39;s a devil&#39;s bargain and you&#39;re gambling you won&#39;t get sent to some third world shithole and shot.</p>

<p>People &#39;worship&#39; the military members because they&#39;ve made that bargain.  Because they&#39;ve beat that devil. Because people need someone to admire and respect and someone who puts their life in danger for someone else is a symbol of bravery and heroism.  </p>

<p>We need heroes.  REAL heroes.  Why do you think Hero movies are so popular?  Someone who made a deal with the devil and won is the closest thing a lot of people have.    </p>

<p>But when he says the US military has defended my rights and freedom as a US citizen, when has that really actually happened during my lifetime, now I sincerely appreciate the people who do &quot;protect our rights and freedom&quot; but it really never happened in my lifetime.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See, that&#39;s the thing, your rights and freedoms exist because some former military actually did fight to secure and defend them a hundred or more years ago.  To disrespect the present military is to disrespect those who carry on that tradition.  Just because some jackhole sent them to the wrong side of the world is no reason to hate on them.</p>

<p>Edited to add:  Your reasons for hating on the military sound a bit like jealousy and sour grapes to me.  Lose a girl to a jarhead?</p>

What we&#39;eve been doing as far as my knowledge goes is not justifiable, im sure some vets can definitely agree. I wasn&#39;t trying to bash the people who join the military, because it isn&#39;t their fault and they arent the ones who make the decision, I dont agree with the sorta &quot;concept&quot; that the military has created in order to entice young men into joining the military to do tasks that they probably didn&#39;t even imagine to do</p>

<p>Because no one is protecting the dollar. Because the dollar is being raped to death. Because the military fights for globalism and the destruction of nations at the whim of the jews, et. al. The yuan is not the replacement. Nothing is. The wholly digital Globuck is the end-game.</p>

<p>No, because I was correct in my assessment. Unless you wanted to praise me for the speed and accuracy thereof, in which case go ahead.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You don&#39;t know any of what I believe or how I feel beyond me labeling you a bigot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you think that everything exists in a vacuum? Holy fuck, that&#39;s stupid. By virtue of your label, I know exactly what you believe. You have deluded yourself into thinking that feelings are facts. You have deluded yourself into thinking that anything that hurts your feelings is instantly wrong, regardless of its truthfulness. Anything inconvenient to you is wrong. Anything that contradicts your initial &quot;education&quot; (quotations because it wasn&#39;t one) is wrong. Anything that isn&#39;t politically correct is wrong.</p>

<p>Correctness is to political correctness what a chair is to an electric chair.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But please, yes, post your evidence, I&#39;m always looking to be proved wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Make a claim on the aforementioned subjects. Any claim. You will be proven wrong.</p>
