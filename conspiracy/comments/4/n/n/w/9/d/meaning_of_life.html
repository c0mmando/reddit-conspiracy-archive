       I had a dream where I asked a sentient shoerack(which was sitting outside at a large BBQ) what the meaning of life was. It turned into a rock with a face. I waited for an answer and the rock waited too. I made an expression like "well...??" and so did the rock. I started laughing and so did the rock. Then I woke up.

       Depends on your perspective and upbringing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like light and dark, some believe their purpose is to be bad, others to be good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact is you can't have one without the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       My personal purpose is fairly simple: do unto others as you would want done unto you. Simple.  All else in between is just offshoots of that.  And yes, that also means massachists that enjoy pain will give pain. That is part of the light and dark part.

       Life is about transcending personal considerations in pursuit of the Absolute Truth. The pains of this world are to remind us that we do not belong here. We must connect with the center to find the happiness everyone is looking for. There is no happiness in this world. Happiness is found within.

       The only compassion in the world is what we ourselves bring into it. The natural world is red in tooth and claw. It knows no compassion. Men, and maybe a few higher mammals, are capable of something completely new and unexpected -- compassion for others. Empathy. Feeling another's pain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our ability to express love and charity and kindness in our lives is a measure of our godliness. The more compassion we express, the closer to the divine we become. God is love. God is our compassion for our fellow creatures.

       Personal choice. If I don't give a fuck, who will? That and it makes my life better. Not in the short term. But the long term payoffs are the friends you make and keep. And the ones you lose but know you did right by. Perspective changes a lot when you get old and people you have known for twenty or thirty years call and want to see you before they die. Because you were a real friend. That is the stuff that really matters. Not how new the car was we went to the drs office in, but that we put water in the radiator three times and forgot to get gas. ( Dammit crying, that was to new.)

       I just wrote you big long answer and then screwed the pooch and deleted it. But my friend Ed passed away in January. I knew him for close to thirty years. It took a long time to get him to teach me how to do stained glass. The last couple of years as he got sicker, I carried him to appts. And we laughed. And ran out of gas. And laughed some more. No one can ever take that experience from me. None of it. And those that you call friends that only show up when they need something are not friends. But you already know that. 
I miss Ed. But I would rather miss him than not have had the good times.

       Because he challenged me to be a better human being. I didn't get that then. I just really wanted to learn how to make beautiful glass pieces like he did. He made me prove I really wanted to. I had to read a couple of books, that I have now. He made me watch him make a whole lampshade. I had to pick up a lot of broken glass. And learn how to grind glass pieces on a old wetgrinder. Then.we did a few field trips to the museum
 To look at tiffanylamps. From below. With this new thing we paid thirtydollars forsowe could point at details in the structure. That old laserpointer was awesome. Then after a few years he let me make my own first pattern. He was about twenty years older than me, and army life during nam was not really his thing. So when he came back he marched against it. He taught me a lot through the years. Typing this out felt really good. Edwas my best friend. Over the years we hurt each other, fought, didn't speak for a few years, but when either one of us needed the other we were there. I have been very blessed. I can't explain any better why humans by and large are pretty awesome critters to be around.go meet new ones if you don't have the right ones around. They come in all shapes sizes and ages. You might be surprised who you find. And actually, I loved Ed. Never even kissed.

       The first step usually involves seeing the futility of finding happiness on the enervating plane (where everything slips through our fingers). Once one in at that stage, they begin to inquire into the nature of reality. According to the strength of one's inquiry one receives knowledge of that caliber.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally study the Bhagavad-Gita. It explains our situation on a very fundamental level and provides knowledge as the solution to our predicament. When we understand the nature of consciousness, we begin to shift our awareness away from the plane of change and instability to the plane of pure awareness and stability. When we reach that plane, even though we physically exist in the unstable world, because we are aware of our deeper, unchanging nature, it does not affect us. From here, one begins to find one's unique relationship to the whole, where one find's true satisfaction.

       Wow. A monastery. One of my never followed dreams. Book learning is good. People learning is better. The closest I get to religion is when the Tibetan monks build the annual mandala In a local theater. I attend the opening ceremony and that is my spiritual fix for the year. Do enjoy your being there. Wherever your spiritual leanings are I am sure the learning is amazing.

       To create new life experiences for the purpose peacefully share them with others.  This results in closer bonds that tie all our souls to all others.  Death is just another open door to another awakening which leads to another experience.  Your will is what decides how the next awakening will be...  If you are cruel and unkind in the previous life, the next will be equally cruel and unkind...  Until the experience reaches hell like levels....  The soul never dies...  It is up to us all to determine our next experience...

       There may be no "meaning" at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is definitely a "reason"…but reason and meaning are 2 very different thing. There is a reason for absolutely everything…but meaning is far more elusive.

       That is up for debate. For some the reason is that a "God" wanted it to be…others will tell you the reason is the destruction of the dinosaurs that allowed mammals to evolve, something that wouldn't have happened otherwise.

       Life isn't actually that bad in our modern times even when there are a couple of nutcases in control.
      </p>
      <p>
       it could have been worse, much worse, just imagine a North Korea or Stalinist russia for the whole globe.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what do I think is the meaning of life? Well existence exists and consciousness exists, this gives us some clues.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine our universe without any biological life, just rocks in space? What would be its meaning?
      </p>
      <p>
       To me there is no reason why biological life should exist, and there is no reason why life should strive to be more complex to create consciousness. In fact there is a lot of luck involve to reach consciousness. There is also no reason why existences exists in the first place, nothing, a story never told.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet it does exist, and so is consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any yet when we die our consciousness is extinguished, out organic body turns to dust. If your body is in a vacuum with no bacteria is your body still alive organically or inert matter? We might be food but we still turn to dust, there is no great cycle of life where out organic body transforms into other cells, all you are is chemical fuel.
      </p>
      <p>
       So our mind is extinguished, our body also, so why doesn't matter itself disappear?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does existence exist?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you might be thinking I am going in circles, and you are correct, I am just tracing the paths and you might see like me at the edges a blurry outline. This is my belief on what the meaning of life is.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no reason why the universe can be experienced just like it has no reason to exist. Yet it does in all its ways and stories.
