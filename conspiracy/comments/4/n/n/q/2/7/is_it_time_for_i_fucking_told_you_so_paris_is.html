      <p>
       Daily reminder that the EU is going to ramp up aggression with Russia in the next couple of months and various "false flags" will happen in the EU to create hostility toward Russia and give an excuse to extend Russian sanctions. A preview of the coming months:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) The upcoming Brexit vote will fail, it is rigged. They need to stop any independence and nationalist movements.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) A Unified European Military will be created and EU power will be HEAVILY expanded.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Hillary Clinton won't get indicted and will win the general election. It is rigged. Amnesty, immigration, H1B visas, and HUD/ AFFH resettlement will all be ramped up. Sentencing reform will put tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of black criminals out on the street - many straight into white middle class neighborhoods though the HUD/ AFFH resettlement program. BLM will tell government to get police to lay off black criminals. Government will show support for BLM and black criminals will be emboldened. Expect relentless anti-white and anti-cop rhetoric in the mainstream media. Blacks shot by the police will become martyrs in the media. In the months leading up to the election, racial tension will reach a fever pitch and multiple large scale race riots will break out across the nation. Hot zones will be: Memphis, Baltimore, Ferguson, Cincinnati, Detroit, Chicago, St Louis, Indianapolis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you are living in a gated community, thanks to HUD and AFFH you will live next to violent welfare blacks. Those black neighbors are going to terrorize you 24 hours a day. They will break into your house. They will dump trash on your property. They will steal your furnace and water heater while you are on vacation. Your windows will be smashed. They willbeat you and your family in the street, kicking your head as you lay in a fetal position. Your children will be attacked. Your female children will be raped.
      </p>
      <p>
       It might seem horrible to you, but it's all part of the plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       4)   A spate of large scale mass shooting will trigger new anti-gun legislation in America before the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Status update: mass shooting in Orlando. 50 dead. Calls for assault weapons ban.
      </p>
      <p>
       5)  The doping scandals and recent violence at the Euro 2016 football match (which was instigated by a third party) is preplanned to prolong anti-Russian sanctions
      </p>
      <p>
       6)  There will be allegations of rigging when Putin wins the September Russian election
      </p>
      <p>
       7) Allegations of vote rigging will lead to protests. The protests will spiral into violence and chaos and the end result will be a Color revolution. This is already planned. Putin knows what is coming and that is why he created the National Guard
      </p>
      <p>
       8) Ukraine will launch a new offensive on Donbass while this is all happening
      </p>
      <p>
       9) There will be a blockade of Kaliningrad to force Russia into a war with NATO, that's what all the recent propaganda about invading the Baltics is about
      </p>
      <p>
       10) ISIS will get reinforcements and launch a massive strike against Damascus
      </p>
      <p>
       11) There will be a huge catalyst false flag terror attack in Europe and/ or America before December.
      </p>
      <p>
       12) There is a planned coup d'etat in Brazil to oust Dilma Rousseff. The coup is happening because of Iran, oil, and petrodollars. Corruption is just being used as a cover. Brazil is set to host the the 2016 Olympics and the international media will run a relentless smear campaign. The games will be an economic black hole like Sochi 2014.
      </p>
      <p>
       13)  Once the B and R of the BRICS nations have been conquered, the (((eye of Sauron))) will be on China.
       <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;amp;gl=ca&amp;amp;tbm=nws&amp;amp;authuser=0&amp;amp;q=democracy+china&amp;amp;oq=democracy+china&amp;amp;gs_l=news-cc.3..43j43i53.2491.7367.0.7890.23.8.4.11.8.0.118.641.6j2.8.0...0.0...1ac.1.t8EiXLSumeI&amp;amp;gws_rd=ssl">
        Expect relentless pro- Chinese democracy propaganda in the international media
       </a>
       and pro democracy protests within China. Also expect heightened terrorism in western China by the "persecuted" Uyghur minority whom the international media will be sympathetic to. Expect the Uyghur minority to take the role in China that the Kurds are playing in the middle East. A charismatic Uyghur Muslim will be chosen to become a household name worldwide in 2017 since the Dalai Lama and the poor, disenfranchised Buddhists are pretty much played out at this point.

       ... Just kidding. Nobody can predict the future. Especially not an anonymous internet troll.

         I wouldn't say 'nobody'.  There have been a lot of people, there are a lot right now, over 7 billion - law of probability too, eventually 0's turn to 1's.  But of just the people I personally know right now, the only evidence I have that people I know can't predict the future is they haven't given me an indication of the ability, but I have no scientific way to validate that no ability exists.

         Call it 'intelligence analysis' then.  That's exactly what the C.I.A. does.  They look at current intelligence, they already know what's happened previously, so they can connect dots and move forward.  Current events, once you start following them, play like scripts that never change or vary much.

       A 10 minute video and he doesn't even mention what this extension level event is?  How can anyone take such bullshit seriously?  It doesn't matter if there is a real story there when he discredits himself with that crap.  10 minute video without a single fact.  Fuck him, he's just a con man.

       How is this proof at all? The only thing it is proof of is that you don't understand hooligan culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are always pretty good organized, but that doesn't mean that TPTB are behind it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just take a look at other
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQMpsdHhEVc">
        hooligan meetings
       </a>
       . They meet up to fight. They go to soccer games solely to fight afterwards.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what hooligans do. It's their hobby. But just because they are organized doesn't mean that there is a conspiracy behind it.

       I think you do write them with a smug look of superiority on your face. You think you got it all figured out for whatever reason. Here is the thing you don't. No one does because there is no elite group in control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone is fighting for control even you are with this post. You want people to focus on you and believe this. I mean seriously a race riot. That won't happen. The majority of people that you think would participate within something like that are so little a number as to those that would stop them its impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       People don't want violence. They want to be left alone with the smallest amount of effort expended to get thru each day. Why do you think things that have apps for phones are so successful?
      </p>
      <p>
       Like uber? Or Facebook. You think its because of a lack of service in those sectors? Shit it isn't that at all. Its because interaction of people is at an all time low. Actual interaction like shaking someone's hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have 22 people on my Facebook and I have met all but two personally. The two I haven't are in other continents. You think about the generation of today and how little they will interact with anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       How they will be accustomed to believe what news sources they use now because its too much effort to find new ones that are reliable.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people don't know their world is a lie by now then fuck it. They HAVE to know its impossible not to.

       You ever notice that anything in /politics or /worldnews that is important usually has a top comment chain of humor that pushes the rest of the information down the line?

       Jesus christ. Im irish. Lived in london for a couple years. Now while the huge majority of brits are great people. It is widely understood that there is a group of people  who  allign themselves and find a sense of worth and comradship through effectivly joining football gangs. They express this comradship through violence as shown above. This happens everytime england play. Its an embarrasment. Not noticable in Brazil because these people are typically from a social class that cant really afford a trip like that.

       France is literally a tunnel drive away. Everyone knew this was gonna happen and your really reaching here.

       Every country has sent a security force over to protect its players as there is a threat from extremists.

       Alex Jones makes huge blanket statements and injects massive amounts of fear into every issue, he's been doing this for years now, so when one of his sensationalist reports even minutely bears some fruit, he's up there doing the "I told you folks, you can only get this news from us at Infowars! By the way wanna buy some wheat grass?" Don't get me wrong , I like Alex Jones and followed him since his piece on Bohemian Grove, but I see through the hype through his absolute non coverage of the globalists he attacks so frequently and won't ever name, referring to them only as "They."
      </p>
      <p>
       To me he's an info-dis-info agent, telling just enough truth to convince people he's telling the whole truth, and that's really no different to CNN in many respects, my advice is to take everything with a pinch of salt, in this day and age you cannot even trust your own eyes, watching too much Alex Jones will make you feel highly insecure and paranoid. We can see the rhetoric between the superpowers playing out right in front of us, and yes there are going to be some terrible consequences taking place, no one needs the Alex Jones hype train to work that out.

       Same old bullshit we heard a million times on this sub about Jones.  Either YOU are the disinfo agent or you have been fooled by the disinfo campaign against Jones.  Jones has woken up more people than anyone else and has been exposing the New World Order for over 20 years.  Infowars is the best place to get real information, which is why it is banned site wide on Reddit and in the military.  And why Jones is constantly ridiculed and attacked in MSM.  You have no idea what you are talking about.

       Considering I don't own a media company or even a website with very little comment karma on even Reddit .. it certainly adds up that I'm a dis-info agent right?!?!?
      </p>
      <p>
       I said I like Alex Jones, did you read that or did you just turn into a raging idiot like Jones did with Piers Morgan effectively passing off all truthers as mad shit crazy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Real information doesn't need bells and whistles and a script stolen out of a Michael Bay movie of impending doom, "I'm tellin ya folks those FEMA camps and all those coffins somethin' is going to happen this year they're gonna lock us up and those that resist will be killed!" That was what, 2007?
      </p>
      <p>
       So while Jones does actually cause people to seek alternative media and critical thinking much of his content is alarmist nonsense and the stuff he omits from his coverage so not to upset his Israel supporting sponsors ..well that goes without saying.

       One of the reasons many people like Jones is that he isn't a Jew hating racist.  I'm glad he doesn't harp on Isreal, though he does address it on occasion.  The New World Order and what they are doing to humanity is the subject most important to Jones and his listeners.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe he is controlled.  One reason is the guests he has on.  No one else in media, especially mainstream media, has the guests on that he does.  He had David Duke on his show.  They didn't get along but Jones gave him a platform to state his point.  When is the last time you saw David Icke on mainstream media?  Among many others.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of Jones' main subjects in the Second Amendment.  I don't see him speaking at a rally as sabotaging it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your points are all disinformation that has been the script from the opposition for years.  Give it up, it's not working, people still listen and will continue to listen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jones isn't perfect, but he's in the fight against the New World Order, and that is good enough for me and his millions of listeners.

       Now you are throwing out liberal talking points?  If being ok with a wall is racist then I guess we are guilty.  Jones lives in Texas of course he talks about illegal immigration and the damage they are doing to that state. Now I'm pretty sure you are disinfo.

       Lol, he's talking about La Raza, a white hating racist terrorist group that wants to take back large parts of the United States for Mexico.  You have all these videos and talking points right at your fingertips don't you.

       No one will listen. OK let's think about why you think they won't.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say its the platforms in which you are using because they censor your speech. Ok well maybe with Reddit, but Facebook? You can send private messages or use creative wording.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I think it is. Its your method of delivery. You are telling people what you think they should know. They see that as a form of authority so you are already shunned because you have nothing to tell them. On top of that you are so abrasive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its because you probably don't know how to reach people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's look at the most effective way in use today that controls thought in people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Public schools. Now how do they do this? Hmmmm well some can say its forced attendence. Na you can ignore it or just not go. So must be something else cause they keep doing it with even less resources the before.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how? I bet its thru empowerment. See schools today don't teach or even educate they indoctrinate. They do this by making you doubt your abilities to function in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kids that get high marks are rewarded by the system so you think. Really they are outcast by their peers because the school system makes sure everyone knows who is doing well. Teachers are encouraged to praise those that exhibit the make less waves to rock the boat types.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many kids now are fed the lie of get good grades go to college. The schools don't teach these kids the principal of Credit. Or debt. Hell many can't read but they can kick a football.
      </p>
      <p>
       These kids get into crippling debt by 18 now. They realize they got fucked and now they realize it. Too late thou cause parents say you are lazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the system wins. It did that thru how the education system works.

       All conflict requires the creation of The Duality.  The actors who want to encourage The Duality are gonna go about their business anyway.  One must recognize them for who they are and avoid them lest you, too, inadvertently charge The Duality.  The Middle Road avoids this trap.  (I capitalize for both amusement and clarity)

       If there are riots in Paris (and I haven't heard anything) it can't be the white Christians. I gave up on them after they did nothing following the last two major terrorist attacks. Nothing at all. It must be more Muslim violence. At this point I don't much care who they kill. Parisians are all cucks and don't deserve life, because they won't even defend themselves against obvious aggressors. Paris needs
       <em>
        major riots
       </em>
       to purge itself of Muslims. Paris needs thousands of deaths in the streets. It's the only way it can save itself.

       Including importing radical Islam.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has two effects that are both reasons it should be rejected world wide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly it brings in young males who are used to fighting in the streets, thus making such events far more likely to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly it brings in an alien culture which via PC requirements, requires the native culture to put aside all things that strengthen the family unit and holds large communities together.
      </p>
      <p>
       No public religious displays, no feelings of safety within your own community, complete hopelessness. And the only solutions being presented are to ignore all of this and wait for the aliens to integrate themselves while instead they just keep setting up more no-go zones and replica cities from the lands "they fled".

       I dont think a lot of total 372 mass shootings in the US can be of people under mind control or false flags, may 20 odd would be specially the ones they publicize.

       High profile mass shootings come once or twice a year. You know the ones that make national headlines and sound really insane. The rest are cases where 4 people were hit by bullets in the same location. They don't even need to be dead for it to be considered a "mass shooting."
