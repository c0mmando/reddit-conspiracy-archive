       Hi everyone
      </p>
      <p>
       I come from
       <a href="/r/holofractal">
        /r/holofractal
       </a>
       - but have posted here many times.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a huge proponent of a unified field theory that solves quantum gravity by utilizing a holographic quantum vacuum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's start at the beginning, because I know this obviously sounds like pseudoscience quackery:
      </p>
      <p>
       The notion is very simple. 
Quantum theory was birthed when Max Planck solved the blackbody radiation problem by quantizing energy. He found that energy does not move in a continuous manner, but actually moves in discrete 'packets' of energy, at the planck length. The planck length is extremely tiny.
      </p>
      <p>
       From this planck wavelength comes other fundamental constants, such as the planck mass (which is how much energy a planck length fluctuation has).
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the main issues is how massive the planck mass is. It's about the weight of a flea's egg, but the planck length that the planck mass fits in is hundreds of billions of trillions times smaller than a proton.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a few ingrained problems our physics has when trying to use this information to solve quantum gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
       For one, they are stuck in a 'void space paradigm' meaning the vacuum of space is totally empty - this is in direct contradiction to the fact that if you sum up all of the planck fluctuations that should be in space, you yield a mass energy of 10
       <sup>
        93
       </sup>
       grams/cm
       <sup>
        3.
       </sup>
       This massive discrepency is the largest in all physics, dubbed
       <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150416055016/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_catastrophe">
        The Vacuum Catastrophe
       </a>
       ( look at that, wiki removed the article...link to archive).
      </p>
      <p>
       Another is that currently when we try and calculate things such as how many planck fluctuations fit in an area/volume, we used cubic packed packing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently you can calculate the entropy of a black hole by tiling planck areas on it's surface.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Starting from theorems proved by Stephen Hawking, Jacob Bekenstein conjectured that the black hole entropy was proportional to the area of its event horizon divided by the Planck area.

      <p>
       The Universe does not make straight lines.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Universe makes spheres.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happens when we quantize space as
       <em>
        overlapping
       </em>
       planck spherical units?
      </p>
      <p>
       First - when we divide the proton volume by planck spherical units and multiply by the planck mass, we yield the mass of the observable Universe @ 10
       <sup>
        55
       </sup>
       grams.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second - we can now apply the holographic principle because this would obviously make the proton a black hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we divide the surface spherical units by the volume spherical units, and multiply by the planck mass.
       <em>
        Boom
       </em>
       we yield the mass of a single proton at 10
       <sup>
        -24
       </sup>
       grams.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/holofractal/comments/3bzsyl/since_i_wrote_this_out_in_a_comment_might_as_well/">
        Math
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason we can apply the holographic principle for mass can be explained via the quantum vacuum.
      </p>
      <p>
       The holographic principle states that the surface of a black hole can encode the information (or mass) of the volume.
      </p>
      <p>
       These surface PSU's are the beginning of a wormhole connection to another proton (google Loop Quantum Gravity or Quantum Foam for the wormhole hypothesis of some quantum theories e.g. spacetime is multiply connected in many mainstream attemps), all protons are entangled (entanglement being wormholes is called EP=EPR) and thus are sharing mass through the quantum vacuum. So there are 10
       <sup>
        60
       </sup>
       PSUs in the volume, but 10
       <sup>
        40
       </sup>
       surface ports that the volume PSUs are divided into, leaving 10
       <sup>
        -20
       </sup>
       to contribute mass locally, which multiplied by the planck mass just so happens to nail the proton rest mass. 
How is this sphere packing accomplished?
      </p>
      <p>
       Through omnitriangulation - wikipedia actually has a beautiful article on this type of sphere packing
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlapping_circles_grid#Triangular_grid_of_overlapping_circles">
        Triangular grid of overlapping circles
       </a>
       - you may be familiar with this sphere packing as 'The Flower of Life ;)'
      </p>

       <strong>
        The ancients somehow knew this
       </strong>
       .

       This pattern has been blasted on the walls of sacred sites for aeons.

      <h1>
       Within the past few days Nassim has released a new paper entitled
       <strong>
        The Electron and the Holographic Mass Solution
       </strong>
      </h1>
      <p>
       Whom he co-authored with recently published
       <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.5575v1.pdf">
        Dr Amira Val Baker
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       This paper may be the most important paper in decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course it's being ignored by the mainstream, they won't even take a look.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, he extends the holographic proton equation, which is simply surface plank spherical units divided by volume planck spherical units * planck mass - to the radius of the Bohr atom, and not only nails the hydrogen atom, but it works for each and every element on the table.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        This is deducing the mass/gravitation from first considerations of a holographic vacuum, or quantum gravity
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A new derivation for the mass of the electron is presented from first principles, where the
mass is defined in terms of the holographic surface-to-volume ratio and the relationship of the
electric charge at the Planck scale to that at the electron scale. This new derivation extends
the holographic mass solution to the hydrogen Bohr atom and for all known elements,
defining the atomic structure and charge as a consequence of the electromagnetic fluctuation
of the Planck scale, with an accuracy of 99.99999998%. Furthermore, the atomic number, Z
emerges as a natural consequence of this geometric approach. The confinement for both the
proton and the electron repulsive electrostatic force are now accounted for by a quantum
gravitational force exerted by the granular Planck scale structure of spacetime.
       </p>

       Yes it is a hologram. It's actually a game. We are here to defeat the ego and evolve into greatness likes a rags to riches game. All the hardships in the game don't exists in real life. This game provides the opportunity to build in a crumbling style lifestyle where everything has to be up kept while transforming lives for the better in the process. The difficulty setting is high in this particular holographic game. It's one of the highest.

       Well, you could say that they've missed things decades back that has influenced a path of research wherein many physics issues that should be fundamental problems are being band-aided as they go.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, missing 90+% of the Universe's mass - instead of saying, hey - maybe our equations surrounding gravitation are incomplete (in this example it is because we are missing spin in spacetime near massive objects) they instead patch it with things like dark matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       In terms of them evaluating Nassim's work - it's a myriad of reasons. He has no PHd. He is an autodidact. He solved quantum gravity in a 100% different direction than what the top scientists are trying to do (quantum chromodynamics / string theory / etc). His solution is extremely simple. It requires modification of assumptions that we have held for so long they have become part of the ingrained models.

       Many, many models can predict correct observation. However, many of these in the standard model are literally molded to fit without following causality.

We knew that there had to be an immensely powerful force that holds nucleons together, however instead of trying to figure out how this could be gravitation, we simply slapped a force with the exact energy required for confinement in the perfect place. This is much like dark energy and matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although it works - it doesn't logically follow from anything, mechanically, casually, etc. It's essentially a free-parameter that we have tweaked until it fit.

        How does this fit into the LHC?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The LHC has barely found anything of notice. There are many people even claiming that the Higgs find was completely concocted and that the research doesn't backup what they are saying. See
       <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Higgs-Fake-Particle-Physicists-Committee/dp/1492176249">

       They are going to continually dump billions of dollars into larger and larger accelerators, and imo, they are going to keep finding smaller and smaller shit. They should instead be focused on a fundamental pattern of division.

       Nassim says trying to figure out how particles work by smashing them into each other at c is kind of like smashing two 747s together to figure out how they fly.

       Spot-on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mainstream science is curve-fitted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I... like what you have to say,
       <a href="/u/d8_thc">
        /u/d8_thc
       </a>
       . I've been studying Nassim's work for years. While I am not dogmatic on his findings - I do not believe everything he purports is exactly correct - he has truly influenced my own
       <em>
        self-guided
       </em>
       research into the cosmos, the wherefore, and the fundamentals of reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to add to a few things you've mentioned above, although it is clear you do not need any help.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I mentioned: mainstream science is mostly curve-fitted these days. False predilections built on false pretenses built on false theories. I saw a highly-upvoted article on reddit a few months ago claiming that "If [this] particle didn't exist, there would be no time..." to which I replied (in another account), "This is just a cute way of saying the universe would be different if it weren't exactly how it is." They're a bunch of quacks, calling themselves scientists because they've learned what other people have discovered.
      </p>
      <p>
       So... dark matter, dark energy - all curve-fitting. Can't argue it. It was slapped on. "Oh, shit, our equations don't work!"
      </p>
      <p>
       "Well, if we shove this thing we made up into it, it works perfectly!!!!"
      </p>
      <p>
       "Right-o! It must exist!"
      </p>
      <p>
       It must be wholesome. It must be comprehensive. It must be self-evident. It must be observed. Either this
       <em>
        invisible
       </em>
       thing you just
       <em>
        made up
       </em>
       is real, or... you, sir, are dead wrong. Sorry. And it's OK! Universe very, very, very, extremely, incomprehensibly complex. We monkeys. Savvy? You were wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Higgs is bullshit. Another curve-fitted system. "My equations don't work unless I make something up - a magic particle... a... a... GOD particle." GMAFB.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have to say though, I don't think CERN themselves ever said they found "it." They just found
       <em>
        A
       </em>
       particle that vibrates within the frequency range they predicted.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pioneers of quantum physics discovered how essential the observer - consciousness - is in the grand scheme of empirical science. Consciousness is what is
       <em>
        seriously
       </em>
       lacking in physics, but I have a theory why (and all you non-free-willers can go fuck yourselves... you're just trying to justify progressive policy)... Consciousness is not subject to physical laws. There. I said it. So, reductionism and determinism do not apply. Mind. Body. Telling me my choices are an illusion is one of the most profound transgressions of mainstream, physical science.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wow... tangents.  Sorry.

       I seen his old doc.  Black whole. It was neat but afterwards looked into his work a bit more.  He's kind of a crackpot but I don't know enough of higher maths to make a decision on his work. It's interesting but he just gives me an ancient aliens kinda feel. Not that they are wrong just a bit out a left field.

       I'd like to know more about perception. My perception seems to be the glue,or the organizer of all these little blinks of energy. I once heard that consciousness is all, and it's units are everything. So even though for example I perceive a tree in front of me when my attention is on it, the tree wavers in and out of this reality. The tree is comprised of units, and those units can also be in multiple realities where they blink to. They may blink out and reconfigure themselves as a rock and have a duration in that reality of thousands of years, though I only perceive that blink as a fraction of a second. So there is a simultaneous transformation that occurs between all things but the perception doesn't perceive that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course this relates to being human. I perceive this blink of myself, but just like that tree I am blinking in and out. I think the rate is actually faster than Planck. So what I want to know is how to perceive the blinking out?

But the manner in which you perceive your reality and the incorporation of your configuration of time sequentially allows it to appear to you to be uninterrupted and a flow of constant continuous presence, but in actuality, you are continuously blinking in and out. If you slow time enough and bend time in a manner to generate the type of slowing that is required, you can actually objectively view a blink in or out.
      </p>
      <p>
       CAT: He wants to know if that is on his part or on my part.
      </p>
      <p>
       ELIAS: Both, for he is generating the action, creating the blink and projecting the energy and slowing time, and you are receiving the energy. Therefore, you receive the message of what is occurring and you configure it in like manner. Therefore, you also participate and slow time to view the action of blinking in and out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now; were you to be not receiving the energy, you would not notice. You would not view the actual appearance or disappearance."

       Now this is interesting and I think it's saying the continuity is the holographic illusion...
      </p>
      <p>
       "FEMALE:  Elias ... I’m really excited about this!  I forgot what my question was! (Laughter)  Oh, when I disappear ... I got it.  When I disappear for a second, and I’m aware that I come back, and I almost can hear a conversation, like if somebody is talking and I’m engaged in a conversation, sometimes I disappear and come back....
      </p>
      <p>
       ELIAS:  As you have within this moment!
      </p>
      <p>
       FEMALE:  Just now! (Everybody cracks up)  It’s like I’m aware that I almost had a conversation, and I can hear part of that conversation I had for that split-second (snapping fingers) like that.  Is that when I’ve disappeared into another focus, or I’ve become aware of it?
      </p>
      <p>
       ELIAS:  In a manner of speaking, yes.  This is what we term to be an objective awareness, partially, of the action of blinking in and out.
      </p>
      <p>
       You create this action continuously throughout all of your manifestations, but you also create an illusion within your perception that your attention continues uninterrupted within any particular focus.  In actuality, you are continuously blinking in and out of each focus, and in that, you are allowing yourself to turn your attention, in those moments of blinking out, to other focuses and other experiences of your essence.
      </p>
      <p>
       You view your attention to be quite singular and to be quite consistent.  View your experience of the alteration of identity, in meditation, of different faces superimposed upon one individual.  This is a physical example, in objective terms, of what I am expressing.  This is an allowance for your recognition of all of the focuses that are occurring simultaneously, and that they all occupy the same space arrangement and they all are occurring simultaneously, and that your attention is merely focused singularly upon one expression, one manifestation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, you identify one singular individual, and you identify all of the other focuses as separate individuals.  In actuality, they are not.  They are all you, and they are all occurring now, and you are participating in them all by blinking in and out continuously, and moving your attention from one to another to another to another to another continuously.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you have allowed yourself to participate within in that objective action is a melding of several within an objective recognition, not separating by blinking, but allowing yourself to view several simultaneously within one attention.

       There are undoubtedly holographic principles at play wherein consciousness interacts with matter. I believe the benefits of a broader understanding of this concept are limitless, but what initially comes to mind is 1) It will impart a more spiritual cognizance amongst our species - which induces calm and peace and 2) The advantages in technology that can be procured through this understanding are immeasurable.

       Well, EP=EPR is a massive mainstream theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Einstein Rosen Bridges are theoretical wormholes that would exist at the planck scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quantum foam has long been postulated to be made of planck scaled wormholes connecting and disconnecting at the planck time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because we are yielding the exact rest mass via the holographic principle, which means we know that the surface of the proton is holographically representing the volume, it can be extrapolated that most likely this is due to the EP=EPR paradigm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other things fall into place that confirm this - e.g. there are 10
       <sup>
        40
       </sup>
       PSUs on the surface. If each leads to a proton connecting to 10
       <sup>
        40,
       </sup>
       you get 10
       <sup>
        80,
       </sup>
       the estimated amount of particles in the Universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also - this is the very beginning of unified physics. These concrete answers and deductions will come in time :)

       Well, this is related to Buckminster Fullers geodesic domes. The packing is omni-triangulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can't tile circles onto a sphere surface, nor can we do it with triangles straight.

      <p>
       The solution of dividing one sphere by others necessitates totally space-filling spheres. Obviously tangential packing will result in gaps, and so sphere/spheres will not work. There are a few ways to pack overlapping spheres, yes, but there are a myriad of reasons for omnitriangulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, very importantly, this geometry is based on years and years of work by Buckminster Fuller - who called it synergetics.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is essentially a novel way of looking at energetic dynamics of geometry, notions such as tensegrity and n-frequency vectors are important here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially this geometry Nassim uses is extrapolated from a tetrahedral geometry. This geometry obviously doesn't exist on it's own, but it governs the interaction between these spheres.
      </p>
      <p>
       The smallest perimeter to area shape is a triangle. Extrapolate this in 3d for a tetrahedron. The tetrahedron is the most efficient way to pack spheres, and the Universe works on efficiency - as opposed to a cube which requires 'awkward' vectors of force to maintain its shape.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has to do with what Bucky called the Isotropic Vector Matrix and his Vector Equilibrium. The
       <a href="http://imgur.com/a/ORQ1V">
        isotropic vector matrix
       </a>
       being a fractal tetrahedron which he speculated to be the basic structure of spacetime, and the vector equilibrium/cubeoctahedra which he speculated to be the zero-point in energetic geometry, simply because the radial and edge lines are the same length, creating no vectors of force. The vector equilibrium is also able to

       , creating an energetic event in the lattice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bucky knew what the gravitational field was going to be decades ago, simply because of these principles.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “Omnitriangulated geodesic spheres consisting exclusively of three-way interacting great circles are realizations of gravitational field patterns… The gravitational field will ultimately be disclosed as ultra high-frequency tensegrity geodesic spheres. Nothing else.” - 
Buckminster Fuller

       It's not worked out yet. It's either because the shell is two PSU's thick, or some other reason.

       However, this is not the only physics equation wherein a 2 is required to satisfy the equation for an unknown reason. I had a list of other examples but cannot find it atm.

       Our mass values for the proton are extremely precise.

       Our charge radius values for the proton are consistently being altered.

       The most recent experiment utilizing muonic hydrogen yields 4% off of the standard models prediction.

       Here's where it gets interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nassim takes the current charge radius and deduces a mass. That mass is slightly off of our current mass values.
      </p>
      <p>
       He then takes the
       <em>
        accepted
       </em>
       (not his derived) mass value and deduces a radius, and uses it for a prediction.
      </p>
      <p>
       This radius is
       <em>
        extremely
       </em>
       close to the new muonic hydrogen radius experimental value, within one sigma.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may be that Nassim actually has the right radius, and our experiments are coming closer and closer, simply due to the fact that Nassim is using fundamental units (and our experimentally verified proton mass value).

       But it is not so new. The idea that propels the story – there is a universal super-consciousness / space that transcends time and space, and in which all human life is connected in a large matrix – has been around for about 3,000 years. It is Vedic and the central notion of the Upanishads, India’s oldest philosophical texts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Indra’s net, the Hindu metaphor which depicts the universe as an eternal web of existence spun by the king of the gods, each of its intersections adorned with an infinitely sided jewel, every one continually reflecting the others.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Look at the first Matrix movie,” says producer Peter Rader. “It’s a yogic movie. It says that this world is an illusion. It’s about maya – that if we can cut through the illusions and connect with something larger we can do all sorts of things. Neo achieves the abilities of the advanced yogis [Paramahansa] Yogananda described, who can defy the laws of normal reality.”

       every so often this same OP posts this same nonsense. He himself doesn't even understand it. He recites statements about measurements and mass and constants and blah blah blah, attempting to use technical language as he does it, but none of these statements would even signify anything about our reality regardless of whether the statements were true or false - that is, the statements have no actual semantic content; they literally imply nothing; nothing is revealed if they are true and nothing is revealed if they are false. Presumably, the OP has just been swept up in someone else's claims, repeating things he's heard, believing their supposed conclusions to be meaningful because they sound lofty, and because he's associated them with his own pet beliefs and assume they represent something they don't. Just the same, if you get swept up like the OP, you will fall for the nonsense as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please don't entertain this kind of nonsense, guys. If you can't start at A and follow consistent logic to B and arrive at the same results as the OP, don't even consider for a second believing this crap. Not even kidding when I say this is the type of thinking that facilitates delusion and mental illness.

       Nassim is a fake. Second year Physics majors can debunk a lot of his work (and we had a fun discussion about him in our SPS club). In this case, he seems to be taking work from someone else to an extreme conclusion. The basis for the particles existing in another plane (an ELI5 generalization of his work) sounds like a lecture Frank Wilczek gave at SMU a few years back. His work was still in the preliminary stages, though.

       Particles in another plane? I don't know what you're talking about but it's not Nassims work.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are multiple PHds on Nassims team, and Dr Elizabeth Rauscher Co wrote many of Nassims papers. She is a world renowned nuclear physicist with hundreds of published papers that basically started the field of quantum information science.

       Sorry, was referencing some of Nassim's other commonly known work. Dr. Rauscher seems to have an impressive background, but has focused her research since school on some very controversial topics. I would have expected some form of publishable, verifiable results on those topics at some point in the last 30 years. The other author on her most recent articles is a psychologist.
      </p>
      <p>
       From RationalWiki: entry under Nassim Haramein
      </p>
      <p>
       Haramein claims his theory explains the origin of spin, which he defines as a "spacetime torque." He claims that his amendment to Einstein’s field equations, incorporating torque and Coriolis effects in "'plasma dynamics'"[4] interacting with a "polarized geometric structured vacuum", produces a unified field theory. Further, he and Dr. Rauscher have developed a "Scaling Law for Organized Matter"[5], which characterizes all matter from subatomic to galactic and universal size as various sized black holes. His unified field theory and the fractals associated with this "Scaling Law" are integral to his concept of a "Holofractographic Universe". There's also something in there that uses the real field of cymatics[wp] to support his idea of "resonance".
[edit] Schwarzschild proton
      </p>
      <p>
       Drawing on the aforementioned "Haramein-Rauscher metric," Haramein proposed "the Schwarzschild proton," a theoretical model of the proton in which two black holes "orbit" one another. It may sound impressive, but it's almost entirely inconsistent with experimental observation. Anyone with even a basic knowledge of quantum mechanics knows that classical "orbits" do not apply at the scales addressed in his paper.
      </p>
      <p>
       A blog titled "Up" ran a number of posts debunking the Schwarzschild proton model.[6][7][8]
      </p>
      <p>
       The paper describing the model is available for download from his website.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that his Schwarzschild Proton paper has been debunked, Haramein claims to have published a new paper, "Quantum Gravity and the Holographic Mass" in the Physical Review and Research International Journal, at ScienceDomain International. Physical Review and Research International Journal is in fact not a scientific journal, but an "open peer reviewed" website where anyone can pay a fee and have their "research" "peer-reviewed" and then "published" on the website.[9]

       I honestly don't have time for this. Nassim (and his society) is known as "oh, that guy" to just about every Physics department everywhere. I haven't bothered to waste my time on him in years (since I was a TA). I cited this source because it was easily understood by all the other commenters who didn't know any math. If the particle is observed in experiments acting a certain way, and someone writes a theory that doesn't support the observed action, it's pretty easy to see the theory is crap. You can believe whatever you wish. I was only trying to show others that he (or anyone that works with him) can't be taken at face value.

       I wouldn't call reality a hologram. It's pretty solid. I'd rather call it a virtual reality with some properties of a hologram.

       The term hologram is misleading. It does not mean what you see in Star Wars.

       No, it means an image produced by light...light isn't solid. So how do you explain a hologram being solid?

       In this case hologram means the full image is available at every piece of the image.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not a 2d surface. The Universe is 3d. It's just that each discrete piece contains the information of the whole.

       But the image is made of light. So what is this holographic universe made of, and how does the hologram create physical objects? This has nothing to do with 2d vs 3d. Something may appear three dimensional but still have no physical property (it's not solid).
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the hologram part. Now the universe has many fractal properties as well, but not entirely. Fractals are not exclusive to holograms, and holograms are not solid. It's a VR with some properties of a hologram and some fractal processes, but the two don't have to be connected necessarily. Holograms are always fractal, but not all fractals are holograms.

       Well, in this theory, space is made of energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is only when light / these PSU spheres are co-orbiting at light speed when we see a particle. A particle is simply a vorticular dymamic of space, which is light.

       While the overall /holofractal theory might be true, beware of d8_thc and similar, their posts are mainly pseudoscience and gifs from /whoadude that somehow "prove" the world is a hologram. I'd do your own research tbh and just turn 180 degrees away from OP

       The term holographic means that it is ultimately made up of light. The holography you are referring to are illusions of light for display.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "solid" reality is actually a misconception. Just because you feel/experience solid objects as you do, doesn't mean they are totally solid. In fact, all matter is 99.999999% space. So I wouldn't really call reality "solid".
