Pretty much all regulars came to the conclusion that politics is a sham. Even when a true outsider is elected like Carter it did not make a difference. And, Trump is far from an outsider.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say that &quot;Trump shills&quot; are not actually true conservatives even if they use the word &quot;Republican&quot; to describe themselves - especially since the Trumpkins&#39; entire goal right now is to destroy the Republican party (so very interestingly aligned with the Dems!). Also important to note that those pointing out Clinton&#39;s crimes are not necessarily Trump fans.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s very existence has been a boon to Clinton&#39;s campaign when you see how easily people are trained to believe that criticizing Clinton is ex post facto an endorsement of Trump - which it is not.</p>

<p>So? Literally what is your point? As long as the mods are not actively taking one side over the other, then why should you give a shit? What, you think it&#39;s more topical to discuss 50 year old conspiracies that no longer matter while rome burns down around us? If you feel like taking a shit on donald trump and exposing his secrets, go right a head. Why should you care if it gets down voted? Downvotes mean absolutely nothing. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get plenty of pro-hillary shills to make you feel good about it so how do you lose out in any case? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But it&#39;s all related. I don&#39;t understand what you think would be more important? That idiot who made a post the other day about the moon landings being a hoax? This is a real conspiracy, happening right now in front of you and you want to put your head in the sand because it&#39;s not bi-partisan? You think the democrats can rig the vote if nobody actually supports the person they rig it for? That&#39;s dumb. How can you explain vote rigging to someone without the context of the decades of corruption hillary has participated in? You think you can just post some youtube video of some random guy hacking a voting booth and then call it a day? No way.</p>

<p>This is exactly how a real conspiracy should be handled: non-stop discussion with zero let up. It&#39;s the only way any random person can stand up to it. But instead, you want to cry about how politics have no business here? You fool! You&#39;ve been trained since birth to feel like that. You never thought it odd how everyone always says shit &quot;LOL LET NOT NOT TALK POLITICS, THOSE SHOULD BE PRIVATE ;)&quot;, that meme has been hammered into our brains all our lives specifically so we don&#39;t talk about the kind of back room deals going on right in front of us right now. </p>
