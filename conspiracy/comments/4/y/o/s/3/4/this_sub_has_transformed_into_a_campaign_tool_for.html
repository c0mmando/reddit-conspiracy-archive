       Sometimes it seems that way. Sometimes when people try to debate troublesome aspects of Trump's character, past, or political bedfellows they are attacked and downvoted to hell.

       Don't know why anyone has any faith in any politician. There's only maybe 2 I like- Ron Paul and Cynthia Mckinney.

       Imo there is more to this than just people falling for the show.

       I think Donald Trumps campaign is targeting people like us, the community that often is referred to as conspiracy theorists, who don't believe in Washington politics or mainstream media.

       I also wonder if you do something like "D0nalD Trunp is a p14nt" - would you get as many downvotes? Like, I actually think there are keyword searches out on Rump and pl4nt the way the agrichemical shills keyword search and go knives out when they see regular people discussing things like glyphosate and Monsanto.

       I'm holding out for September, by that time European and American school will be in session. Hopefully this sub will clear up a little then. I feel like theres a lot of younger people invested in their "side" who come here, and prob some trolls and a shill or two mixed in.
Pretty much all regulars came to the conclusion that politics is a sham. Even when a true outsider is elected like Carter it did not make a difference. And, Trump is far from an outsider.

       Non stop posts about dnc and shillary. I get it, she is corrupt to the core, but doing my research on trump I find he is equally as corrupt if not more.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is conspiracy. We all know politics is a sham. Except for those republican trump shills posting non stop about hillarys crimes. But the minute you shine light on trumps shadyness, it gets down voted to oblivion.

       I'd say that "Trump shills" are not actually true conservatives even if they use the word "Republican" to describe themselves - especially since the Trumpkins' entire goal right now is to destroy the Republican party (so very interestingly aligned with the Dems!). Also important to note that those pointing out Clinton's crimes are not necessarily Trump fans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's very existence has been a boon to Clinton's campaign when you see how easily people are trained to believe that criticizing Clinton is ex post facto an endorsement of Trump - which it is not.

       Among the real people I know, those voting for Trump are doing it because they can't stand Clinton. And those voting for Clinton are doing it holding their noses because Trump's the worst.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a few friends and family members who've woken up and voting third party (almost all Johnson, FWIW), but for some reason most of the old folks I know are chickenshit terrified of not participating in the duopoly - even though their own states are done deals and their votes won't count anyway - why not log a protest vote? It makes zero sense.

       Exactly! I've family members who know all about Trump's odd connections yet I know will STILL vote for him just because Hillary is the worst.

       Dumbass "lesser of two evils" nonsense. As if we only have 2 choices- candidates who are griends and hang with the same crowd, just like when 2 Skull and Bones members ran against one another.

       So? Literally what is your point? As long as the mods are not actively taking one side over the other, then why should you give a shit? What, you think it's more topical to discuss 50 year old conspiracies that no longer matter while rome burns down around us? If you feel like taking a shit on donald trump and exposing his secrets, go right a head. Why should you care if it gets down voted? Downvotes mean absolutely nothing. I'm sure you'll get plenty of pro-hillary shills to make you feel good about it so how do you lose out in any case?

       I live in America, where I have the freedom to choose my giving of shits. I posted this because  It's sad to see people on this sub fall for these political fallacies. There is a bigger conspiracy than the DNC and billery called
       <strong>
        Presidential Elections
       </strong>
       . You're half right about the downvotes, they do mean nothing, except that the post doesn't get seen by as many people. 
You don't have to badger me, I'm just sick of all the posts attacking DNC and shillary.  I feel like this is one big psy-0p

       But it's all related. I don't understand what you think would be more important? That idiot who made a post the other day about the moon landings being a hoax? This is a real conspiracy, happening right now in front of you and you want to put your head in the sand because it's not bi-partisan? You think the democrats can rig the vote if nobody actually supports the person they rig it for? That's dumb. How can you explain vote rigging to someone without the context of the decades of corruption hillary has participated in? You think you can just post some youtube video of some random guy hacking a voting booth and then call it a day? No way.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is exactly how a real conspiracy should be handled: non-stop discussion with zero let up. It's the only way any random person can stand up to it. But instead, you want to cry about how politics have no business here? You fool! You've been trained since birth to feel like that. You never thought it odd how everyone always says shit "LOL LET NOT NOT TALK POLITICS, THOSE SHOULD BE PRIVATE ;)", that meme has been hammered into our brains all our lives specifically so we don't talk about the kind of back room deals going on right in front of us right now.
