       The sell it to the masses at a young age.  If you went to a public highschool in the US, chances are you were bothered multiple times a year by recruiters posted up outside the cafeteria, pulling you and your friends over for a lil chat about becoming a soldier.

       Also the pledge of allegiance is a form of brain washing. And history classes omit anything (such as the My Lai massacre, orders to kill everyone over the age of 10 in the Philippines, native American massacres, etc.) that would paint the US as an empire. At least that was my experience.

       I was in, I joined at 18 and fully believed everytihg they were trying to sell. I did 9 years and looking back I'm glad I did because it made me into the man I am today. Plus I have several really positive things that came from being in.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said I am glad I got out. Excuse the metaphor but in the last few years I feel like Neo from the Matrix, finally waking up. I now see how fucked our government is and what it is willing to do. Many people in the military are starting to wake up and see it for what it really is. I will still recommend service to individuals because I do believe it makes you a stronger person but do your 4 or 6 years then peace out and go to college.

       Boy, you say you've opened your eyes but you're still speaking propaganda. As if we're in some dire struggle against a mortal enemy? Who? Isis? We created Isis. Russia? Russia just wants us to stop attacking people for no reason. In fact, we'd all be a lot better off if you people didn't join the army. How can you, knowing what you say you know, still recommend people volunteer for service? Just wondering.

       It s not about the conflicts and war. You guys can sit here at your screens and form your opinion and that is fine. But just remember its because of people who join the military we have that liberty. I know many of you think I am crazy but please take it from me, its not as nefarious as everybody thinks it is.
      </p>

       I was in the Coast Guard, I primarily did counter narcotic ops. While I don't agree with the war on drugs and I think its a failed policy being deployed and learning about myself, other cultures and people has opened me up to the bigger world. So many people never even leave the states and if they do they go to major tourist destinations. its all about perspective. Plus the majority of people joining up now are doing it just for the GI bill so they wont be up to their eyeballs in student loan debt.

       Lol, because of the military we have liberty? Why? Because Evil Saddam Hussein would have taken it away from us? No, we gave millions in arms and training during the cold war, and he was our attack dog against Iran. So, in the end, we had to shoot him down like an old dog who was losing his grip. Of course, we could have just decided not to go into other sovereign countries and play geopolitical war games all around the planet out of some sick megalomaniacal desire to craft the entire world in our image? We could not even need to be enemies with Iran if we just stopped our alliance with Israel! That's the whole reason we're against them anyway. So, in the end, as always, it comes down to maintaining our sick desire to have a stranglehold around the neck of other countries that have nothing to do with us, and in this we find and create enemies. So forgive me for this but I'm calling bullshit on this whole "without us you wouldn't be free!" garbage. That might work on some people who don't know American history. Maybe if the CIA didn't go around overthrowing democratic governments just because they wanted to nationalize their own oil, we wouldn't need to spend trillions on national defense. Just an idea. Nobody really wants war in this world besides our country and Israel. We're the problem. We will have to be dealt with or world war 3 will come very quickly. Time magazine is already speaking of a "New Axis of Evil". They've got their sights on Iran within the next decade, as I'm sure you know. Tell me why any sane person would be thankful for all of this stuff I've just described?

       Hey man, everybody is entitled to their own opinions. I'm not saying you are totally wrong but when you have somebody with personal experience vouch for something you have no experience with other than through the looking glass you should value their opinion a little more. Yes the US uses its military for shitty things, but they use it for good things too. Who do you think takes all the aid to foreign countries when there is a disaster? Who is typically the first on the ground during a disaster? Military members. There are always two sides to the coin.

       Foreign aid is our government donating to itself, we only give aid when we know we will earn it right back. For instance, we will give a few million in aid to Haiti for instance, but these government contracts are given out with no-bids and they go straight through companies like Monsanto who provide a country with self-terminating seeds to rebuild crops, but then they need to keep buying crops from monsanto because they are designed to stop growing after one season. So basically, it is always an investment, and it is never, EVER, out of the good will of their heart. Whether or not you know this as the people on the ground is not really what I'm getting at, I'm sure you had good intent and I can appreciate that. But intentions don't really matter when you're signing your life over to the United States Army, at that point you're just another pawn in the game.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand you thought you were doing good when you signed up and I'm not lambasting you for that. I'm only criticizing because you're smart enough to know otherwise and you still say you recommend to young men they sign their life away? That's just mean. I get that when you were young and naive you signed up to do some good, but now you're older, and you can be that presence in some other young man's life that you should have had before you signed up yourself. You can be that influence that says to another man "You know, that's really honorable that you would give your life for your country, but it's a bad decision and here's why...."
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what you need to be doing, and if you don't believe it's a bad decision you need to do more research, because I can tell you that we are continually lied into war after war after war and it has nothing to do with helping people, and it has nothing to do with any of the reasons you are told. Right now we are in Syria because we are in the process of making conditions for a greater Israel in the middle east. You can read about this in Oded Yinon's “A Strategy for Israel in the Nineteen Eighties”, who details the entire plan in plain english for you to read. They are trusting that Americans are too lazy to read a few pages of plain text, prove them wrong.

       Who's going to keep an eye on countries like North Korea if there isn't a military? The military does get used  for political and corporate agendas but it's still there to protect citizens and deter the adolfs of the world.  It also helps some people out that come from bad walks of life.

       I didn't say it made me a man, I said it made me the man I am today, big difference. People can hate on the military, but in the grand scheme of things being in the military isn't all that fucking bad. Good pay, benefits, education. Plus you get to travel, sure you may end up on a shitty deployment but going to those places shows you how much more fortunate we are than people in 3rd world countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can hate on it all you want, but IMO don't hate on something unless you have first hand experience and don't put a blanket label of everybody who has joined. The military has helped so many young people escape bad situations. If the military was so bad why do people still sign the dotted line. Just because you didn't have the balls to do it doesn't mean other people shouldn't.

       I had a few friends in high school join - one of my best friends actually. He, and the others, all didn't like school and formal education, so the army was a gig they could do after high school while everyone else was going to college.

      <p>
       Luckily, all of them survived their deployments in the Middle East. At that time for me too, I was completely oblivious to anything going on other than the tales of the mainstream media.

       I am completely against war and very much dislike many of the ways that my government uses its military. But I have considered enlisting as a way to help pay down student debts. If they offered a program to absolve all federal student loans for six years of service then I'd probably sign up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have multiple degrees and my salary has been stagnant since starting at a fortune 50 company, five years ago. Many many people are in way shittier situations than I am in. In fact I barely have anything to complain about considering how stable my job is and how reputable the company. But the debt is piling up for all of us and if the US Military were to pay it off, throw in access to VA loans and give us health care for life then it'd be too good of an offer to refuse. Besides the idea of being a military scientist doesn't sound that bad, though I doubt they do much of their research themselves these days.

       When I was 22 and a major us bank offered me a spot in their "management development program, I turned it down. The money would've been 120k during 2-3 years of training and 180k after that. I had qualms about working for an evil enterprise and stuck with my idea to try and make it in tech. Now, several years later, I have barely moved forward in my career. I have earned another degree which should move my market value quite a bit higher than it is now but I do regret not just selling out when I had the chance. I was stupid and young and if I had the option to fix that mistake then I would do so in a heart beat.

       Keeping our country safe from the big bad boogie man terrorist?
      </p>
      <p>
       These people go and lay their lives down thinking its to keep the country's freedom in tact, but alas tis not true. If the US were in threat of invasion then yes their enlistment is a righteous act, but to pay the ultimate price to line the pockets of greedy men and women is American folly. Besides we kill innocent people over seas everyday. It's disgusting. People that aren't even concerned about America die left and right. Who knows the next Gandhi could have been slain by predator drones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Becoming apart of our military after a complete reform of our government for the good of the nation is one thing, but joining to eliminate debt is foolishness as well. Money is not worth your life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't mean disrespect to those who have served in the past, but reform in our government ousting all the corruption is needed before we send teenagers, young adults, and adults in to die for as a false as a statement as "fighting for our freedom".

       I joined when I was 21. I thought I was doing something great, something to be proud of. When I got there I could tell relatively quickly that all these young kids are being brain washed and pushed to do thing they really wouldn't have agreed with beforehand. I was in Ft. Leonardwood and it was summer. My experience changed my life in such a way that I now have severe trust issues and it's hard for me to believe/trust authority. The way that they treated women, “females” was pretty bad too. I understand it's supposed to be hard but the hard pill to swallow was how corrupt it was and how easy it was to rile up and brain wash everyone. It honestly scared the shit out of me. Every Sunday was breakfast, church then from there we watched the newest Rambo. Marching back we would yell, shoot em in the head shoot em in the head kill em. Get a body bag get a body bag fill it. Fucking sick. I was discharged and never looked back. I'm now ashamed I was even there. Sorry to rant but to be blunt, I have no freaking idea why anyone would join other than money. It ain't worth it unless you don't care about life.
