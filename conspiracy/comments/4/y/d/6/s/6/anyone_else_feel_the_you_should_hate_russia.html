        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>They tricked many people with 9/11 into falsely hating Arabs when now it&#39;s basically understood that America criminally and illegally invaded the middle East using a false flag as an excuse.</p>

<p>But now they are trying to make us hate Russia and it&#39;s not sticking.</p>

<p>You can almost smell the next huge false flag on American soil that will result in the deaths of many to push us into the next war.</p>

<p>Interesting times indeed.</p>

<p>Once you break away from the blind nationalism, the empty shell of America reveals itself that WE in fact, were the bad guys the whole time.</p>

<p>Gives you a different viewpoint on the people fighting back. These people are just trying to fight back against tyranny . </p>

<p>Imagine your town was invaded by a foreign force when you did nothing wrong.</p>

<p>The character defects within people in charge are massive.</p>

<p>Greed being at the top.</p>

<p>HOWEVER... Russia and China both also have a roll to play in all this. I suggest you read the following to see what part they have to play in the new world that is being thrust upon us.</p>

<p>This guy definately lays out the strategy well and it is healthy to be aware.</p>

The internet has made us realize that 99.9% of people on this planet mostly want the same things out of life as we do; to enjoy it peacefully and under our own power. Its becoming harder and harder to paint the other guy as a demon and less than human in order to further their means.</p>

<p>The draft will never happen again, purely because nobody will abide short of the Russians actually landing in Alaska with an expeditionary force. I want to believe nobody will suffer that meat grinder ever again, and that scares the top.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read this story once that was about monkeys, maybe apes, not sure. The point of it was that a hotel had thrown out some tainted meat, and so the dick monkeys, the greedy monkeys, they ate it all first, and then they died. Researchers expected new assholes to arise naturally from the stock of nice monkeys that survived, but none did. It was like so and so many generations later, and they were still the most peaceful tribe of monkeys; also still competitive amongst their peer groups in terms of ability to provide. </p>

<p>Sometimes liberty must be renewed with the blood of tyrants and patriots, sometimes hotels throw out meat that kills all the tyrants, and maybe someday, someone will find a parallel that would work as tainted bait for the rich and evil. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah this is what I&#39;ve been thinking lately. </p>

<p>I was too quick to praise Russia as a possible savior of the West but ultimately this could all be a show that all of the world leaders/elite are in on. All of the elites(including Russia&#39;s) will profit tremendously if they NWO succeeds. Why would another country run by elites want to stop that plan?</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t researched this enough to say for certain but it seems like the modern jewish global domination started with the bolshevik revolution in Russia in 1917. </p>

<p>Now, if these same people wanted to take over America, what would be the best way to do it? They would have to destroy America from the inside as they would lose in a direct war. </p>

<p>It does look like America is falling apart from the inside in the last few months. </p>

<p>It&#39;s always a good card to hold on to and play it at a later date. Plus, the old &quot;mutually assured destruction&quot; thing -- what do we know that the Russians don&#39;t want their people to know? </p>

<p>And one other thing: I don&#39;t read Russian (or would it be Cyrillic?), so who&#39;s to say what&#39;s been published over there that we&#39;ve never had translated for us? Maybe the fake moon landings are a much more commonly known event elsewhere. </p>

<p>We&#39;re all getting a bit wiser, now. The Internet just shreds misconceptions, even through all the paid troll nonsense. Once you really start looking, the douches invariably turn out to have untraceable accounts. </p>

<p>&quot;Everyone&#39;s a douche when they&#39;re anonymous&quot; is what I used to think... but I&#39;ve been doing this since BBS&#39;s and Ham Radio were the digs... and people didn&#39;t USED TO BE douches when they were anonymous. Something drastically changed around 2000-2002, and if you weren&#39;t on AOL or CompuServe or BBS&#39;s before they got the TrollVasion, you would never know the difference.</p>

<p>I&#39;m coming to the conclusion that somewhere between 50% and 90% of ALL the fucked up people on the Internet are being paid to be that way... </p>

<p>In real life, 5% to 15% of people are douches. Online, and anonymous, it&#39;s like 25% or higher, quite often... and these douches are more douchy than ANYONE on my flawed, flawed facebook friend list. [I babble incoherently sometimes when I&#39;m too happy or excited... apologies]</p>

<p>That is ridiculous. Read about the <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/30420106/suler.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;amp;Expires=1471575133&amp;amp;Signature=He%2F0QenUzZi1OcwIFZfxUlTUse0%3D&amp;amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DThe_online_disinhibition_effect.pdf">Online Disinhibition Effect</a></p>

<p>&quot;While online, some people self-disclose or act out more frequently or intensely than they
would in person. This article explores six factors that interact with each other in creating this
online disinhibition effect: dissociative anonymity, invisibility, asynchronicity, solipsistic introjection,
dissociative imagination, and minimization of authority. Personality variables
also will influence the extent of this disinhibition. Rather than thinking of disinhibition as
the revealing of an underlying “true self,” we can conceptualize it as a shift to a constellation
within self-structure, involving clusters of affect and cognition that differ from the in-person
constellation.&quot;</p>

<p>Also the crimea issue is not black and white. I think that hasn&#39;t gone to plan for the CIA as expected and it has pissed them off.</p>

<p>In the game of chess that is world politics, Putin has played it better at the moment. If you follow the lessons from history, this is leading to a war. I&#39;m hoping people power can stop it (doubt it though). When your Internet becomes vetted and blocked (which is starting) then we&#39;re on the way as they can drip feed the lies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Crimean issue is very black and white. Crimea has traditionally belonged to Russia, but was forced to cede it (once again, as it has been outright taken by force back and forth more than once) to the Ukraine when the Soviet Union dissolved (it was part of a UN mandate). That entire area has been populated by ethnic Russians (not Ukranians) for well over 1600 years. Too add icing on the cake, Russia, even after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, has kept one of their major nuclear powered navy bases in Crimea, and it was threatened with annexation by the Ukranian government. It should come as no shock that a nationalist Russian leader such as Putin would step in and say, &quot;Nyet.&quot; and take the entire area back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, fair enough. This is good, though: now we&#39;re talking about empathy for the supposed &quot;enemy&quot;, rather than just accusing only one side of playing intimidation politics.</p>

<p>So, let&#39;s look at Ukraine and the Crimea from that perspective. Leaving aside the &quot;why and who&quot; of how the conflict started for the sake of argument, it can only be described at this point as a civil war in SE Ukraine. What possible basis could the US have for trying to chastise Russia for &quot;annexing&quot; the Crimea, a region that has been part of Russia longer than the US has existed? Do you really think that in Ukraine, a country that has only existed in its current boundaries since the 1940s (I think, though it might have been the 20s? I&#39;m not sure on this) there are not people who still identify as Russian, as well as people who side with Ukrainian independence? Does anyone trying to look at all sides of this picture really think the Russians would roll over and let Ukrainian &quot;ultra-nationalists&quot; seize their naval base, or in other words let NATO take control of it by proxy? (this would be a good point to look into the full story of who and why the crisis started, and who some of the Ukrainian ultra-nationalists are, btw)</p>

<p>And Russia has been expressing concerns about the NATO advancements in ex-Warsaw Pact countries, placement of missile systems in same areas, and the increasing frequency and scale of military exercises in the Baltics and Poland. Are these not intimidation politics? The accusations that Russia is planning to &quot;invade&quot; these countries seem sketchy at best, and major Russian military build-up on their borders did not happen until AFTER the Ukrainian crisis started to unfold, afaik.</p>

<p>Look back at the history of the Cuban Missile Crisis, and try and compare it to these events. When tensions rose, Kennedy did not dismiss Khrushchev&#39;s concerns about NATO IRBMs in Turkey as &quot;Russian propaganda&quot; and paint him as nothing but an evil dictator, and similarly Khrushchev acknowledged that he bore responsibility to put pressure on Cuba to withdraw the Soviet IRBMs. Comparing to current events, it would be like if Khrushchev had ignored Kennedy and tried to create a permanent Soviet base in Cuba...something tells me the Russians are not going to let that happen any more than the US would (or should) have in 1962.</p>

<p>And all of the above is obviously still a huge oversimplification of the Russia-Ukrainian-European history behind &quot;Putin&#39;s aggression&quot;. I&#39;m not trying to portray myself as an &quot;expert&quot;, I&#39;m simply saying <em>stop taking the 3-minute soundbite history on CNN at face value</em>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that a lot of anti American feelings from Russians come from the fact that we in the United States operate kind of under &quot;Do as I say, not as I do&quot; mentality.</p>

<p>The difference is American government sugar coats everything to give us a self righteous feeling, while Putin openly says this is what we&#39;re doing, deal with it. That in itself deserves a little bit of respect vs the sheraid we play here.</p>

<p>Time and time again we have shown that our moral compass isn&#39;t always right and is aimed towards our benefit. Invading countries we want to invade, while telling others they aren&#39;t allowed to, is hypocritical on the grand scale of things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Things to remember about touring North Korea: </p>

<p>1) First and foremost, when given instructions about when and where you can go, by your host and (the plethora) of armed guards there. YOU LISTEN AND OBEY.</p>

<p>2) Don&#39;t get cutesy about stealing signs or other shit, like that dumbass kid did and now is serving time with hard labor.</p>

<p>3) Don&#39;t spout religious propaganda of any sort. In fact, don&#39;t take any religious material with you at all unless something is misconstrued as you trying to subvert their social harmony and you end up in prison serving time with hard labor.</p>

<p>4) Don&#39;t insult Dear Leader or reference Team America: World Police.</p>

<p>5) Never get more drunk or eat more food than your host.</p>

<p>6) Use good manners - the educated North Koreans appreciate etiquette.</p>

<p>7) Don&#39;t take any electronics you don&#39;t mind losing permanently.</p>

<p>8) Be mindful of not littering or spitting in public even if you see locals do it.</p>

<p>9) Remember that you will more than likely not be able to bring anything you buy in North Korea back with you, due to trade embargoes, customs rules, etc. If you have to get a burner phone to use while in North Korea, you have plenty to choose from that are manufactured in China and you can just dispose of before you leave (and yes, your calls are always monitored).</p>

<p>10) Don&#39;t expect any use of the internet outside of certain areas, and even then it is very much like China, with only approved sites, etc.</p>

<p>And lets not make this a Trump discussion. He has his own role to play in this globalist evolution they are forcing upon the world.</p>

<p>Besides, the fact that he suggests &quot;poll watchers&quot; when he fully knows that the elections are rigged electronically in my eyes, shows he is complicit in the corruption. Once again, giving an illusion that he cares. he fully knows having poll watchers wont do anything to stop the electronic fraud. He is also from the same royal bloodline as every president. He and Hillary are cousins ( yes, for real ).</p>

<p>If you still think that there is a difference between the candidates. You are mistaken.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone here should read Sutton.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1973, Sutton published a popularized, condensed version of the sections of the forthcoming third volume relevant to military technology called National Suicide: Military Aid to the Soviet Union after which he was forced out of the Hoover Institution. His conclusion from his research on the issue was that the conflicts of the Cold War were &quot;not fought to restrain communism&quot; since the United States, through financing the Soviet Union &quot;directly or indirectly armed both sides in at least Korea and Vietnam&quot; but the wars were organised in order &quot;to generate multibillion-dollar armaments contracts.&quot;</p>

<p>In a few words: there is no such thing as Soviet technology. Almost all — perhaps 90-95 percent — came directly or indirectly from the United States and its allies. In effect the United States and the NATO countries have built the Soviet Union. Its industrial and its military capabilities. This massive construction job has taken 50 years. Since the Revolution in 1917. It has been carried out through trade and the sale of plants, equipment and technical assistance</p>

<p>In his book Between Two Ages: America&#39;s Role in the Technetronic Era (New York: Viking Press;1970), Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote:</p>

<p>For impressive evidence of Western participation in the early phase of Soviet economic growth, see Antony C. Sutton&#39;s Western Technology and Soviet Economic Development: 1917–1930, which argues that &#39;Soviet economic development for 1917–1930 was essentially dependent on Western technological aid&#39; (p.283), and that &#39;at least 95 per cent of the industrial structure received this assistance.&#39; (p. 348). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright folks, lets call me controversial, I&#39;m clinching my buttcheeks for the incoming downvotes, but isn&#39;t unpopular opinions what this sub is all about?</p>

<p>Here is the thing. More and more I see people glorifying Russia. And I get it, USA is a meanie and sucks, but usually the men who complain about Russia.. Well they don&#39;t speak Russian. Now I do and I follow their news. I see it for what it is - a huge, patriotic superpower that considers neighboring countries as their property, glorifies war and can do whatever it wants. Remind you of something?</p>

<p>All the Putin lovers are basically new &quot;Che Guevara&quot; T-shirt wearers. You think you are in opposition when glorifying Putin, but you actually are in the same boat - sucker for a greedy superpower.</p>

<p>Whenever people talk about Russia they talk about their own made up idea of Russia. I&#39;m looking in this thread..</p>

<p>&quot;Russians do not hate gays&quot; - Where do you get that information? They are called &quot;faggots&quot; even by the highest officials of the country. There is an overwhelming hate against gays.</p>

<p>&quot;Russians do not want war&quot; - What is this? Have you seen Russians talking about war? They still glorify their WWII days as it was a week ago. The moment you&#39;ll raise that flag against any small country as an enemy, the hordes will flow.</p>

<p>No why do you think that only USA caused bad things, but not Russia? Well, here we go again - you do not speak Russian or follow the blogosphere. Also, the powers that controlled Russia have not actually fallen. While USA is sorry for everything, the natives, the blacks, all of that... Russia is not sorried, so it doesn&#39;t cry all the time, so you just do not know it. </p>

<p>USA or Russia: just 2 superpowers who pretend to have opposite ideals (gays, masculinity, etc) while being the same in their core. Don&#39;t get duped folks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, do not hate. But see things for what they are. Remember - Russian propaganda machine is much stronger than in USA, because they WANT to believe it.</p>

<p>Before Ukraine, everyone was for Klitchko, the boxer. Everyone said &quot;Show those cunts what SLAVS are made of!&quot; The second Ukraine war started, all Ukranians changed from &quot;brother slavs&quot; to &quot;useless slur&quot;. Everyone waited for him to be destroyed. </p>

<p>The moment you&#39;ll see how fast it changes will be the moment you understand the wish of Russians to believe.</p>

<p>Here is the thing. It does not matter what Putin says in the slightest. He controls the media, he doesn&#39;t have to say anything. What DOES matter is what is allowed to be said. That is why watching what Putin says in his speeches is useless. You have to immerse in the whole culture to see what actually happens. You are basically listening to what Obama says about Healthcare plan. Really unbiased.</p>

<p>Plus Putin is rational and doesn&#39;t have to work through the same politics the US does. He can act faster than we can.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not entirely sure on the rationality actually. He commits real North Korean style tactics. For example, if he were rational, he would have waited about 5 years more before he takes Crimea (if one really thinks he was not directly involved, this won&#39;t be a long discussion.)</p>

<p>After 5 years NATO would have been obsolete and Europe would have much more problems. For some reason he decided that the time was then and there. Only they did not get the south corridor through Mariupol, even though they tried and tried again. Thus leaving Putin with a glorified Crimea&#39;s &quot;reunification&quot;, but no land bridge to support it with. And that is why Putin dealt with his generals in a Soviet way.</p>

<p>Also, yes, he can act faster than other countries. While it points out to the overblown bureaucracy and general spinelessness of the west, it also shows how much control the man has in the country. If all you need is to make a call and your will is God&#39;s will, of course things will happen fast. </p>

Think of governments as major &quot;sections&quot; of this puzzle, and each has their own set of given instruction to make sure that puzzle gets complete.

    <div class="md"><p>Ooooo-kay. But I don&#39;t think everything that is planned, organized and set in motion plays out the way the people who are doing the planning, organizing and motion-setting expect. A few examples:</p>

<p>1- Boston bombing was intended to be much, much worse. An attack on the JFK library was foiled (remember the early reports that a bomb went off?) and other events that day were held in check. That&#39;s why the martial law thing was so ridiculous for just two guys -- it was supposed to be martial law during a hunt for a much larger group.</p>

<p>2- Remember those ISIS beheading videos? Revealed as frauds and then they just....stopped? Many sheep were scared but many were not. </p>

<p>3- The Orlando shooting. LOTTA people questioned that one, to the point where they&#39;ve pretty much had to sweep it under the carpet. </p>

<p>Things are percolating. The fuckery is dawning on more people every day. They&#39;re realizing that, as you wrote &quot;most of it is a lie.&quot;</p>

<p>So I ask you more specifically: You wrote &quot;Change is coming, and it&#39;s not what you expect.&quot; What is the change? What is the &quot;change&quot; going to be, exactly? Or at least the ballpark version?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Religion was created for a population without common knowledge, those who barely understand why the grass below them grows green, or how mountains are formed. For they were too uneducated to understand. We however are not, and though ancient teachings of the unknown make sense, it is merely because you already know the truth. If humanity ever reaches the point were we visit planets, and say we find early intelligent life. What will they see us as? Something like them? Or a God.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re never going to get to that stage. You think the world can continue as it is for another even 60 years? You&#39;re deluding yourself. You&#39;re also deluding yourself if you simply think the elite use occult symbolism and rituals for fun. These guy&#39;s don&#39;t do things &#39;for fun&#39; especially not mock human sacrifices . Or doing ceremonies with dancing goats and &#39;fallen angels&#39; depicted in the ceremonies do they? The only reason you think &#39;aliens exist&#39; is because of the propaganda by the mainstream media for 60 years propagating the idea of aliens. If anything they&#39;re setting up a false flag alien invasion and people like you are buying it hook line and sinker. Because if this scenario unfolds, and aliens rock up on the scene you&#39;re being pre programmed to expect the outcome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post. I would like to add the point that they&#39;re trying to do this more with Syria than with Russia. I don&#39;t think many people want a direct US/Russian conflict, so they have all these proxy wars. And to justify sending troops to the proxy wars, there&#39;s all this propaganda about how it&#39;s a humanitarian mission to save the people of Syria from their evil ruler Assad. Anything that supports this narrative is blasted through the media over and over. While conveniently ignoring the whole &quot;funding FSA/ISIS&quot; side of things, which is the mechanism by which the west is funding an overthrow of syria</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our government has been trying to paint Russia as our enemy for literally decades. They only paused briefly when a few countries in the middle-east wouldn&#39;t fall in line with the plans for control of oil production and distribution. Now that that&#39;s clearing up the Military-Industrial Complex that Eisenhower warned us about has to switch gears and return focus onto the next imaginary threat.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is we have to get our own house in order before we can even begin to think about correcting others. The United States is a super power and with that comes certain responsibilities. First and foremost is to lead by example.</p>

<p>We had no business in Crimea. We had no business in Syria, nor Libya, nor Iraq, etcetera. For our survival as a nation we need to bring our troops home, focus on fixing the problems within our borders, and change our foreign policy from interventional to observational.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Recently I started thinking about why we still have troops in the middle east and there is still talk of invading Iran and possibly others. Why? They&#39;re no threat to us. They don&#39;t really even have anything we want. Sure, many of the puppeteers get richer from contracts with the war machine itself, but is that really it?</p>

<p>Then it hit me. The middle east is intended to be the theatre for a ground war with Russia. Neither side wants the fighting to start on their soil. If we already have an excuse for having troops and infrastructure in the desert, and we can reach Russia from right next door, that&#39;s where the fighting will begin. And because it&#39;s removed from our doorsteps, both nations will tolerate it until it escalates, but by then it&#39;ll be too late.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s working and it is preparing the next phase, which will probably be a coup (presented as &quot;democratic revolution&quot; or &quot;Russian spring&quot;) or a massive war.</p>

<p>They are after Russia, Iran and the BRICs. No doubt about that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They have already been trying the Russia springs but Soros, and his buddies got kicked out of Russia by Putin. Basically the usual tactics are not working so it&#39;s true they may be falling back on trying to start a war.</p>

<p>And the reason a false flag will be out right required is because at this point the people of the West are starting to hate their own leadership worse than the Russians. We tell them we don&#39;t want more immigration, and they flood us with every refugee that can fit on a ship. And our young have no good job opportunity because they were complicit is mass outsourcing. Turns out our leaders made themselves rich but did so at the expense of burning all the good will with their peasants. So when they need us for war now we have no interest of answering the call.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you&#39;re wrong. Russians don&#39;t like gay people. They call them &quot;fags&quot;, &quot;голубой&quot; (literally means &quot;blue&quot;), sometimes they use the word &quot;gay&quot;.</p>

<p>Women don&#39;t seem to have much problem with gay guys, but men tend to behave rather agressively. Bullying is inevitable if you&#39;re openly gay, especially in smaller cities. In Moscow, St. Petersburg, Tyumen, Ekaterinburg, Krasnodar and other big cities it is better, but not so much really.</p>

<p>I&#39;m Russian, and I know what I&#39;m talking about. Personally I don&#39;t care if someone is gay as long as they don&#39;t show it (like, coloured nails, the way they walk, etc).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because they use &quot;slurs&quot; doesn&#39;t mean hate. In North America something that&#39;s &quot;gay&quot; doesn&#39;t have to be homosexual, it&#39;s also used to indicate something is:</p>

<p>stupid; a bad idea; dumb; </p>

<p>Example: &quot;yo I love vanilla ice cream!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Vanilla ice cream is gay, chocolate is the shit&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, fair enough. This is good, though: now we&#39;re talking about empathy for the supposed &quot;enemy&quot;, rather than just accusing only one side of playing intimidation politics.</p>

<p>So, let&#39;s look at Ukraine and the Crimea from that perspective. Leaving aside the &quot;why and who&quot; of how the conflict started for the sake of argument, it can only be described at this point as a civil war in SE Ukraine. What possible basis could the US have for trying to chastise Russia for &quot;annexing&quot; the Crimea, a region that has been part of Russia longer than the US has existed? Do you really think that in Ukraine, a country that has only existed in its current boundaries since the 1940s (I think, though it might have been the 20s? I&#39;m not sure on this) there are not people who still identify as Russian, as well as people who side with Ukrainian independence? Does anyone trying to look at all sides of this picture really think the Russians would roll over and let Ukrainian &quot;ultra-nationalists&quot; seize their naval base, or in other words let NATO take control of it by proxy? (this would be a good point to look into the full story of who and why the crisis started, and who some of the Ukrainian ultra-nationalists are, btw)</p>

<p>And Russia has been expressing concerns about the NATO advancements in ex-Warsaw Pact countries, placement of missile systems in same areas, and the increasing frequency and scale of military exercises in the Baltics and Poland. Are these not intimidation politics? The accusations that Russia is planning to &quot;invade&quot; these countries seem sketchy at best, and major Russian military build-up on their borders did not happen until AFTER the Ukrainian crisis started to unfold, afaik.</p>

<p>Look back at the history of the Cuban Missile Crisis, and try and compare it to these events. When tensions rose, Kennedy did not dismiss Khrushchev&#39;s concerns about NATO IRBMs in Turkey as &quot;Russian propaganda&quot; and paint him as nothing but an evil dictator, and similarly Khrushchev acknowledged that he bore responsibility to put pressure on Cuba to withdraw the Soviet IRBMs. Comparing to current events, it would be like if Khrushchev had ignored Kennedy and tried to create a permanent Soviet base in Cuba...something tells me the Russians are not going to let that happen any more than the US would (or should) have in 1962.</p>

<p>And all of the above is obviously still a huge oversimplification of the Russia-Ukrainian-European history behind &quot;Putin&#39;s aggression&quot;. I&#39;m not trying to portray myself as an &quot;expert&quot;, I&#39;m simply saying <em>stop taking the 3-minute soundbite history on CNN at face value</em>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People keep saying that Trump will turn everything into a joke, and forget the man idolizes Sun Tzu and Machiavelli, and discusses in depth his use of their tactics (lure your enemy in with distractions, act a fool when you are wise, etc) in several of his own books. He isn&#39;t as stupid as people would like to pretend he is.</p>
