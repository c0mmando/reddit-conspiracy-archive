       I can't believe I'm writing this as I considered myself an atheist up until a few weeks ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       In revelations, the second coming of Jesus is described as a man who would be persecuted. Also described as having snow white hair. ( Assange? )
      </p>
      <p>
       Next I've seen evidence of Trump holding up the 666 with numerology all over the place.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is, Hillary also holds up the baphemet signs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could there be two antichrist? Does this relate in the Bible in anyway?
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone could chime in that would be interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because it piqued my interest I took it to google regarding Assange as second coming Jesus. To my surprise I wasnt the only one to make the connection. Wtf...

       Check out "The Little Apocalypse" in Mathew. It's pretty much Jesus talking to His homies about the end of the world. It's my favorite.

       As in the expression of Aleister Crowley? Where he accepted he was the devil and had the motto
       <em>
        do as thou wilt
       </em>
       where he could be as wicked as he wanted to be until his heart was contempt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or like the more acceptance that you are of the devil and more in line with following the orders of God in which you also follow the 10 commandments and all of that but understanding who you are at the same time.

       Ah I see interesting, I wasn't aware that many people were into admitting it. I've spoken with a few people into the ideology that told me what it was they believed and it made sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a satanist who asked me the question, if I could come back as any race on the planet, what would I come back as, I told him Asian (I was atheist at the time) because I thought Asian chicks were the bee knees...
      </p>
      <p>
       Curious I asked him the same question and he told me black. I think about it all the time actually.

       I was raised constantly hearing about Revelations.  Things aren't great but they've been a lot worse and a lot more evil (WWII).  I don't recall ever reading about two antichrists in Revelations.  Revelations also has a lot of symbolism to wade through.  I found it difficult to understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing I do remember was back when I was in college one of my professors told me the US Civil War was the precursor to WWI.  That always stuck with me.  I believe Churchill said if you want to know what the future holds, then look to the past.  I believe WWII may have very well been a precursor to the coming antichrist and a one world government.

       If you are going to jump down the religious rabbit hole only based on the doom and gloom end of the world stuff you will find every hidden connection you are looking for. 
Confirmation bias is real. 
Revelations does not count. 
The whole thing is an allegory/ metaphor. 
Focus on the actually fucked up things in the world and spread awareness.

       There is nothing about him being persecuted this time round; in fact, he's supposed to really kick some ass. He paid his dues before, and soon the devil and his money changing minions are going to pay theirs. 1/3 of life on Earth will be lost in the struggle.

       Fine, even though you tried to make this not about the description of Jesus, Ill give it to you simply you force you to dig a deeper hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moses was born a Hebrew – Israelite from the tribe of Levi (Exodus 2:1-3). He spent 40 years in the House of Pharaoh (Acts 7:23) and from the time he was an infant, passed as the Pharaoh’s grandson (Exodus 2: 6, 10). This was during the same time that Pharaoh ordered all Hebrew males under the age of two to be killed.
       <strong>
        So, if Pharaoh, was a black-skinned descendant of Khawm / Ham, which he was, it would of course follow that Moses was black-skinned also.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Moses was raised in the house of Pharaoh, as the grandson of Pharaoh, when Pharaoh ordered all other Hebrew males to be killed at birth.
       <strong>
        If the Israelites were a white-skinned people, how could Moses the Hebrew survive (secretly) in the house of Pharaoh among black-skinned Egyptians for 40 years, and not be noticed. Scripture tells us that Moses killed an Egyptian, after he saw him mistreating a Hebrew.
       </strong>
       So Moses had to flee from Egypt for his life because Pharaoh found out and sought to kill him (Exodus 2:12-15).
      </p>
      <p>
       Explain.

       That's a nice little theory but how does it equate to the wisdom of the Bible? Now again, explain how Moses was black if Jesus of Judah was white.

       I think that the notion of race denoting your place in the world is a very recent construct. It seems evident to me that your allegiance was much more important for the majority of human history. it's pretty evident how this switch in thinking has caused a shit ton of problems.

       I understand where you are coming from which is the heart and not Bliblical context.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Matthew 15:19
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       God set things up for prophecy to be fulfilled.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Exodus 11:7King James Version (KJV)
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        7
        <strong>
         But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue
        </strong>
        , against man or beast: that ye may know how that the Lord doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Now, concerning prophecy. God chose the lost tribes of Israel (Jacob) as his nation and while they followed his commandments, he blessed them. When the lost tribes stopped following the commandments they would be cursed until the return of the messiah for the
       <strong>
        SECOND TIME
       </strong>
       not the first which was simply to solidify the messiahs return later on (our time). These curses would include going to going into slavery for 400 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Genesis 15:13
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Now it is clear that the lost tribes of Israel would go into a land they did not know by a people they did not know.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Deuteronomy 28
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        33 The fruit of thy land, and all thy labours, shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway:
       </p>
       <p>
        36 The Lord shall bring thee, and thy king which thou shalt set over thee, unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have known; and there shalt thou serve other gods, wood and stone.
       </p>
       <p>
        37 And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all nations whither the Lord shall lead thee. (The N word)
       </p>
       <p>
        49 The Lord shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand;
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       These are just a few but if you read Deuteronomy 28, it becomes clearer and clearer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if you don't know who Esau is, he was Jacobs twin brother who was born
       <strong>
        Red
       </strong>
       (Rothschild's) who actually had the blessing but due to his love for the flesh, he traded it to Jacob. Esau was a master hunter who was very cunning he also loved red meat. This nation would be the nation that would inherit the world (the wicked) when Jacob finally fell after taking council with the other nations.
       <strong>
        He also had a very interesting blessing, he was a man of the flesh who would live by the sword (WAR)
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Genesis 27:40King James Version (KJV)
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        40 And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Romans 9:13King James Version (KJV)
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        13 As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Moving on, we see something very clear in the Bible that points us towards Revelation.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        2 Esdras 6:9
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “For Esau is the end of the world, and
        <strong>
         Jacob is the beginning of it that followeth.”
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The above passage helps us understand more clearly how the world is set to work. Esau or Edom, will be in control at the end of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we might still be confused but we can go straight to the book of
       <strong>
        Obadiah
       </strong>
       concerning Edom and confirm the above even further.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        3 The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground? (mention of a prideful nationality)
       </p>
       <p>
        4 Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the Lord.
       </p>
       <p>
        7 All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, and prevailed against thee; they that eat thy bread have laid a wound under thee: there is none understanding in him.
       </p>
       <p>
        10 For thy violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever. (white shame or guilt)
       </p>
       <p>
        11 In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The above is referring to how Esau took council with the other nations in order to overthrow the Hebrews without actually doing it themselves. They allowed the other nations to do while they sat back and watched just like the Rothschild's do today in their war game tactics, you will never see them get their own hands dirty, they are much to cunning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now this is important to note because Rothschild set up the state of Israel with the Balfour Declaration. This is why in Revelation it says the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Revelation 3:9
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        9 Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       When we get closer to opening the seals we notice that there is a red horse mentioned
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Revelation 6:4
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        4 And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This red horse is someone from the nation of Edom. If I were to guess, Donald Trump wins the election due to a fault (Hillary being too sick) and causes the world to hate one another even more. This is why his rhetoric right off the bat was to demonize Muslims, Mexicans and Blacks which would take peace away from the entire world.
       <strong>
        We also see once again the sword is mentioned.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       So technically, to fully understand the Bible, you have to acknowledge the racial differences that God placed before us. Now this is not the traditional way the Bible is taught but this is because the church was taken over long ago, so it's natural that-that's how it will be ran until the new world begins.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I left any gaps that you need help filling please let me know.

       The passage he quoted is John (the author of the book of Revelations) description of Jesus, not the antichrist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although it may be fun or interesting trying to figure out who the antichrist is, it truly doesn't matter all that much! We will be raptured and won't be here to see him.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we do know is that when he comes he will promote world peace, one world government, one world religion, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       He will come giving a solution to the world's problems and everyone will love him. He will sign a 7 year peace treaty with Israel. After 3.5 years, he will turn on them and he will command everyone to either bow to him or be killed. This is also when the mark of the beast will be distributed.

       For the record, I'm pretty familiar with the book of Revelation (as well as other mentions throughout the Bible of Christ's second coming and the end times climate) and there's definitely nothing that indicates he will be persecuted. In fact it's explicitly stated that he won't show up under any condition unless a number of things first come to pass, many of which have not yet occurred. Until this time we are specifically told to be wary of many false Christs who will appear, and not to believe any of them. And when he finally does appear, he won't be persecuted at all, but will instead defeat his enemies, resurrect all the dead, and judge the entire world on the spot. Doesn't quite line up with Assange as far as I can tell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, the description of his snow white hair is only describing how he appeared when he revealed himself to John of Patmos, who wrote the book of Revelation. This doesn't necessarily have any bearing on what he will look like in other instances. Although if you want to know what Christ will look like when he comes, look no further than Matt 24:26-27
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <sup>
         26
        </sup>
        So if they tell you, ‘There He is in the wilderness,’ do not go out; or, ‘Here He is in the inner rooms,’ do not believe it.
        <sup>
         27
        </sup>
        For just as the lightning comes from the east and flashes as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.

       It's genius. I feel like we discovered another part of the underground game they play. I wish I could know if Julian sees them mocking him in that manner or just the charges on the surface.

       OR... TPTB created this religious construct many many years ago as one form of control. Now they are just going through the motions and making it play out as they originally wrote it out.

       It's amazing how you can peel back "reality" and then there is the actual reality. And that reality literally depicts a battle between good and evil ( perhaps a balance ) over earth. . .

       So many layers.... What if the written text was just a construct by TPTB..  a form of control of the masses. They recently have been losing this control which is why things have been heating up getting closer to and end. They always had the end of the book written on how it was to play out. Now them following this guide ( Bible ) they can use it as another form of control when they say "see, this is how the Apocalypse happened!."
      </p>

       Maybe this is why they have hidden the date lines and age of civilization from us.

       Maybe nuclear technologies have been around longer then they have let on.

       Maybe the symbolism with the architect and the matrix being reset is coming in to play.
