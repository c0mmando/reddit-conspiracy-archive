       Perhaps the most intriguing of Terence McKenna's fascinating theories and observations is his explanation for the origin of the human mind and human culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       To summarize:  McKenna theorizes, for instance, that synesthesia (the blurring of boundaries between the senses) caused by psilocybin led to the development of spoken language: the ability to form pictures in another person's mind through the use of vocal sounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       About 12,000 years ago, further climate changes removed the mushroom from the human diet, resulting in a new set of profound changes in our species as we reverted to pre-mushroomed and frankly brutal primate social structures that had been modified and/or repressed by frequent consumption of psilocybin.
      </p>
      <p>
       McKenna's theory has great appeal and intuitive strength, but it is necessarily based on a great deal of supposition interpolating between the few fragmentary facts we know about hominid and early human history. In addition, because McKenna (who describes himself as "an explorer, not a scientist") is also a proponent of much wilder suppositions, such as his "Timewave Zero" theory, his more reasonable theories are usually disregarded by the very scientists whose informed criticism is crucial for their development.
      </p>

       We wonder where human consciousness came from that separates us from other animals. I believe that psychedelic plants definately played a part in our evolution.

       That's just false. Not peer reviewed, by authors who are not qualified to do genetics research (Anatole is a biochemistry prof, Igor is non existent) published by a company that publishes for profit without checking whether the article has a legitimate scientific basis (look up SCIRP on Wikipedia, the publisher of this article). It's just a blatant attempt at nazi eugenics of old, to say that there is a fundamental difference between Aryans and Jews and this the race with DNA deemed superior by 'their' standards can do whatever they want with the other race, but substitute Europeans and Africans in.  Here's a discussion on why it's false:

       So no, stop masquerading racist eugenics as genetics and science.

       I know this isn't popular opinion, but can we test this on animals? Sharks, octopi, elephants, bonobos, silverbacks, lions, hippos, orcas...
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe involve a group of chimpanzees or birds and see how they react? Puzzles? I remember watching animal planet and fermented fruits and they would get drunk.

       Octopus or dolphins would be interesting. Heck even allowing more medical research and allowing depressed humans the opportunity to find new light.

       Excellent OP, I'm happy to see this again. I think it's very possible it allowed us to unlock parts of our brain

       Anyone who believes that the psychedelic experience belongs in the same realm as borderline occult subjects such as the Mandela effect doesn't know what the fuck they're talking about.
