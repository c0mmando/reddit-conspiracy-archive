       it seems like this is the direction the world is heading.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure if there will be any organized resistance to the banking cartels and secret societies, or if it is even plausible at this point in time.
      </p>
      <p>
       but id much rather the world end under those circumstances than the alternative. plus Id love to enlighten the world to whatever secrets there are and perform the opposite ethnic cleansing that they want (basically, wipe their genetic lines clean and allow regular people to be in charge forever), and prevent worldwide eugenics/ethnic cleansing of us. I don't generally support death sentences, but if there was ever enough solid evidence, this would be far more than justified
      </p>
      <p>
       but unless every bit of their control is ceded all over earth, it wont matter. if one nation alone rose against them the rest would rise to crush them like a bug.
      </p>
      <p>
       Id really love for this not to be the book of revelation coming to pass. but still, this is a ridiculous way for human history to end.

       I think a night of long knives will happen, so long as people keep asking this question. I am optimistic, because it would seem the pendulum is swinging the other way--that is, people are now aware of the panopticon of google as your household fema camp, they are aware of corruption because of an unpunished Hillary--which is going to cause people to ask why.  And then they will figure out that the constitution has been undermined for the rich by the cryptocracy, because of the continuity of governmnet plan that has been renewed each year by bush and obama since 9/11, thus enabling them extort the public to enrich the antinational security state for the benefit of oligarchs in the defense industry, and at the cost of our houses, jobs and sanity.....people have had enough of this horseshit and they are sharpening their pitchforks, let me tell you.
      </p>
      <p>
       There won't be physical uprising because people aren't stupid. Instead, they are going to figure out how to wage an asymmetric nonlinear warfare in ways that will boggle the minds of stupid ass veterans who are taught little more than cleaning their gun, being called a fag, doing pushups and how to kill people they don't know or understand....only to come home and harass people online because they have zero charisma and reallife translatable skills like cooking, accounting, designing bridges or making webpages (i mean, are they really going to pick up ladies with terrible desert PTSD and barking a few catchphrases in arabic while hopping on their one leg?  Give me a break--their lives and future are RUINED...this is ALL They can do now---bully people..it's all they know)
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, people have had enough and I'm optimistic that we're going to burn this whole fucker down and it will be their fault, not ours.  But this is a good thing. Because what we have now is broken well beyond repair.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, you see I say that, but their response to this attitude is this: no, just like occupy it will accomplish nothing and when a global crash happens, the wealthy will still make out.  That's what MR ROBOT is about.  It's acting as the voice of the elite, telling us that even if we burn it all down, all it will do is make little old ladies unable to get money for her medicine at the atm....
      </p>
      <p>
       So watch out for messaging like this, and don't believe it.  Have faith in people's goodness and if a crash happens, you can expect--judging by volunteer efforts around the nation--that if people see suffering they wont' put up with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       People == good
      </p>
      <p>
       government / elites == bad
      </p>
      <p>
       They want to psychopathologize you. Only problem is, we figured it out and it wont' work on us anymore.

       I'm not sure if it will be possible to maintain a peaceful action for very long, especially since we are so close to the end game now (its like legit last second. to be honest, we may not even have time and not get another election)
      </p>
      <p>
       the thing is, people need to act outwardly, openly, loudly, in force and en masse.
      </p>
      <p>
       after awhile, the elite will continue to refuse to sentence themselves to life imprisonment, exile, or death,
      </p>
      <p>
       they will refuse to give up their way of life in the same way as we refuse to give up ours.
      </p>
      <p>
       even if the only punishment was to set things right, maybe fines and loss of political rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       they still would refuse to cede everything their families worked for hundreds of generations to accomplish, or even the large amount of money or resources which allow them to continually manipulate our societies and cultures.
      </p>
      <p>
       in the end, I highly doubt this can evolve into anything but an end times scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
       even if humanity goes on past this point, only one group and one way of life can continue into the future. and if life itself is up, only one type of soul.
      </p>
      <p>
       there is not room for the evolution of consciousness to fit both perfectly evolved good and perfectly evolved evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       and we all inside hope that good prevails over these false man made systems of lies and manipulation. at least anyone who isn't brainwashed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm terrified of whats happening and even more so, the things that will be revealed to those who survive the birth pangs of the apocalypse.
      </p>
      <p>
       theres a good chance only jesus can defeat this evil in the end. I hold onto that belief as a security blanket to know that at least if good loses in the end, evil will be annihilated as well, and that there is something else, better than this shithole after for those of us who were awake.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really do hope and wish for a peaceful revolution and a better world/life. but there also is a part of me that wants to institutionalize legalized vivisection as a method of execution for the people behind the curtains... put them on a cross, vivisect, put them on life support and wait until the infection sets in ;)
      </p>
      <p>
       although that's a dark thing in itself, and I need to push that anger away. it solves nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       in the end, I'm not sure what will happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       honestly I think all us little people are going to die.

       because there is an excessively violent and powerful group who controls over 75-85% of the wealth and all government and economic systems,
      </p>
      <p>
       who will stop at nothing to accomplish their goal of world domination and extermination of those they deem undesirable and impossible to control.
      </p>
      <p>
       its kind of impossible to overcome hardships and come together when the most powerful force on earth is actively spending all its time and energy to divide and conquer and ultimately implement a system which can never be overturned.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm all for the future you presented, but we have to remove these people, or at least render them totally powerless, and seize all their wealth, land, assets and redistribute them in order to get there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not talking about communism. I'm saying, we have to split up the trusts, monopolies, and duopolies, and not only split them, but remove the people who control them and totally eviscerate them in favor of new systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       for this to happen, you need them to either willingly step down and donate everything but a modest amount out of the 'goodness of their heart' (which is impossible because they aren't good and they are already pissed at the charity work they have to do to BS people)
      </p>
      <p>
       or they have to be removed either through the power of government, or directly coup'ed along with their entire bloodlines to ensure nobody could inherit anything and continue it.
      </p>
      <p>
       and either way requires some level of revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       our mission is to basically remove and isolate the most powerful people in the world from government long enough to enact laws and raise an army big enough to fight whatever private armies they hire, or whatever nations they control, to remove those individuals from the world stage.
      </p>
      <p>
       the problem this brings is that there are multiple competing illuminati systems, and defeating one will only ensure anothers monopoly.
      </p>
      <p>
       revolution in just one country would cause all other nations under their control to bomb that nation with everything they had.
      </p>
      <p>
       or to destroy them through economic sanctions and a cut off of the money supply.
      </p>
      <p>
       basically, as I said, it would have to be some kind of world wide anti-illuminati revolution or coup, either in peace or in blood,
      </p>
      <p>
       or we have to be subject to the death and slavery, the depopulation and NWO they are working towards.
      </p>
      <p>
       unfortunately those kind of are the only two options.
      </p>
      <p>
       although your statement kind of is the plan for if there is ever an after all this shit.

       That depends on each of us and how willing we are to be enslaved, to give up what so few have had in the world, a semblance of freedom and prosperity.  I'd like to see the civil war with all soldiers and police dropping their weapons and joining against the unfair and unjust laws that were made to enhance the wealthy and enslave the poor.  We could have a world where everyone has plenty if those few didn't insist on having so much.  We could then cultivate the earth for food and forget destroying it for profit.

       they will join us, the problem is at that point they will have been replaced with foreign officers and foreign troops.
      </p>
      <p>
       the former US police officers who aren't willing to go with the program, and the veterans (former US army, UN being the only active army force) will all be on terrorist watch lists and probably among the first to go on false charges or in secrecy. or even taken out in mysterious accidents or 'terrorist' strikes.
      </p>
      <p>
       so the people will all be together in the end moments, unless we get nuked really soon (I'm scared they may escalate war with Russia since they cant maintain control of the USA, the best thing to do for them would be to kill us all now, and join with the Chinese to escape death themselves or hide in bunkers)
      </p>
      <p>
       most people are hopelessly brainwashed, and it will fade because its only hypnosis. but it will be really late when it does.
      </p>
      <p>
       if anything major happens, especially if a world war is declared, it may seem counter intuitive, but urgent revolution at the moment of declaration, regardless of state of martial law or disasters, would be the only hope to save us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure if we can stop this or not, if jesus is real at least he will destroy them all. if not, the future looks grim.
      </p>
      <p>
       at least if they do become more advanced and survive, hopefully aliens will kill them if god doesn't and the people cant.
      </p>
      <p>
       somehow, I'm committed to the belief that even if they win, they will still lose in the end. whatever higher power guides them will certainly sell them the fuck out the minute it gets what it wants.
      </p>
      <p>
       this is the only reason I believe in the problem of evil and a literal satan. there is no logic to such evil things. the New world order will make the elites life worse than an ideal utopia would too. the only way things like this happen are when some evil power convinces our elites it is god and they must do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       otherwise they would see that they are also more unhappy in the current system, even if they are rich and powerful, the luxury is still missing things and happiness and love. in an ideal world, eventually everyone could have just as much as they do now, and the idea of want itself would be a dream/nightmare of an era gone by.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm absolutely convinced they are actually possessed by satan and believe in the false pantheistic gods that existed in history.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm convinced demons are behind this.

       yes. its coming soon unfortunately I believe. a lot of the evidence is saying ww3 and mass internment are right around the bend, possibly a few months to a year or two away.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could be wrong, and I hope so. but the hour is getting late here man.
      </p>
      <p>
       when I said most people weren't waking up until the last second. I freaking meant the last 2 seconds before shtf lol. that's pretty close to where we are at.
      </p>
      <p>
       honestly the mass awakening began a littler earlier than id expected to and gave me some  hope, but its still pretty late, and a majority of people are still asleep or very confused and far behind on the advancement of the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       basically what happened was the USSRs real plan was for the globalists to establish the worldwide empire. this was the revolution they said theyd win without ever firing a bullet.
      </p>
      <p>
       the new caeser is close to being crowned. the antichrist might and probably is even alive and adult right now. the pope has even called him to the scene, asking for a new savior and saying that jesus failed when he died on the cross and didn't come back.
      </p>
      <p>
       that's kinda why I'm getting desperate here. I know whats up. I'm totally weak and have no arms or weapons, and no friends or people or allies, but ive waited my whole adult life for this moment, the great unmasking.
      </p>
      <p>
       I fear what happens next greatly, but there aint no getting offa dis train we on! (Barret from FF7)...
      </p>
      <p>
       whatever happens, my side is chosen. and it is widely known. I'll be among the first gone, but at least I wont live in the hell the world will become. Id rather die in the ashes of the old world, than accept the satanic new world which will end as quickly as it will become.

       the sleeper cells of retarded masses who don't even know they have been programmed will only not want to look at the truth. because the truth hurts when we have been bitchified, genetically modified, used, abused, and basically literally turned into lesser beings because of whats happened.

       I'm not sure, it seems an impossible task of a fool but if we could somehow unshackle our collective chains and then somehow survive the resulting conflicts and battles, Earth and thus ourselves could just maybe live on.

       That being said I do feel like the deck is stacked, the game is rigged and we are totally fucked yo. The focus on individuality has really screwed us, My problem is after truly realizing things aren't nearly what they seem and waking up, I go through my daily life, telling myself "Non of this shit matters." and it kills me.

       me too. I feel almost totally ready to throw my life away at the mere hope of even a better future, or a better tomorrow, and the idea of possible lasting peace and stability and an era where things aren't utopian, but not engineered to farm humans and then sacrifice them all
      </p>

       but that stuff sounds plausible in the beginning. if your ex is that kind of person, I'm not sure what to make of you.
      </p>
      <p>
       and I know for sure if it was me, I would've used that connection to spy on people and release secret leaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       at this point, if an opportunity like that came to me, Id be willing to risk my life for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not really interested in causing a ruckus or violence, as that only serves the elite, but I have a great dream of being able to break into secret society meetings, steal their most prized secrets and truths, and release them to the entire world unregulated and uncontrolled.
      </p>
      <p>
       I always wished I could undo the burning of the great libraries. free mankind from slavery and ignorance, and destroy the physical barrier that separates the classes.
      </p>
      <p>
       although, Ive come to believe this is Jesus' job, and my wishing to be that person probably is the spirit of anti-Christ in me as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       so I have to try to be humble and remember how weak, and powerless I am. how I can snap like a toothpick with only a strong breeze lmao.
      </p>
      <p>
       but id love to be a volunteer spy, underequipped macguyver style. poetic justice, a genetically impure damaged kid from the streets overthrowing the illuminati purebloods, reverse eugenics. lmao.
      </p>
      <p>
       It scares me how ready id be to accept the alternate occult future. perhaps that itself is evil? I don't think spiritualism, magick, or technology is in itself evil, its how its used and how knowledge and power are disseminated among individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
       although is it bad that I myself feel anger and a desire for revenge that ultimately mirrors their attitude? even if my results were purely the opposite. I feel like its still evil. even if the outcome is possibly less so.

       if they could've directly destroyed us we would already be dead. and the evidence we have seems to imply they are interdimensional, not interstellar crafts (sharp turns, immediate materialization, faster travel, more reasonable, because in a spacecraft hundreds of years would pass on the earth and your home planet by the time you crossed galaxies)
      </p>
      <p>
       basically they are definitely working with the government, coopting them so they can eventually directly come in.
      </p>
      <p>
       the aliens are real, but they are the same thing as demons, even if they are from another planet. it doesn't matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       so if that happens its part of the end, not a false flag. the only false part is that the leaders will lie that they didn't work with them, or about who they are if they admit that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe certainly in the watchers and the gnostic archons. they are the true form behind the aliens/demons of history. and they possess our leaders minds and bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
       the Vatican is also a prime target. they have a lot of knowledge and are one of the first main satanic cults of the modern world. jesus warned of the jewish temple and rome as evil, satanic entities. that's why he was killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rome scattered Judea in a war to hide the truth, which was that Catholicism was a twisting of the gnostic teachings of Christ -- not all of the gnostics are right btw, just the archons part really --
      </p>
      <p>
       Rome was infiltrated by the same satanic, Babylonian mystery religion (earliest intelligence society, basically the original CIA)
      </p>
      <p>
       which became the catholic church. they preached the bare bones, mostly lie story of jesus, just to get their own evil power and control through the ages. they created the banking systems, and our ruling class.
      </p>
      <p>
       they are evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       they are the new rome. we need to storm the Vatican and take the pope down and open the libraries and truth to everyon.
      </p>
      <p>
       but realize, the pope is evil and satanic. their truth is not necessarily THE truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       they hid the truth of what jesus did and said, in the same way our govenrmnet killed the terrorists as they co opted them into their own system,
      </p>
      <p>
       rome did this with Christians before the catholic church.
      </p>
      <p>
       then the accepted, watered down, pagan accepting Christians they created were their slave class.
      </p>
      <p>
       look at history.
      </p>
      <p>
       don't let it deceive you that Christ isn't real.
      </p>
      <p>
       he is.
      </p>
      <p>
       in the beginning, there was another megacivilization, before Egypt. probably more advanced than us, because 'aliens' or angels were allowed to be here then.
      </p>
      <p>
       that civilization fell because something very evil happened. the whole world changed and none of us remember anymore. there was something worse than nuclear catastrophe. the biblical disaster.
      </p>
      <p>
       Except most of the history we have in the bible is still lacking about that. probably hidden from us and even maybe destroyed and only remembered among the elite through oral history.
      </p>
      <p>
       the elite actually survived the disaster, and have the genes of these evil ones in them. the ones at te top at least.
they crawled from the wreckage along with the remnants of our ancestors, the nobodies. and they established civilizations with their recollection of lost sciences, math and history. they were the only ones with knowledge of ancient sciences and astrology.
      </p>
      <p>
       through secret socieites, since ancient Babylon they have made themselves sociopaths and let in dark entities to their minds for power.
      </p>
      <p>
       they have communed with these beings at the top of the secret societies. so they are actually possessed. they believe it is god communicating with them, or aliens that can save them.
      </p>
      <p>
       that this is how it has to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       and they cannot reject it or stop now. they are consumed totally by it.
      </p>
      <p>
       their families have been for thousands of generations. they have served these beings and fought to acheieve their plan since the beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
       the biblical disaster failed to destroy them and only set things back so humanity had time.
      </p>
      <p>
       and the elite secret socities killed jesus too -- because their unholy satanic messiah will imprison our souls and rule over us in place of god instead of god.
      </p>
      <p>
       jesus was the true messiah and our messiah. theirs is satans spawn, and fights for the lust, hate, greed, and power they so desire.

       Thanks a lot for the reply, very interesting to discuss these things. I have come to similar conclusions myself despite not originally following to closely to Religion(s). I believe that what you have just discussed is the theory about a past advanced civilization(s) that was destroyed, I too believe the "Elites" at that time fled the majority of the destruction only to come back to the generations of "common" survivors as seemingly "saviors.". I believe this allowed them to swoop in and set the table to their liking after the reset.
      </p>
      <p>
       If demons and aliens are one in the same it would explain the seemingly real theories about Ancient Aliens and our past, at least I think it might. I don't know. I find it crazy how all these things relate to each other yet are separate, do you have opinions on the deity/god M? (Lets say half man/half bull, possibly an owl)
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think M and Satan are one in the same or is it a relationship similar to God and Jesus? Were Jesus and Satan brothers?
      </p>
      <p>
       My head hurts.

       as far as that goes I'm uncertain. I don't know the nature of the enemy in detail since there isn't much written information about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Id imagine there are a hierarchy of entities. probably bunches of minor ones, and major ones reoccurring.
      </p>
      <p>
       if this is true they can shape shift and have incredibly advanced powers and technology in physical form most likely -- or they appear to people in psychic states in which our perception is manipulated.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had dream/abduction/ OBEs and interdimensional travel dreams or past life experiences (with unknown ancient languages) but to me I heard English, and I saw things that didn't make sense. i.e. id be in my room, and id see a big mutant figure, but it was really a person and I was in a drug like, hallucinating state in which I was still partially in rem, but fully awake, and paralyzed not by sleep paralyse, but by a numbing agent similar to Novocaine but stronger.
      </p>
      <p>
       both the mind makes sense of things that cant be accepted by the subconscious, and also sometimes they must be using drugs on people and abducting them as they sleep. possibly altering even individuals memories of traumatic childhood events they caused.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ive experienced many weird things, like green wisp lights the acted sentient and converged over my mother while she was ill.we all woke up in horror, turning the lights on but there was northing there!!! yet the flashes kept going like fireflies, but brighter.
      </p>
      <p>
       so many experiences. id be happy to talk about the crazy shit ive seen and felt and believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there are many entities. not all evil, some neutral, some good. but  the bad ones are the most evident because they hurt us.
      </p>
      <p>
       they take  many forms and I don't know the details or what the secret mystery schools knew. but I know that moloch is probably a minor, yet major entity. think this way -- if you have a name, your like a king. and satan is the grand magistrate of evil forces.
      </p>
      <p>
       the most powerful basic demon was legion, whatever it means, he is many,
      </p>
      <p>
       but outside of that, if you don't have a name, and your own pagan worship, your probably not very well feared/revered.
      </p>
      <p>
       I cant say what well is true and not, because its not like you can openly join any truly satanic fraternity. you kind of are born into it as blood brothers of the final solution.
