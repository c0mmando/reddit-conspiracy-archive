I&#39;ve confirmed that Secret Service protocol dictates that the president be rushed to a secure location immediately, even if it&#39;s against his will when <em>any</em> threat whatsoever exists.

<p>Mr. Bush&#39;s location that morning had been made public days prior to 9/11. As far as they knew, there could have been a plane heading directly for that school in Florida. </p>

<p>The fact that he wasn&#39;t whisked away immediately tells me that they <em>somehow</em> knew they were secure at that school.</p>

<p>The fact that the media hasn&#39;t questioned this before is that the implications are very disturbing. But it is what it is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly right. The moment that second plane hit, they should have burst through those doors and grabbed him and at least gotten him away from the school, where he was publicized to have been.

    <div class="md"><p>The ignorance is astounding. People just don&#39;t care. Wanna commit suicide in a commercial jet? Fly it 500mph at 1,000 feet. You don&#39;t even have to hit a building! The air at 1,000 feet rips the wings off for you!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should avoid this argument. 500mph at 1,000 feet is slower than 500mph at cruising altitude. The slowest rated of the airframes allegedly involved is the Boeing 767. According to Boeing docs filed with NTSB, the plane is certified to about 435kts at 1G aerodynamic limits, and that is with a safety net. 435kts is a little over 500 statutory miles per hour. The 757 is a much higher speed airframe, originally developed by Boeing under a military funded secret program for a supersonic transport craft. Funding was pulled when the project was near completion and Boeing leveraged it in to a successful commercial airliner. Look at it compared to some other commercial airliners from an aerial view and look straight down the nose. The wing shape and nose and fuselage profile are very different from more conventional planes. They also use a special Rolls Royce engine developed as part of the SST program and that&#39;s why they have a completely different engine noise than other contemporary passenger jets (watch a flyby on YouTube, they have a buzz to them that reminds me a little of a pulsejet instead of that high pitched metallic whine other jets have). </p>

<p>VMO ratings are legal limits, not airframe or operating limits. For example, the 757 has a published VMO of 250kts below 10,000 feet. This is due to cost saving measures in design, manufacture, and testing of the windshield. It is only tested and certified to withstand a bird strike at 250kts (because most of the world has civilian speed limits below 10k of 250kts so why spend extra on testing it at 300 when the market doesn&#39;t allow it to be used that way). VMOs are legal safe commercial operating limits based on worst-case scenario testing of the absolute weakest link on the entire aircraft, so they have nothing to do with whether or not the wings would rip off. Now if a 767 speed was actually measured with a legit device as being significantly over 500mph, that might be questionable, but if it was &quot;about 500mph&quot; then no, nothing to investigate there. It&#39;s rated to be safe in terms of airframe up to about 500mph and that&#39;s at 1G and fully loaded. Below 1G and not full of passengers and cargo, physics would raise those limits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are also a pair of Pratt and Whitney models certified for 757 &amp; they are of similar capability, and also different from conventional jet engines used in other aircraft. They are used in 757, F-117 stealth, and C-17 Globemaster III. It&#39;s irrelevant to my point though; that part was just a little history of the 757 program to illustrate that it&#39;s an extremely high speed capable plane. In commercial use, their speed is software limited to subsonic, and the airframes lack reinforcement required to break sound barrier. The shape is the same though and they wouldn&#39;t fall apart @ 500 statutory mph.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Commericial Pilot License Holder here. Link to these thousands of pilots swearing the aircraft would be destroyed?</p>

<p>Just because aircraft have a maximum operating speed doesnt mean that if you exceed it the aircraft will implode. Aviation is about multiple layers of safety. That means they are built tough. Real tough. And limits applied to how the pilot operates it are <strong>well</strong> below what the aircraft can actually handle. How far? We dont really know. But there are videos on youtube showing the huge extent that wings can be bent before they break during factory testing.</p>

<p>You will likely have vibrations and noises, but the aircraft will not start to take damage until you are exceeding VNE by a significant amount.</p>

<p>Could these amatuers have done the navigation and maneuvers they did at these high speeds? To me that is the ridiculous part of the story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s actually a group called Pilots for 9/11 Truth. Massive group of mostly commercial, but very sharp ex-military and private pilots too. Also includes aeronautical engineers, some of whom worked for Boeing and Airbus. </p>

<p>If you search for their group on YouTube, you will find numerous presentations in which they present data regarding the planes&#39; performance thresholds, even citing layers of protective redundancy built in, and compare that with the official narrative. </p>

<p>The group also has a website where all of their presentations are free to view. I am not a licensed pilot so I&#39;d be honored if you&#39;d take a look at some of their content and let me know what you think. I lost someone in the North Tower that day and I&#39;ve always been unsettled about this. </p>

<p>Up until now, I&#39;ve theorized that a swap occurred mid-air Operation Northwoods style, and that the aircraft that hit the towers were heavily modified with FTS modules and strengthened components which would eliminate flutter, etc. at high speed in thick air. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just saw this comment and went to watch videos from this group. At 2 minutes and 10 seconds in to the first video I hear an objectively false claim that &quot;510 knots at that altitude is above mach 1&quot; No, 510 knots is about 587mph and mach 1 is 768mph so you&#39;re still 181mph below the speed of sound. They&#39;re trying to make a comparison that at 22,000 feet 510kts would equal a ground speed above mach 1, which is completely bunk in application because a) air speed, not ground speed, would be the speed that has an effect on the airframe, and b) because it wasn&#39;t at 22,000 feet. ANY and ALL reputable pilot(s) would know this, so 2 minutes in to the first video they have destroyed their own credibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it to be highly questionable based on several grounds. First, that their expert is the same guy making the knowingly false statements in the first video I watched. Second, that they make a lot of false statements about radar that again, any legit pilot would know to be false in regards to speed data. They say if these radars weren&#39;t accurately reporting speed, planes would hit each other, but this is false. What they&#39;re discussing here is what they call primary radar, but that is a backup system well known to be frequently inaccurate by a wide margin, particularly in terms of speed and altitude. The actual data primarily used for traffic control is data sent from the plane&#39;s instruments via transponder or ADSB. These were intentionally deactivated on the 9/11 hijack plane because even a simulator hobbyist knows this. The ONLY indication of the alleged 510kt airspeed is the primary radar, which is well established in the aviation community to be inaccurate. It&#39;s a backup/redundancy check system for just in case the aircraft systems fail. In failure cases, other aircraft would be cleared from the airspace because it is known to be unreliable data (and to give clear space for maneuvers if needed by the emergency craft). </p>

<p>Another thing I can offer a partial debunking, I think, is their GPS data about coming from the wrong gate yada yada, and they align it with another gate based on a path that starts the takeoff roll at the extreme end of the overrun threshold, from which a normal takeoff roll would not begin. Under normal circumstances, the takeoff roll would begin farther up the asphalt, and if you move their GPS graphic to align with that, it does roughly align with the documented gate and the funny diagonal line in the taxi path aligns roughly with the diagonal taxiway.</p>

<p>Another thing is the FDR data showing values for cockpit door closed and showing GPS operational when there was no GPS. The data fields for all possible sensors/data are present in every file, whether or not the plane is equipped to monitor said field (think of it as a database table - every plane has the same database table and if a sensor or value exists, it is put in the table. If not, a default value of null, 1, or 0 will appear in the memory segment. In the case of cockpit door open or GPS operational or not, those are both bit fields that would have a default value of true or false, so the fact that these two fields each has a single non-changing value is 100% consistent with a vehicle either unequipped with or not monitoring said systems.</p>

<p>Now, based on those things, it appears to me very strongly that they are knowingly presenting false information, which leads me again to call in to question their entire credibility and motives. I strongly believe they are disinformation, either for profit or government. </p>

<p>On top of all that, I was married to someone born and raised in Alexandria, VA, from which you have a very close up view of approach to Reagan National and the pentagon area. Having spent a lot of time there, I have spoken first hand to multiple people who claim to have seen the 757 alleged to have hit the pentagon. They all said it stood out not because of odd flight path but due to the fact it was going so fast and so loud compared to normal air traffic. None of them saw it fall apart and nobody saw any unusual planes or missiles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I can&#39;t explain every detail, but in my opinion, the events claimed to have happened involving aircraft actually happened. I believe they were &#39;allowed&#39; to happen at the very least, but again just my opinion, I think it&#39;s much more likely this was another case of terrorists either created by or at least pushed in particular directions by an alphabet agency, then allowed to carry out a plan at least some in government were aware was at least a threat. 9/11 is a significant date in Islamic faith having to do with defeat and exile of Muslims from formerly occupied territories in the middle east, so it would be a popular date for terrorism (attacks on Benghazi also happened on Sept 11th). I honestly can&#39;t explain every detail but considering the money trail and all the coincidences, but also the Islamic extremist details, I think it was a combination power elite / government / terrorist event all wrapped in to one, that the terrorists were real, but guided by elites somehow and unaware of the whole plot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tend to agree with bitcoin_noob here. I&#39;m suspect of the &quot;thousands of pilots&quot; claim. The 435kts figure for the 767 I quoted is a &quot;safe&quot; commercial operating limit. Beyond 435 they list as &quot;airframe damage&quot; but we have to also account for the fact that damage does not equal discorporation. You&#39;ll start to get oscillation in overspeed, and that will cause metal fatigue. With commercial jets running tens of thousands of cycles, this would be a primary concern as the lowest speed airframe damage. Lots of planes have crashed from failure caused by metal fatigue, and metal fatigue happens way way before pieces breaking off, so remember, even when they say airframe damage, they&#39;re not talking about pieces ripping off. </p>

<p>So far, I&#39;ve not seen any detailed truther claim about the aircraft on 9/11 that I couldn&#39;t immediately debunk. I believe the official line is a lie, but it&#39;s because I followed the money. I think most of the claims about the planes are frankly ridiculous and for the most part easily disproven.</p>

<p>In terms of airframe and speeds, high speed crashes, etc, definitely look in to Pacific Southwest Airlines flight 1771 crash in 1987. That plane was hijacked and intentionally crashed at high speed. It was a BAe 146-200 which is a totally different plane, but one that is of an older generation than 757/767 and has a much slower airframe design. It was found to have hit the ground still in tact at supersonic speed, and the crash site looked an awful, AWFUL lot like the crash site in Pennsylvania. The majority of items that survived were papers and other objects without enough mass for inertia to disintegrate then. Few pieces recognizable as aircraft parts were ever found, and responders made some nearly identical quotes to the ones emphasized by loose change et al as &#39;proof no plane crashed in Pennsylvania&#39; - things like &quot;there was nothing at the crash site to suggest a plane crashed here&quot; and one of the first responders on scene radioed it in as a small private plane crash  and said in interviews that he thought it was a Cessna because he didn&#39;t see recognizable aircraft parts, but a BAe 146 is a quad jet engine plane that holds about 50-60 people something like that depending on configuration. I know there were about 45 aboard that one when it crashed, and it was also said by some of the first responders that there were no recognizable body parts found, but some small parts were eventually found, though could not be identified other than a piece of the hijacker&#39;s finger still attached to a piece of the gun he used.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The second half of my theory is that in order for the plan to work there had to have been a period of inaction by the Government.</p>

<p>For example, little Donnie the Secretary of Defense was outside of the Pentagon helping the wounded. A noble task but one would think that someone in his position would have been more useful in coordinating the response to the attack.</p>

<p>I guess George hadn&#39;t thought his plan through too well. I&#39;d put money on the fact that he had issued orders to his staff that this PR stunt was not to be interrupted no matter what.</p>

<p>Andy disregarded that order. You can see George&#39;s face get all screwed up with a conflicted response when this huge plan had already started to leave the rails. His worst nightmare was already trying to come true.</p>

<p>And so he just sat there. Stubbornly sticking to the plan. Eventually they&#39;d spin the response but I know what I saw. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We now know the White House was warned about Bin Laden planning to attack the US nearly a month or so before 9/11.</p>

<p>Our intelligence agencies knew this was a possibility and might happen, and also knew there were no planes in range of W. This wasn&#39;t exactly a surprise attack to anyone with security clearance, so they didn&#39;t react to it like it was one. </p>

<p>It would have taken 1-3 hours for any of the hijacked planes to make it to W&#39;s location. </p>

<p>Then of course there&#39;s the false flag theory that the Bush admin was in on the attack anyway. To this day I&#39;m still torn between it being incompetence or an inside job. Either way, we know explosives were likely used to bring down the towers and building 7, so whatever happened was a lot more coordinated then what it appeared to be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me, there is no question as to whether this was a false flag event. We created Bin Laden in the 80s. He was an intelligence asset. That is a matter of record. Your claim that it would have taken planes hours to reach Florida assumes that they knew exactly which planes were hijacked and where. That simply isn&#39;t true. Look at the real raw radar that morning. There are planes everywhere all across the country. The war games taking place that morning caused officials to believe at one point that 20 or more aircraft had been hijacked. Also a matter of record. </p>

<p>As far as they knew at the time, a plane could have been hijacked in the sky above Fl. and headed straight for their location. </p>

<p>My heavily researched opinion, given the facts, is that Bin Laden/Arab dupes were only involved at the scapegoat level. That allowed for our &quot;response&quot;--illegal wars of aggression without end in the name of combatting terrorism. The 9/11 operation was conceived of, planned, and executed by a small number of operatives within our government and likely included help from members of foreign governments. Israel sticks out in particular here. Foreign banking interests were also likely influential. Incompetence by our own government that was painfully obvious that day was deliberate in order to buy time for the operatives to carry out their mission before mobilizing in a defense capacity (see Donald Rumsfeld on the Pentagon lawn,etc)</p>

<p>9/11 is one hell of a rabbit hole, but it was the perfect crime, as atrocious as it was. It killed about 200 birds with one stone. If you dig deep though, you begin to see why they did it--what needed to be destroyed and why, who benefitted, etc. </p>

<p>Incompetence was integral to the &quot;inside job&#39;s&quot; success. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>At approximately 8:48 a.m. on the morning of September 11, 2001, the first pictures of the burning World Trade Center were broadcast on live television. The news anchors, reporters, and viewers had little idea what had happened in lower Manhattan, but there were some people who did know. By that time, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), the National Military Command Center, the Pentagon, the White House, the Secret Service, and Canada’s Strategic Command all knew that three commercial airplanes had been hijacked. They knew that one plane had been flown deliberately into the World Trade Center’s North Tower; a second plane was wildly off course and also heading toward Manhattan; and a third plane had abruptly turned around over Ohio and was flying back toward Washington, DC.</p>

<p>So why, at 9:03 a.m.—fifteen minutes after it was clear the United States was under terrorist attack—did President Bush sit down with a classroom of second-graders and begin a 20-minute pre-planned photo op? No one knows the answer to that question. In fact, no one has even asked Bush about it.</p>

<p>Bush’s actions on September 11 have been the subject of lively debate, mostly on the internet. Details reported that day and in the week after the attacks—both the media reports and accounts given by Bush himself—have changed radically over the past 18 months. Culling hundreds of reports from newspapers, magazines, and the internet has only made finding the “truth” of what happened and when it happened more confusing. In the changed political climate after 9/11, few have dared raise challenging questions about Bush’s actions. A journalist who said Bush was “flying around the country like a scared child, seeking refuge in his mother’s bed after having a nightmare” and another who said Bush “skedaddled” were fired. [Washington Post, 9/29/01 (B)] We should have a concise record of where President Bush was throughout the day the US was attacked, but we do not.</p>

<p>What follows is an attempt to give the most complete account of Bush’s actions—from Florida to Louisiana to Nebraska to Washington, DC.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow what a great point we were under attack by enemy unknown and the head of state was attempting to read. Fuck that&#39;s so crazy when you actually <em>think</em> about it, on the surface yeah sure he hears news of the attack, doesn&#39;t want to scare the children.
If you were to <em>think</em> about it however? Holy crap that&#39;s almost undeniably odd I don&#39;t think it&#39;d even happen in a movie: </p>

<p>&quot;I must stay here so as to not frighten the children, children who&#39;s lives I&#39;m putting in grave danger by staying.</p>

<p>Wow, really?  I don&#39;t know how he pulls that off when his brother (Jeb) was instrumental in PNAC and another brother happened to head security at WTC, a cousin had some other capacity that is very fishy.  I forget what at this moment, but I had no idea Tarpley felt that way.  Maybe it was early days after?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I interviewed WT personally in 2012. He honestly believes there was a &quot;coup faction&quot; led by Cheney and the PNAC cabal. He even cited sources he wouldn&#39;t reveal which led him to believe that Bush wouldn&#39;t tell the military anything in the early hours of the attack, fearing that this was a military coup. He cites the &quot;Angel is Next&quot; message as evidence of that. Either way, and despite my pointing out everything you just pointed out, Mr. Tarpley was adamant that he believes Bush was kept out of this. Sounds crazy, I know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, thank you for looking into this. That&#39;s ridiculous. What are your thoughts on how the alleged pentagon plane would have held up during its 270° descending corkscrew? I&#39;ve had pilots personally tell me that to hand-fly that would be ace-like. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen the theory presented that the pentagon plane overflew the pentagon and then executed a 270 degree turn to smash back in to one side, but can find no substantiating evidence of that. The NTSB report and publicly available tracking data shows that the pilot most likely set a route to Reagan National approach on the flight management system, then used the Washington Monument as a visual reference when in sight. The actual recorded path has him starting several miles out and making a very wide descending 330 degree turn several miles wide over Alexandria, then lining up with the pentagon and Washington monument still several miles out and making a straight in approach. Another thing I see constantly in the attempts to conspiratize (is that a word? lol) the airplane aspects is people talking about amateur pilots and quoting derogatory claims from early/beginner flight training about how incompetent these guys were. Fact is, four of the 19 alleged hijackers were FAA licensed commercial multi engine rated pilots, which requires also an instrument rating. Taking that in to consideration, it&#39;s not only possible but extremely probable any of the four would have had the skills to make a relatively standard turning descent and line up an approach at the end of it. The only difference between a tactical corkscrew descent (which is often required at US commercial airports, particularly Reagan Nat&#39;l) and what is claimed to have happened at the pentagon is that he was going faster and with a faster descent rate, but within the limits of the plane it would essentially take no additional or significantly different level of skill. The official story here is that a licensed commercial pilot essentially executed an unorthodox approach procedure that is sometimes required of commercial pilots and he thus should have had those skills to obtain the certificate. He also came in too low at the very end and hit the ground before the pentagon according to the official story so he didn&#39;t do it all flawlessly. Taking that all in to account, it really doesn&#39;t seem so unusual to me.</p>

<p>As for the plane itself, I&#39;m having trouble finding the actual FDR data for the descent part, but a 757 is an uber high performance aircraft with capabilities that can outperform Korean war era fighter jets. The supercritical wing airfoil of the 757 was designed to have supersonic airflow under normal flying conditions and the funny wing shape is to control the shockwaves and boundary layer effects, so nothing about  a 757 going faster than normal raises any red flags with me unless you get in the 650-700mph range and high G load, but the reason the tactical corkscrew descent is a thing is because it minimizes the G forces in a high speed vertical descent. This is again based on physics that should be known to a commercially licensed pilot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, they are conspiracy theorists too. They just believe the official conspiracy theory that 19 guys used box cutters and managed to take out three American sites. </p>

<p>Theirs is just more ridiculous, but they do really hate it when you point out that they believe in an unproven theory of multiple bad actors who engaged in a plan to do bad things: a conspiracy theory.</p>
