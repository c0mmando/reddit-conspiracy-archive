<p>I would like all candidates including independent to explain their scandals. Many want Sanders to explain how did he manage to purchase a 600,000 dollar summer vacation home 3 weeks after Clinton was nominated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The dude is old and has been a government employee for a long time. He didn&#39;t pay cash for the home. He has an income and will have a pension after retiring.</p>

<p>In a country where low income families can buy a 300k home on an annual income of less than 100k/yr I don&#39;t see how this is a conspiracy. It&#39;s just how the banks have been functioning since the Clinton administration. Banks will bend over backward in order to finance massive debt you most likely won&#39;t repay over your lifetime. Then they will reclaim the property and sell it to the next chump.</p>

<p>In regards to Trump, I&#39;d rather see information focusing on his ties to the elite and those who currently make policy decisions. He already has ties to neocons, CFR, Bear Sterns, BOA, and Blackwater.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s all dig in to that and make sure it&#39;s on the sticky.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t a home, it&#39;s a &quot;seasonal retreat&quot;. A seasonal retreat at 600k would be about 20-30k a year for tax, insurance and minimal maintenance. If he did take a mortgage, he&#39;s looking at another 40k a years in mortgage payments. </p>

<p>That&#39;s 30 + % of his pre-tax salary for a &quot;seasonal retreat&quot;.</p>

<p>Assuming he is paying much less in tax and insurance than I do, he still clearly cannot afford the payments on his salary. He was also in debt, so where is his downpayment money?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know where you are getting your numbers. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see mention of two homes that he outright owns. </p>

<p>Even if he does own two homes outright, I don&#39;t think you understand discretionary income. He has shown that his discretionary income is continually  exceeded by his annual living costs.</p>

<p>That is, based on his income and expenses, he is in debt.</p>

<p>As I pointed out in this thread, he would need the equivalent of a $2m lottery payout to afford a 600k luxury seasonal retreat.</p>

<p>Under the on-going circumstances of his finances, him purchasing a luxury retreat while unable to afford his previous lifestyle is financial suicide. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like a McDonalds employee who is taking out payday loans buying a brand new Porsche as a secondary car.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So they use the upper figures to give him a net worth of 800k, whereas it is between 187-759k.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, I don&#39;t think you understand discretionary income.</p>

<p>For example, my wife and I earn a combined $150k. From this money, we can pay for one home in her native country, one home here and a piece of land. Paying for our homes adds very little to our net worth, most of it is an expense. Paying for the maintenance/tax on our land adds nothing to our net worth. </p>

<p>Each year our net worth increases by let&#39;s say 30k (it changes) and over 20 years is 600k. </p>

<p>But we use up all of our income. Unlike Bernie, we don&#39;t incur credit card debt. </p>

<p>Can we afford a $200k cottage? No. We would need a downpayment. Since we would be taking out a mortgage, the bank would insist we have it insured. We would need to pay property taxes. </p>

<p>We can&#39;t make those payments. Hence, we can&#39;t afford it. Because we can&#39;t expect to make those payments, and because the economy is not doing well, we can&#39;t expect to be able to sell it. Not many are in the market for an expensive holiday home in a rural area. </p>

<p>We would either need to take on debt (which we can&#39;t afford), expect to lose it when we can&#39;t make our payments (forfeiting the downpayment and our credit rating), or drastically change our lifestyle. Or win the lottery; in which case we still wouldn&#39;t put all of our winnings in something that would leave us still in general debt.</p>

<p>In a country where low income families can buy a 300k home on an annual income of less than 100k/yr I don&#39;t see how this is a conspiracy.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t a home, it&#39;s a &quot;seasonal retreat&quot;. A seasonal retreat at 600k would be about 20-30k a year for tax, insurance and minimal maintenance. If he did take a mortgage, he&#39;s looking at another 40k a years in mortgage payments. </p>

<p>That&#39;s 30 + % of his pre-tax salary for a &quot;seasonal retreat&quot;.</p>
