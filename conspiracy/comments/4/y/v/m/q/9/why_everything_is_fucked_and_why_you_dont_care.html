        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The world is clearly being driven toward war. Whether the impulse is primarily from the warmongers engineering our culture toward acceptance of war, or whether from the culture itself actually internalizing these values and begging for war itself, or a mixture of the two, the war they are trying to engineer is coming to a head. We all feel it on the horizon. Now there is little question of &quot;Can this be stopped?&quot; and more of &quot;How much can we mitigate the damage?&quot; </p>

<p>Our culture is being systematically destroyed. Cultural values of compassion, empathy, and good will have been wrecked by the media. The repetition through the media to destroy these values gets absorbed in to the culture at large. </p>

<p>And I&#39;m not just talking American culture, although it&#39;s a prominent example. People all throughout Europe are experiencing a similar situation. People in Russia. People in the Middle East. Systematic destruction of cultural values outside greed, outside authoritarianism. Anything that challenges the dominant military-industrial complex and banking systems are minimized or ridiculed. Anything that would bring us together is being broken up. Religion used to be a source of unity within a culture, now it is a source of divisiveness. Systems to balance out wrongs of the past become sources of new grievances. Victim status is exploited as a gain, creating a culture of victimhood. Things you took very seriously, you now find to be a joke. After all, if the leadership and authority doesn&#39;t take it seriously, why should you? The signals travel from the top down.</p>

<p>The less you care, the less I care. Why should I be the one left caring the most? </p>

<p>Everybody sees themselves an island. An ideological, emotional, physical island. This is the end result of divide and conquer. Everything is divided so finely you don&#39;t even agree with yourself. We are confused. We are frustrated. We are angry. We don&#39;t understand. </p>

<p>The economy is not doing well. If everyone had a cushy job, we probably wouldn&#39;t need to post on here. We probably wouldn&#39;t spend so much time searching for answers. The lack of opportunities to make money causes frustration, especially in light of the expectations that were over-sold to our generations. We were horribly misled, to a future that could only fall short. </p>

<p>Some of this is intentional, by the powers that be. Some of this is us just shooting ourselves in the foot without realizing it through human foolishness. The 70s-90s were so good and easy, that people forgot the hard-won lessons of the past. The lessons the greatest generation learned from WW1 and WW2. The lessons of the true lasting benefits of empathy and compassion, as compared to the fleeting sensual pleasures of greed and consumerism. These are wise lessons, and our childish culture could not care less for them. </p>

<p>So day after day, rational thinking people are beaten over the mental brow by this abusive media that masquerades as our culture. How far can it drag us from where we were before? How much has the mild insanity caused by our economic hardship pushed us right in to their waiting arms? In to the ideologies they designed as traps to convince us to accept our growing abuse. Do you think there were slaves that had ideologies that made being a slave not seem so bad? Do you think billions of people could hold a similar ideology? </p>

<p>These thoughts are not new. Countless people have them in moments of destitution. We are being broken, so that we give up. They are not breaking us with whips and chains, but with abusive culture and false consensus. They are making us look like we are saying things we are not. We are all being gaslighted by an entire culture. </p>

<p>And you know what? No one really cares. Can&#39;t blame em either. The shit is overwhelming. Overwhelming by design, in fact. That makes for solid confusion, which is just the thing to immobilize everyone. </p>

<p>I would say something here like &quot;The moment you stop caring is the moment they win.&quot; but in reality we are so far beyond that it&#39;s not even funny. We are 10000 years entrenched into a long cycle of abuse, passed down from generation to generation. You caring or not caring will only make a small dent in the overall trajectory of this 7 billion person system. It&#39;s up to you to try or not. And I mean that. If you don&#39;t want to try, then don&#39;t. It&#39;s pretty fucked anyway. I won&#39;t judge you if you want to just live your life as happily as you can, even if that means embracing a bit of ignorance. But what I&#39;ve learned is that we&#39;re all in ignorance, and I&#39;m not excluding myself. We just create stories and narratives, and pretend the world is actually like that. But really we&#39;re just old children, playing a centuries-long game of telephone. We have intelligence slightly above dogs and cats. We&#39;re like German Shepards that can talk and use facebook.  </p>

<p>The sooner humanity stops putting on a front, the sooner we can get on with something that resembles reality, and the more sustainable (and less stressful) our world culture and society will become. But I don&#39;t see this happening anytime soon because greedy humans love to take the short cut, because they don&#39;t realize the long-term consequences. Until world human culture wises up to this sort of thing, we will continue to be stuck in a rut. And this is not an easy thing to realize, because people don&#39;t want to realize it until they absolutely have to. Convincing people they&#39;ve been fooled is like making a dog swallow the heart pill medicine. You can even wrap the pill in bacon, just like you can wrap the truth in humor, but it doesn&#39;t mean the dog will eat the pill. </p>

<p>I may be biting off more than I can chew by writing this post, but I think there is a war coming, and most everyone is going to tacitly agree to it as a culture because we&#39;re all confused as hell, generally speaking. We are hypnotized by confusion. There will be protests and people against it, but the tools of media will be used to whitewash over those people, and the tools of power will keep any change from being enacted. Then things will finally get so incredibly bad it will cause more and more people to wake up. Like the Vietnam War for example was forced on everyone until it got so bad (in large part because of the draft and exposure on TV) that the public wouldn&#39;t have it anymore and the government felt compelled to respond so we withdrew from Vietnam. This is a minor victory, but only after suffering dire consequences. Humanity seems to be like that. We are motivated to solve problems, but after only it&#39;s become startlingly clear there is a problem that must be fixed. </p>

<p>They&#39;re rattling our cages. Over and over. Trying to wear us out so they can do whatever they want. Are you going to keep talking about the truth, or are you going to be rattled in to silence? Are you going to hang on to what you consider your morality, or will you give it up because they&#39;ve convinced you that no one cares? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Worked for the Vietnamese and the Taliban, albeit at great cost but the idea that a truly motivated resistance could not overthrow the government is laughable to me considering how the recent military campaigns abroad have gone. Let&#39;s also not forget that a sizeable amount of the military itself would also turn against the government in an all out revolution, but at the end of the day farmers with rifles are much tougher to beat than most people realize. The biggest issue though is that historically most violent revolutions end with the situation being even worse than before, so I wouldn&#39;t advocate for it (pls no black bag NSA). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately most people don&#39;t even know why we are being pushed to war.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In accordance to the principles of Doublethink, it does not matter if the war is not real, or when it is, that victory is not possible. The war is not meant to be won. It is meant to be continuous. The essential act of modern warfare is the <strong>destruction of the produce of human labor</strong>. A hierarchical society is only possible on the basis of poverty and ignorance. In principle, the war effort is always planned to keep society on the brink of starvation. The war is waged by the ruling group against its own subjects. And its object is not victory over Eurasia or Eastasia, but to keep the very structure of society intact.&quot; -- George Orwell, 1984 </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, as it stands right now rubles and yuan are merely re-branded dollars.  But this will shortly change.  </p>

<p>Putin has sided with a faction among his advisors on monetary policy in the interest of Russia and sovereignty.  To achieve this they have to rewrite the Constitution US provided for them.  As for China, everything there is under control of the Communist Party.  They can do it with just a vote of the Party. </p>

<p>As for BRICS issuing loans, one has to understand how fractional reserve works.  When a bank issues a loan it creates money out of the borrower&#39;s promise to repay.  Banana Republics are not allowed to do that - they can only borrow.  So what BRICS are doing is not allowed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they have overlapping people it is rats trying to jump ship to the BRICS bank, or it is the western banking and intelligence cabal trying to infiltrate BRICS to undermine it. Considering the history of the west in trying to subvert and destroy anything which threatens our corporate interests and the current progressive policies of BRICS, that is the more likely scenario. Especially in considering how western pharmaceutical corporations and energy interests have tried to initiate lawsuits against India for &quot;unfair&quot; trade practices and violating patent laws. </p>

<p>It&#39;s too early to demonize BRICS. BRICS is still in it&#39;s infancy and so far the majority of the BRICS nations policies are based on central planning to raise the standards of living for their citizens, not on enriching a handful of corporations or people. Though things are far from perfect, India, Russia, and especially China have made substantial investments in infrastructure, enacted socially responsible policies, and have a positive versus oppressive role in the developing world, particularly Africa. In Africa, the US is backing dictators and oligarchs who steal the people&#39;s wealth, versus China who has been investing heavily in infrastructure and offering much more equitable wages and trade agreements. </p>

<p>Also, there are no comparable networks of oligarchs and organizations in Russia or China comparable in power or wealth to what the US or EU have, I can&#39;t say the same for India, South Africa or Brazil. As far as Russia and China are concerned, this is due in part to their history of overthrowing their respective royal families, this has made their oligarchs and officials less powerful and easier to manage. They still have their fair share, but their governments do an excellent job of keeping them in check, and their elite have not had the chance to amass wealth, power, and network as they have in the US or EU. As far as corrupt oligarchs in Brazil they certainly have an abundance, but even still, the Brazilian people regularly try to challenge and hold their government accountable. Unfortunately only because corruption is so systemic it has them at a constant breaking point, but their oligarchs aren&#39;t unified like they are in America or the EU, they regularly turn on each other and the recent elections and protests there prove that. </p>

<p>But yeah, if the western banking elite is taking key position in BRICS that is something to watch and is cause for concern, however, Russia and especially China have a long history of cracking down on corrupt oligarchs. </p>

<p>Truthfully, I wish America would return to a policy of severe isolationism. We have the power, the resources, and the will. The only thing we <strong>dont</strong> have are forthright, honest politicians and enlightened citizens.  </p>

<p>And now some people see any talk of economic isolationism as racist or xenophobic, but what about the middle class in America? Bad priorities.</p>

<p>The media has fooled the people, the people elect crappy politicians, who influence the media, and it&#39;s created this feedback loop from hell that was sustained by 50 years of lucky economic prosperity. But now that it&#39;s gone, we&#39;re realizing what we&#39;ve done, and who we&#39;ve put in to office, and how they&#39;ve closed all the routes for change... sad</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a debt-based system there will always be more debt than there is money, so it&#39;s mathematically unrepayable, even in theory. All debt-based central banks are like this. The amount is a thing used to scare people in to compliance, and to allow government to pass cuts to social programs. It means nothing. In 3rd world countries, their debt to GDP ratio gets over a thousand percent, and it&#39;s clear they can&#39;t repay it. What does the World Bank do? Cut the debt to 100% debt to GDP ratio. Make it look like they have a chance at paying it off. </p>

<p>This whole &quot;pay off the national debt&quot; thing, where the government is in debt to a private bank, rather than creating its own money, is the means by which central banks control and influence governments around the world. </p>

The fact they are blaring all over the media the location of 80 nuclear warheads is beyond my comprehension. I feel they are setting up a situation where nukes will get stolen. Either way citizens around the world are being urged to prepare for the worste. Germany, Italy, China, Russia...Pretty much everywhere but North America is being prepped for war. Its like America is setting itself up to fall. Then you got the global economic crisis on the doorstep just waiting to crash the world war party and send the entire globe into massive civil unrest.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t recommend anyone being this afraid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To a degree it is an issue of fear, but it honestly isn&#39;t only that.  I just don&#39;t want the level of discord that exists in the outside world.  The constant conflict, the egotism, the ugly rap music.  The stuff everyone sends each other on Facebook is also just mindless; it&#39;s the sort of thing people used to write on posters which they then put on the back of toilet doors.</p>

<p>So yes, there&#39;s fear, but it&#39;s also just a scenario where I genuinely do not like the way the world is right now.  I don&#39;t know of anyone who has a mobile phone, where it actually makes them happier.  Some people have said that they are useful, or that they need them for work, but I&#39;ve never heard anyone say that it has truly improved the quality of their lives.  It doesn&#39;t.  It just adds stress, and puts them in contact with unintelligent, superficial, unnecessary people who distract them from other things that <strong><em>might</em></strong> actually benefit them.</p>

<p>I have never seen a single thing on Facebook, which I thought was really profound, or that made me consciously happy.  At best it&#39;s hollow New Age aphorisms which don&#39;t really mean anything.  People give away everything about themselves to that site, and they receive nothing whatsoever back in return.</p>

Personally, I try to rise above it and proudly light a beacon so that others can see and perhaps be inspired to rise above it as well. For instance, you don&#39;t like the ugly rap music. Why is it ugly? Is it personal preference or are there actual reasons why it is ugly to the core? Many people won&#39;t be able to see the distinctions unless people like you are there to illuminate them. It may seem like a meaningless gesture but it&#39;s better than doing nothing and letting people continue on auto-pilot without questioning why. I&#39;ve never used facebook so I can&#39;t really make a fair judgement on that.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>But that is no reason to disassociate with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, actually it is.  If you do not like something, what is the point in continuing to associate with it and make yourself miserable?  The single biggest problem with the world at the moment, is the fact that people are willing to tolerate things that they dislike.</p>

<p>This is not to say, that other people should not be allowed to have things that I do not see value in.  I do not like Facebook, and I truthfully believe that it was created with fundamentally malevolent intentions, so I will not continue to use it; but activists and other such people see value in it, so they can have it.</p>

<p>The fundamental problem with these services that use information as a commodity, is the fact that corporations want to make money, but we do not want to give money to them.  So the corporations have looked around for a way to continue to make money, despite our not wanting to pay for said services; and they came up with the idea of selling our information to advertisers for profit.  That is why Facebook wants me to enter all my personal information, my preferences, and my location into it; so that they can sell the advertisers that information, the advertisers will annoy me with targetted ads, and the advertisers will give Facebook money.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is it personal preference or are there actual reasons why it is ugly to the core?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s partly preference, but I think the messages that it conveys a lot of the time are angry and destructive, as well.  For me, rap is largely an unjustifiable genre of music; but again, there are other people who find it valuable.  They are welcome to do so; I simply am not going to tolerate them doing so within my sight or hearing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Magnora7 you are so on a roll lately. Thank you!</p>

<p>The only thing I would add to this excellent essay is that I see <em>more people than ever before</em> waking up, speaking the truth with courageous eloquence, reclaiming their agency, and fundamentally (and radically!) normalizing the presence of an empowered, clear-minded, beneficially-oriented human being. </p>

<p>The example thus set makes it easier for those coming after the early adopters to recognize they have been duped, accept that there is no shame in this, shake off the grog from decades of what essentially equates to abuse, and join ranks with other empowered humans, and on and on exponentially, in waves.</p>

<p>There is already so much more mainstream fluency in the language of coexistence, interoperable agency, planetary integrity, interspecies reciprocity, the nature of mind, the moral imperative to rework our institutions and relationships from a more comprehensive platform, etc. So much more than I ever thought I would witness in my lifetime. </p>

<p>So yes, the efforts of those who would like to continue the oppression and exploitation of everything and everyone is doubling down. But I think this is because they are experiencing the panic and desperation that comes with recognizing your empire is crumbling, and the spoils of your looting, enslaving and warring don&#39;t have as much meaning or value or shelf-life as you thought they would.</p>

<p>The very basic way we define intelligence and responsibility is being revolutionized to an entirely more comprehensive understanding.
This can be accomplished from the grassroots, each perhaps borrowing assurance from the other as we familiarize in our natural potency; and all institutions, systems, and organizations will naturally transform because their purpose will more obviously and spontaneously stem from the innate desire to be of benefit to all.</p>

<p>For me the key is in exactly what you are pointing to: we have a duty to ourselves and each other to offer support and to act as examples of what it looks like to live this way, to live <em>as</em> the freedom we are by nature. No matter how marginalized or dismissed such values are by the carpetbaggers of the consensus reality, we must--we <em>must</em>-- set the precedent by refusing to capitulate to the all-is-lost, fall-in-line message that is the blare of the trumpets of destruction.</p>

<p>Gratitude to all who, like <a href="/u/magnora7">/u/magnora7</a>, use whatever moments of their lives, whatever skills and gifts they possess, and whatever opportunites they can seize, to contribute to the transformation that is possible when human beings boldly and fearlessly recognize the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People don&#39;t have a purpose.</p>

<p>Success is tied to whatever the PTB says it is and then it is not available to most. Your example of a well-paid position. </p>

<p>The standards are set. Want to be a good journalist? One that cares? Break an important story. Do the footwork, put yourself at risk, fight for it. </p>

<p>Be Gary Webb. Then you break it. You get the sources and show your editor. This is big, this is important, this will make a difference.</p>

<p>But then it doesn&#39;t. The status quo outlets make a straw man out of it and beat it to a pulp. And your editor tells you to drop it. But you care. This needs to get out there to keep your fellow peeps safe. You&#39;re going to fight for them. </p>

<p>But then they don&#39;t care. Some do, but most don&#39;t even want you to expose the threat they are under. They and the system praise and reward a photo of some celebrity&#39;s nip-slip and shun your story.</p>

<p>Your purpose is gone by actually fulfilling it and being left with the results. You break that story and your reward is two bullets to the back of the head and a congressional committee that makes a straw man out of it to pacify any unrest you caused. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the reward for caring. I bet if you asked Gary Webb if he&#39;d do it again, he&#39;d say no. I bet if you asked any reporters that he inspired if they&#39;d break that story, they&#39;d say no.</p>

<p>Not because of the retribution from the PTB, but because of the apathy of us. Because of the old conundrum: what is help?</p>

<p>I might think he helped, you might too. But overall, the public didn&#39;t consider him helpful. </p>

<p>He disrupted our bliss. </p>

<p>We could be working on altering the reward system right now. I tell myself I do that with my work. I believe that we are near. And I believe they will try to wipe the slate because of it.</p>

<p>Like with Gary Webb. And therein lies my conundrum, since in the end, my idea of what will help may be another&#39;s annoyance. Not those I believe I&#39;m trying to prevent from harming us, but those who are being harmed and I&#39;m trying to prevent from being harmed. It will be them that hate me.</p>

<p>I think Gary Webb would say yes. It&#39;s not like it was all roses prior to his death, he knew most people didn&#39;t want to hear these things, but he pushed to have them published anyways because he knows, like I know when writing my articles, that there <em>are</em> people listening out there. They may be too afraid to show it right now, but there is a revolution happening. It is happening in our minds, like any good revolution. But it hasn&#39;t yet reached our culture, aside from brave people like Gary Webb. I think he knew that, and I think if he could look back he could rest easy knowing he tried his best given what he had available to him. That&#39;s all anyone can do. He knew if the world were filled with people thinking like him, then these awful problems could be fixed. So even though it might be drops in the bucket, and might cost him his life (and he probably knew this to some degree), it is still the obvious correct choice to make because he knew what was right. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t know what&#39;s right, then maybe doing nothing is the best thing to do. If you <em>do</em> know what&#39;s right, then please start doing it because we are fucked and every little bit helps. We can&#39;t know for 100% what we will do is good, but if we pay attention to our conscience instead of our culture, we can realize a deep morality that makes sense. One based on empathy with other beings. If you find a way to do that, then do it. It&#39;s all ad-hoc in the end anyway. There&#39;s no silver bullet, and we shouldn&#39;t waste our lives waiting for one. However you&#39;re correct too that the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and that not every well-intended action has good consequences. But inaction is also a choice in itself. Not always a bad choice, but doing nothing is still doing something. As long as we are alive in this world and the clock is ticking, there is no true &quot;opt-out&quot; choice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with our world is that people have become completely disconnected with anything within.</p>

<p>Before people come in and say the soul and stuff isn&#39;t real, let&#39;s even just suggest that people don&#39;t even connect with their own emotions anymore.</p>

<p>Our world is truly based on a facade we put up. A facade at work, a facade with friends, a facade on social media. How many people can you truly be yourself around? Probably very few.</p>

<p>So, most do what they can to fit in as a coping mechanism. I&#39;m not going to bring up conspiracy theories with my co-workers after all.</p>

<p>And we must certainly never be too nice, too angry, too caring, too anything. We have to keep our emotions perfectly balanced so nobody can suspect what is &#39;wrong&#39; with us, that we are discontent with something.</p>

<p>Once you realize that emotions are only the beginning  (and mostly temporary), you start to see some sort of consciousness beyond those emotions....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, yes. You are hitting on a real key part of this here. The facade thing is endless. Once I realized I had spent my whole life doing it, and most people spend their whole lives doing it, I couldn&#39;t do it anymore. Now several years later I sometimes go too far in the other direction and have to dial it back.</p>

<p>Most people operate on this base level of fear without fully realizing it, being the thing they think everyone around them wants them to be in the moments where it matters. Trying to fit in to their perceived niche in the culture. Things like going on a long trip abroad or meditating or even psychedelics can break this internalized (often-subconscious) facade-creation process, which can be a real wake-up call for a lot of people. It&#39;s like being a child again. We&#39;ve all had moments like this. Some people just don&#39;t take those moments very seriously, or try to hide them back under a facade because they were afraid of it awakening something in them. Afraid of the cognitive dissonance they would then have to fight with. Afraid of the burden of figuring out something new, or once understood that it might ruin their ability to create good facades. Which might hurt their social standing. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a real shortcoming in our society, we ignore the whole emotional side of things. We talk only of IQ but generally ignore EQ, despite it being just as integral to life. And a lot of people are in a bad place emotionally, and don&#39;t have any help with it, and don&#39;t see it in the culture, and so they feel like a freak and feel compelled to hide their emotions. And our society ignores those people, hoping they will get better on their own. Emotional bootstraps. </p>

<p>But of course, admitting emotions exist and are important means that the authorities in our lives would also have to admit the situations they created are not good for our emotions, which could weaken their hold on their position of power. And given this is a highly power-seeking society, no one wants to lose power. So they will never admit wrongdoing, so emotions are basically ignored by anyone with power, because it doesn&#39;t serve their interests to admit emotions really exist and actually matter. </p>

<p>And like you said, all this talk about emotions that are the ignored half of the mind, is just scratching the surface compared to talking about consciousness, which watches it all happen. Which makes it all the more hilarious how much our culture downplays the importance of emotions from groups like workers and students, because it&#39;s so obvious yet most everyone is pretending like it doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s the elephant in the room. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very well written.</p>

<p>I like your connection to the &quot;powers&quot; that even seem to deny the emotions of their &quot;human resources&quot;. </p>

<p>I often went through depression over the years.  The depression was caused by two things: not exploring how my past affected me and the facade I put up with the world around me.</p>

<p>I got therapy and dove into my childhood. It hurt. It hurt a lot. I cried a lot. At times I got really angry. My therapist told me it was OK to yell and vent if it wasn&#39;t directed at anybody or hurt anybody (I rarely ever get angry so this was new to me).</p>

<p>Then I realized I was unhappy because the majority of my relationships were extremely vapid. And I had to put up a front constantly.</p>

<p>So, I learned to live a life of more balance  (though I&#39;m working on it). I know as long as our society wants materialism, shallowness, and consumerism, then as long as I participate in that society, I will have to put up somewhat of a front. However, I limit this front as much as possible now.</p>

<p>I also allow my emotions to exist. There are days when I&#39;m down and sad, and I don&#39;t deny that. There are days when I&#39;m extremely happy, and I don&#39;t deny that. As long as the emotions aren&#39;t limiting my functioning  (which they were before, they are ok).</p>

<p>Now that I have been more able to address my emotions, I have been able to explore a higher level of consciousness. This often takes me beyond my emotions and helps me understand things more deeply.</p>

<p>I am nowhere near enlightened, but I am getting to a much better state.</p>

<p>However, I look at most people and they are extremely stuck. I am not judging them. I am often sad for them, and wish I could help them rise a little. The thing is, they have to want to. They have to be open to it.</p>

<p>Our media, the divisions, our world has been made to close the minds of people into some type of worldview of paradigm.</p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of like photography. You choose what lens you see through. If you want to see the Moon through the telescopic lens, it will look great, but you might miss it in conjunction with its surroundings. If you want to look at the moon through a wide angle lens, you might see the beautiful world, but fail to see the details. It takes many lenses to see what is real.</p>

<p>Many people only see the world through one lens. I find atheists for example (sorry I know not all are like this), use the lens of &quot;science&quot; and &quot;logic&quot;. And it is very important to see the world in that way. But, to not even attempt a different worldview is slightly dangerous. We went from dogmatic religious beliefs, and now we are living in a world where people worship science, when in reality science is often bought and funded.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why extremism is dangerous. I find by the late 20s most people have chosen their worldview and they stick with it - they stick with that lens.</p>

<p>How much do they miss out on though?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Beautiful post. I like the lens analogy, that is spot-on. I think most people stick with that late 20s lens because they get locked in to their career and social position and changing it becomes too much a burden. </p>

<p>And I also agree with the warning against extremism, and calling out these people who believe in &quot;scientism&quot; as I like to call it, where the scientific establishment is held up as the bastion of truth, even beyond the scientific method itself. </p>

<p>Like your examples of extreme atheists, or extreme scientism-ists, or even Christians, many of us grew up in these extreme mindsets without realizing they were extreme. They just seemed normal. Then as we get wiser, we realize that they&#39;re actually highly lop-sided. </p>

<p>Perhaps we are all extremists, and the key to enlightenment is ridding yourself of all your inherited extremism, inherited through your culture and natural behavior at birth. Maybe we believe any bug in our house should be smashed. Maybe later in life, we realize this is an extreme position, and most bugs can be captured and let outside again. This is a very minor example of extremism, but it makes me wonder how many things I am &quot;extreme&quot; about without even realizing it yet, where I just let some thought or ideology run away with me without even realizing I have other options, simply because it&#39;s the cultural norm. I guess this is why enlightenment is called &quot;the middle path&quot;, because it gets away from the extremes. But perhaps it&#39;s like a fish in water, where we are surrounded by extremes without even realizing it. Perhaps enlightenment has to do with recognizing the extremes as being extreme, where before we thought they were normal. I suppose this is part of waking up to the big picture. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What a great way to start my day with this conversation. I don&#39;t have much to add because I think you really said it well enough!</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad you liked my lens analogy. I take pictures a lot (amateur but enjoy the hobby), and it has shown me how our perspectives can be twisted in so many ways. Perspective is everything, really. And that&#39;s when you start to wonder if there is a higher perspective beyond our egos. There is, I think. Our egos taint things with our biases, judgments, emotions, etc. And there is a place and purpose for our egos, but that can&#39;t be the only lens through which we view the world.</p>

<p>I am a teacher, and I just read an article about the importance of establishing empathy with young children. Does our world in any capacity do that? Do most people even understand what empathy means? I find most mistake empathy for sympathy - feeling sorry for others, but that is not what empathy is. In my opinion, empathy take us beyond our egos.</p>

<p>If nothing else, I feel developing empathy is another first &#39;stage&#39; toward a better world. I really find that it is a trait most are severely lacking. I find most people confuse loving their family or friends as &quot;being a good person&quot; and having empathy, but that is simply not the case.</p>

<p>I kind of rambled, but I really have enjoyed this conversation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, fantastic analogy with the ego as a lens. That is really good, I&#39;m going to think about that off and on for the rest of the day probably. It&#39;s true that ego is a tool in the toolbox, but it&#39;s not the only tool. People over-rely on it, no doubt. </p>

<p>I agree that developing empathy is key. And I think it&#39;s sad in a way that when religion was rejected by mainstream American culture over the last few decades that they also threw out the baby with the bathwater, that is morality. People don&#39;t discuss morality in any serious way anymore, and I think that has hurt people&#39;s ability to take empathy in to consideration. I like to say empathy is the ability to see things from other people&#39;s points of view. To simulate another person&#39;s mind in your own mind. This takes skill, but it&#39;s so useful. We begin to see the world from not only our perspective, but <em>every</em> perspective. It&#39;s like a meta-perspective, because you can see out of multiple people&#39;s eyes at once, so to speak. It&#39;s a meta-consciousness that is so helpful to develop not just for yourself but for everyone around you. It&#39;s great you&#39;re teaching children these skills of empathy for their fellow beings, it&#39;s something that is never tested on the SAT or ACT so unfortunately it gets ignored in most education. It seems elementary school is the only time it&#39;s taken somewhat seriously. </p>

<p>I think you&#39;re right about the &quot;being a good person&quot; having these limited check boxes that they feel if they complete, they don&#39;t have to worry about it anymore. Empathy is a skill that has no limit, it can be honed to very deep levels, and I think that&#39;s scary to most people because they want to focus on doing other things, like school and work and whatnot.</p>

<p>Feel free to ramble away! I enjoyed our exchange quite a bit too, really hitting on some important topics here that I don&#39;t see discussed very often</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your post got me thinking further.</p>

<p>I think the problem with some philosophies and religions is that they require people to be egoless. While I do think that is possible for some, I feel the ego is demonized. Our egos often motivate us on some level and to deny that is ridiculous. I&#39;d be lying if I didn&#39;t say that teaching works with my ego on some levels. I need a personality and even achievements to reach some of my students after all. I wish it was not like that, but to reach people, appealing to the ego in some ways is important. Unless there is a full spiritual profession of our planet, that&#39;s where we are.</p>

<p>So, the problem right now is the over reliance on our egos as a lens, like you said.</p>

<p>And then I agree that morality is not even a subject matter anymore. While I do find religions of the past to be used to control people at times, they did often times provide people with a sense of morality. The problem today is that I&#39;m not even sure how most people measure morality. Is morality a word even used anymore?</p>

<p>That is the importance of culture at times. We are now living  (we Americans) in a society that seems to have no culture...or a disjointed culture. We have nothing that seems to be bonding us other than a hatred for one another. Our morals are really and truly based on consumerism and capitalism...if we have morals at all?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure. I&#39;m not sure the average person even questions morality, their own mortality, or anything philosophical. That&#39;s where I think the free will component comes in. Though most of our lives are dictated by circumstances beyond our control, we still have the free will to think...</p>

<p>Well, I mean they try to do everything to get people not to think. And it works mostly, but clearly there are still some of us choosing to think.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, what is up with that? How can we help more people choose to think? Do you think it&#39;s in-born, or do you think your circumstances played a role? </p>

<p>I know some people won&#39;t think something unless everyone else thinks it too, but other people seem okay to go their own way. Perhaps by making thinking seem less scary and more liberating (which is how I see it, as a ticket to realizing the truth and thus putting myself and others in a good position) then perhaps people could be encouraged to think more freely and see it as empowering. </p>

<p>I think a lot of people have their curiosity crushed in school. They get average or bad grades, and they were told that. So they gave up, and stopped trying to be curious and started hating learning because it tells them they are bad at it. The Prussian School system, which is the basis for all US schooling, is based on the idea of obedience because the Prussian army lost a series of battles due to inobedience of army members, so this schooling system was designed to create good obedient soldiers. Later it was expanding to create good obedient workers, and that&#39;s the basis of the US school system we use today in a nutshell. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey polkadotgirl. I read all your posts and it looks like your having a spiritual awakening which is great! I was an atheist worshipping science that had a spiritual awakening and my entire lens changed. You figured some things out correctly. The ego represents insanity and it wants you to use its lens to see the world. Your only other lens is your true self. Your consciousness when self actualization, is love itself. You can serve the ego or serve your true self. </p>

<p>You are also right about humans being primitive. We have been in a vicious cycle and it led to a lot of suffering. This is mostly because we worship the ego. The ego leads to destruction. It always has stupid ideas with attractive promises but it always leads to ruin. </p>

<p>All these acts people put up in public are torturing them. Everyone wants to have fun and enjoy each other but they are so primitive, they cannot see solution which is right in front of them. Consciousness is also the expression of joy. People simply love to have fun. The lack of expressing joy leads to sadness. If it does, sadness has to be expressed so that it can revert back into a desire for fun which will have to be expressed or it will turn back into sadness. If someone feels sadness and refuses to express it, it turns into depression. At this point, depression would have to be expressed fully so it goes back to sadness. </p>

<p>Basically, we need to be ourselves at all times. People who think they are not free to express themselves are simply giving away their power to do so. </p>

<p>Also, religions are man made institutions that were meant to unite us but they are doing the complete opposite as they are operated by primitive people. Also, many politicians have meddled with religious text and have made a mockery out of God and reality. They made God look like a dictator who wants people to avoid all pleasures when in fact God is a big, blameless child who likes to play and have fun just like us. Also, religion stopped 2000 years ago. God has been talking to us through many ways but we have not listened. </p>

<p>The good news is that in this giant mess of a world will the golden age of man emerge. It is our pain and suffering that is causing us to awaken and rise. We could have done it without all these problems but we have to learn the hard way that the ego lens is insanity. </p>

<p>We are living in a simulation we built in the real world. Happiness means we are winning. Insanity means we are losing. All is consciousness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It began early this year. I saw a scientist on YouTube explaining his near death experience where he died, left the matrix, came back, and his brain was restored in full. Originally the cancer at about half of his brain. </p>

<p>I started digging around which I realize now that digging around is an invitation to awakening as a willing invitation is needed. </p>

<p>Right now I feel powerful enough to push the entire planet into a positive direction. Of course, I&#39;m not taking all the responsibility on my shoulders but I just know what to do now. The battle is won in millions of small victories. People like me act as a motivator but I fight small battles as well. All the tiny battles lead to victory. We only have to worry about our area of reach. The fastest way to world peace is self improvement. Nothing is out of reach and we can make our wildest dreams come true but we have to eliminate all divisions all the way from ridding the mind of racism down to unisex bathrooms. Divisions are killing us. My entire mission as of right now is to steer mankind into the golden age from my local reach. I know what I do here travels fast. Although I believe the future is bright, I don&#39;t think people understand what they need to do. They know, but they need to put the true lens up instead of the ego. I maintain awareness everywhere I go about the oligarchy, federal reserve, and other broken systems. This helps a ton in reality. We need to set long term goals such as the goal of equal opportunity. We have to eliminate fear, guilt, increase forgiveness, increase trust in each other, consider our universe as the one being that it is, unite, and remain in the present mentally (stop thinking about past or future). </p>

<p>These are very practical things we can all do instantly. That&#39;s the beauty of it all. The solutions to the most complex problems are so incredibly simple. We can&#39;t legislate morality. We can only increase spirituality. </p>

<p>no, it&#39;s coming from top.  There are &#39;cultural engineers&#39; and they &#39;manufacture consent&#39; from the public.  The public is only to blame if they know about it and don&#39;t gripe about it.  Some of you argue that talk is cheap and griping about it on the internet is not very brave and costs you nothing (ahem: chomsky antagonized us for this).  </p>

<p>I would say to that the every time you gripe to someone, you&#39;re actually telling a story.  You&#39;re contributing to our collective oral tradition. Your participating in citizen journalism with your words. And your words have power.</p>

<p>In fact, words create the world, &quot;in the beginning there was the word&quot;, reality is made of languge.  So words are more powerful than any action.  After all, if a tree falls in the forest and there&#39;s no one to hear it does it make a sound?  Of course it does, but no one cares about that sound because they didn&#39;t hear it and so it didn&#39;t exist.</p>

<hr/>

<p>We are participating in citizen journalism as we speak.  You see, the enantiodromia they forgot about is that if they shitcan everyone by thinking they can protect their 2M/yr ceo salaries--instead of you know, fucking sharing, personal sacrifices and sparing everyone&#39;s jobs THROUGH their sharing/sacrifice--then we would have plenty of spare time to go on reddit and participate in the tide turning of opinion against them, which ultimately leads to deep distrust of ALL institutions, starting with politics, then the media (ie: &quot;the voice of the elite, which happens to be the directives of the cultural engineers&quot;), then the government itself.</p>

<p>You can see the government trust starting to wither like dust in their mouths as people run lights, stop stopping at stop signs, weaving all over the road and not signalling ever when changing lines...like they&#39;re all out of fucks and so none will be given.  </p>

<p>So my point is : be safe and continue doing what you&#39;re doing.  I&#39;m going for the burn it all down option and I too have zero fucks left to give.</p>

<hr/>

<p>edit: btw magnora I agree with others here, it&#39;s an excellent post and thanks for caring, so here&#39;s some gild.  I say i have zero fucks but I do care, just about burning it all down and starting over.</p>

<p>I agree with that so much. People dismiss &quot;internet activism&quot; but this OP I wrote will be read by approximately 1000 people. Mostly preaching to the choir, but a lot of people might be able to fill in some blanks, and some new people might be opened to many new ideas at once. Repeated over months, this has a definite impact. Multiplied by a few hundred people doing the same thing... that can have a huge cultural impact depending on how many people view it. Stuff that gets to the front page can easily get 100k-1M views. If broadcasting info didn&#39;t work, then advertisers wouldn&#39;t pay so much money for advertising. </p>

<p>And the more people who wake up means the more people who can talk about this stuff. It will grow exponentially. The internet has changed everything, and by spreading hidden info it helps humanity clearly see the present so we can better plan the future. </p>

<p>enantiodromia - is a principle introduced by psychiatrist Carl Jung that the superabundance of any force inevitably produces its opposite. It is similar to the principle of equilibrium in the natural world, in that any extreme is opposed by the system in order to restore balance. When things get to their extreme, they turn into their opposite. However, in Jungian terms, a thing psychically transmogrifies into its Shadow opposite, in the repression of psychic forces that are thereby cathected into something powerful and threatening. This can be anticipated as well in the principles of traditional Chinese religion - as in Taoism and yin-yang. Though &quot;enantiodromia&quot; was coined by Jung, it is implied in the writings of Heraclitus. In fr. 126, for example, Heraclitus says &quot;cold things warm, warm things cool, wet things dry and parched things get wet.&quot; It also seems implicit in other of his sayings, like &quot;war is father of all, king of all&quot;, &quot;they do not know that the differing/opposed thing agrees with itself; harmony is reflexive, like the bow and the lyre&quot;.</p>

<p>We are all being gaslighted by an entire culture.</p>

<p>This is the real reason we powerless to change anything on this earth. Like Mark Twain said, &quot;It&#39;s easier to fool people, than to convince them they&#39;ve been fooled.&quot;</p>

<p>A bit of scripture that&#39;s helped me find meaning in this madness. </p>

<p>&quot;For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a spiritual war and you can find solace in the fact that it was all foretold. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your analysis is mostly wrong and extremely black and white and lacks any real perspective. I&#39;m surprised that so many have agreed with you without providing the context I will try to provide here. And by context, I mostly mean my own perspective. These things are debatable, and it&#39;s personal opinion, but in my opinion you&#39;re way off target.</p>

<p>You say that the world is clearly being driven towards war. You say that as if that&#39;s something new on the horizon. And give your opinion about what may be its driver. But you don&#39;t provide much context or fact about how much war there is versus what&#39;s historically been the case. I&#39;d posit that this is the way it has always more or less been. That if anything, we&#39;re on a waning period, rather than the reverse. And if anything, that, probably at no other time in history have more people been more critically aware of and organized against the possibility of catastrophic war. I&#39;m not naive, I realize that there are many organizations and people who seek the opposite, but historically, I don&#39;t see how you could credibly suppose that we&#39;re in any worse shape than we&#39;ve been in in the past.</p>

<p>In your second paragraph you posit that our culture is being systematically destroyed. This is nonsense. This is some &#39;end of history&#39; doublespeak nonsense. The world is in flux and change, it always has been and always will be. But to suppose that the cultural values you named are being destroyed, never to return is nonsense. Certainly our culture has dramatically changed. And I would even agree that those valuable cultural values have worn thin in certain areas of our civilization, but to not think and realize that the world will find balance, is naive. The market of ideas is like the market place of capital. If it&#39;s out of whack, it will find balance, if there&#39;s a bubble, or some aspect of it has gone off the deep end, I&#39;m confident that something at the opposite end of the spectrum will come about to counterbalance that. If you look at how brutal and distorted and inequitable some of our history is, maybe much of it, I&#39;d say we&#39;re still winning the battle as far as the cultural values of compassion, empathy and good will. And you say something about the media. The media? Fuck the media, the media doesn&#39;t define me, the media doesn&#39;t necessarily define my world.</p>

<p>Next paragraph, some pretty sweeping comments. You say religion used to be a source of unity within a culture? But not it&#39;s a source of divisiveness? Seriously? Religion has always been both, different things to different people at different times. I could say the exact opposite and have it be more or less true! It just depends on which chair you&#39;re sitting in.</p>

<p>As far as the economy. I think the past 15 to 20 years has been one of great transition, and a good amount of it gives us a lot to complain about, but that again, things will balance out and stabilize. I&#39;d suggest Peter Zeihan <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIdUSqsz0Io">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIdUSqsz0Io</a>
as someone to google or look up on youtube as a good contrarian voice to the never ending calls of doom about this country and where it&#39;s headed.</p>

<p>To further suggest that there is something fundamentally wrong with this newest generation, or millenials, or anything like that, as compared to the WW1 or 2 generation, is also naive, and wrong. To get some perspective on that, I suggest this:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HFwok9SlQQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HFwok9SlQQ</a>
To suggest something inherently wrong with our or the newer generation, is kind of fucked up. To not understand that, they, as human beings, like us, or whatever glorious generation you want to measure them against, mostly have, and always will want more or less the same things, and share more or less the same values. You&#39;re driving a wedge between the two which shouldn&#39;t exist. You&#39;re explaining things you see by making assumptions on the value judgments of people that are wholly false.</p>

<p>Next paragraph you talk about the media. MSM abuses us, etc. MSM is shit, people are aware, hence their shit ratings. MSM viewership has been dying hard for the past couple of years. People are well aware when they&#39;re being bullshitted. They may not be able to articulate it, because that&#39;s a challenging thing to do in a confusing world, but the fuck if they&#39;ll listen to it. That&#39;s why it&#39;s being tuned out and turned off.</p>

<p>Same thing with you, if you don&#39;t like it, don&#39;t turn it on and don&#39;t take part.</p>

<p>No thoughts like this aren&#39;t new, like you wrote. But you fall into the classic sort of &#39;end of history&#39; view of the world, where you&#39;re holding up the changing world, and it&#39;s changing measures, to your very small measuring stick, defined only by your very limited experience and knowledge. Time will not end, civilization is not collapsing, tomorrow will come, I promise you. Even some of the most educated and important social and political commentators, in my view, fall into this trap. Chris Hedges for example, whom I am very fond of, has become too messianic in his message, leaving people looking for a grand finale, or second coming, or definable labelable point, where you can say, see!, here!, it&#39;s the end, or something. That&#39;ll never come.</p>

<p>You sound confused from there. Saying that people don&#39;t care. Are you stupid? Of course people care. Just because they don&#39;t completely agree with you, or share your same sense of frustration and outrage, doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t care. Many people by and large are exhausted and overwhelmed, confused and unable to necessarily articulate the movement or change they&#39;d like to see. But to dismiss most of the world as uncaring is naive and insulting to so many people. It&#39;s hubris of the worst kind.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve got to say it sounds like you yearn for for a connection to a purpose and movement bigger than yourself, but damn the world because you haven&#39;t found it yet. It&#39;s out there, I guarantee it. But you&#39;re making a rediculous assumption that it&#39;s not out there, and that you haven&#39;t found it yet as proof that humanity is putting on a &#39;front&#39;, or falls flat, because of your own fucked up expectations.</p>

<p>Get real dude, and get your philosophizing in order, to help you make sense of your world. In my view, (something from Christianity) humans are fallen and sinful, so while I agree with some of your analysis, it&#39;s to be expected. But you leave a lot of the good stuff out. We&#39;ve evolved to become less violent, healthier, and there&#39;s something about the redemptive quality of human beings that usually makes up for a lot of the nonsense that brings us down, I&#39;m just sorry you haven&#39;t found that or come to that conclusion yet.</p>

<p>Yeah, there&#39;s probably a war coming. People aren&#39;t powerless though. The whole reason Obama didn&#39;t go into Syria after Assad supposedly crossed the red line was because of the insane groundswell of grass-root opposition against it. So I think you&#39;re wrong about people being powerless.</p>

<p>I&#39;m all about fighting the power, I just wanted to inject some perspective into this thread, so that you&#39;d have some humility and maybe a reality check and be able to get outside your own head for a sec.</p>

<p>Meant no disrespect by anything written, just IMO stuff,</p>

<p>Peace</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The mistake might be to consider these actions, and the emotional impact, as a recent development. I note the inclusion of the 10,000 year date and agree that&#39;s a good marker on the transition to this form of civilization--but its a movement that cannot be understated. It also marks the emergence of a ruling class incapable of empathy. And a cycle of war against the newly created citizenry. I don&#39;t think we&#39;re on the cusp of war, I would argue we&#39;ve always been in it but in a guerilla-esque form. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s definitely a point worth making. It&#39;s something that waxes and wanes throughout history. Corruption and psychopathic leaders cannot be &quot;defeated&quot; anymore than evil itself. It&#39;s always there, it&#39;s just a matter of mitigating the damage based on the knowledge it will happen. It&#39;s definitely an ongoing battle, but I think the recent development of the internet has significantly altered the calculus of the elite. When the whole globe knows, then there&#39;s no where else for these power-mongers to hide. Thanks to the internet, we can actually imagine such a day. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The sooner humanity stops putting on a front, the sooner we can get on with something that resembles reality, and the more sustainable (and less stressful) our world culture and society will become.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This right there. That said, the moment you do in fact stop caring you also stop making effort to put yourself out there and also the point you stop influencing the world around you. (=&gt; i.e you make no effort to break through the front you and others put up)</p>

<p>Each individual lives in its own macro-cosmos, each of which we can individually affect with out actions and decisions.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t change the world.</p>

<p>You won&#39;t change world.</p>

<p>Both of us can however change the world/cosmos we live within as individual and have <strong>positive</strong> impact. Be compassionate, be forgiving, know what <strong>you</strong> stand for and hold <strong>your</strong> values high. Not above that of others (i.e creating a divide) but also don&#39;t give up on what <strong>you</strong> think is right. Be kind and respectful. Be a humane.</p>

<p>No matter what the future has in store for me, I&#39;ll not be going to war, whatever that may means for my individual future - worst case an abrupt, unexpected end to it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll keep on standing for what I <del>think</del> know to be right and that&#39;s about as true as one can life one&#39;s life. This also dispels all potential illusion. You don&#39;t need to believe, you don&#39;t need to doubt - you simply need to trust what you&#39;ve experienced and made of it for that is truth (or rather, fact) which in turn turns belief into knowledge.</p>

<p>From a religious perspective speaking: If you&#39;ve found/experienced god you no longer need to belief in god, for god is no longer a subject of belief for you but simply a fact. Likewise, your facts don&#39;t need to be pressed onto others. Others need to make their own experiences and reflect upon them for at the very least as much as one has on one&#39;s own.</p>

<p>Also, I sense somewhat of Jungian vibe from your entry. Might want to have a go at his psychology model ;)</p>

I even show the email scandals, how she was fired from Watergate, her years as a lawyer, and who is controlling her! Hard evidence man! But his response &quot;Politicians fuck up.

<p>I think you are wrong about people not caring.  Most people who are aware, I think, care a bit.  But the thing is, it&#39;s hard to show concern in public, people being very judgemental and the world being very PC... so people just act indifferent for better social cohesion, even if inside they are concerned.  The problem, in my eyes, is more a lack of awareness, or the presence of misinformation, rather than people who are informed not caring.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think at this point, at least in the U.S. where I live, we still have a while to go before war.  I&#39;d be strongly against a war with Russia as I&#39;m sure many others would be, but with ISIS in the Middle East, that would probably be a lot more favorable.  Then we have potential risks like Iran and Turkey.... who knows what could happen.  For now, I think it is good to just spread whatever info we can - exposing the MSM for being a hoax, aiming for smaller government, more transparency, etc.</p>

<p>Things seem bad in Western Europe, but I feel that I can&#39;t really do much here in the U.S.  I really hope that enough people are seeing the migrant crisis for what it is, an invasion, and waking up to that sad reality.  I hope it doesn&#39;t take a major catastrophe to wake people up, but it might.  Doesn&#39;t help the globalist$$$ are pushing for it too.</p>

I don&#39;t think anyone is pushing for mutually assured destruction that would be triggered by direct conflict between the US and Russia. But I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to see ISIS wind up with a nuke somehow and use it against Assad, thereby triggering a humanitarian crisis and an immediate pretext for US invasion to destroy ISIS.

<p>The protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism is the origin for people building wealth for investment for the purpose of building wealth.  This is the path to righteousness as the protestant conceptualization of god in this way.  It is a MORAL CONCEPTUALIZATION.  </p>

<p>This stems from the Judeo-Christian belief in monotheism.  The worship of a single higher power deity that judges our individual actions.  This is why there is charity and philanthropy to take the place of civil society.  This morality permeates the legal world and is the foundation for justice in the Western world.

Even then I was a man of faith, and thought we could &quot;fix&quot; the world, even though we kept hitting these brick walls. Then one day I prayed for guidance and discovered that trying to &quot;fix&quot; the world or change someones view was pretty useless (Ephesians 6:12). I discovered that the only thing I could really change was myself and my viewpoint. Since that day, though by no means without struggle or hardships, I have been happy...at peace.    </p>

<p>Whats coming has been coming since the beginning. it was always going to come...and it WILL come. Everyone has whats coming to them, so do what needs to be done to DESERVE what you are gonna get...sow what you want to reap...and really understand what it is that you want.   </p>

<p>Be willing to die far before you are willing to kill. Fight and win the war within instead of marching to fields of battle throughout the world. I for one am still fighting to change the world, i just do it one person at a time, and that one person is myself. Be the change you want to see in the world. Put your faith in and wear the full armor of God. Accept that Christ is the only way to escape the chains that this world and its rulers have placed on you.    </p>

<p>Whatever you ask God for in prayer, BELIEVING, you will receive...pray wisely my friends. ;)   </p>

<p>Ah yeah, that&#39;s just what they <em>think</em> though. The truth is they have the power to band together and change the government, if they were to choose to do so. They have the ability to change culture and what people think, by voicing their opinions using online media. </p>

<p>People just got fooled in to thinking this work/consumerism method of existing is what needs prioritizing, and everything else can be ignored. They got fooled by their own comfort of the last 5 decades, and by a cultural narrative that rewards certain types of ignorance. </p>

I just don&#39;t think they have to have a world war, because that would go nuclear. There&#39;s still valuable land they can tax here, they wouldn&#39;t do that. It&#39;s all staged. They&#39;ll have a war with like Saudi Arabia or Turkey or something more minor and the U.S. and Russia wIll continue their slow march (back, in Russia&#39;s case) towards authoritarianism.

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. Every once in a while I just get so fed up and I have to say what I&#39;m thinking to people who understand. And you all understand, so it&#39;s a joy to share. But I honestly think every truth that has ever existed has already been said in one way or another, it&#39;s just a matter of keeping what&#39;s important at the forefront. Keeping the good bits in focus. Re-awakening, like you said.</p>

<p>If we do that enough times, it will grow to more people and our world culture will absorb it. How cool is that, that we can play a part in that process? Surely 1000 people posting something everywhere has as much reach as a mainstream media network, in this day and age? Imagine if 1M people saw information like this post instead of just 1k. </p>

<p>Imagine if a few billion people instantly had a good counter-narrative anytime a corrupt government or organization tried anything, because they overcame the limitations of the corporate-made media by using the internet and finding out info from everyone who is spreading it to everyone else. Wouldn&#39;t that be amazing? It&#39;s all possible with changes in culture, and culture changes as we individually change ourselves, because the things we do and say <em>are</em> culture. We are each 1/7billionth of modern human culture right at this very moment, and it&#39;d be cool if we all acted like that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually take solice in the notion that industrialized civilization is circling the drain.  One or the other of the global economy or the global ecosystem are at most a decade or two from complete collapse - and this is a good thing.  While it is unfortunate that climate migration and WWIII will claim the lives of 93% of current human lives, the complete destruction of contemporary civilization is the very best thing that we can hope for in terms of the long-term continuity of humanity and the earth itself.</p>

<p>Corporate and banking elites hold no sway in a post-apocalyptic wasteland where the dollar has long since been  revealed as the tool of control that it is.  Capitalism, industrialism, commercialism... these are the notions that poison living human mentality.  After &quot;the end of the world&quot; humanity will once again have a chance to live <em>with</em> the earth.</p>

<p>I say start now. </p>

<p>We are already beginning to unravel authorities and corruption and darkness in our world, and the ways we separate and divide each other from each other. This is beneficial because what&#39;s coming down the road is more water a lot more. We didn&#39;t poss God off or anything, just screwed up the earth a little. So it needs to take a bath. So to say.</p>

<p>But what&#39;s happening now is laying the groundwork. We won&#39;t survive the floods with this current system. But we need to be &quot;united&quot;. So the amount of separation needs to be undone to a major degree. </p>

Nothing is going to change until people can wake up and make small changes that will trickle into the future, changing attitudes over generations.  How to convince people of this?  Massive suffering.   Seems like people that suuffer the most are happiest will tge least.  I think it all boils down to a depopulation, and the easiest way to do it is to keep us pissed at each other, enable certain cultures to be lazy, and in the end we all fight and kill each other while they hide out underground for a few years.  One thing is certain, we can sit and guess the plan forever but we will never know the exact next move or the end game.  Depopulation is a surety IMO.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just bizarre how none of us really had anything to do with any of this, we just inherited this huge mess and now we have to figure out how to make it work. I suppose every generation had it like that to some degree, but this go-around is pretty extra-special. </p>

<p>I agree, we need to get back to basics and simplify. And discover ways of operating that don&#39;t generate so much anxiety and that are sustainable without lying. We need to connect as humans about what exactly we want out of society and collectively become that, instead of letting others design our culture for us and then selling it to us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>War with who? Any major war in a globalised world would be like the left hand fighting the right. Destruction and construction is profit from nearly all angles at the expense of the lives and livelihoods of the people unlucky enough to be caught in the middle. It&#39;s not really about war on a national level anymore and instead just a game of profit and control.. control to protect said profit. Any attempt to assume otherwise is propaganda.</p>

<p>How is the media destroying culture? If anything it&#39;s abusing it and using it to divide. The media doesn&#39;t report the news anymore.. They paint it.. like a picture that fits their fiscal/political agenda using your culture as a stencil to make sure you only see the image of the news that they want you to see.</p>

<p>The more I read this the more it becomes apparent that you are falling into a nihilistic world view. This is a hurdle that you need to overcome on a personal level more so than a sociological one i think. That&#39;s just my opinion though. Thanks for sharing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please feel free to tell me what you think is fucked and how you think its fucked, but please don&#39;t in your title try to tell me anything about what I think about a subject.</p>

<p>First, too many people here talking about war don&#39;t know war, but some do. As a combat vet myself, I don&#39;t think we should be accepting these wars without proper constitutional backing, and the AUMF style authorization does not count as a declaration of war. So then the responsibility to reject foreign supranational oligarchy designed quigmires. If our generals are failing to uphold their oaths, then they should be brought to justice under the UCMJ. Our Justice department needs to grow a set of balls, and if they are being cut by POTUS or SoS, I say the speaker of the house shouldn&#39;t be able to shelve all discussion about impeachment, when thats the main tool designed for a dissasitisfied public to at the very least, warn it&#39;s president. We need to return to our uniquely American way of individualism that is essential to understanding our system of law and the rule of law under the supreme law of the land, the constitution. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll give you an example. People want to talk about equality. Equality in the constitutional sense is about equal access to the law. This system is completely unconstitutional due to how corrupt the lawyers and legislators have made it. The poor get fucked in court daily, yet the rich have nice lawyers to make things go away. This corruption is a root corruption that feeds into others, such as private prisons. </p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is keep the focus on the the thing that makes us unique, and that&#39;s our oaths&#39; the the constitution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I write about it because I feel so overwhelmed that not talking about it is akin to suicide. Talking about it and realizing others are feeling the same way is one of the few threads of hope I have left in this world. The fact that people might actually band together to fix things that need fixing because many many people realize what the problem is. We&#39;re not there yet, but this is why I write the things I do. I don&#39;t mean to depress you, but only to point out reality as it is so that we may begin to fix it. Seeing reality clearly can be jarring if you&#39;re used to the lies though, there&#39;s no avoiding that </p>

The amount is a thing used to scare people in to compliance, and to allow government to pass cuts to social programs. It means nothing. In 3rd world countries, their debt to GDP ratio gets over a thousand percent, and it&#39;s clear they can&#39;t repay it. What does the World Bank do? Cut the debt to 100% debt to GDP ratio. Make it look like they have a chance at paying it off. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t recommend anyone being this afraid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To a degree it is an issue of fear, but it honestly isn&#39;t only that.  I just don&#39;t want the level of discord that exists in the outside world.  The constant conflict, the egotism, the ugly rap music.  The stuff everyone sends each other on Facebook is also just mindless; it&#39;s the sort of thing people used to write on posters which they then put on the back of toilet doors.</p>

<p>So yes, there&#39;s fear, but it&#39;s also just a scenario where I genuinely do not like the way the world is right now.  I don&#39;t know of anyone who has a mobile phone, where it actually makes them happier.  Some people have said that they are useful, or that they need them for work, but I&#39;ve never heard anyone say that it has truly improved the quality of their lives.  It doesn&#39;t.  It just adds stress, and puts them in contact with unintelligent, superficial, unnecessary people who distract them from other things that <strong><em>might</em></strong> actually benefit them.</p>

<p>I have never seen a single thing on Facebook, which I thought was really profound, or that made me consciously happy.  At best it&#39;s hollow New Age aphorisms which don&#39;t really mean anything.  People give away everything about themselves to that site, and they receive nothing whatsoever back in return.</p>
