RE: H. Clinton</p>

<p>Apparently, the FBI forgot to visit the Cornell Law Library. Word for word from the Cornell Law Library Former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey tells MSNBC that not only is Hillary Clinton&#39;s private email server illegal, it &quot;disqualifies&quot; her from holding any federal office. Very specifically points to one federal law, Title 18. Section 2071.</p>

<p>For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here&#39;s what it says: 
“(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.
(b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term “office” does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.”
Yes, it explicitly states &quot;shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.&quot;
Shouldn&#39;t voters know that? The media won&#39;t tell them. So it&#39;s up to us.

<p>It&#39;s pretty clear she willfully transmitted material she knew was classified and did not turn over all classified material when asked, and that she caused people (server admins, any country with an Internet connection and cybersecurity agency) who were not cleared to view it the power to do so. She may not have known the specifics but she knew her server was not secure, and did not immediately hand over all materials when she found out there was classified info there.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve got a buddy that thinks the fbi didn&#39;t suggest prosecutory methods because Obama would simply pardon her and she&#39;d win the presidency anyway. His idea is that the fbi can&#39;t stand her, and is waiting for her to win the election before they bring up charges. </p>

<p>This theory falls flat on three levels. First, after winning the presidency she could simply claim executive privilege due to national security and for all intents and purposes pardon herself. </p>

<p>Second, it&#39;s my understanding that the fbi director that recommended no prosecutory measures be taken was a fucking attorney for the Clinton&#39;s during <del>Watergate</del> Whitewater... </p>

<p>Third, the fbi isn&#39;t going to drag the country through the mud no matter what. Billy Bud comes to mind...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is interesting for a couple of reasons. And I submit these questions:</p>

<p>Let&#39;s assume your friend&#39;s theory is correct. Obama will pardon her, she&#39;d be &#39;elected&#39; anyway. What are the parameters of presidential pardons? Meaning, doesn&#39;t someone have to be convicted to be pardoned or simply charged with a crime?</p>

<p>So, if she were convicted, isn&#39;t it possible that would be after the election anyway?</p>

<p>As for her to pardon herself: &#39;...lost track of time.&#39; &#39;wouldn&#39;t that be something.&#39;</p>

<p>So while your criticism of your friend&#39;s theory is valid, those would be my doubts about it. Essentially, you are voicing an emerging trend/theme: she is untouchable for reasons x,y,z (it actually doesn&#39;t matter <em>why</em>; it <em>is</em> what it <em>is</em></p>

<p>Your second point is one that I don&#39;t buy -- for whatever reason. Was he, in fact, the decision-maker regarding a prosecution? He had the power to yea or nay it? If so, that&#39;s interesting, especially re: Bureau &#39;hating&#39; the candidate.</p>

<p>Didn&#39;t they get a big awful black eye during the incident at the compound in 1993?</p>

<p>I&#39;d be more in line to think that the Bureau doesn&#39;t like her for some pedestrian, simple reason that only she would know about. For example -- I&#39;m speculating, just so we&#39;re clear -- the Bureau could have been sent on a wild goose chase regarding some recent events and they discovered they wasted years of resources and time investigating a bogus ________ , when the PTB knew all along. That I could see Bureau-wide and long-lasting. I imagine they got a taste of what we low income people and workers have known for a long time:</p>

<p>Be careful that you don&#39;t do your job so well that you bring attention to yourself, because the Owners often do not like it, even when you achieved the attention by doing what you were told. We live in a time where if you are literal, you will disrupt some figurative plan from people YOU WILL NEVER KNOW, IN ROOMS YOU&#39;VE NEVER BEEN.</p>

<p>Yes. His theory is that the FBI didn&#39;t push for prosecution because she&#39;d have been convicted and Obama would have pardoned her. He believes that, because the FBI allegedly can&#39;t stand her, that the FBI has pulled the ultimate con in that they are waiting for her to be elected because a president can&#39;t pardon themselves. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, if she were convicted, isn&#39;t it possible that would be after the election anyway?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If there was a prosecution or a trial of any sort, it&#39;s highly unlikely she&#39;d have won the democratic nomination at all. Remember, all this happened before Bernie pulled the old tried and true establishment rabbit outta the hat trick on his Bernouts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Was he, in fact, the decision-maker regarding a prosecution?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He had the power to yea or nay it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. He only had the power to suggest the Justice Department move to prosecute. The FBI, JD, and the Clinton machine as well as the Whitehouse and Obama administration as well as the media all worked hand in hand to get her out of this mess because everyone had so much to lose should he have made the suggestion that the Justice Department move to prosecute. He wouldn&#39;t force their hand, because his hand was forced not to. They&#39;re all bedfellows.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Didn&#39;t they get a big awful black eye during the incident at the compound in 1993?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. So? That was completely different. The FBI is the scapegoat in this case as it has been in the past. FBI director Comey is lifelong friends with the Clintons and like so many others under the Clinton thumb, was willing to look like a complete fucking fool to keep the game alive.</p>

<p>The PCG has no allegiance but to themselves. Our whole entire God forsaken world is a lie. If the lie is brought to light, the whole entire God forsaken world will come crashing down like building 7. Shit rolls downhill.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The President can pardon any person or group of persons for a criminal act at any time following the act, regardless of whether charges had been filed or convictions found. This has been done in the past, notably with Carter preemptively pardoning the Vietnam draft dodgers. In this case though, pardoning her before charges were filed would make her look guilty as sin. </p>

<p>State Department is a public office, and as SoS, she would be considered a public officer, so it&#39;s not just court documents. On the other hand, I&#39;m not sure on the specifics of what it would mean for a paper or document to be &quot;filed&quot; with such an office, so I don&#39;t know whether the emails which are available would qualify, or whether this statute applies to <em>copies</em> of the documents in addition to the documents themselves. </p>
