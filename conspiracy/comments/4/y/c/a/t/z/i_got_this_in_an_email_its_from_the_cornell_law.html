       Interesting read! Wonder how many people are aware. Word for word from the Cornell Law Library - 
RE: H. Clinton
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently, the FBI forgot to visit the Cornell Law Library. Word for word from the Cornell Law Library Former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey tells MSNBC that not only is Hillary Clinton's private email server illegal, it "disqualifies" her from holding any federal office. Very specifically points to one federal law, Title 18. Section 2071.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says: 
“(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.
(b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term “office” does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.”
Yes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States."
Shouldn't voters know that? The media won't tell them. So it's up to us.

       it says "willfully" and Hillary's entire defense is that she did not do this "willfully", that it was unintentional, of course, she's not going to admit that she did it willfully, but it's pretty obvious she did

       I super agree with your comment about what she says, but considering it was illegal to have a private server for State business, and she conspired with and paid others to set it up and then used it, how does one reasonably make the argument that removal from authorized systems wasn't intentional?

       Ignorance of the law is not a defense. That's why the average person can be changed of something without even knowing such law exists. It's also why all laws are made available to the public so that they can know the law and not break it. Because everyone has free time to read all 40,000 pages of the tax code!

       You have definitely summed it up but it leaves me with a few questions. Didn't her legal team and her willingly delete "personal" emails? Were some of those emails retrieved and found to be work related and/or classified? I have been trying to keep up with it but I'm sure I've missed a few things.

       Yes, apparently standard operating procedure is now to just deny the existence of one intangible aspect of the written law. It's like the DEA just flat out denying marijuana has medical use even though everybody knows it does. Welcome to the glorious fruits of doublethink.

       She says she did not willfully send or receive any material that was marked classified at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's pretty clear she willfully transmitted material she knew was classified and did not turn over all classified material when asked, and that she caused people (server admins, any country with an Internet connection and cybersecurity agency) who were not cleared to view it the power to do so. She may not have known the specifics but she knew her server was not secure, and did not immediately hand over all materials when she found out there was classified info there. There had to be subpoenas.
      </p>
      <p>
       She just focuses on the "willfulness" of a specific act and then broadens that to become a defense of all subsequent acts.

       That's why her defense is bogus, and why many prosecutors cannot understand how she could get away with such a lame answer. The truth is, she basically said "yeah I did it, so what?" She's just untouchable.

       Word for word from the Cornell Law Library - RE: H. Clinton

       Word for word from the Cornell Law Library
      </p>
      <p>
       Former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey tells MSNBC that not only is Hillary Clinton's private email server illegal, it "disqualifies" her from holding any federal office. Very specifically points to one federal law, Title 18. Section 2071. For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.
      </p>
      <p>
       (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term “office” does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.” Yes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States." Shouldn't voters know that? The media won't tell them. So it's up to us.

       I've got a buddy that thinks the fbi didn't suggest prosecutory methods because Obama would simply pardon her and she'd win the presidency anyway. His idea is that the fbi can't stand her, and is waiting for her to win the election before they bring up charges.
      </p>
      <p>
       This theory falls flat on three levels. First, after winning the presidency she could simply claim executive privilege due to national security and for all intents and purposes pardon herself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, it's my understanding that the fbi director that recommended no prosecutory measures be taken was a fucking attorney for the Clinton's during
       <del>
        Watergate
       </del>
       Whitewater...
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, the fbi isn't going to drag the country through the mud no matter what. Billy Bud comes to mind...

       This is interesting for a couple of reasons. And I submit these questions:
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's assume your friend's theory is correct. Obama will pardon her, she'd be 'elected' anyway. What are the parameters of presidential pardons? Meaning, doesn't someone have to be convicted to be pardoned or simply charged with a crime?
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if she were convicted, isn't it possible that would be after the election anyway?
      </p>
      <p>
       As for her to pardon herself: '...lost track of time.' 'wouldn't that be something.'
      </p>
      <p>
       So while your criticism of your friend's theory is valid, those would be my doubts about it. Essentially, you are voicing an emerging trend/theme: she is untouchable for reasons x,y,z (it actually doesn't matter
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       ; it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       what it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Your second point is one that I don't buy -- for whatever reason. Was he, in fact, the decision-maker regarding a prosecution? He had the power to yea or nay it? If so, that's interesting, especially re: Bureau 'hating' the candidate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Didn't they get a big awful black eye during the incident at the compound in 1993?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd be more in line to think that the Bureau doesn't like her for some pedestrian, simple reason that only she would know about. For example -- I'm speculating, just so we're clear -- the Bureau could have been sent on a wild goose chase regarding some recent events and they discovered they wasted years of resources and time investigating a bogus ________ , when the PTB knew all along. That I could see Bureau-wide and long-lasting. I imagine they got a taste of what we low income people and workers have known for a long time:

       Be careful that you don't do your job so well that you bring attention to yourself, because the Owners often do not like it, even when you achieved the attention by doing what you were told. We live in a time where if you are literal, you will disrupt some figurative plan from people YOU WILL NEVER KNOW, IN ROOMS YOU'VE NEVER BEEN.

       Yes. His theory is that the FBI didn't push for prosecution because she'd have been convicted and Obama would have pardoned her. He believes that, because the FBI allegedly can't stand her, that the FBI has pulled the ultimate con in that they are waiting for her to be elected because a president can't pardon themselves.

      <p>
       If there was a prosecution or a trial of any sort, it's highly unlikely she'd have won the democratic nomination at all. Remember, all this happened before Bernie pulled the old tried and true establishment rabbit outta the hat trick on his Bernouts.

       No. He only had the power to suggest the Justice Department move to prosecute. The FBI, JD, and the Clinton machine as well as the Whitehouse and Obama administration as well as the media all worked hand in hand to get her out of this mess because everyone had so much to lose should he have made the suggestion that the Justice Department move to prosecute. He wouldn't force their hand, because his hand was forced not to. They're all bedfellows.

      <p>
       Yes. So? That was completely different. The FBI is the scapegoat in this case as it has been in the past. FBI director Comey is lifelong friends with the Clintons and like so many others under the Clinton thumb, was willing to look like a complete fucking fool to keep the game alive.

       The President can pardon any person or group of persons for a criminal act at any time following the act, regardless of whether charges had been filed or convictions found. This has been done in the past, notably with Carter preemptively pardoning the Vietnam draft dodgers. In this case though, pardoning her before charges were filed would make her look guilty as sin.

       She paid a law firm to go through all of her emails and sort out what was work and what was personal.
      </p>
      <p>
       They turned over all the work and destroyed the personals. But the investigation shows that she (her lawyers) didn't turn over all of the government work emails like she said. In fact some that were very clearly government emails were not turned over. Some of the earlier ones shown her asking about setting up their own system. A new one shows her aide actually logging in and sending information from Clinton's account.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though she outsourced the filtering if her emails, she signed a declaration that all of them were turned over under penalty of perjury. With all of the FOI lawsuits and requests it has shown the public that she lied. Some have had their release pushed back till after the election or in some cases a day that doesn't exist (November 31st).
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI investigation also said that they recovered emails that contained classified information, some of which they weren't allowed to look at. They had to bring in people with the right levels of access to document it. Now go back to the start, she paid an outside law firm to sort through this stuff. FBI agents weren't allowed to see this stuff but she paid civilian lawyers that did.

       This clearly refers to court documents. I'm curious to know which court documents are involved here and how their existence in the emails was established.

       State Department is a public office, and as SoS, she would be considered a public officer, so it's not just court documents. On the other hand, I'm not sure on the specifics of what it would mean for a paper or document to be "filed" with such an office, so I don't know whether the emails which are available would qualify, or whether this statute applies to
       <em>
        copies

       of the documents in addition to the documents themselves.

       That's precisely what this is referring to. Reading it the way some people want to would mean that the government clerk who deletes a spam Viagra email (that would be a file that's "deposited" in a government office) would be guilty as well. That is definitely not the intention of the law, and a clear misreading.
      </p>
      <p>
       A more appropriate provision, would be obstruction of justice for destroying evidence.
