    <div class="md"><p>It has very little to do with Nazism and a lot to do with world history.  Italy was the first european country to be colonized by Judaism. The Medici family were Jews.  The renaissance era of Italy was characterized by the rise of Jewish fiance and global trade companies.  Shakespeare wrote about it in the late 1500s in his play The Merchant of Venice.  There&#39;s a good argument that Shakespeare, who was Catholic, was really an amalgam of Jesuit spies leveraging popular theater for political power in England during a period when the British royals were struggling for power against Catholicism.  These Shakespearean authors were possibly Jewish converts to Catholicism called the Marranos.  Google that word.  Jews were forced to convert to Catholicism, and not only did they, but they also changed their names to reflect native Italian identity.  That was the best thing that ever happened to Judaism from the standpoint of evolutionary adaptation.  Furthermore the Marrano Jews had an extremely heavy influence on Catholicism.  Some of the Popes were converted Jews.  Most of the early Catholic saints  were Jews.  And of course Christianity itself is a cult totally obsessed with Judaism and worship of the Jewish god.  All of these factors had an enormous cultural impact on Italy initially, and secondarily on the rest of Europe.  All of this had a determining factor on your own cultural biases.  How did your ancestors reject their native culture and take up worship of a foreign Jewish god, becoming obsessed with Jewish culture and fictional Jewish history?  Isn&#39;t that odd?  How was Europe conquered by Judaism? What inspired Martin Luther&#39;s reformation against Catholicism?  Why was he so hateful to Jews?  Why did a British Secret Service officer write <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/sro/pc/index.htm">Proofs of a Conspiracy Against all the Religions and Governments of Europe</a> about the Illuminati in 1793?  You can read it, it&#39;s a real book by a real person concerning real history.  All of this precedes Nazism by hundreds of years.</p>

<p>Ask yourself why Nazism was ever a thing at all.  What caused it?  Look into these questions.  Always remain curious.  The real issue here isn&#39;t about race or ethnicity, but about culture.  Ask yourself what specific human behaviors differentiate one culture from another.  Focus your attention on this issue.  I have Jewish ancestors and I give you permission to express personal skepticism about Judaism.  I won&#39;t call you a Nazi for doing this.  I wish you have sovereignty over your mind.  Live long and prosper. </p>

<p>Ooh! Italy storytime!</p>

<p>Jewish well poisoning is well documented. One case in particular has many stories behind it that have been told by old townspeople to youth for generations. After the Black Plague had almost run its course in Italy, jews weren’t happy that Italians weren’t taking loans to pay for doctors anymore, so they started poisoning wells. But they didn’t know that medicine was advanced enough to detect water poisoning, so eventually the goyim knew.</p>

<p>One night, the townsfolk hid near the city well, and in a while a jew showed up with a torch in one hand and a bottle in the other. As he was about to pour it in the well, the people came forward and confronted him. The jew said “it’s just lavender to make the stench of the dead go away.” The people responded, “Well, then you shouldn’t have any problem pouring some on yourself.” The jew panicked and refused, a little fight started, and eventually the people sprayed him with the “lavender.” The liquid hit the torch and caught fire on the jew’s clothes so he dived into the well to his death.</p>

<p>And that’s how the Italians decided to burn 30,000 jews alive along with entire ghetto in one night. </p>

<p>Something similar happened in France around the same time. A few years ago, a neofascist raided the remains of the jewish community in Italy (20,000 or so people), spraying lavender on the walls, especially those of the synagogue. Some complained, but no one really cared; after all, perfume is not vandalism or persecution. But people of the city say the jews roaming the perfumed streets had that expression you have when you are reminded about something very bad you did and thought that everyone had forgotten about it.</p>

<p>It’s these little stories that give you that wake up call. Of course, in the media they are labeled “antisemitic lies,” but everyone knows that people who lived in nations several thousands of miles away from each other in medieval times didn’t magically make up the same stories.</p>

<p>Jews were forced to convert to Catholicism, and not only did they</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/IE1UaZ4.jpg">They didn’t, though.</a> Translation: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In La Silva Curiosa de Italian de me, printed in Paris in 1608, on pages 156-7, it states: (1)</p>

<p>In 1492, Chemor, Chief Rabbi of Spain, wrote to the Grand Sanhedrin, which had its seat in Constantinople, for advice when a Spanish law threatened expulsion. This was the reply:</p>

<p>“Beloved brethren in Moses, we have received your letter in which you tell us of the anxieties and misfortunes which you are enduring. We are pierced by as great pain to hear it as yourselves. The advice of the Grand Satraps and the Rabbis is the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>As for what you say that the King of Spain obliges you to become Christians: do it, since you cannot do otherwise.</li>
<li>As for what you say about the command to despoil you of your property: make your sons merchants that they may despoil, little by little, the Christians of theirs.</li>
<li>As for what you say about making attempts on your lives: make your sons doctors and apothecaries, that they may take away Christians’ lives.</li>
<li>As for what you say of their destroying your synagogues: make your sons canons and clerics in order that they may destroy their churches.</li>
<li>As for the other vexations you complain of: arrange that your sons become advocates and lawyers, and see that they always mix in affairs of state, that by putting Christians under your yoke you may dominate the world and be avenged on them.</li>
<li>Do not swerve from this order that we give you, because you will find by experience that, humiliated as you are, you will reach the actuality of power.</li>
</ol>

<p>Prince of the Jews of Constantinople.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jews do not create. They only destroy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but they also changed their names to reflect native Italian identity. That was the best thing that ever happened to Judaism from the standpoint of evolutionary adaptation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the worst for everyone else.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And of course Christianity itself is a cult totally obsessed with Judaism and worship of the Jewish god.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Completely and utterly false. No one with any knowledge of Christianity would say that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Isn’t that odd?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, because you’re just making up shit. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What inspired Martin Luther&#39;s reformation against Catholicism? Why was he so hateful to Jews?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the Bible says to be.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The real issue here isn’t about race or ethnicity, but about culture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And so culture magically exists in a vacuum? RACES. CREATE. CULTURE. CULTURE IS THE PRODUCT OF RACIAL BEHAVIOR.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wish you have sovereignty over your mind. Live long and prosper.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Blah blah first sentence and then you throw out the jewish canard, so forgive me if, on top of the rest of your lies, I trust you less far than I would like to throw you.</p>
