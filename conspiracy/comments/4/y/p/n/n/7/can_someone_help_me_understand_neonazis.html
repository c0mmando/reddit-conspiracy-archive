       I got into a discussion with a girl on twitter, who calls herself a National Socialist. Though the natural implications of National Socialism seem to run on superiority. I have two Jewish friends who she called scum, saying she's been bullied by Jews all her life, and as I asked about it she referred me to 'The Story Never Told' which is a documentary about Adolf Hitler. But as a German, living in Germany, I find it quite offensive that she thinks the Holocaust never happened. My country has spent years rebuilding what was destroyed and it breaks my heart to see, I know older member of society who are still ashamed of what happened. I do not want to cause drama, I am just curious and need help to understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       She seems to get all of her facts from ONE documentary, which has sources I still have yet to research.
      </p>
      <p>
       She also stated that she went to a Holocaust Museum in Isreal and she was given dirty looks. Which I believe is an unfair assessment because we can never really know what goes through someones mind, though I don't want to fully discredit her because she may be telling the truth, however I do not like how she is claiming to be a victim of a History that doesn't really have anything to do with her since she is an American.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, so in a context of today's day and age, what does it mean to be National Socialist?

       The worst actions from men are guided by fear. Neo Nazis actions of hate are more driven by fear then anything else. When you become part of a culture of fear you mark yourself for self extinction. It's a natural process per se if not necessary to have them and know it. Little by little you see their decline.

       Since nobody answered your question adequately,
      </p>
      <p>
       "Neo nazis" are white national socialists who particularly look up to Hitler as a leader and they believe he was fighting for his people. While I am neither a national socialist nor fully white I have found with research that Hitler was actually an amazing person on many levels. The reason he has been demonized and the holocaust hoax thrown over his icon is that he banned usury from Germany and their economy flourished. Usury is a Jewish tradition of charging interest on loans and the world banking cabal is indeed run by Jews so they made sure the world would not follow his example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Holocaust can be disproven by a 5 year old, but here is a thread I made giving a very basic run down:

        http://www.wildheretic.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=329
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Pay particular attention to the official Red Cross death toll for labor camps that had to be litigated out of them back in 1977 since it proves the holocaust was a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       In conclusion, the Neo nazis aren't bad people like people make them out to be, and even the KKK originally fought for black rights in the mid 1800s.

       Let's pretend I believe what you've written here. The big question for me is why? Why go to the extremes of lying about the murder of 6 million people? That's an outstanding lie to have to try to justify and prove. And for what reason?
      </p>
      <p>
       Big, Jewish, global banking wants to keep its hooks in planet earth and keep us paying interest on loans. There's our apparent motive. So they
       <em>
        lie
       </em>
       about the murder of six million Jews to protect it?
      </p>
      <p>
       The world was at war with Germany for their aggression, not genocide. Genocide apparently only came to light as the Russians uncovered death camps at the end of the war. So to claim that Zionists made up a murder of six million people to justify fighting Hitler is counter to the time line. We were already at war with Hitler, then we found out about the death camps. The lie could have been about anything far more probable, i.e Hitler had nukes. That would be much easier to fabricate. Hell, the Allies could have even placed one in Germany, post-war, and justified everything that way, yet they chose 6 million bodies to lie about?
      </p>
      <p>
       And six million Jews? Six. Million. Why not 1,000 or 10,000? That would be enough to justify the same conspiratorial end and be a lot easier to fabricate. Six million seems a little extreme to lie about and as your write-up shows, nearly impossible to prove.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "Okay we're going to pretend 6 million people died here."
"But Sir, the best the death camps could hypothetically manage in that time would be closer to 64,000. And 64,000 is still enough to prove that Hitler is a monster."
"Nope. Multiply that by 93. I want 6 million on record. We'll worry about the impossible logistics of it later."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       This just doesn't sit right with me.

       You ask the question almost as though you know the answer and are prodding others along to think critically. But the key word is "almost".
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer is crystal clear: it's written in the Torah that six million Jews must vanish before the state of Israel can be formed. They've been writing about 6 million Jews dying in a "holocaust" since the late 1800's. It's all in the newspapers.

       Yes.  If America is a melting pot, then we could tell any other country that any pure race country that they are wrong and go to war with them over their lack of diversity.  The United States of Diversity then would be a nationalist country without racism, because they'd be opposed not to any one race but all single monoraces, because they'd be against diversity.  Or if say brazil were very much about being brazilian but hated other non brazil countries (brazil is very multiracial / mixed black and hispanic, some asian)

       I'm not sure why hate has to come in to play at all. Isn't that wholly dependent upon the society? Can you be a Nationalist but still respect other races or cultures? Is a feeling of supremacy required?

       I think you should tell all three of your friends that freemasons created the nazi party to enrich the industrialist fascists around the world.  They've been a global enterprise for centuries, and you know this from the opium trade and east indian tea company.  It's pretty obvious to me now but might not be to you. That the nazi party and the world wars are run by freemasons as a means to profit by selling short humanity.  But since they managed to grab high political office and by creating america as a freemason run business, they pretty much can't be toppled.  They've exported and then perfected rome, and part of that is coordinating with friends in britian to create psyops like the nazi party.
      </p>
      <p>
       WHen you trace their roots, they go to the same places.  Aleister crowley was an occultist and british spy; and freemason, and oto; nazi party was informed by thule society, informed by theosophy and thelema (crowley), which was informed by alchemy and gnosticism from rosicrucianism.   The freemasons were subverted by illuminati people within a decade of forming america, so it's been rotten since, waging war against its citizens to reach its resource management goals.

       I wonder how she was dressed when she got diety looks.  My problem with it all is how the Jews seem ro monopolise the Holocaust,  another 5 million non Jews were killed and their voices are never as loud as the Jews.  Some schools of thought believe that the 6 million Jews figure is fabricated to fit in with a prophesy that ends with them receiving the holy land and the figure is nearer under one million.

       Mostly it means someone is a rebellious teen without two brain cells to rub together.

       Sometimes it means a retarded adult that never outgrew that stage.
