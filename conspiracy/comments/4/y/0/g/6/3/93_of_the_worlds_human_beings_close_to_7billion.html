<p>It&#39;s just that human life is not lived on a balance sheet.  93% of the world&#39;s population have for all intensive purposes no assets and no wealth.  They exist only to serve GDP growth in exchange for SURVIVAL.  Any reductions in extreme poverty (less than $2 per day) are directly offset by an increase in extreme wealth.  This is all a con that is nothing more than the exploitation of human survival.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am mentioning the percentages as a way to foster critical thinking about how wealth is distributed globally.   Probably less than 1% of the population in the entire continent of Africa make as much as $50/day.  Of course PPP is relevant in the discussion of what this money buys people around the world.  The interesting part of this is that global GDP has risen exponentially to the benefit of almost no one...The world&#39;s population simply exists to serve GDP growth so in return they can eek out basic survival.   About 76% of America lives paycheck to paycheck.  It is the same situation globally.  </p>

<p>What I can say with certainty is that the top 0.00000001% need less.  How much less is indeed a democratic question, and really a moral question about what kind of society we want to have.  I do not believe that a solution is the redistribution of wealth in the form of wage increases, helicopter money, or other stimulus.  The whole system is corrosive to liberty.  We don&#39;t need more consumers or participants.  It would just probably create catastrophic ecological problems anyways (among other problems).  What is needed is an entirely different pursuit where the public sphere and building civil society is the priority over irrational GDP growth.  The first step is a will to reduce privatization with this goal in mind.  </p>

<p>The only solution is to build civil society through investment in the public sphere.  This has consciously been eroded and co-opted by private interests for private gains in the name of GDP growth.  </p>

<p>Of course I don&#39;t have the right to dictate it.  I have the right to contribute to the question of what kind of society we want to have though.  As should you.  Rather than thinking individually, appreciate that we live in a SOCIETY.  The implications of abusive wealth are corrosive to the liberty to others by default.  Can you understand that?  I will not dictate the precise point in which it becomes abusive, but I am certain earning $100/second is abusive to other people&#39;s lives.  </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>As I said, this depends on what kind of society we want to have.  It is a moral question.  Of course to Ronald Reagan, standing in the way of privatization is a denial of individual liberty.  I disagree with this vision of society where we service GDP growth irrationally.  </p>

<p>Not at all.  I am making clear that it is democratic question, but in general the current level of inequality is abusive.
