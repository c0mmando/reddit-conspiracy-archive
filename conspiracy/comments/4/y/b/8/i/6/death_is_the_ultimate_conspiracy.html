    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Let me be the first to tell you: you don&#39;t need religion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The most accurate thing I&#39;ve seen this morning.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You need to ask the Higher Power that made you something instead of nothing to forgive you for ever doubting god&#39;s divine plan and that is it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what if they Higher Power that hears me isn&#39;t the only Higher Power? Aren&#39;t I just pissing off one while pleasing the other? How do I know that there is only a single Higher Power?</p>

<p>And why should I apologize for doubting something I&#39;ve never seen, imagined, heard, or &quot;had revealed&quot; to me? I think that&#39;s a slippery slope, albeit into a sandbox, but it could lead to apologizing for the implementation of this &quot;divine plan&quot; which I have no control or part in.</p>

<p>I have reservations about apologizing for something I can&#39;t properly define as an act. How is my inability to know a Higher Being&#39;s plans a justified cause for an apology?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have to apologize to you for missing your birthday, and for good reason. IDK when that is, or how to send you gifts. What you require amounts to apologizing to you for missing your birthday party, and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s wise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LMFAO I agreed that we have a different conclusion. No need to tell me I&#39;m wrong because I have an opinion and believe it. I do think that God is doing great with or without me and doesn&#39;t need me for a damn thing. Since you did not answer my question about why there is no need for sacrifice or prayer I will ask you another. For what reason and for what do I need to apologize for?
BTW I do not pity God I am God fearing and I repent everyday I can to Him in order to properly thank Him for everything He has done not only in my life but in the world. I am not religious or dogmatic but I do believe in the Bible, God, the Son, and the Holy Spirit but that is my choice. You can choose to believe whatever you want that is not business nor what I care about. Your response just shows me how &quot;blissful&quot; you truly are. Humility is knowing that you are just as humanly imperfect as the rest of us and treat people as such. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes... Energy can <em>not</em> be created, nor destroyed... <em>But</em> we don&#39;t &#39;live&#39; forever, our energy is transferred into the soil and air, as is how decomposition works, and we simply die. Our entire form of reality, which is perceived through our eyes, ears, nerves, etc. Is taken in by our brain and thus is &#39;translated&#39; so to speak into what we percieve. Once our physical body dies, our brain dies too, as it needs oxygen and blood to function, and post mortem our blood stagnates and we stop taking in oxygen, the stored co2 in the blood speed up the process as there&#39;s no way to exhale it after death. Since our brain at this point is considered clinically dead, our mind, and our perception on reality is also dead.
Yes our chemical makeup and subatomic makeup move on, but without sentience, it&#39;s dwad just as much as we would be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Meditation is a good start!  Find your <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9ZY40La80">Third Eye</a> and squeegee it good.</p>

<p>Picture a triangle on your forehead with the bottom 2 corners at your pupils.  At the top point is your Third Eye.  It is where your soul connects to to your brain and passes through to your perceptions.  (Yes, you are not just your body.  You are the entirety of your perceptions.)</p>

<p>First, find somewhere quiet and get comfortable.  Hardcore yogi instructors would tell you to sit in a half- or full- lotus position, but I personally recommend just being comfortable.  I like laying down on my back myself.</p>

<p>Try to clear your mind and think of nothing.  First think of the concept of nothing and then try to remove the concept.  It&#39;s not easy, you&#39;ll find yourself thinking about <em>something</em>.  Just be aware of when it happens and try again to think of Nothing.</p>

<p>If you have trouble focusing, try humming a low, quiet tone.  (Or go full-buddhist and <em>ooohhhmmm</em>.)  Focus on the vibration.  You are that vibration.  </p>

<p>You are a unique vibration in the very fabric of spacetime.  You are the result of god&#39;s Pure Love of Creation.  You are a fractal fragment of god&#39;s Love.</p>

<p>Personally, I would much rather remain an honest 99% sure than to assume an answer to the last 1%, without proof (that&#39;s what faith is). Faith is dishonest. If you don&#39;t know, just say you don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>No, not everything makes perfect logical sense to me. And I&#39;m okay with admitting that. That doesn&#39;t mean the things I fail to understand are explained by gods and demons and miracles and souls. It may just mean that I&#39;m not capable of understanding the logic of reality yet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>With respect, what if it <em>feels</em> right because it serves my interests? Are we sure that feelings tap into what&#39;s universally right, instead of what&#39;s individually preferable? Why should feeling strongly about something suffice as proof of anything. That&#39;s an epistemological qualifier known as Strongly Held Belief, whereby a person believes they can <em>know</em> something by feeling very strongly about it. I have big problems with that kind of thinking, because history has shown us that people can feel very strongly about some very harmful and messed up ideas, a well as lots of demonstrably incorrect ideas. Strong feelings should, imho, be disregarded to whatever degree posible when considering what we know and don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>I prefer the Justifiable True Belief qualifier instead, although it has its limits as well. Its not a recipe for absolute knowledge, but as far as I&#39;m aware, we don&#39;t have any of those recipes. We have Strongly Held Belief practitioners who <em>feel</em> absolutely sure of things, but they manage to feel sure without being able to provide a proof whereby anyone else can be equally convinced. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reasonable doubt is a-ok-- as long as it&#39;s reasonable!  Do not let yourself become blinded by what you&#39;ve already convinced yourself is true.  Always remember that <em>you could be wrong</em>.</p>

<p>I had to bang my head against 9/11 and Montauk Project (and far more) and see the patterns that lay underneath.  The WTC towers were destabilized on a molecular level and the hurricane that accompanied the attacks could not have been controlled by mortal hands.  I had to look at the technology that was at play and honestly ask myself who or what could have access to such things.  I was stuck on <em>aliens</em> for a good while until I realized that they were just the final false-flag themselves.</p>

<p>And as much as I&#39;d love to take everyone by the hand and lead them down my same path, we do not have that time.  All I can do is tell you it&#39;s time to find the Truth you&#39;ve known was missing your entire life.  (Spoiler: it&#39;s all in the bible waiting for us to notice, but even that has been polluted with lies.)</p>

<p>I can&#39;t have faith in a complete unknown, and I wouldn&#39;t consider it wise to make presumptions on what that unknown would be.</p>

<p>Your God claims Love and Compassion, but also justifies genocide. Where was compassion when Herod was struck down by an &quot;angel of the lord?&quot; Where was love when David and Bathsheba&#39;s child was killed by your God? Where was compassion for the Ammorites, Jeroboam, or anyone on the &quot;hit list&quot; in Numbers?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>bad press</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, &quot;killing most of the global population with a flood&quot; can lead to bad press. Wiping out &quot;1000 - 2000 people for perceived sins&quot; would lead to bad press. Killing all the &quot;firstborn of Egypt&quot; for &quot;persecuting the Hebrew people and enslaving them,&quot; while proven to be factually baseless, would still generate some bad press.</p>

<p>Maybe Jahweh gets bad press because he wiped out the Ammorites? Maybe it was because he killed all competitors to the religions of Abraham (Hi Korah)</p>

<p>Maybe you should read Job again. You know the one, where &quot;God&quot; is goaded into a &quot;bet&quot; with Satan himself... Yeah... the almight all powerful has to &quot;prove a point&quot; to Satan about his &quot;righteous follower&quot; by fucking up his entire life. What kind of God would ruin the lives of his followers, to prove a point to a known enemy that you will personally cast into a fiery abyss. Makes absolutely no sense for a God to do such a thing. Sounds like the behavior of a human being, to me...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>god&#39;s not so bad once you get to know &#39;him&#39;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, and then you accidentally get your burnt offering slightly wrong and God &quot;rewards you&quot; by killing your children with fire from above. That&#39;s probably the fire of love.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You ever been in love?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve been beyond, &quot;in love.&quot; I&#39;ve been to the furthest reaches of the minds ability to experience love. I have felt unconditional love for the entire world, if only for a brief moment. I found that on my own, without guidance by a god, or his representatives, in any form.</p>

<p>God didn&#39;t make anything for anyone. God sneaks in to claim the work of other&#39;s as his own. God punishes you for not praising him for doing nothing. God fears us. It&#39;s in the Bible, and his actions amount to one thing. Fear.</p>

<p>The God of the Bible is the God of Fear and Hatred. The God of love is nowhere to be found, between little children throwing tantrums in synagogues they don&#39;t belong in, to them actively cursing their father&#39;s own creation, the Bible is full of fear mongering, hatred, and lies.</p>
