So it&#39;s not just the dinosaurs, it&#39;s any organic material that has been under extreme pressure and heat for millions of years. It&#39;s actually mostly ancient plant material.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A professor of mine once a likened it to the process of composting. But on a massive scale and extremely long timeline. Plant life dies, falls, more plants grow, die, fall, and pile on top, plus any other organic materials. Then you have millions of years worth of tectonic activity, calcification and fossilization burying it deeper and deeper. Pressure and heat at those depth does amazing things like turn carbon deposits into diamonds and in some case creates a highly flammable soup of hydrocarbons we call oil. </p>

<p>also the surface of titan is -179 degrees C. at that temperature, the hydrocarbons that we utilize would be solid - the freezing point for the majority of the compounds found in crude oil would be frozen at or before -100 C, and everything found in &quot;our&quot; oil would be frozen at -160 C. so there are no lakes of oil waiting to be pumped off the surface and refined in space to fuel our cars and trucks on earth..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder about the nukes hoax. I will say: Years ago, I knew a woman in Hawaii who taught all these kids from the Bikini Islands who were born retarded and mutated. IQs in the 60s. They said it was from all the nuke testing, the kids were brought to the US and housed and taken care of here. </p>

<p>So this is a tale once removed, but I did know this person and that was her job. I never met the kids, I never went to her school, but she was a friend and credible and no reason to make it up. </p>

<p>I would love to believe nuclear bombs aren&#39;t real. But I don&#39;t. </p>

<p>yet there are little trees and twigs kicking it. They looked like they were burned. </p>

<p>here is Tokyo, a few weeks earlier, firebombed.

<p>They look very similar to me. Also, ever wonder why the two cities targeted were basically made out of <a href="http://cdn.home-designing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/shoji-room-divider-600x399.jpeg">paper</a>? lol, i mean, big bad evil hitler was in Germany.

    <div class="md"><p>Well....many say race had a lot to do with why we bombed Japan and not Germany. Also, if they were concerned about radiation, the people in France and other European countries would&#39;ve likely suffered from a bomb dropped on Germany. </p>

<p>That said, it&#39;s interesting that those two houses are standing in the first picture when everything else is decimated. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not scared of a suitcase, though. It&#39;s waaaay too heavy to carry, for one thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, it might be race related or the fact that it was built by brick and steel. Interestingly enough Hiroshima and Nagasaki are huge bustling cities now and they started to rebuild the day after they were burned.  So much for radiation fall out.

    <div class="md"><p>Oil comes almost solely from microbial sea life. Mainly algae. The algae live in concentrated areas that are favorable. So they live, reproduce, and die en mass I those areas. This covers the sea floor with the dead algae, which over time becomes burried and eventually turns into oil. The funny part is, the energy released when you drive down the road is ancient sunlight. At least that&#39;s the conventional knowledge. Algae = car go vroom vroom. I&#39;m surprised so many people answered this without knowing that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will explain it to you, as my science teacher explained it to me - however this was back in 1995 so I&#39;m reaching WAY back into my head to do so - nothing I say is legit, just a memory:</p>

<p>First, you have to remember that dinosaurs weren&#39;t the only thing that turned to oil. Everything that died and ended up under billions of years of rock also turned to oil. Thousand types of living things over thousands of years covered by a thousand types of living things over thousands of years covered over and over. Time, heat, pressure - boom oil. We actually have a very small concept of not only the concept of time frames but also how much life we haven&#39;t been able to find because of those thousands of centuries. It&#39;s this &quot;ignorance&quot; that means there&#39;s untapped oil reserves in plenty of places that would allow us to live easily for centuries on oil alone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have absolutely no proof this is fact, just spouting off with antiquated rederick from the past. Whenever I hear this stuff I can just see TPTB laughing behind our backs how gullible people are, paid off scientists woking with these criminals just to collect a check, pathetic.</p>

<p>EDIT:
 Finally found it. Did Titan have have dinosaurs?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve heard that meme as well, but here.. check this:</p>

<p>Hiroshima ground zero. atomized

<p>yet there are little trees and twigs kicking it. They looked like they were burned. </p>

<p>here is Tokyo, a few weeks earlier, firebombed.

<p>They look very similar to me. Also, ever wonder why the two cities targeted were basically made out of <a href="http://cdn.home-designing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/shoji-room-divider-600x399.jpeg">paper</a>? lol, i mean, big bad evil hitler was in Germany. Why not drop one in Germany specially when the distances are pretty much the same.  My days of being scared of a suitcase are over. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well....many say race had a lot to do with why we bombed Japan and not Germany. Also, if they were concerned about radiation, the people in France and other European countries would&#39;ve likely suffered from a bomb dropped on Germany. </p>

<p>That said, it&#39;s interesting that those two houses are standing in the first picture when everything else is decimated. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not scared of a suitcase, though. It&#39;s waaaay too heavy to carry, for one thing. </p>

<p>Thanks for your comment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The easiest way to shut down that ridiculous concept of fake nukes is to ask the person to explain the spontaneous creation of radioactive particles detected in the atmosphere after the first tests. Particles that had never been seen before or detected on planet earth suddenly existed.</p>
