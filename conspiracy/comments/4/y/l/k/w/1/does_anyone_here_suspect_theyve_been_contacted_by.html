<p>He&#39;s come out w/so much information that I don&#39;t think it&#39;s very credible for too many people to simply claim he&#39;s just a hoaxer or a charlatan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks! :) </p>

<p>I do. He&#39;s a very smart man and very passionate about what he believes. I do not think he is a hoaxer, although there is no way to be sure he&#39;s correct about everything he claims. I have conversed with him about things he&#39;s never made public &amp; he is very knowledgeable and his story is fascinating. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He’s <em>extremely</em> smart.  Anyone who listens to him for a bit will be able to understand that.  I’ve visited one of the locations where he said he jumped to Mars from - the elevator inside a corporate building in El Segundo.  Though I didn’t know what I expected to find other than “an elevator inside a corporate building in El Segundo”, and although that is exactly what I very much did find and nothing else, it was actually a fascinating voyage to the location nonetheless.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there is no way to be sure he&#39;s correct about everything he claims.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marine Captain Randy Cramer, Laura Eisenhower (great granddaughter of president Dwight D. Eisenhower), Bernard Mendez, and various other people have all come out and independently corroborated Andrew&#39;s core claims, however.  This goes quite a long ways toward indicating that there is significant validity in what he&#39;s stated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I know he&#39;s been corroborated. I definitely believe there&#39;s something to Pegasus &amp; Montauk, and I don&#39;t doubt Andy&#39;s involvement.  I also know he&#39;s been put through a lot personally as a direct result of being honest. </p>

<p>I just mean, as long as there&#39;s no official disclosure, what the subjects remember could be altered. The elevator is an excellent example of that. It&#39;s just an elevator, but what they experienced wasn&#39;t. So who&#39;s to say they were ever even in the place they thought they were? </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I also know he&#39;s been put through a lot personally as a direct result of being honest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly.  This is a very, <em>very</em> rough planet we live in.  The elite have indoctrinated the masses to the extent that often we follow those leading us down the wrong path and kill those trying to free us.  Very much reminds me of <a href="http://i.quoteaddicts.com/media/q5/602514.png">this quote by H. L. Mencken.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>as long as there&#39;s no official disclosure, what the subjects remember could be altered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Making disclosure “official” will not prevent the information from being altered, however.  It’s not like the same nefarious forces at work now will somehow go away.  They may start working even harder then to confuse the truth that’s been released.  The key is for individuals to do <em>personal work</em>; to make sure and be critical thinkers so that they understand what’s going on regardless of who or what supposed “official source” tries to tell them what is and isn’t the truth one way or the other.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The elevator is an excellent example of that. It&#39;s just an elevator, but what they experienced wasn&#39;t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  Correct.  It was “just” an elevator.  Definitely.  What they experienced was definitely <em>not</em> ordinary, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So who&#39;s to say they were ever even in the place they thought they were?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, it’s like Descarte stated in his “Cogito, ergo sum/I think, therefore I am.” quote in the sense that Basiago and others like him know that they experienced <em>something</em>…over and over and over again - and it seems they were awake, aware, and cognizant enough times during their experiences that they could discern whether what was happening was merely some sort of strange dream state or an actual, awake, conscious experience.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe Basiago, but even he knows there&#39;s a lot of weirdness in all of this &amp; often things are not what they seem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh most <em>definitely</em>.  Could not agree more.  Definitely “high strangeness” involved in all of this.  The point is that something weird, “out there”, and <em>a lot</em> stranger than what we are being told is most definitely happening.</p>

<p>Even if we don’t know every single detail of every specific thing going on, the fact is that we KNOW definitively that we are being greatly lied to by TPTB over so many things about this world.</p>

<p>And these very same “authorities” that do little more than lie and lie to us are the same sources we’re going to trust if they come out w/disclosure?  I don’t think so.  It’s a tough situation because so many people are waiting for some sort of “official disclosure” when the real question is “Why on Earth would you trust ‘official sources’ when these same sources have been proven throughout history to be in the business of <em>lying</em> to the public?”</p>

<p>The best source you can trust is your own personal experience - not what some “official, state-sanctioned source” tells you.  It’s tough for those who either haven’t had personal experiences or don’t have sufficiently good cognitive thinking skills to put two and two together and inductively reason their way toward what the truth really/likely is.</p>

<p>Yeah.  Definitely a tough world…</p>

<p>Thanks for the response.  Cheers,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and they told me this: Clean up your act. Manifest good. Why? Because you&#39;re not going to die. The greatest fear is not death but being locked up in your consciousness for an eternity. If you did no good in life, you will not be included in society. You will be stood in an impenetrable phone booth sized prison with a slot overlooking an airless moon with absolutely no chance of seeing anything change or any kind of contact FOREVER. You can&#39;t even lie down. </p>

<p>Alternatively, you walk down a tunnel that gets narrower until you can&#39;t turn around, forever. You won&#39;t need food. You will only have your memories, crystal clear memories of the harms and hurts you caused during your life, and the cascading effects thereof from each victims perspective. You won&#39;t think you&#39;re so clever then. No appeal. No change. No death. No off switch. Not even a guard. </p>

<p>You will hear the songs you blared into your ears as you ignored life, kindness, compassion. Those songs will not be comforting or distracting, especially when you can&#39;t turn them off after a trillion repetitions. You see, by then, you will have made your bed, too late to go back, no sleep, food, water, scenery, take backs, belated apologies, and nobody to explain it to, no appeal, no authority.</p>

<p>You are recording <strong>now</strong>, this minute the eternal distortions in the energy field that can neither be created nor destroyed or, unfortunatly, modified once you feel the sting of the loss of this physical manifestation, this existence, a gift, a gift of choice between good and evil. In the end you get what you deserve.</p>
