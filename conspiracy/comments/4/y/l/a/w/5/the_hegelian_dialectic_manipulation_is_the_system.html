       Christian philosophy in terms of Eastern Orthodoxy has various theories/Premises that there are universal morals/ethics that exist in the Soul and that Christianity is a system used to access the Soul.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this soul exists, then I agree it doesn't belong to any form of religion. However access to it is debatable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many Native philosophies say the true morals exist in the heart, but Western culture is all head based.....head vs heart.

       I mean yeah its that, but its sooooo much more. WTF is human nature and why is it the way it is?
      </p>
      <p>
       We can have on one hand brilliant geniuses that can single handedly create programs to solve most world issues, give us eventual free energy (or solar with high end batteries) and get rather close to a Utopian Society.
      </p>
      <p>
       And on the other hand we have Ignorance, ISIS, Islam, Religions in general and the fundamentally retarded fundamentalists that come out of these systems and divide, kill, ruin all the good things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its human nature that is fucked ultimately I'd say.

       This is really cool. I'm a philosophy major and two of the most interesting philosophers I've come across is Hegel and Kierkegaard. People should take a look at the Hegelian synthesis, Hegel relationship between morality and the state, and Kierkegaard's teleological suspension of the ethical. 
When you really step back and think about it, especially today and with the media fuelling extreme opinions, there is a synthesis going on in culture that is used to change morality and perceptions. Hegel viewed morality in a state of progress (how many times have you heard the "it's 2016 so X shouldn't happen" argument?) Kierkegaard argued against Hegel's system, believing that people could transcend morality (a concept tied to culture in his time) through faith. Whether your religious or not, there are some interesting and deep thoughts split between these two thinkers that are deeply relevant for today.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't pretend to know them completely, but this man was right to point out the Hegelian dialectic. Now we need more people thinking about Kierkegaard!

       Keep in mind, that what the hegelian dielectic means is that the 'ends justify the means'.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why you make the end your aim, and then manufacture the means to that end by manufacturing a problem started by you and resolved by you.

       They also bank of the fact that we're too stupid to actually figure any of it out. With all the recent leaks, it proves that people only spout the information reported to them, rather than do their own research and make individual conclusions. Who knows, there could not even be any hackers, and this could just be a test to see how we respond and how that response is affected by external response (news)

       I worked for a weather reporting company about 10 years ago, give or take.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a trend there that the real meteorologists were being taken off of the live on-air bits, and younger, prettier people were being hired (broadcasters as opposed to meteorologists).
      </p>
      <p>
       I noticed this trend in TV media, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, it's only fitting that our reporters are dumb teleprompter reading maniacs working for these insane 24-hour news channels.
