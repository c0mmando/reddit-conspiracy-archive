       Being a free thinker and having an open mind means being open to changing your perceptions and ideas based on new information. If you have a close minded audience, who does nothing but follow what their alpha says, there is no reason to hire and pay professional shills. The group will follow, adapt, and conform their beliefs to whatever they are told is right. ( see

       The reason for this is because people like you continue to perpetuate this outdated idea. Sure, the odds would be in your favor, but you're not helping anyone by publicly mocking the idea of a third party.

       Fuck I hate this "I don't wanna waste my vote" bullshit. I can't tell you how many times I've heard it now. I wish I could get all of those people that said it to me together just to say "all you fuckfaces don't want to waste your vote. You all know the bipartisan system is BS. Obviously other people share your opinion. So stop falling for their fucking trap"
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the issue with that starts with the media. The media will only give you two choices to view, so people think there are only 2 to pick from. They let the media decide who's more qualified for them.

       I have issues with all 4 of the candidates running for president, more with some then the others. My choices are 2 candidates that I know are not going to win, and 2 that have a possibility of winning that I don't like. So should I vote for a candidate that I know is not going to win or vote for the lesser of two evils? The 3rd option is to not vote at all. The reason that 2 of the candidates don't have a chance of winning is because they do not have the supporters and infrastructure to win and not the press says. I know it's hard to believe but the press tends to report on what the people want to hear because if they report on things nobody wants to hear then people will stop watching the station. Even though the majority of tv, radio, and newspapers are controlled by a small # of companies you still have more options for news then ever in history.

       I actually LOL'ed. You're telling me that the MAINSTREAM media, as a whole, covers the election fairly? That they are just covering two shitty candidates because that's what the people want?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is incredibly disappointing whenever I hear people say, "Gary Johnson? Who's that?" or "I've never even heard of Jill Stein". It isn't because they don't have the "supporters or infrastructure", it's because they are trying to compete in a game that has been rigged against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       True democracy can only be achieved through honest and fair coverage of the election from the press. Now I am genuinely asking you, do you think that the MSM coverage of this election is fair and honest?

       How was I mocking the idea of a 3rd party? All I said was the chance of one of them wining is a long shot. I sometimes gamble and pick the long shot in case they win. I would make much more money if I win with a long shot then if I pick the favorite. The biggest issue I have with a 3rd party is how much more disfunctional our government would be. Think of how things would be if the president was of one party and each house of Congress was a different one.

       Hillary and Trump are on same team. If Trump was serious he would take voter fraud serious. Instead he suggests "poll watchers" when everyone knows the vote is hacked digitally.

       They are also cousins from the same royal bloodline. 19th cousins but cousins none the less.

       Is this one of those things though where it's so far back almost anyone with any European decent can be traced back to him, like Charlemagne, or is it really a phenomenon that's not probable without something weird going on?

       Nah, The media is out of control in an insane feeding frenzy like junior detectives trying to please dad. They've taken to falling over all over each other to gain recognition for the most unseemly bashing stories of Trump who I'm not emphatically "for". The enemy is the milquetoast complicity of the whole media (6 Companies), good little brownshirt assholes, perhaps "brown-stripes" because they've shit themselves. Read Matt Taibbi's "Rollingstone" article on same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since it is such complicity, itself a purposeful
       <em>
        conspiracy
       </em>
       defined literally as BREATHING TOGETHER done at the beck and call of the Hitlery campaign and the neocon masters it, indeed, belongs here in this forum.
      </p>
      <p>
       I support Trump because we need him to break the backs of the current oligopoly who have been ripping off the middle class to their demise and the total collapse, what was good about America.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd love to watch these sycophants the day AFTER a Trump victory. Frankly I don't give a shit if he's worse than Obama if that's possible. I'd love to see Trump crack some heads, install some Supreme Court judges that just MIGHT fuck up the oligarchs' long grift. If it resulted in the end of the neocon and the arrest of bankers and the gutting of the Fed, I'd count it as ultimate victory. Also send the war mongers packing and, indeed, it would make America Great Again.

       You're not listening. We need Trump to break the current system which is beyond corrupt to the core, even if he fails to do anything. Remember, Clinton brought us NAFTA and has come out FOR  TTP many times (now mumbling she doesn't support it, yeah right). This is our last chance before the long winter of discontent.

       What has he done in his life that would back up anything that he has promised? He is just another talking head in this elephant-ass hybrid mock government. The real solution won't be offered by our true rulers; thus it will not come from their tool known as the "American Government". Around my way freedom ain't free.

       I actually just got Team America, and haven't seen it yet. I was quoting Lupe Fiasco's song "Around My Way". He might have been quoting that movie though. Duality is a bitch. In the end Democrats and Republicans in our society both just want the money and power. My only trust and faith is in Jesus Christ. God bless!

       So you read what Michael Moore said. I wonder what pictures they have of him doing what? Any who, a lame duck is a president at the end of his term. He and his party have done enough harm, don't want The Hildabeast and its massive army of hillbilly thieves to expand its operations to the Whitehouse. I'm a little confused about your last sentence but corrupted elections are the hallmark of a banana republic in decline.

       I like this sub reddit, but here you cant support republicans or democrats. If trump was in an independent party, it would be edgier to vote for him. But since he is running republican there must be a conspiracy. Regardless of the fact he destroyed the "chosen" republican candidates. The reason I am voting for him is because we don't have a Bush vs Clinton.

       Trump's brain is wired to make large bucks for as little work as possible off the backs of others like most billionaires, I'm sure he'll be able to resist the wiles of Wall Street and the Banking/MIC cabal though, surely.

       Good luck. Even plato talks about natural born masters and slaves. Its a natural rhythm of the world. If you have idea for a fairer example id love to discuss it.

       I'm not sure there is a simple way out of the system we've been thrown into, certainly none of the existing political systems can address the problems of
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       people and nearly all seem designed to perpetuate the Platonic master/slave system in some way. Short of a benevolent AI removing human greed through mass extinction I think we're in for a rough ride whatever happens.

       I think removing particular incentives could fix a lot. Just simple changes like term limits. 4 year terms for senators. They get paid the average of the district they are from. Have to use obamacare. They don't get free health care for the rest of their life.

       Effectively taxing the super-rich, not heavily taxed, just actually paying a fair share on off-shored income then using that for a universal income and free healthcare and education would probably help for normal people and society at large.

       Mixed I guess, if they're financially benefitting from their fellow (ex) citizens it's fair game. If they're no longer connected to the system and only providing services to their new country expecting them to renounce citizenship to escape the tax seems a bit like saying 'you are property'. God knows where you'd draw the line though. Perhaps paying back enough tax to cover the cost of your education and accumulated benefits would be adequate.

       Personally, I believe that if you still think you can vote your self free, you haven't been paying attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two things that I've learned in all my years:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Nothing in politics happens by accident or chance.  There's way too much money and lives at stake (I'm not talking about yours or mine).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If voting really changed anything, they'd make it illegal.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Until this system collapses, those facts will remain.  Call me cynical.

       You're not listening. We need Trump to break the current system which is beyond corrupt to the core, even if he fails to do anything. Remember, Clinton brought us NAFTA and has come out FOR  TTP many times (now mumbling she doesn't support it, yeah right). This is our last chance before the long winter of discontent.

       I actually just got Team America, and haven't seen it yet. I was quoting Lupe Fiasco's song "Around My Way". He might have been quoting that movie though. Duality is a bitch. In the end Democrats and Republicans in our society both just want the money and power. My only trust and faith is in Jesus Christ. God bless!
