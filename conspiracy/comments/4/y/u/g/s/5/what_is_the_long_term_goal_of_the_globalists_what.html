<p>They already are kings, and we are already serfs.  We just choose not to call ourselves those names now, but essentially we still have those roles.  There has been a ruling class for thousands of years.</p>

<p>They never will be happy.  The ultimate manifestation of the Yin/Service to Self polarity is a black hole.  The entire reason why they need more and more and more rationalisations for superiority is because of the black hole they already have inside themselves.  They have no sense of self-worth, so they keep feeding the sense of superiority and elitism in order to try and compensate for it, but that never works...they just need more and more.  It never stops.</p>

<p>Of course not.  But our population growth is parabolic.  I&#39;m not that old, but I remember clearly Johnny Carson saying we&#39;d just passed 4 billion on earth.  Now we are nearing 8 billion.  There are only so many resources, they are finite.</p>

<p>Your first mistake is trying to look at this through a normal person&#39;s eyes.  I believe it&#39;s been proven somewhere that most oligarchs would be classified as sociopaths.  It takes that kind of personality to get where they are in most cases.  Sociopaths have no real feelings for others.  So no, they are never truly satisfied with what they have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all so messed up. </p>

<p>So could you please describe the perfect globalist utopia? </p>

<p>I really appreciate all the knowledge, this is my first real dive into the globalist agenda. I&#39;ve always understood that globalists exist and want a one world government but I never understood why. </p>

<p>One of my biggest confusions is why they would want a one world government? That means that the majority of them who are desperate and greedy for ever more power will have to submit to someone else eventually. One world government means less top dogs. Are there then divisions and internal conflicts? There must be competing globalists who think they deserve a higher spot in the hierarchy, and considering they&#39;re all sociopaths it should be an unmitigated disaster of nonstop backstabbing of each other. I&#39;m amazed so many greedy assholes can find a way to share so well.</p>

<p>If I had to speculate, It would probably be a time when they really were royalty.  That would be the golden age of Victorian times I suppose, like the Vanderbilt&#39;s etc.  Back when they would compete by building the best castles.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m fairly sure that they would prefer not to have to be so worried about the rest of us, like back in those days.  Right now, people have access to information and knowledge that the lower classes in the past were not.  In the past when a serf got uppity, he had farm implements to use as a weapon, so there&#39;s that now as well.  A Utopia for them would have fewer worries.  That&#39;s why a centralized government makes sense to them I suppose.  An ATM can be your new leader so they can be off playing polo or something.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the real issue at heart is these people never WERE royalty. They are like their black militant useful idiots who go around shouting &quot;we wuz kings&quot;. They are almost all from the merchant class, they never had the genetic disposition towards real leadership or being rulers, which is why they are never satisfied with the power they have. They fundamentally lack the genetic component necessary to let them be satisfied with what they are seeking. Their idea of nobility is a phantom, a pale imitation of what they think they want. They could kill every single person on this planet and they would never be the be what they want to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. Makes sense I guess. Although I don&#39;t see how eroding the sovereignty of their own nations help them become more powerful. It just opens themselves up to be at the whim of other elites... like if you were already the king of your own nation, why try and surrender your sovereign power to giant unions and stuff? Do they have a global hierarchy? Do they feel a sense of duty to other world leaders they see as superior?</p>

<p>Because if everyone else is running around like a chicken with its&#39; head cut off, while you are calm, coherent, and able to think clearly, who do you think is ultimately going to end up in power?</p>

<p>They use chaos as a weapon.  They use it to destroy opposition; to basically destroy everything so that they can rebuild on a clean slate, on their own terms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because they don&#39;t view their own nations as their own nations. elected officials in a republic do not have permanent power, they can not directly transfer political power to their heirs, and ultimately no matter how much money they have, if they break the wrong rules and get caught the state can take it away from them. They irrationally fear the system they themselves have created, partially because the effort they&#39;ve put in to destablize society has also destabilized themselves. The elite have the same problem the rest of us do: their own members have been exposed to their own toxic ideology for far too long and some of them actually believe in the lies they created. Remember, this system was started over a hundred years ago. The original intention of the elite was to bring the colonial breakaways back under rule of the british empire. But the british commited suicide by starting and almost losing 2 world wars. The old guard died, and were replaced by the new people who were partially raised in the contaminated environment that their forefathers had created to create slaves. The whole thing is completely fucked, which is why they have so much trouble making their plans work in the first place. </p>

<p>Imagine you are writing a book. You have this great story outlined and you start writing. But half way through, you have a heart attack and die. Some kid finds your book and your outline, and starts to finish your book. He isn&#39;t you, he only has a vague idea of what you were trying to do, so he starts writing in his own stuff. Then he dies, and someone finds the book, and your notes of the other guys notes, and tries to continue on. That&#39;s the kind of situation the globalists are in right now. They have the ground work put down by other, more wiser people, and they are trying to at least partially finish what was started, but they don&#39;t understand the original intentions of the people who came before them and are biased by the environment that they grew up in. vaguly they understand that this grand plan will give them and let them keep power, but the fundamental purpose behind it all has been lost and so, mistakes are made. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The design problem with massive depopulation is that it could only succeed without people identifying the root cause actors, which would be rather difficult, if not impossible.  They&#39;d need a believable narrative into WW3.  Absent that, the slow kill mechanisms are being exposed and people are currently adapting to the reality of poisoned foodsupply, water, etc.  </p>

<p>One needs to ask why a group of people thinks such a huge cull is necessary.  Is population growth the real reason?  Or is it the reason used to lever otherwise pacifists into committing horrible acts?  Or have a small group of people ALWAYS thought it&#39;s their moral right to prune what they view as inferior people from their &quot;responsibility sphere&quot;.  Maybe a global event is necessary because &quot;the machine of society&quot; is a &quot;careless machine&quot; and has to be stopped before it continues on its demonstrably destructive path.  There are many reasons, both good and bad, that one can bring up. </p>

<p>If you were &quot;the good guys&quot; and just needed to create circumstances to demonstrate &quot;the inevitability of the careless machine&quot;, you&#39;d want things to get bad enough that people were forced to deal with it.  You&#39;d want the obviousness of the path you were on to be obvious.  You&#39;d want other models as options to move over to.  This model also resonates with observable realities.       </p>

They don&#39;t want you to be able to support yourself in any way that is outside their authority, and they also don&#39;t want you to have anything whatsoever that they regard as having real value.  That&#39;s what the seed banks are for.  They will create their own catalogue of as many plants as they can, possibly the same with animals, and then turn the rest of the planet into an irradiated, smoking blast crater.  The only way you will be able to get food is through them.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The plan is basically to recreate ancient Egypt in some respects, except to make it infinitely <strong><em>more</em></strong> elitist and totalitarian.  They want a scenario where they can view themselves as literal Gods, although you can only really do that if you still have <strong><em>some</em></strong> peons grovelling in front of you in order to provide contrast, which is what the half billion will be for.</p>

<p>So said elite will have access to transhumanist technology and various other such tricks, while the half billion will remain something less than what we have known ordinary humanity to be.  The chasm between haves and have nots will be incalculably vast; because the ability to view themselves as superior to others is the main thing they need, and what they thrive on.  Their ability to view themselves as superior is their motivation behind the whole thing.  They constantly need new ways of being able to do that.</p>

<p>Remember, whenever some liberal fuck talks about over population and how &#39;we need to reduce the population to less than 500 million&#39;, recognize the fact that the western world is already at that quota. The usa, for example, is only 350 million people give or take. It doesnt make any sense what so ever for americans to be encouraged to drop their birth rates or self-select for suicidal population practies. Europe is also around that same number, and its not even half the size of the usa. The other 6 billion people on this planet , supposedly over populating the world, exist else where. </p>

<p>That is being done in order to create a genetic monoculture, primarily.  They want us weak, and the best way to ensure that is to make sure that we are genetically uniform with minimal difference.</p>

<p>This is also why the SJWs and their associated idiots are trying to destroy any distinction between gender, as well.  They think they&#39;re trying to remove any possible basis for prejudice, but the reality is that it is much easier to destroy something, when said thing only has a single form, rather than multiple forms.  So different ethnicities, different religions, different philosophies and languages all have to go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>if the elite can get the 500 million people down to a single mongrelized race then they can more easily control the population with bio-weapons that target the specific markers a mixed race person might have. </p>

<p>Just consider what is happening to dark skinned people in northern europe right now. Their dark skin evolved to protect them from the harsh sunlight that beat down on their ancestors near the equator of our planet. But in higher lattitudes, this doesn&#39;t protect them but rather denies their body the ability to use sunlight to create vitamins necessary for regular living. To combat this, governments in places like Norway actually have to fortify their food stuffs and hand out supplements as part of their welfare programs so that the dark skinned children of immigrants don&#39;t grow up malnutritioned and permanently stunted. </p>

<p>Now imagine a world where everyone has dark skin from intentional race mixing, and that is used to control the population by denying someone the vitamin supplements they need because they tried to be political dissidents or refused to follow orders after being transferred to some northern canadian work camp or whatever. They would start to die, all on their own, and nothing they tried to do would save them because of a fundamental flaw in their own biology. And of course, with a globalist controlled schooling system they would never be taught this fact. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not an insider - I can only give you my meandering thoughts.  It&#39;s obvious that there are efforts to program behaviour into people through all of the channels available (media, internet, social networks, etc.).  This programming embeds beauty standards (amongst many, many other things) into minds from birth.  This biases mate selection.  These are the sort of easy logical inferences that can be made.  </p>

<p>Another way to glean insight into this would be to imagine some hypothetical model - like Aliens are controlling humanity&#39;s development and have been for a while (as per Sitchin, Sumerians, Gnostics, etc.) - and start asking yourself how that would look.  If such a thing were true, how would it likely manifest.  Smoke some bowls, build up a mental model, ask it questions and see what it produces.  You might be surprised at how predictable results of some models show up in &quot;the real world&quot;.    </p>

<p>Unrelated to this topic, here&#39;s an example of a &quot;model&quot;  to play with.  Imagine what would happen if all the women on the planet decided to collectively withhold sex until all war stopped.  Why doesn&#39;t this modality manifest, even on small scales?  What pressures make it such that such a thing doesn&#39;t happen?  If one proposes that a warlike/rapey culture would quickly kibosh such an act within its society by women, and that&#39;s why this modality never happens, then why is it the most warlike cultures on the planet today are also where women have the most state protections.  What&#39;s up with that?  Where does this model break?  My point is that exploring odd models, odd theses, often exposes interesting resonances with reality.</p>

<p>They want to destroy Christ. Once Christ is out of the way they can try to destroy God. </p>

<p>They used AI and Eschatologists to scour metadata and current events. It&#39;s like a puzzle to them. Once they find canidates they manipulate things to happen around them that could be interpreted as fulfillment of Prophecy. One particular canidate is of interest to everyone at the moment. He has celestial signs going for Him that others never had. Part of the prophecy is that the people have to lift The Son of Man to position so it gets tricky for them. They can&#39;t roll out someone as Christ. They can only set up the conditions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about human rights? What about the differences of views between different peoples? Different cultures and philosophies?  Why do you not like the idea of different people molding their own laws that make their populations the most happy? How can you value business over freedoms and cultures? Is humanity simply a tool for you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Define human rights? </p>

<p>Different views are nothing more than different knowledge of your current situation. </p>

<p>How much has culture helped this modern world?</p>

<p>Became one due to my personal pursuit of philosophy. Philosophy is important for globalization, self actualizion to the world around followed by the most valued mindset a free one.</p>

<p>People have made laws for ages and it is still broken regardless, it&#39;s not that I do not like the idea of different people molding their own laws for themselves, people are corrupt able and self serving. Are the populations really happy is China, Russia, USA, and Europe for the most part happy?</p>

<p>Business is everything or rather yet momentum with more precise knowledge as to what is moving our world. Technology goes perfectly with globalism if we do not utilize one or the other we will never have full grasp and control the greatness humanity can accomplish. I value time, eliminating borders eliminating old practices and at some point mindsets is just general evolution/progress. </p>

<p>We are tools to the greater good, some just don&#39;t work or are of no need any more. Which tool are you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>World government, ie global communism, ie kill off the vast majority of people so they can be more easily managed so that their rule will never ever be threatened under the pretense of creating a utopia. Humanity would be divided into 2 classes: the party(elites) who would remain racially homogenious within the context of the specific region they control, and everyone else: ideally a group of mongerllized mixed race people who have no unified culture, religion, or race in which to rally behind and threaten them with. </p>

<p>The elite push multiculturalism for everyone but themselves, because it destabilizes society, making people easier to single out and punish with the unified force of the state. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neofeudalism.  They want everyone to be microserfs quarantined into technoshantytowns from which they cannot physically or technologically affect the elite upper class.  They want to have a hierarchy of outer shells where people are increasingly corrupt, so that the &#39;beautiful children&#39; can be traded outward into increasingly more profane shell societies (strict caste system)</p>

<p>They want the hungry games + pedo + privilege so that the ruling class can do anything it wants.  Crowleyian hierarchy, mimicking freemasonry as it is now.</p>

<p>edit-afterthought: BUt don&#39;t worry, because the biggest taboo is cannabilism, so at some point, the lower classes will figure out how to poison their bodies to cannabalism while still being alive and do the same for their &#39;beautiful children&#39;, which will eventually force the aristocrats to turn on themselves in order to fulfill their perverse desires after they start dying, and then, they will die in huge numbers as the vampires feed on themselves.  In fact, everyone will die all over and this whole thing will collapse at some point, leading to a reset of humanity back to the stone age.</p>

<p>So my point is they want to do two things: 1) perverted golden age for themselves followed by 2) stone age for everyone</p>
