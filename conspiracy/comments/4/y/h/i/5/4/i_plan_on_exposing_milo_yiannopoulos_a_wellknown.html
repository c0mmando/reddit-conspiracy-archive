        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For those who don&#39;t know, this guy believes 9/11, 7/7, Boston &quot;bombing&quot;, Orlando &quot;shooting&quot; etc. were done solely by Muslims and were not actual false flag attacks/psy ops.</p>

<p>You ask how I will expose him? I&#39;m still writing out what I plan to say, but it will be along the lines of how Trump has not once brought up the issue of funding al-Qaeda, ISIS, ISIL etc., how he&#39;s friends with multibillionaire pedophiles and rapists, as well as war criminals like Henry Kissinger, Rudy Guiliani and George Soros. I will also mention how he advocates just about the same kind of police state Hitlery is pushing for. </p>

<p>I also intend to mention how there&#39;s literally almost no proof of Mateen&#39;s involvement in the Orlando attacks by citing the refusal of the FBI to the FOIA requests to disclose the complete audio transcript of Mateen&#39;s call to 911 accompanied by the meta data, as well as the complete lack of CCTV footage showing him even entering the club with the alleged weapons.</p>

<p>Any strong points which I haven&#39;t thought of, please share so I can incorporate them. In fact, if someone here is a professional writer and/or orator, if you can write a small essay and share it with me, or actually meet me at that event if you&#39;re in Texas so I can be the one recording rather than speaking etc, I&#39;m all ears and completely open to suggestions!! </p>

<p>Thanks :)</p>

<p>EDIT: Forgot another notable war criminal, Rudy Guiliani</p>

<p>EDIT 2: Milo seems to have noticed this post on FB (can&#39;t post the link here since this sub doesn&#39;t allow FB links). Hey Milo fans :-)</p>

Your only reference to Milo is that he endorses Trump.</p>

<p>Also, Milo seems to make it his life&#39;s mission to promote Trump. My &quot;only&quot; reference is THE reference. I want Milo to acknowledge the fact that he&#39;s supporting someone who&#39;s been endorsed by war criminals, murderers, rapists and pedophiles. If he continues to support this man despite this admission, then I will rest my case and gladly crash and burn for your entertainment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So why don&#39;t you expose the many much more popular celebrities who are supporting Hillary Clinton? She is also guilty of all your accusations as are many donors of the Clinton Foundation who all have much more influence that a gay british columnist could ever have.</p>

<p>So maybe your priorities are not straight because it seems very personal for you. Btw: I think Milos views on some topics are extremely outdated but if some blabbering amateur confronts him with all the stuff from your Opening post, he will just seem as a raving lunatic.</p>

<p>I mean your post basically says: &quot;I will expose him!!! So give me stuff I need to expose him with cause I got shit&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>She is also guilty of all your accusations as are many donors of the Clinton Foundation</p>

<p>You think I don&#39;t fuckin know that? If I didn&#39;t care about my privacy, I&#39;d show you my facebook feed where I&#39;ve gone toe-to-toe against braindead Hillary supporters and called them out on their sheer ignorance of Hillary&#39;s war crimes and corruption.</p>

<p>You think I&#39;m a blabbering amateur? I do research on politics as a hobby, and I do it in a very calm, collected and efficient manner. I was simply asking for input on what to talk about and what not to talk about. I also acknowledge that I&#39;m not a professional, and that if someone who is was willing to talk in my stead and work together with me, I&#39;d be totally okay with that.</p>

<p>I have confronted a couple of people in the past in a similar manner. Unfortunately, at that time I was a poor college student who couldn&#39;t afford a camera or smartphone to have it recorded. Examples of people I questioned include IDF spokespeople as well as more popular folks like Ben Shapiro.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You greatly underestimate the support Milo has. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So maybe your priorities are not straight because it seems very personal for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes it is VERY personal from me. I&#39;m tired of having people I know suffer from grief of relatives slaughtered in the Middle East at the hands of terrorist orgs like ISIS, which is the brainchild of the US-Israeli Hegemony. I&#39;m tired of seeing people&#39;s families being devastated by the war <del>on</del> of terror which was started based on absolute lies and cover-ups.</p>

<p>So yes, I wanna see some fuckin change, and one of the ways I will help in seeing it is by calling out famous personalities like Milo on the BS they regurgitate, thinking they are immune to criticism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I predict you&#39;re one of those who think it&#39;s hip and edgy to assume who a person is, what he/she does for a living etc. Didn&#39;t your parents ever tell you about how you make an <strong>ass</strong> out of <strong>u</strong> and <strong>me</strong> by <strong>assuming</strong> things? </p>

<p>Your assumption that I&#39;m a liberal is false. I strongly believe in the traditional values set forth by the constitution of the United States, and I stand by them no matter what.</p>

<p>Your assumption that I think of myself as someone of importance is also false. I merely value my life, the lives of my family as well as the lives and well-being of those I know who have lost loved ones in the senseless war <del>on</del> <strong>of</strong> terror. </p>

<p>That said, I&#39;m not going to be an ass like you by assuming you don&#39;t know anyone who has been a victim of this war based on massive lies and cover-ups, nor will I assume that you haven&#39;t even visited the war-torn countries like Iraq and Afghanistan affected by this senseless war. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t you worry. I will be there. Milo along with the rest of his cocky and bratty supporters will have his ass handed to him when I&#39;m through exposing him and his idol thoroughly. I&#39;ve had enough bullshit. I wanna see some real positive change, not the kind Trump is promoting.</p>

<p>What the flying fuck are you doing poking your nose in US politics? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>No thank you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was an expression you clueless retard, to highlight the shitstorm the US-Israeli hegemony along with its allies (which includes your country) unleashed on several sovereign nations, particularly Iraq and Afghanistan. I have every right to be angry with people who ignorantly supported the march to a war that was started on utter bullshit and lies. NO EXCUSES.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are not going to change anyone&#39;s ways and unfortunately this a lesson for your probable young ass that people have varying and different opinions on things</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Newsflash for you - people can change their attitude when presented with facts. Sure, they may resist at first, but if they are honest-to-God good people, then they will eventually change. So fuck right off with that defeatist philosophy.</p>

Your mom is not the gateway to planting a seed of doubt and curiosity for actual knowledge about the facade of the 2016 election. Milo is.</p>

<p>Still want me to &quot;hassle&quot; your mom? Just to be clear, I don&#39;t intend to be confrontational, or at least I&#39;ll try not to be. My focus is to stimulate critical thinking and perhaps persuade Milo that his idol Trump is not the solution, just napalm to the fire that is our problems. If he is persuaded, then his supporters and followers will also think twice.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not voting for either candidate. It&#39;s like making a choice between coke and pepsi. They both advocate more wars. They both support big government. They both want a police state with advanced surveillance capabilities. <strong>THEY&#39;RE BOTH BAD NEWS!</strong></p>

<p>From the looks of it, you look like you&#39;re neither pro-Trump nor pro-Hillary, so similar to me?</p>

<p>Also, if you haven&#39;t already noticed, Milo has actually posted a screenshot of this post on his FB feed. It&#39;s frikkin hilarious! I&#39;m gonna enjoy destroying him when he comes to Texas. Also, if you do find his FB page, see the absolute retarded comments underneath. There&#39;s still a very large portion of the population which believes in the official fairytale of 9/11. Makes me despair a little given how we&#39;ve had 15 damn years of damning evidence to the contrary, yet no one bats an eye. Jeez.</p>

<p>I think the most damning evidence against Trump is his connections with the Clinton&#39;s- like the phone call between Trump and Bill the night before he announced his candidacy and also his future cabinet members who include the CFR and an ex-Koch brothers spokesman.</p>

<p>Also his daughter was fucking a Rothschild for some time. It appears you&#39;re already well aware of the contradictions in terms that Giuliani&#39;s presence confirms... a &quot;9/11 truther&quot; wanting one of the main perps/exploitationists close by their side.

    <div class="md"><p>Milo is far from perfect but this sounds far more like an expose of event where the official narrative seems to be different from the reality as to what likely happened. </p>

<p>As such, why is Milo your main candidate for this? If you want to do this kind of thing then target any and every Q&amp;A near by which will be filmed and put on youtube? </p>

<p>If you want to &#39;expose&#39; Milo, and I&#39;m generally a fan of his though not on fb to have seen whatever he said, then your main points should be 
    the anti-trump things you&#39;ve said
    The issues with the privilege grant stuff being paid into his account rather than being set up as a legal charity     (though they are apparently now working on that)
    His defence of the priest that he apparently had sexual encounters with when he was underaged</p>

<p>Now I imagine that his responses to Trump would be 
    Pro-gay, anti-islam 
    not hillary </p>

<p>In response to the Privelage Grant 
    I was busy being fabulous and it slipped off the radar but I&#39;m now working on it and it&#39;ll be ready for spring 2017 and it&#39;s all above board</p>

<p>The priest
    Laugh it off, like he has before. </p>

<p>Help yourself, but tbh I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll get anywhere nor do I think that you&#39;ll &quot;own&quot; him - he&#39;s good with awkward questions. But hey, good luck. </p>

<p>EDIT: I suck at formatting, half of this was supposed to be bullet points -.- </p>

I&#39;m sure if you just start listing conspiracy theories that he doesn&#39;t agree with you&#39;ll win the argument and that girl you&#39;re trying to impress will totally let you make fiki fiki with her.</p>
