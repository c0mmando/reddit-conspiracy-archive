<p>Can you tell me more about these demons? Often I meet people that are so bland they seem unreal. Often coworkers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not likely, they&#39;re likely just bored.  Day jobs are a spiritual poison.</p>

<p>The demons I&#39;ve met have been my mother (seriously), my neighbor (he ran away when I started explaining all this to him, after trying the same old tactics on me, <em>hah!!</em>), a clerk at Cost-Co today (asked &quot;feeling human today?&quot; and he went off for a minute about how horrible being human was).  </p>

<p>Additionally, I&#39;ve met 2 at my community pool, neither could answer &#39;yes&#39; to the &quot;are you human?&quot; question.  Which was handy as I was trying to make my crazy point to someone there.</p>

<p>Not sure that&#39;s what you wanted to know, but there ya go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not 100% on the adjective yet (demonic/reptilian/or just psychopathic) but I do believe that there is too large a contingent of beings on this planet that feel far too little for those that walk it with them. Why they can&#39;t or refuse to see the connection we all share to each other and our world, I don&#39;t know. I desperately don&#39;t want it to be a willful evil intent, but boy some of the headlines lately really point towards not just a negligence in fellowship, but an actual pursuit of ill will. Keep spreading love though, I really do like a lot of what you say. Especially the fractals. Also, I am human :]</p>

<p>Also, Rummy was very weird and evasive about these humorous questions. The story he told was bizarre. Fuck him.</p>

<p>FWIW I don&#39;t think he is a lizard (I don&#39;t believe that stuff) but he DID get weird, especially in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dK8Y2nO_8TM">the full version of the call.</a>... it sure was great when CK called him on the Saddam meeting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean the same kind of non-answers.  Start looking for how the media (TV especially) is reminding you to be scared.  Look for it and it&#39;ll be all you hear.  The news, the repeated reminders of &#39;terrorist&#39; acts, it&#39;s all the same noise over and over.  And it all quietly says one thing: <em>be afraid</em>.</p>

<p>It is very much a nervous thing-- and an awareness of just how fucking absurd and insane my story is.  I am fine talking about this online or in person, but it was just really weird saying it all to a flowerpot.</p>

<p>And the skirt is hella-comfy.  Ever worn one?  I got two words for ya: breathing room.  It&#39;s time to start being comfortable with ourselves, our bodies, what we really are.  Each and every one of us is perfect the way we were made.  Now is the time to eat god&#39;s sweet, sweet fruit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do see how the media appears to be trying to keep everyone on alert with all the terrible things happening, on repeat. I have stopped watching the news because of this. </p>

<p>I guess I understand being that nervous because of your story. Why did you choose to say it to a flowerpot?</p>

<p>Skirts are comfy, I agree. I wear dresses daily for the same reason. It is interesting that you say to start being comfortable with myself, as recently I learned about total radical acceptance of myself, and have been trying. Someone who knows similar things to you told me that is one of the biggest things I can do to help the world right now, take good care of myself and love and accept who you are. </p>

<p>No one has free will. Your genetic programming combined with your personal experience determine how you will react to the world.

We may not have known the equations behind the forces, but we still understood that throwing a ball with the same force at the same angle would always produce the same result.

    <div class="md"><p>Our universe is a river of electromagnetic current, like an impulse passing through a brain.  We are electromagnetic creatures experiencing themselves inside of this current.</p>

<p>And like any river, our universe can have tributaries which lead to alternative timelines.  And also like a river, these tributaries will always lead back to our main, shared timeline.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it.  Simple as that.</p>

<p>You are an electromagnetic creature (see above).  When you die, your energy does not change.  You will be you for a long, long time.  All those who&#39;ve died before us are <em>still here</em> around us.</p>

<p>The term I like best is &#39;density&#39;.  We began at the first density and are currently at the third.  When we die, we move to the fourth.  During the Great Awakening (in 7 years), god will call home all Enlightened souls to the fifth density.</p>

<p>Because you want him to be. </p>

<p>Not because you have evidence of it. If you did, you&#39;d be the most famous human to ever live on this planet. You were probably raised Christian by your Christian parents. How do you know the Quran isn&#39;t what you should follow? Or Hinduism? Or the Torah? Or one of over 2000 other religions?</p>

<p>Most people in other religions are 100% positive they&#39;re right about the truth of religion. If they&#39;re 100% positive and yet you are too, who is right? Both of you cannot be.</p>

<p>If I wanted to learn the truth, how would I decipher who to listen to? Well in the real world, we have this crazy concept called evidence. It&#39;s really nice. Since you have none, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be following what you say is truth and what&#39;s not.</p>

<p>By the way, I have a wish granting leprechaun in my living room. But in order to see him, you have to truly believe he exists. If not, then you don&#39;t believe enough. You don&#39;t have enough faith. Same thing if you don&#39;t get your wishes granted.</p>

<p>And if you don&#39;t believe in him, because he loves you so much, he&#39;s going to posthumously torture you for....well forever. It&#39;s because he loves you that he must torture you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so no evidence then?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll still answer your questions.  Maybe after that you can give me some evidence?</p>

<p>I&#39;m more than likely here because my parents had sex resulting in my conception.  Before that it was a long evolutionary chain over the course of billions of years of small changes within organism populations.  The reason the earth is here is likely because of gas and dust accumulating in an accretion disk many more billions of years ago to form our sun and our solar system. That was the result of many supernovae that occured during the 14+billion years the universe has existed.  That&#39;s why I&#39;m here.</p>

<p>There is something because of nothiing because of the big bang.  I get the feeling you&#39;re hinting more towards why did the big bang occur.  We don&#39;t know since our equations for time tend to break down when you get to the instantaneous moment of the big bang.  That&#39;s pretty crazy because we hypothesize that time itself is the result of the big bang.  It&#39;s a crazy concept, but it&#39;s just a hypothesis right now.  The thing is, mathematics are right about everything right up until that instantaneous moment the big bang occurred.  But what&#39;s great about the science world, astronomy in this case, is they are still trying to find answers to that question.  They will never stop.  And if/when we find those answers, we just have more questions!  It&#39;s an endless process but that&#39;s how you learn about the world around you.  Ask questions.  Test your question.  When you get an answer, ask another question.  Then test that question.  And so on.  That&#39;s how you learn.</p>

<p>So can I please have that evidence now?</p>

<p>Edit:  Also, I&#39;m also assuming that you mean why did the big bang come from nothing?  Well, you can&#39;t say there was nothing before the big bang because you don&#39;t have &#39;nothing&#39; to compare it to.  Can you describe nothing?  It&#39;s not a black void.  That&#39;s still something.  What is nothing?  Unless you can define what nothing is and prove &#39;nothing&#39; exists, you can&#39;t claim the universe came from nothing.  The whole point about time resulting from the big bang, just as our universe did, means our universe just has always been.  You can&#39;t have before time.  &#39;Before&#39; is a concept of time.</p>

Which, even though is stupid to say because it&#39;s a contradiction of itself, would mean everything I&#39;ve told you is true. From your own words dude. You&#39;ve admitted that because you believe me to be a &quot;demon&quot; and &quot;demons&quot; cannot lie, you believe I haven&#39;t lied about anything. Even though I said I wasn&#39;t a demon, which would make me human and able to lie. So which is it dude? </p>

If I had a kid and they asked me that, I too would be quite offended and refuse to answer such a stupid question. He changes his story so much that I can&#39;t tell if he&#39;s a troll or his delusions are evolving. He needs help either way, it&#39;s people like him that go on killing sprees believing the world needs cleansing. If he does do something like that at least I know I did all I can to stop him. The shot thing is you can&#39;t reason with madness, any attack on belief systems without evidence always result in the believer sinking deeper.</p>
