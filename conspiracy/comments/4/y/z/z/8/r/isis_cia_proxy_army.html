        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>To even suggest that ISIS was created and is controlled by the CIA and affiliated intelligence agencies is a taboo in most circles, so I&#39;ll discuss it here, with all the other crazy conspiracy theory nuts*.</p>

<p>(* Btw the term &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; first showed up after the Kennedy Assassination, not long after a secret CIA memo suggesting ways to discredit anyone questioning the official version of those facts: <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-02-23/1967-he-cia-created-phrase-conspiracy-theorists-and-ways-attack-anyone-who-challenge">http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-02-23/1967-he-cia-created-phrase-conspiracy-theorists-and-ways-attack-anyone-who-challenge</a>)</p>

<p>First of I think that anyone who doesn&#39;t even want to consider such a possibility has a very limited knowledge of what kind of messed up things the CIA and for example Mossad have done in the past, the lengths and lies they&#39;re willing to go to to achieve their goals, including blatant lies and defying the wishes of elected democratic governments.</p>

<p>Secondly I will state that most likely ISIS was created by a cooperation between the very Coalition countries operating against it today, namely the US, Israel, Gulf States, Turkey and Europe. Meaning it was most likely created by the CIA, Mossad, MI6, and all those other secret agencies.</p>

<p>Thirdly I believe ISIS served three main goals:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Expand the conflict into Iraq, to create chaos in a now pro-Iranian country led by a Shia majority government. As well as to deprive it of oil funding, and as an added bonus sell captured oil at half the market price, which fit in nicely with the concentrated effort by the oil cartel at that time to push down global oil prices. Notice that Russia started bombing ISIS oil exports only after the rebound from lows in oil prices. But that&#39;s for another crazy theory discussion.</p></li>
<li><p>To provoke an intervention by the Coalition over Syria, and create a general sense of fear in the West. Governments and private companies love a good war to fight terrorists, it means more debt enslavement for taxpayers, more control for power elites, and more profits for the banks and the &quot;defense&quot; sector (the DoD should be renamed the Department of Offense if you ask me). It&#39;s easier to start war against faceless baby-killers than to remove a dictator that&#39;s actually supported by most of his people. And once you&#39;re there and putting out your air power, you&#39;re in a good position to escalate if need be. &quot;It was self defence&quot;, &quot;they had WMD&#39;s, we&#39;re sure of it&quot;, etc...</p></li>
<li><p>To create a Kurdistan. The Kurds have long been an actor used by the West, first to fight Saddam and now Assad, and I&#39;m sure to keep Turkey in check. By having ISIS conquer so much territory and create a buffer zone between the Kurds and the Iraqi/Assad governments, it allows the Kurds to fight the &quot;evil satanist baby killers that hate democracy and puppies&quot; (ignoring the small fact that their laws and beliefs are extremely similar to those of Saudi Arabia) and in the proces win more ground and power, under a nice umbrella of Western air power. As when Turkey shot down a Russian jet for supposedly entering Turkish air space for a few seconds, the Coalition is now flexing its air cover because Coalition forces are in the area (which suggests they are supporting the Kurds in their offensive agains Assad&#39;s forces, kind of strange concidering they&#39;re supposed to be there to fight ISIS...), and who knows where this could lead.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>However, now that ISIS seems to be losing to a Kurdish dominated SDF and also in Iraq, Turkey seems to be getting nervous and switching sides, possibly after the failed coup against Erdogan. Turkey smoothed over things with Russia, offered its air bases to Putin, suddenly decided Assad isn&#39;t Hitler reborn after all, and is now launching their own little Syrian rebel proxy army (with Turkish support) against ISIS (probaby trying to take the ground before the Kurds can). I wonder how many of those rebels are Turkish soldiers taking up some much deserved vacation time...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was in Iraq at the tail end of the war. I was some of the last boots on ground. I didn&#39;t see any ISIS, and guess what, I ain&#39;t afraid of no ghost...(<em>edit</em> - I realize ISIS wasn&#39;t invented yet at the time. Thought about it after I wrote this, but decided to keep it for humour)
...I wrote an entry on my livejournal, around the time the third video emerged of a beheading, and that article was about all the things ISIS supposedly did, that was impossible. I also wrote a list of things that were improbable. I can recall a few from memory...
...The Anbar Province is one which the US led Coalition had trouble securing (never really did), the entire years of the war. ISIS was said to have swept in (from where?) and controlled it (totalitarian style) within weeks or months of their conception (sprang from Al Nusra Front). 
The other terrorist groups gained &quot;moderate&quot; status by publically being against ISIS, saying even we don&#39;t burn children and commit warcrimes (they pinned all Syrian warcrimes on ISIS).
Lets touch on that first video shall we? It was so fake looking. The bad guy sawed at the other guy&#39;s neck six or seven times before what appears to be red liquid squirts out from the hand of the victim, as it fades to black?? Then a head on top of a body is seen, and the neck seems very...blockish. That first video was taken off the internet quickly, and soon replaced by better and better videos, until lighting a man on fire convinced everyone..but even just after the first few, Jordan decided to lend air power to Syria. The King of Jordan on an interview remarked that nobody in Jordan even watches the video, because it is too offensive...just mull over that thought for a moment.
So ISIS goes about beheading people of key citizenships, of every country in the coalition, one step at a time. Each country, in turn, immediately and without congressional (or similar) approval, sent air power to Syria. Looks like beheading all of those people was the worst tactical decision ever, but ISIS loves tactless decisions, as they will become their hallmark as the tale goes along.
At the same time as Western Artillery was pounding out a 20 mile buffer zone along the Syrian-Turkish border (to move troops, equipment, resupply and regroup), hitting hospitals and schools, news began to surface about ISIS defacing and destroying precious protected monuments. Nice deflection there. ISIS gets blamed for all warcrimes and now for any destruction the war might cause. Interesting way for western forces to escape legal liability which would hold them responsible (you know, for all the murder of women, children and &quot;fighting aged males&quot;).
ISIS is like lightning and they don&#39;t seem to want to strike twice. They systematically create media spectacles (not actual harassment of enemy infrastructure or personell, but all soft targets, which is not a war tactic and never has been), to piss off every sigle social group that exists. They piss off moms, dog lovers, gays and their sympathizers, women in general, kids, little girls specifically. They hate happiness, charm, animals, all that is holy and good, and they hate love itself. They even hate their own people, and that has gone a long way to encourage Muslims worldwide to accept not only an alteration to their normative customs, but to accept enshrined legislation mandating these normative adjustments. For instance the ban on Burkinis, face veils in public places, closing down of Mosques and a hard grip on the structure and effect of Muslim hierarchy (Imams). ISIS just seems to want to piss everyone off, and guarantee western allies come right to them where they are, to kill all of them (again, not a war tactic that has ever been used).
Lets talk a little more about the impossible, having laid out some, as well as the improbable. ISIS is said to have several ministry organizations, including a ministry of education. Now ISIS is said to have the power of an Industry. They are said to have massive amounts of large currency (from where? Simultaneous to that, some large bills in the EU were taken out of circulation because &quot;criminals use large bills&quot;). ISIS is said to control their territory so well, that once well meaning populations are now propagandized and radicalized into doing anything their leaders wish (blowing selves up/becoming sleeper agents).
Ok one last big point, which is a very small one. I gleened some precious intel, about a shipment of a new kind of drug (meth) that was found being smuggled along the turkish border. It was quickly covered up, but for a brief moment the world has the ability to see a glimpse, of a bigger picture. I have always felt that no person could believe so zealously as to blow themselves up. Maybe a person, but not many people. If sex slaves are turned into &quot;martyrs&quot;, then logically they weren&#39;t overzelous before. What made them so overzelous? I suspect these people are being captured, brainwashed and fed these new drugs, to hype them up and craze them. They can be remotely exploded without any idea they are even laced with explosives...and who has a track record for studying sex slavery and brainwashing using drugs? Why, the CIA, of course, in studies such as MK Ultra 1, 2, and their successor projects.
I for one, am quite convinced that ISIS never once existed, beyond the schemes of our own intel agencies.
Nice post :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thanks for the input</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t pay attention to the beheadings (I like to ignore propaganda when possible, didn&#39;t watch tv for a week after 9/11), but thanks for pointing it out</p>

<p>yes ISIS&#39; moves make no sense whatsoever, beyond provoking attacks by Europe and now Turkey. how can an organisation have the tactical and strategic capabilities to conquer and govern an entire country worth of territory, and then piss off everyone it can to come and attack it. if they hadn&#39;t done those beheadings, terrorist attacks... the coalition wouldn&#39;t be there, and they&#39;d have a much easier time against the Kurds, the rebels and the SAA (and now the Turks)</p>

<p>and drugs play a huge role in war, it&#39;s something especially obvious with child soldiers. it&#39;s also a huge source of income, I&#39;m convinced the CIA/Pentagon invaded Afghanistan mostly to protect its opium production (with great succes)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been thinking about your comment, and I want to say more. Disinfo and other subversive intel ops, coupled with covert control of popular news flow, makes people just stop looking, but there is a pattern that begins to emerge.
I hosted the news on my blog for about 7 months, and in that time I saw that pattern.
We must force ourselves to look. I&#39;ve read it 5 or so times now (not each link), but time and time again I find more and more.
Care to take a gander? I pull the key data and I have compiled it for all to peruse :)

<p><em>edit</em> I started highlighting the news more than part time (hours per day), at the moment I heard of the Paris event, 11/13/15 (in between college classes, work and homework).
I knew immediately it was France&#39;s 9/11, and laws would be set in motion that would change the world as we know it.
In hindsight, I was right, and I documented the process step by step. Pay attention to the small details.</p>

<p>I mean Trump has alienated all the demographic groups that he needs to actually win the presidency. Similar strategy I thought to what you explained. I don&#39;t believe Trump actually wants to be president and is only running to damage the GOP and ensure that his buddy Hillary wins the race.

<p>but I&#39;m not excluding the possibility that it really was a US supported coup, although if it was it would have succeeded</p>

<p>the thing is that after this happened, Turkey became friendly to Russia and sort of to Assad, and now (as I predicted) they launched an offensive into Syria, against ISIS (but mostly against the Kurds), two Assad opponents, but more importantly they&#39;re supporting a rebel offensive.

    <div class="md"><p>Great post.  </p>

<p>Completely agree with the balkanization concept- iraq, syria, lebanon, iran and TURKEY are going to be broken up and be redistricted into a syriani/ free kurdistan.</p>

<p>your bit on the oil price is good too:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As well as to deprive it of oil funding, and as an added bonus sell captured oil at half the market price, which fit in nicely with the concentrated effort by the oil cartel at that time to push down global oil prices. Notice that Russia started bombing ISIS oil exports only after the rebound from lows in oil prices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the liquid gas boom, in conjunction with war in the middle east, has really hit countries reliant on energy exports- venezuela, russia, iran, saudi arabia</p>

<p>a big key to keeping chaos in the region is stopping an alliance with the east, particularly one which allows Russia to maintain control of european energy.  Russian and Iranian LNG pipelines seem to be big targets here.</p>

<p>I wish I could find the video from several years ago of anne coulter suggesting that a mercenary army of al quaeda style extremists  would be a great way to take out Iran without ever having to put US boots on the ground.  She know we did it in afganistan in the 80&#39;s, and that the same agency faction loves propping up islamic militant movements in places like yemen, SA and chechnya.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>haha yeah, on another forum I suggested Argentina use ISIS as a proxy army to take over the Falklands, then have ISIS attack Argentina to provoke a response, of course purge the military which had some links to ISIS, and then invade the Falklands to scare off ISIS (which magically vanished, similar to how Argentinian special forces magically apeared in their place)</p>

<p>I wrote this just a month before the Erdogan coup. now Turkey has steamrolled into ISIS territory &quot;because of ISIS&quot;, ISIS vanished, and Turkish forces are engaging the SDF (which aren&#39;t going to last long without coalition air support against Turkish special forces and fire support)</p>

<p>it&#39;s the template they used in Yugoslavia (and more recently Ukraine, Libya...): divide and conquer through civil war. use a few billion to apply preasure to weak spots and watch people kill each other</p>

<p>oil is a big factor in the whole story, and I suspect this conflict will be the excuse to push the price back up. possibly a Saudi invasion as soon as next month</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You all have this wrong. </p>

<p>After invading Iraq in 2003,  Uncle Sam installed a puppet named Nouri al-Maliki into a green zone in Baghdad.    al-Maliki was a huge family connected to a very orthodox sect of Shiite Islam.  The problem here is that 90% of the Iraqi population is Sunni.   </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouri_al-Maliki">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouri_al-Maliki</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This established a common states-of-affairs seen in the middle east and the Levant.   (A large sunni population lorded over by an orthodox Shiite dictator.)    Nouri al-Maliki&#39;s government was mostly at peace with the population of Iraq.  However,  the northern section of Iraq was home to a collection of terrorist organizations , which your western media refers to as &quot;Shiite Militias&quot;.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to former U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Zalmay Khalilzad, &quot;the existence of private militias&quot; has loomed as &quot;a persistent problem.  (July , 2006) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Baghdad had its own problems distracting it, and so it was a peaceful group.   On the other hand, the Shiite Militias were out-and-out slaughtering civilians in northern Iraq.  Proof : </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6946028.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6946028.stm</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Because these militias were Shiite,  the al-Malaki government <em>turned a blind eye</em> to the slaughter, the bombings, and the massacres.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Because of the inaction of the government in Baghdad and their inability to protect the population they are suffering the way they are now&quot;   (Khaled Salih , Kurdistan Regional Government )</p>

<p>The militias — mostly Shiite Muslim groups known collectively as popular mobilization units, or PMUs — have a reputation for brutal reprisals against Sunnis suspected of being loyal to the Islamic State. Iraqis and human rights groups have accused them of torture, forced disappearances and executions</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You will notice, even to this day,  that the wikipedia article on the <strong>Qahtaniya bombings</strong>  is unable to isolate the group that actually perpetrated those bombings.   This is western censorship on full display.  We know exactly who did it --  the Shiite Militias. </p>

<p>The stage is now set in Iraq for the emergence of ISIL.  The Sunni population contained the soldiers and the military familes of the Baath party.  In essence, ISIS is  Iraqis of Sunni persuasion who are now finally rising up against the Shiite Militias, after a near decade of being killed by them, while governments &quot;turned the other way.&quot;  (The governments here being al-Maliki in Baghdad and Bashar al-Assad in Damascus.)  </p>

<p>For one reason or another, the Western powers who have a stake in the Middle East have made it their unspoken policy to side with Shiite Militias in Iraq and Syria.   The way the USA, France, and others have done this, is to  scrub the dialogue of all mentions of the crimes of Shiite Militias , and to create a group called &quot;ISIS&quot; and make them out as heinous in the media. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Iraq’s government has ordered the militias to stay away from the fighting inside the city. And the U.S. military says it refuses to give them air support, fearing that their involvement could help the Islamic State rally besieged residents to its cause.</p>

<p>The militias “are sectarian just like Daesh is sectarian,” said Majid al-Juraisi, a tribal leader from the city who fled to Baghdad when the Islamic State took control.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>thanks for the input, it&#39;s good to hear I&#39;m not the only one who thinks this. and I think it&#39;s healthy to repeat this now and then, to keep people&#39;s attention on it</p>

<p>special thanks to the people collecting the documentation, it&#39;s the closest thing we can hope to have as proof</p>
