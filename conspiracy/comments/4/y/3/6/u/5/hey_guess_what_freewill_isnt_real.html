<p>Free-will isn&#39;t real. You don&#39;t make choices, you analyze to the extent of your experience. It is &#39;divining&#39;.</p>

<p>You are an extension of a singularity without beginning. An angel, literally.</p>

<p>Only insane angels pay tribute to other insane angels that say pride is good and evil is real.</p>

<p>Good luck. The truth is supremely horrifying yet still must be faced. Patience is so much more than most know. With it there is no future that cannot be dealt with sanely... when you don&#39;t know what to do, patience.</p>

<p>... also there is no do. :)</p>

<p>That&#39;s what.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A worship of patience as we realize the hell we dug ourselves (incidentally, patience is the religion of ninjas).</p>

<p>We continue moving and adjusting for the future with whatever means and disciplines we have. </p>

<p>The wisdom of fate bursts a dam of subwisdoms. The more prominent of which is the impossibility of evil which reveals the absurdity of hate. Even the worst of us can only ever be insane, never evil. </p>

<p>Patience, people generally don&#39;t remember they are the Bhudda overnight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hence patience. With patience you always have enough and there is no trauma or anxiety that cannot be faced. It is patience that allows us to see hell without falling victim to rage or panic... it is patience that allows for intelligence greater than rage or panic.</p>

<p>To love truth is to both see greatest beauty and greatest sadness (which is where the high wisdom of patience will find you if you hadn&#39;t found it yet)... my pinnacle thought had me crying hard for a week. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>nervous breakdowns can be faced mindfully and responsibly... it is sort of like a birth in its &#39;happening now and there is nothing you can do about it&#39; spirit. hence my eternal emphasizing of patience. </p>

<p>Patience is required on so many levels. dealing with grand thoughts and dealing with a life immersed in &#39;the comfortable lie&#39; and dealing with friends and family that are not yet ready to delve into the harder truths aka there is an ostrisization, but it passes as character develops. Truth brings a standard forgiving of all silliness and stupidity... no one truly wants to be insane, we&#39;re just in hell and hell sucks balls. Patience is the way out. (I know how I sound here).</p>

<p>PS: the nin in ninja is a word for patience (they have a reputation for being invisible because they know they are things of nature, so they don&#39;t look out of place)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As you look to how you are creating your reality, you must also take into account all of reality and all of its angles, for there are many. Each action that you choose may not in actuality be directly related to the action quite previous to it. It may appear that the action is following within a line of probabilities or within a line of events, but this is not always the case; although simultaneously it shall also fit into the scheme of present motion, but it may hold ramifications beyond the present circumstances.</p>

<p>You do not think to yourselves of the influences that are pressing to you continuously. You hold many focuses within essence. You hold many alternates within one focus. Your future self, as you think of it, is also quite influencing of your present. This is not to say, once again, that you hold no objective control and direction, for you hold all. You only do not look to your own action.</p>

<p>I express to you that the smallest actions that you alter within a daily routine are precisely chosen. You may awaken one morning and you may be choosing to comb your hair differently. You may choose to eat your porridge before your coffee or tea, as opposed to your normal routine of sipping your tea or coffee first. These seem to be insignificant alterations, but these also are conscious choices and affect you; for you have chosen, within this particular day, a different routine. You have chosen to alter your methods, and within this you alter the whole of you. Your perception changes. You may not notice a dramatic alteration of perception, but your perception shall alter. This is a very slight, small example which offers a very slight, small alteration of your reality; but it is an example of how each choice is created, which alters your perception and also creates your existing reality.</p>

<p>Actually, the choosing aspect of reality is much larger. It&#39;s an expansive drama, with intents for explorations that have a wider meaning or deeper impulse. Life intents, or soul intents. The influences of one life to another. There are many angles though it would require a different perception about what you are to understand fully the choices you make. You won&#39;t understand choice by claiming it doesnt exist. </p>

<p>It is all objective choices. You are not walking through this physical reality asleep! You are not engaging other individuals or your employment within your dreams! You are awake. You are objective. You are thinking. You are choosing. Your choices are made objectively. You are directing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s probably more accurate to say a culture of free will can&#39;t coexist in a community where some faction plays by another set of rules that excludes free will.  In other words free will isn&#39;t compatible with total control freaks, and the latter are definitely here among us and they rule the roost.  Someday if people evolve to a higher culture level we can have both free will and some benefits of social communion, but until then we&#39;re under the subjugation of criminal sociopaths because to them it&#39;s a game of winners vs losers and they intend to come out on top regardless of the consequences.</p>
