       Hey. Guess what.
      </p>
      <p>
       Free-will isn't real. You don't make choices, you analyze to the extent of your experience. It is 'divining'.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are an extension of a singularity without beginning. An angel, literally.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only insane angels pay tribute to other insane angels that say pride is good and evil is real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck. The truth is supremely horrifying yet still must be faced. Patience is so much more than most know. With it there is no future that cannot be dealt with sanely... when you don't know what to do, patience.
      </p>
      <p>
       ... also there is no do. :)

      <p>

       A worship of patience as we realize the hell we dug ourselves (incidentally, patience is the religion of ninjas).

       We continue moving and adjusting for the future with whatever means and disciplines we have.

       The wisdom of fate bursts a dam of subwisdoms. The more prominent of which is the impossibility of evil which reveals the absurdity of hate. Even the worst of us can only ever be insane, never evil.

       Hence patience. With patience you always have enough and there is no trauma or anxiety that cannot be faced. It is patience that allows us to see hell without falling victim to rage or panic... it is patience that allows for intelligence greater than rage or panic.
      </p>
      <p>
       To love truth is to both see greatest beauty and greatest sadness (which is where the high wisdom of patience will find you if you hadn't found it yet)... my pinnacle thought had me crying hard for a week.

       nervous breakdowns can be faced mindfully and responsibly... it is sort of like a birth in its 'happening now and there is nothing you can do about it' spirit. hence my eternal emphasizing of patience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Patience is required on so many levels. dealing with grand thoughts and dealing with a life immersed in 'the comfortable lie' and dealing with friends and family that are not yet ready to delve into the harder truths aka there is an ostrisization, but it passes as character develops. Truth brings a standard forgiving of all silliness and stupidity... no one truly wants to be insane, we're just in hell and hell sucks balls. Patience is the way out. (I know how I sound here).
      </p>
      <p>
       PS: the nin in ninja is a word for patience (they have a reputation for being invisible because they know they are things of nature, so they don't look out of place)

       Patience be with you. All motion is a single motion and it goes back forever. You are God. Your opinions form via your experiences, just like everyone else ever. The truth, however, remains static- the whole of all is a single thing with recognizable fundamental parameters. The is is and anything suggesting otherwise is false.

       Essentially, a belief in free-will is an indication of the planets most prominent brainwashing scheme.

       As you look to how you are creating your reality, you must also take into account all of reality and all of its angles, for there are many. Each action that you choose may not in actuality be directly related to the action quite previous to it. It may appear that the action is following within a line of probabilities or within a line of events, but this is not always the case; although simultaneously it shall also fit into the scheme of present motion, but it may hold ramifications beyond the present circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do not think to yourselves of the influences that are pressing to you continuously. You hold many focuses within essence. You hold many alternates within one focus. Your future self, as you think of it, is also quite influencing of your present. This is not to say, once again, that you hold no objective control and direction, for you hold all. You only do not look to your own action.
      </p>
      <p>
       I express to you that the smallest actions that you alter within a daily routine are precisely chosen. You may awaken one morning and you may be choosing to comb your hair differently. You may choose to eat your porridge before your coffee or tea, as opposed to your normal routine of sipping your tea or coffee first. These seem to be insignificant alterations, but these also are conscious choices and affect you; for you have chosen, within this particular day, a different routine. You have chosen to alter your methods, and within this you alter the whole of you. Your perception changes. You may not notice a dramatic alteration of perception, but your perception shall alter. This is a very slight, small example which offers a very slight, small alteration of your reality; but it is an example of how each choice is created, which alters your perception and also creates your existing reality.

       Actually, the choosing aspect of reality is much larger. It's an expansive drama, with intents for explorations that have a wider meaning or deeper impulse. Life intents, or soul intents. The influences of one life to another. There are many angles though it would require a different perception about what you are to understand fully the choices you make. You won't understand choice by claiming it doesnt exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is all objective choices. You are not walking through this physical reality asleep! You are not engaging other individuals or your employment within your dreams! You are awake. You are objective. You are thinking. You are choosing. Your choices are made objectively. You are directing.

       and you think you could have said something differently, though your character reacted exactly how its experience dictated when you were inspired to comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone was literally lied to about free-will. 'choice' is an analytical process, not a inspiration from nowhere process.

       Its why Jesus was murdered. He knew the truth that will lead people to rather every suffering than ever paying taxes again... I digress...

       It's probably more accurate to say a culture of free will can't coexist in a community where some faction plays by another set of rules that excludes free will.  In other words free will isn't compatible with total control freaks, and the latter are definitely here among us and they rule the roost.  Someday if people evolve to a higher culture level we can have both free will and some benefits of social communion, but until then we're under the subjugation of criminal sociopaths because to them it's a game of winners vs losers and they intend to come out on top regardless of the consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine a scenario of 1000 people living together in a community where 999 of them want to live in freedom but one person desires to exert control and domination over everyone else.

        In this scenario none of the people can ever be free.
       </a>
       Even the person who desires to dominate the others is locked into a system where free choice becomes impossible.

       Truth is the truth. In this time people are fated to think choice is real. We've been confusing the divining process and it made the world a hell of blame and spite. Hiding this truth was the main reason Christianity was coopted by Rome. Pride is a delusion that made psychotic retards of us all

       Not what I was talking about and you know it. Fact you're trying the bait 'n' switch shows exactly how much I nailed it. So you're definitely under 25. Under 20? In college? Still in high school, maybe? If the latter, props to you, actually -- few your age can even imagine tapping into patience.
