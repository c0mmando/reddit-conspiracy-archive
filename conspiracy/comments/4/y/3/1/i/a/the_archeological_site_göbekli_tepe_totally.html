       Another place that is extremely interesting is Puma Punku, on the shores of Lake Titicaca, Bolivia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Built at an elevation of nearly 13,000 feet above sea level on the cold, dry and windswept Andean Altiplano, it is an extremely harsh and unfriendly place for human habituation, yet it was inhabited by a very technologically advanced civilization. It contains some of the most highly sophisticated precision stonework known to archaeologists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Puma Punku is distinct from the nearby site of Tiwanaku, which was allegedly built long after Puma Punku was abandoned - having been decimated by unknown catastrophic forces - quite possibly a tsunami-like flood of global proportions - possibly from a massive meteor strike, or some other event that literally "rocked their world".
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I am entertaining the theory that these ancients somehow foresaw the coming of such an event, and, understanding the potential ramifications, sought refuge in one of the few places on earth that might possibly (A) be high enough in altitude to escape the devastation, and; (B) still be hospitable enough that they could grow food and sustain life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently they were wrong about (A).

       I was going to mention this as it is usually looked over in favor of Gobleki. To me Puma Punku is far more interesting because of the immense amount of precision (no deviation of more than .001" per foot!) in a material that almost no one built out of (Diorite) because it is so damn hard. Hell, the Egyptians used Diorite tools to shape granite, and here is a structure composed almost entirely of Diorite with some of these precision cut stones weighing upwards of 800 tons! A structure like this would be close to impossible to build with the same accuracy now!
      </p>
      <p>
       And still everyone brings up Gobleki Tepe. We have most certainly been sold a false bill of sale in regards to history. I am still trying to figure out exactly what the benefit is in suppressing history.

       I thought Pumapunku had been dated to have been built around 600 AD, while Gobleki was dated to have been from around 10th century BC.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also don't think it's being suppressed so to speak, just that these sites were discovered fairly recently (late 1960s). There appears to be plenty of info around on these types of sites

       Well one can't carbon-date Diorite (or anything without carbon in it) and the pottery shards around the site are attributed to a tribe of indigenous peoples from around that time. But said tribe had no system of writing and had barely figured how to make stone tools, so I think we can say said tribe didn't carve highly accurate, jointed together (these block fit together like puzzle pieces btw), giant blocks out of the second hardest naturally occurring mineral on earth, and then destroyed it with some catastrophic force no surrounding culture noticed... I am open to most theories but I'm just not buying that one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another interesting fact of Puma Punku is that these blocks show
       <strong>
        no
       </strong>
       tool marks. Even the sides that haven't been exposed to the elements for gods know how long.  Many different experts have gone to this site and none have yet to come up with a decent explanation of exactly how these stones were carved. This site, as with many others, raises far more questions than the elementary explanations usually given for them.

       There is the theory that the blocks were cast in place using some unknown recipe. Much like the limestone blocks of the Pyramids of Giza. Casting limestone blocks has been scientifically proven.

       What I found pretty damn interesting about Globeki Tepe is the fact that the place has been burried on purpose and really seem to be, like Graham Hancock said, a time capsule.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is freaking huge, bigger than any site that we know of so far. I just can't imagine the things that are still hidden underground and are yet to be discover.
      </p>
      <p>
       And since it was burried, nothing has been contaminated.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know how long it will take to dig up all of this place, but damn, I'm so curious about what is going to be found there.

       Don't get me wrong, I find Goblekli Tepe just as interesting and I don't want to down-play its significance, but there are so many sites scattered across the globe that question currently held, main-stream academic beliefs that it is difficult to focus on all of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       South America has a number monumental structures whose alignment (the way in which the structures are laid out) would only make sense if they were built 25,000+ years ago. The stone walls without mortar that didn't even shift a centimeter during some of the strongest recorded quakes in modern times.  And there are many more that I could list for this continent alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is so much that isn't even acknowledged much less discussed that I tend to start to dislike these "novelty" sites (by which I mean they are so new that many people get distracted by the shiny of it that they drop unanswered questions by the road-side. Feels like it is on purpose to me) because of the attention and funding they draw from other sites. Do we hear much about the library they are excavating at Herculaneum? The second largest depository of ancient knowledge in the world at the time (Alexandria being the first) Mount Vesuvius erupted, and most of it was preserved from what I last heard (and they were finally getting down to the level where the really juicy stuff was stored like the Greek histories).
      </p>
      <p>
       So much to study and the ass-hats in charge would rather hoard power and wealth instead.

       You seem to have gotten most of your information on Puma Punku from
       <em>
        Ancient Aliens
       </em>
       or similar sources. Unfortunately, most of that info stems from Von Daniken, and is wrong.

       Hold on there, I have never stated nor expressed a belief that ancient extraterrestrials are responsible for Puma Punku. Please don't assume you know my position. My position is: sites like this show direct evidence that humanity (and technological advancement as it is sold to us through media and academia) is much older than we are lead to believe. I personally
       <strong>
        do not
       </strong>
       ascribe to the ancient aliens theory and I believe that sites like this are proof of our potential as a species and that humanity alone is responsible for it.  Imo, the ancient aliens theory
       <em>
        as it is presented
       </em>
       is insulting and a cop-out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back to Puma Punku. Attributing the site to Yaya Mama is presumptive as it assumes such a tribe could never and would never settle on an older site (which is rarely considered), and the "dating" of that site is biased because it is done on the artifacts left
       <em>
        by
       </em>
       the Yaya Mama. Dating of the stones themselves can't accurately be done due to the lack of measurable carbon. But look! Pottery fragment from a tribe of people we know for sure lived here... Do you see how it might be a bit too much of a logical leap to attribute a complex (no debating that fact) megalithic structure to a culture that had barely mastered flint knapping?
      </p>
      <p>
       The accuracy of the stone that I mentioned earlier are accurate and I never said it was impossible, just
       <em>
        close to
       </em>
       impossible. What do I mean by this? I mean, given our current economic system, the materials involved, the accuracy and planning necessary, the methods currently available to us for shaping and moving said materials, that such a construction project would be so difficult and costly to us
       <em>
        now
       </em>
       that it would be considered "impossible".  Could we do it? Of course we could. Again, don't lump me into "ancient aliens" theorists simply because my argument
       <em>
        sounds
       </em>
       similar (but isn't).
      </p>
      <p>
       On to the tool marks. Ancient aliens would have us believe extraterrestrials came down and used, or showed us how to use, some energy/sonic tool that carved the channels and holes to such an accuracy. Others of the same school say the builders of this site used diamond embedded tool bits on power tools. Both methods should have left tell-tale tool marks to confirm this. But there are none. One argument is that the weather wiped away the traces of said marks, but diorite weathers
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       slowly and, if true, would imply the site is much older than 300-600 ad. My own theory is that the tech used was some form of high pressure water jet perhaps mixed with an abrasive, but that is just my theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       And finally, what falsities did I put forward? Many of the blocks
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       Diorite. The accuracy of the channels
       <em>
        doesn't
       </em>
       deviate more than .001" per foot. Some of the Diorite blocks
       <em>
        indeed
       </em>
       weigh upwards of 800 tons (with some as low ~8 tons). The Egyptians
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       use tools made from Diorite to shape granite. And
       <em>
        most
       </em>
       monolithic structures we find are made of a stone softer than Diorite (for what should be obvious reasons). All of these are confirmed facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the future I would appreciate it if you would check with me before lumping me into a group that I am not now, nor ever been, akin to. Btw, the "debunking"paper you linked to makes as many assumptions about the site as the group they are trying to disprove and that muddies the waters of history as much as introducing a set of falsities does. ;-)

       I didn't say you did. Most of your bizarre explosion of a reply is (ironically enough) the result of a bad assumption on your part.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just said you got your information from "Ancient Aliens or similar sources", and given the set of info your presenting it's clear you did.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did NOT say that you believed Puma Punku was built by aliens, however. You can get "facts" (factoids) from that show without believing its conclusions.

       You certainly implied it. And you saying I get my info there is speculation and light slander. But it is a good diversion on your part to try and turn the focus from Puma Punku to my credibility. At least I am presenting some facts, even your "debunking" paper is more editorial than presentation of fact. Much like your response.

       Yeah, there were a lot of far-fetched presumptions and flawed information that came with that Ancient Alien series...

       OTOH, you seem to be a True Believer in the infallibility of the "debunkers" you cited.

       “One of the most intriguing thing there is it that the stones that were used there weren’t sandstone, they’re
       <strong>
        granite and diorite
       </strong>
       . The only stone that is harder than diorite is diamond, so the only way this could have been achieved is if the tools were tipped with diamonds.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        DEBUNKSTER:
       </strong>
       This is funny because it’s totally wrong, the stones are not granite or diorite at Pumapunku, they are Red Sandstone and
       <strong>
        Andesite
       </strong>
       ...
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay, so it was NOT Diorite, it was ANDESITE!!!! So what's
       <strong>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andesite">
         Andesite?

      <p>
       Oooh! So maybe the Ancient Aliens guys were not that far off after all? But wait, your DEBUNKER guy is about to
       <strong>
        Double Down

       "Well yeah, actually it is sandstone."
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, both andesite and red sandstone were used at Puma Punku, but your Debunkster scoffs at the
       <strong>
        Ancient Aliens
       </strong>
       guys' gaff of using the term "diorite" - which, as shown above,
       <em>
        is extremely similar to Andesite
       </em>
       - but the Debunkster does NOT bother to mention that, does he? Then he goes on to IMPLY that
       <strong>
        all
       </strong>
       of the stones were actually just SANDSTONE - but this is not the case: Those stones that show the most sophisticated carvings were
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       sandstone, but Andesite.
      </p>
      <p>
       And your boy is trying to claim that he his integrity and intellect is superior to that of the people he is trying to "debunk"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Moving right along, your boy continues...
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        DEBUNKSTER:
       </strong>
       The sandstone and andesite stones at Pumapunku would have been
       <strong>
        easily worked with the most basic stone working tools
       </strong>
       [5][6], the idea that diamond tipped power saws were needed is ridiculous. The red sandstone was relatively soft and easy to work with,
       <strong>
        and even though andesite is pretty hard
       </strong>
       , because of the way it cooled it could be easily flaked off using stones as soft as 5.5 on the Mohs scale.[7]
      </p>
      <p>
       So, to demonstrate the overall tone of dishonesty that your Debunkster Boy demonstrates, FIRST he berates the Ancient Alien crowd for what was essentially a semantic error, the implication being that, because the stones were NOT diorite, as they said, they were not as HARD as diorite. RIGHT?
      </p>
      <p>
       So, is that true? Is andesite really softer than diorite?

       I am being drawn closer to the theory of the growing earth to explain these disasters. Water is under us building up...under heavy pressure which is causing quakes. Eventually something gives and the water gets released. 3 times the size of our oceans worth of water escapes, causes the devastation.

       This is the second time I've heard someone mention this theory. I will absolutely check out that video later that you posted below.
      </p>
      <p>
       The theory that I have subscribed to for the last few years is from the work of Graham Hancock and Randall Carlson. Check out this JRE episode (it is far and away my favorite one). They discuss the idea that two comets struck the continental ice sheets, essentially ending the ice age overnight, causing massive flooding. Graham goes into Gobekli Tepe a lot as well.

       The thing about "pangea" is that it wasn't some continent surrounded by an ocean. It was the entire surface of the earth. This is why there are remains of old oceans in places we cannot explain with current plate tectonic theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       The growing earth theory also explains why life forms used to be so much larger then they are now. Because the atmospheric pressure of earth has changed. PV = nRT.

        Randall Carlson
       </a>
       has some very interesting ideas about the origins of civilization.
       <br/>
       There's the possibility that the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphinx_water_erosion_hypothesis">
        Sphinx is actually thousands of years older than we believe
       </a>
       , and we're finding evidence of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunung_Padang_Megalithic_Site">
        Pyramids that predate the Egyptian Pyramids
       </a>
       (Buckminster Fuller
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Path_(book">
        believed civilization originated in the Pacific atolls
       </a>
       check out the Chapter 1 link).
      </p>
      <p>
       Randall's theory isn't very extraterrestrial or celestial, he believes that it's possible that humanity has been as advanced as we are now, and that civilization has 'restarted' several times due to cataclysmic events such as asteroid impacts leading to ice ages and the collapse of civilization, which I think is a really interesting idea and he presents a great argument for it.
       <br/>
       He mentions that Gobekli Tepe was buried on purpose and explores why they might have done it.
       <br/>
       He also ties his ideas into mythology and folk lore, linking the Little Ice Age to the story of Arthur and the Holy Grail, as well as linking Plato's account of the sinking of Atlantis to change in sea level about 12,000 BC.  He also dives into all of the mythologies shared by cultures such as great floods, flying machines, etc. (What if they actually happened, and we're interpreting them as mythology or something extraterrestrial? It's an interesting idea, at least).
      </p>
      <p>
       Alot of people like to call him a "fringe" scientist or whatever, but as we've seen throughout history so many people who were right were condemned by society (and in far worse ways).

       Yeah, there's no way that it started with the Pacific atolls, since literally everything within the languages, cultures, and dna point to ISEA, which is the sunken continent of Sundaland. That's the best bet, IMO, and there's very old evidence, including stone structures like the rante' stones which are similar to gobleki tepe, an pyramids.

       Bucky's "Speculative Prehistory of Humanity" theorizes humans started developing in the Atolls based on a few ideas, but his theory isnt too far off from the Sundaland theory, though he believes we started in the water and the islands in that region, learned how to build boats,  developed navigation based on the stars and eventually moved inland during the glacial periods and eventually over thousands of years made our way to Asia Minor.

       I posted this above, but wanted to make sure you saw it as well. Have you seen the JRE episode with both Randall Carlson AND Graham Hancock? It is even more mind blowing than Randall's episode is. If you haven't, I can't recommend it enough.

       This is likely closer to the truth about humanity, but academics tend to resist it becoming orthodoxy for a variety of reasons.

       How is it not being investigated? There is an ongoing archaeological dig.
      </p>
      <p>
       The site seems to be used for sky burial. This means putting out bodies in a contained area for vultures to consume.
      </p>
      <p>
       Creating this that long ago would have taken significant effort. Also,  it was intentionally buried, why? The size and purpose of this makes it seem like there must be one or more equally ancient cities in the area that made use of this burial site. A lot of the most ancient sites are buried under the most modern cities.

       The people who make this argument fall into two categories.
      </p>
      <p>
       A. They fear what his theories would do to human civilization if he turns out to be correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       B. They've never actually listened to what he has to say, and/or are going off of inaccurate reviews/opinions of Graham and his work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, some of his stuff is based on speculation, but so is most of Egyptology and any other study of ancient cultures! When you take all of the information into consideration, Graham's theories and ideas are just as "provable" and credible as the mainstream paradigm. People (especially academics and scientists) become extremely offended/butt hurt/angry when anyone tries to challenge an idea that they've dedicated their entire life to learning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine what would happen if we learned, definitively, that everything we have been taught about ancient Egypt and the pyramids is a complete fairy tale, just an educated (though ultimately incorrect) guess. People would begin to question EVERYTHING they have learned as fact! Right down to the timeline of human evolution. That would massively disrupt nearly every area of academia and science.

       "Sure some of it is speculation"

       you're first mistake was thinking he was stating facts. he never claimed to be right about everything, they are called theories for a reason. its all about the exploration of ideas and concepts in order to get closer to the truth. people shouldn't fear exploring these ideas no matter how ridiculous their own ideology may find them and shouldn't get upset when new information comes out that expands on that theory, branches off in another direction all together, or completely disproves it. that's what makes this all exciting in the first place.

       Nah, you have "meta" in your name, and you started off your comment with the wrong form of Your/Youre then spouted more bullshit so I just figured, ya know.
      </p>
      <p>
       But anyways, the guy said anyone who thinks Hancockis wrong  is either scared of the truth or hasnt really looked at what he says. Then he continued to do the same thing as you which is deflect from logic. My comment is saying that the more likely truth is just that people studied Hancock and maybe even were convinced by it (like I once was)  until they realized his shit is purposefully missing out a lot of facts to help his arguments. Its like Ancient Aliens. Its like the crackpot Nassheim whatever his name. Some of their theories might be true, some of what they say might be true, but overall they are shams or at best just optimistic/delusional. If your answer to this is "everything is speculation!" Then Im sorry but this is exactly what Im talking about. No one takes this shit seriously

       thanks for the reply and i understand more clearly where you're coming from. I just don't understand why people get angry when researchers explore these out of the box outlandish ideas where these ancient anomalies exist because there really may be something there. ...Because there is "something" there. Maybe its not aliens (and i am NOT talking about ancient aliens, that show is garbage), or whatever but the anomalies are there, and there is fascinating missing information with potential unknown implications to be discovered. I have a feeling people get angry after feeling they have discovered something amazing through these books and theories ( such as Hancock's) and feel conned after realizing he didn't get as the facts straight. It doesn't  by any means discredit everything he has done though.

       The issue is not genuine exploration by genuine researchers.

      <p>
       The issue is with people making factual claims without evidence or with forged evidence and presenting their unsupported ideas as facts.

       It also lends support to the theories of Hancock, Carlson, et al. who propose that civilization is much older and more advanced than currently given credit for.

       ISIS have the perfect MO for it: anything that pokes holes in their fundamentalism must be destroyed. Unfortunately in this case Gobekli Tepe pokes holes in ALL fundamentalist religions, including scientific materialism the religion of all academics.

       </strong>
       This discovery at Gøbekli Tepe fits in perfectly with previous records from the neolithic period in the Levant region. Primitive signs (early) of agriculture started approximately 12.000 BC, maybe even earlier, in the Levant, in Iran and in Afghan region (I am currently not updated about the Chinese regions). No mystery to be found here, just a lot of nonsense in stilts in the comments section.

         Currently I am not working as an Archaeologist, university was great fun, but finding a full time job as an Archaeologist in Denmark is almost impossible, full time employment for archaeologists is properly somewhere between 5-10%.

         I read quite extensively about the Levant/Iran/Egypt/Turkey paleolithic and neolithic period, about 10-12 years ago, during my studies in Denmark, I have afterwards from time to time read publications or news articles concerning the subject. I tended to gravitate towards the paleolithic period, the early Neolithic´s and the Germanic Iron age (Vikings).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Sources... my God... you can't just ask people for sources (you may laugh)... a lot of books, articles, new and old, has been written on the subject of early neolithic agriculture. Some of the texts were literally a 100 years old. The Israeli, Turkish and foreign (German/English) sources tend to be quite good. I properly still have a few old boxes, buried deep in my basement, with books and articles.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        thesis?

      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Agriculture started very early in the Levant (15.000-12.000 BC), very gradually, with seasonal gatherings of crops (grain), which very slowly tuned into semi-agricultural practices (planting crops). This is before our ancestors actually started to build permanent settlements. Husbandry and permanent settlements (8.000 BC), as you see them in Gøbekli, is just the "end result" of this gradual change over a long period of time. Afghanistan, Iran, India and China also slowly developed agricultural societies, with semi-permanent and permanent settlements. Do remember that Turkey, North Africa, Mediterranean, Levant, Middle East and Iran was pretty much covered in was savanna and forests. Hunting and gathering would still have played central role, even if we categorize them as early agricultural societies.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Categorizing stuff in archaeology is done via artificial constructs. The neolithic period (Gøbekli) is our Paleolithic period (Denmark). Pottery and stone tools, in itself extensive subjects, are frustratingly messy and arbitrary at times. Thank God for carbon dating :-)

       Yeah, there's no way that it started with the Pacific atolls, since literally everything within the languages, cultures, and dna point to ISEA, which is the sunken continent of Sundaland. That's the best bet, IMO, and there's very old evidence, including stone structures like the rante' stones which are similar to gobleki tepe, an pyramids.

       I posted this above, but wanted to make sure you saw it as well. Have you seen the JRE episode with both Randall Carlson AND Graham Hancock? It is even more mind blowing than Randall's episode is. If you haven't, I can't recommend it enough.

        Randall's theory isn't very extraterrestrial or celestial, he believes that it's possible that humanity has been as advanced as we are now, and that civilization has 'restarted' several times due to cataclysmic events such as asteroid impacts leading to ice ages and the collapse of civilization, which I think is a really interesting idea and he presents a great argument for it.

       This is likely closer to the truth about humanity, but academics tend to resist it becoming orthodoxy for a variety of reasons.

       What was Carlson's theory about why they buried Gobekli Tepe? I've heard it mentioned many times but never heard about the motive.

       Exactly! It would be nice, what with all this rapid technological development we are currently experiencing, if science would come up with and better, perhaps more accurate form of determining the age of things.
