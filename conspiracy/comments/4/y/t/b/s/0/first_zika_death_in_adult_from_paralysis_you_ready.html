      <p>
       The same old dog and pony show that gets run every year or two.
      </p>
      <p>
       Avian Flu, Swine Flu, Ebola, Zika.
      </p>
      <p>
       The existential threat that keeps people coming back for their regularly scheduled inoculations. Gives people something to keep the fear hamster wheel turning.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a serious pandemic hits it won't be in the news till well after the damage is done.

       I've always thought, what if they intentionally sensationalized those past "virus scares" you listed so that people will develop that exact mindset? A sort of "boy who cried wolf" scenario.

       So they're going to use Zika, which  has tenuous links to negative effects on a small percentage of pregnant women and their unborn children?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ebola would have been far more useful as a depopulation tool if it is as effective in countries with running water as its reported to be in countries without infrastructure.

       There's too much of a heads up for me to buy it. Messiahs tend to step in for souls in unexpected crisis, not warn publicly ahead of time. That's usually PR and advertising at work.

       I've read somewhere that Zika is unique and can increase in virulence. I'm no virologist obviously, and I can't recall where I saw that, but if it's true, things could get out of hand quickly.

       This is getting under reported. They are dumping thousands of these Zika infected Mosquitos across the states. By their own Stats they say 1 in 4 Puerto Ricans will have it.

       NPR is running Zika  25% as much as Trump stories in my locality. Which is about as much as they were running Ebola.

      <p>
       What's your source on the mosquitoes being infected with Zika rather than the bacteria that makes the mosquitoes sterile and incapable of transmitting Zika?

       They underreporting the danger. Think of it like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Originally they said it just effected newborns. Then seemingly overnight "a new study" showed that it effected adult brains as well.

       Well guess what?

       The website that holds the patent on the virus, has the characterised listed as paralysis and death.

       It was patented in 1947. There have most likely been extensive studies on the virus. They know exactly what it does.
      </p>

       It kills.

       Eh, we've seen reporting on potential for GBS since at least January. Three deaths this year with Zika links in reportedly highly infected South &amp; Central America.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without some sources that can confirm the death toll is much higher than that reported, or that the rate of infection is much lower than reported, my concern will remain at Flu level. Skeptical, but open to change based on new information.

       If so, my general assessment of pop culture is that it shares a lot in common with the Bible. Rife with allegory, touches on eternal truth, generally a poor compass regarding current events.

       Could you put a link to the zika death article in your self.text, and also the relevant timestamp(s) for the video? Actually, I just got to the point. It starts at about 8:20. Just to clarify, it says "2013 was practice, 2014 was the warm-up," but same general meaning I guess.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not going to say I know your theory is wrong, but I will say it feels like a bit of a stretch. The 2013 practice/2014 warm-up slide is so vague as to seem applicable to almost anything in retrospect. It could be referring to Zika, but it could just as easily mean something else, or nothing in particular.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as Zika causing brain damage in adults, I think that conclusion might be a bit premature. The study was done in part by Rockefeller University, formerly Rockefeller Institute. Any time I see that name pop up, alarm bells go off. Check out James Corbett's excellent documentary on "Rockefeller Medicine" for more info on their connection with allopathic medicine.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see this data point as fitting equally well with both the Zika-as-depopulation-agent and Zika-as-scare-tactic theories. If you need to try to make Zika a big scary threat, you need to make it seem scary for adults as well as pregnant women.
      </p>
      <p>
       No Agenda has included Zika in a number of recent episodes, and their general theory seems to be that it's being used in part to get funds released that were initially meant for Ebola. Basically, a number of countries and NGOs pledge money to fight Ebola, but after the African epidemic was subdued, they didn't actually give that pledged money. They go over the numbers in their podcast, but their claim is that the amount of money Obama is asking for to fight Zika is the same amount of money pledged for Ebola that was never delivered. I don't know how to find the specific segments where they talked about it, but if you want, I can look them up for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, I haven't made up my mind on this, though I do lean towards Zika as a scare tactic. That said, I think with any of these "Big Operations," there's a number prongs to the plan, and a number of benefits for the actors. I think this is certainly being used to move money around between certain players, and I think the GMO mosquitoes were in the works for a while, and needed a Big Problem to convince the public to roll them out. This iteration might even be benign, but laying the groundwork for a future rollout that will have some intended adverse effect.

       The WHO shirt? Maybe. Or maybe it just means "who?" Do you have a timestamp? I'm not going to wade through that 20 min video again, and if you want more people to see what you're talking about, you should give timestamps for all the slides you're trying to point out. I'm not trying to be a dick here; this is just how you get more people to dig into this.

       Your link from Bloomberg that says "zika may cause brain damage in adults too" uses its information from a study on mice, not humans. They even say so in the study.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.cell.com/cell-stem-cell/fulltext/S1934-5909(16)30252-1">

       </a>
       . So where is the link to adult brain damage? A video that makes a lot of claims with no evidence is not evidence, especially when all you can gather from the video is "2013 was practice, 2014 was the warm up" which could mean literally anything. You have 0 evidence they're talking about zika.

       Yup he died from Guillain-Barré. 30 people out of 13,000+ Zika cases in Puerto Rico have Guillain-Barré. That's a 0.231% instance rate, which hardly represents a correlation. Now one out of 30 having died from Guillain-Barré is much higher, but it's still just one.

       To be clear, my beef with your message was the video, not the Zika stuff.

       I want you to understand that the illuminati stuff is a scam and a distraction to make people who question the narrative look insane.

       They literally kill people in cold blood in plain sight.  If you think for a second that they have to hide behind music videos, you're chasing the wrong tail.  Your own.

       Okay, so let me ask you this. If you were a detective, would you not find it strange that whoever made this video, knew of these things in advance?

       You clearly have never truly met a detective and watch too much detective drama on tv.  That's not whay they do.  No mention of zika is in the video, just loltroll666.

       I can't convince you because you see the magic connections, but really, you're reaching dude.

       Your first mistake was believing the bullshit people post on YouTube.

       Your second mistake was believing the bullshit written by the mainstream media.

       The actual study was conducted on mice (which the article admits) but what the article doesn't point out:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The degree to which IFN-deficient mice model the extent and severity of flavivirus infection in humans is unknown. We recognize that healthy humans may be able to mount an effective antiviral response and prevent entry into the CNS, but it remains a possibility that some immunocompromised humans and even some apparently healthy humans may be susceptible in ways modeled by the TKO mice.
       </p>

      <p>
       In other words, they have no evidence that Zika virus affects human  brains the way it affects these mice.

       Under reported?
      </p>
      <p>
       NPR is running Zika  25% as much as Trump stories in my locality. Which is about as much as they were running Ebola.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's your source on the mosquitoes being infected with Zika rather than the bacteria that makes the mosquitoes sterile and incapable of transmitting Zika?
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong, I'm open to the possibility. But this song and dance feels an awful lot like yesteryears top 40.
