        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>False comparisons by Illuminati: Second coming of Jesus is NOW: Matthew 4:8-9 vs Chronicles 36:23</strong></p>

<p><em>An agent of the satanic illuminati writes</em>:</p>

<p>If Satan was the guy who offered Jesus all the kingdoms of the world then who was the guy who gave Israel their kingdom?</p>

<p>Compare:</p>

<p>Matthew 4:8-9 &quot;Again, the devil took Him to a very high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory; 9and he said to Him, &quot;All these things I will give You, if You fall down and worship me.&quot;</p>

<p>In the old testament it is &quot;the lord&quot; who gave king Cyrus all the kingdoms of the earth.</p>

<p>2 Chronicles 36:23 &quot;This is what Cyrus king of Persia says: &quot;&#39;The LORD, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he has appointed me to build a temple for him at Jerusalem in Judah. Any of his people among you may go up, and may the LORD their God be with them.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p><em>Last Prophet replies</em>:</p>

<p>Now for the REAL comparison: it&#39;s Matthew 4:8-9 and NOW.
Start with the context:</p>

<p>Matthew 3:3</p>

<p>John the Baptist Prepares the Way</p>

<p>“A voice of one calling in the wilderness,</p>

<p>‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.’”</p>

<p><strong>The devil in control of &quot;all the kingdoms of the world&quot;</strong>:</p>

<p>It happened before the first coming of Jesus.</p>

<p>After Armenia became the first christian kingdom in the world, it would happen again only before the second coming, NOW. </p>

<p><strong><em>Notes</em></strong></p>

<p>Cyrus the Great created the largest empire the world had yet seen.
His regal titles in full were The Great King, ... and King of the Four Corners of the World.</p>

<p>Cyrus the Great respected the customs and religions of the lands he conquered. It is said that in universal history, the role of the Achaemenid Empire founded by Cyrus lies in its very successful model for centralized administration and establishing a government working to the advantage and profit of its subjects.</p>

<p>What is sometimes referred to as the Edict of Restoration (actually two edicts) described in the Bible as being made by Cyrus the Great left a lasting legacy on the Jewish religion, where, because of his policies in Babylonia, he is referred to by the Jewish Bible as Messiah (lit. &quot;His anointed one&quot;) (Isaiah 45:1), [14] and is the only non-Jew to be called so.</p>

<p>... his famous proclamation inscribed onto Cyrus Cylinder as the oldest known declaration of human rights...</p>

<p>The Babylonians regarded him as &quot;The Liberator&quot;.</p>

<p>The Book of Ezra narrates a story of the first return of exiles in the first year of Cyrus, in which Cyrus boastfully proclaims: </p>

<p>&quot;All the kingdoms of the earth hath the LORD, the God of heaven, given me; and He hath charged me to build Him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.&quot; (Ezra 1:2).</p>

<p>This edict is also fully reproduced in the Book of Ezra.</p>

<p>The Jews honored him as a dignified and righteous king. </p>

<p>... in Isaiah, God is described as saying, &quot;I will raise up Cyrus in my righteousness: I will make all his ways straight. He will rebuild my city and set my exiles free, but not for a price or reward, says G-d Almighty.&quot; (Isaiah 45:13) As the text suggests, Cyrus did ultimately release the nation of Israel from its exile without compensation or tribute. Traditionally, the entire book of Isaiah is believed to pre-date the rule of Cyrus by about 120 years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The majority of these comments are derailing the topic that OP put forth. You &quot;science&quot; worshipers are no better than religion worshipers. </p>

<p>You&#39;re all missing important substantial points and don&#39;t realize it. Science followers that have little more than surface knowledge about any science use it as a catch all argument. Just. Like. The. Early. Church.</p>

<p>Science followers believe their authorities and take their word on conclusions the followers themselves have not independently verified. Just. Like. The. Early. Church.</p>

<p>Science followers don&#39;t seem to understand that science is a descriptive term of a <em>method</em> of understanding their environment. Religion followers don&#39;t seem to understand the texts they venerate are up to interpretation on an individual level. </p>

<p>Science followers and religion followers alike don&#39;t seem to grasp the significance of multiple texts from multiple cultures being so similar.</p>

<p>The great Gatsby won&#39;t be discussed thousands of years from now, Tolkien, Voltaire, George R.R. Martin or Dan Brown won&#39;t have fervent zealots interpreting their words and persecuting others who&#39;s views differ from theirs thousands of years from now. </p>

<p>Ffs. Neither side realizes they could work together to figure out what exactly these religions have hidden in plane sight.</p>

<p>Apply scientific method to research religious claims without starting with a conclusion. Quit being so easily manipulated by parasitic humans who negatively affect the entire world. </p>

<p>Seriously, you guys look like fools.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is because at the time of his first coming, the Hebrews were already disobeying the commandments of the lord until finally they would go into slavery.</p>

<p>You have to remember, Satan is not real, it means adversary. If someone is stopping you from doing what you are supposed to do, they are Satan. Also used for someone who thinks only of the flesh and not of the spirit, one nation that did this a lot was Edom.</p>

<p>In this sense it becomes clear that Satan meant that Jesus was speaking of whom ever offering him the world (wants of the flesh) was not of his own kind nor followed God in spirit. </p>

<p>This definition of Satan is clear when we see that Jesus refers to Peter as Satan because he doesn&#39;t want Jesus to go and be killed, which was the main reason his coming was foretold. </p>

<p>Cyrus on the other hand was blessed by GOD to rule because the Israelite&#39;s did not need to rule in this manner as God would protect them anyways. Therefore the shared humbleness between Cyrus and the Hebrews were a strong synergy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, my own thought process led me to that belief. I used to be Christian, Baptist actually. If you were to take the time to actually read the whole bible and try to apply it to find answers to the natural world, you would fail. The only reason you&#39;re typing a reply is because of science, which tends to contradict the bible.  The reason you can go to school or work in your vehicle is because of science, not God. The reason you have clothes is because of science. Your entire world is possible because of the scientific method. Why? It works. It gives results. Prayer does not, just ask the next amputee victim you see.</p>

<p>I ask again, can you prove God exists?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The scientific method has led to discoveries that prove the earth is much more than 6000 years old, both geologic and astronomical. It proves it&#39;s impossible to walk on water with surface tension and buoyancy forces. It&#39;s proven that the Ark was impossible as no wooden ship can withstand it&#39;s own weight the length and size, even while empty, in the water. Much more of an impossibility when you take 20,000 creatures and put them on that ship. Geologic evidence also disproves the flood as fossils aren&#39;t found in stratigraphic layers they aren&#39;t supposed to be in.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just a few.</p>

<p>The scientific method works because literally anyone can use it. It&#39;s all about how honest you are with it and how much effort you put into it. You don&#39;t need institutions/schools to use the scientific method. Just be willing to learn more as you go, because to understand astronomy you will need some physics and calculus. Each topic requires you to have some sort of prior knowledge. The interesting thing is that all of that knowledge that was built prior was built using the scientific method. If you don&#39;t believe me, if you&#39;re willing to put enough time and energy, you could invent calculus right now using reasoning and deduction and some mathematical skills.</p>

<p>If I&#39;m being honest, I don&#39;t believe that there is a 0% chance there is no God. But if there is, it&#39;s not the Christian God. And there is and never has been actual evidence that proves God is a possibility. All I ask for is proof.</p>

<p>Been having trouble finding it, but there&#39;s a verse that even says that if doubters ask for evidence, give it to them. I&#39;ve never gotten that evidence. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll answer this one, though.  Then I would appreciate it if you could address the issues I brought up.</p>

<p>Given that the location of Egypt was still in the same lattitude as the time the bible makes its claims, I will assume that Egyptians were a mix of dark to light brown people, depending on the origins of its peoples.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_race_controversy">A quick wiki search shows that the topic is still highly debated to this day</a>.

<p>What becomes apparent is that you have put all of your trust in science while none in God. Yet science itself has shown it&#39;s own flaws and yet you still blindly follow it. Ask yourself why is that.</p>

<p>Where are the works? Where is the proof? Jesus just said to look at the evidence but I don&#39;t see it. So can you give it to me?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, you understand that this is Jesus talking <del>to</del> in John? I assure you I am not the man himself.</p>

<p>What I do like is the fact that you went all the way to John 10 without getting a huge kick from John 8:42</p>

<blockquote>
<p>42 Jesus said unto them, <strong>If God were your Father, ye would love me</strong>: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.</p>

<p>43 Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.</p>

<p>44 Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</p>

<p>45 <strong>And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.</strong></p>

<p>46 Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?</p>

<p>47 <strong>He that is of God heareth God&#39;s words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I know I posted that he is speaking in John. My post was edited several minutes ago before your own. Thanks though.</p>

<p>You&#39;re asking for the evidence I cannot give you. Instead, maybe you should look at the origins of Esau, he was not a spiritual man either, in fact he gave the blessing away that God had given to him which is why Jacob ended up receiving them. He was a cunning hunter and loved red meat, a very scientific dude from what the Bible speaks about him.</p>

<p>Maybe that&#39;s more your speed, live in the flesh if that is what your mind tells you to do, so be it. A bee will buzz, a bird will chirp and the wicked shall be wicked for it is in their nature.</p>

<p>You are not reading correctly then.</p>

<p>I am not Jesus, the evidence you are looking for will be provided to the world at the same time hence Revelation.</p>

<p>If I were to go into the full details, you would not believe me nor even take it into consideration because your own intentions at first was to disprove the word of God. Which many in the past have made the mistake to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously go back through this comment and chain and tell me that again. That&#39;s extremely dishonest.</p>

<p>Asked you for proof of the existence of God a million times now. Even gave you a bible verse that says God gives me a free pass to do so. </p>

<p>You want more questions that I know you won&#39;t answer?</p>

<p>Why does the bible say earth is 6000 years old when it&#39;s not? We see galaxies from distances further than 6000 light years, meaning the universe had to exist before 600 years.</p>

<p>Why does the bible say the earth was created before the sun and moon, which is impossible?</p>

<p>Why does the bible say a man that lived to be hundreds of years old built a ship that is a physical impossibility and filled it with 20,000 creatures when we know more than 10,000 existed at that time?</p>

<p>Why do the fossil records not corroborate what the bible says happened during the flood?</p>

<p>Why does the bible condone forcing a woman to marry her rapist?</p>

<p>Why does the bible condone stoning your misbehaving child to death?</p>

<p>Why does the bible condone stoning a woman to death if she is not a virgin on her wedding night?</p>

<p>Why does the bible condone stoning a man to death if he works on sabbath?</p>

<p>Why does the bible condone slavery and abuse of slaves as long as they are able to walk after a few days after the act of abuse?</p>

<p>Btw, I&#39;m sure you know all those bad things are old testament. Matthew 5:17-18 says Jesus did not come to abolish the old testament. So if you don&#39;t do those things, does that mean you&#39;re going to hell? Why not? Jesus said you must follow all of his laws, new and old.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a small sample of 10 questions for you. Are you going to answer them or are you going to find another excuse to dodge them?</p>

</ol>

<p>Again, if you think I am the messiah that can perform miracles, you are incorrect. You are literally not reading correctly. So let&#39;s break some stuff down for you, since your science cannot help you understand what you are reading. How one can be such a fan of science and not apply it to two simple precepts in the Bible is beyond me but whatever.</p>

<p><strong>John 10:37-38King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>37 If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.</p>

<p>38 But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay so the above is spoken by Jesus, he was the Messiah and could perform miracles. This is because God gave him the powers to heal and do other cool stuff like walk on water, and make lots of food out of only a little bit of food. Now see, I am not the messiah, therefore this passage cannot be applied to me since I am not the messiah. Now I don&#39;t know how your scientific mind could not break down that I am not the messiah nor that this is Jesus talking but I don&#39;t think you are making scientists look good whatsoever when you cannot even break down who is talking within a precept of the Bible. For future references the Bible is not just a book you can grab quotes from when you feel like it, it tells us how it&#39;s supposed to be read. </p>

<p><strong>Isaiah 28:10King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>10 For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little:</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>2. Why does the bible say earth is 6000 years old when it&#39;s not? We see galaxies from distances further than 6000 light years, meaning the universe had to exist before 600 years.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In fact it was <em>science</em> that dated the earth 6000 years old</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>In 1701 the date 4004 B.C. for the year of creation was inserted as a marginal commentary in the English edition of the Great Bible by Bishop Lloyd and, by association, thus being incorporated into the dogma of the Christian church.</strong> By the time the theory of evolution came into open conflict with church dogma, almost every Bible published in the nineteenth century had Usshers date appended to the first page, followed by the sequential dates throughout to the time of the birth of Christ. <strong>As the church succumbed to the reasonings of science, these dates were quietly dropped from the Bibles beginning around the turn of this century (Ian Taylor, In the Minds of Men, Revised Edition, Toronto: TFE Publishing, 1987, p. 284</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/faq/don_stewart/don_stewart_609.cfm">Source</a></p>

<p>As we know, the King James Bible was translated in 1611, almost 100 years before this newer, <em>scientific</em> Bible even surfaced which started this <em>theory</em>.</p>

<p><strong>3. Why does the bible say the earth was created before the sun and moon, which is impossible?</strong></p>

<p>If a tree falls in a forest and nobody is around to hear or see it fall, did it still fall?</p>

<p><strong>4. Why does the bible say a man that lived to be hundreds of years old built a ship that is a physical impossibility and filled it with 20,000 creatures when we know more than 10,000 existed at that time?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, but who said that there were more than 10,000 creatures at the time? <strong>SCIENCE</strong>, you see, science again is a doctrine, a belief system. For someone in our own time to claim that they somehow had the knowings of what happened thousands of years ago and place it out in the public means that people have to use faith to believe it!</p>

<p>Did you do the fossil tests yourself? No? Well that&#39;s odd, because you weren&#39;t there for when God walked the earth either but you don&#39;t believe that...</p>

<p><strong>5. Why do the fossil records not corroborate what the bible says happened during the flood?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Based by who? Again, science! You did not get up and go and do these test yourself, you read them somewhere and decided you would have faith and believe them.</strong></p>

<p><strong>6. Why does the bible condone forcing a woman to marry her rapist?</strong></p>

<p><strong>7. Why does the bible condone stoning your misbehaving child to death?</strong></p>

<p><strong>8. Why does the bible condone stoning a woman to death if she is not a virgin on her wedding night?</strong></p>

<p><strong>9. Why does the bible condone stoning a man to death if he works on sabbath?</strong></p>

<p><strong>10. Why does the bible condone slavery and abuse of slaves as long as they are able to walk after a few days after the act of abuse?</strong></p>

<p>Do you not understand the Bible? Have you even attempted to read it? It tells a story. The world was given to the wicked because the Hebrews fell. This was due to the stumbling block placed before them by the other nations who took council against them and then enslaved them.</p>

<p>A easy way to look at it is the world elite at the time were good therefore, everything below the elite of the pyramid was also good. If the head is correct, so is the tail. When these words were given, the world was much different. A woman and her virginity mattered, since the wicked inherited the world as mentioned in Deuteronomy 28 how the Hebrews would fall and the wicked people would take over until Revelation is completed (World War 3). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7pLwdrQsjw">In which the wicked would be destroyed as mentioned in Revelation, Ezekiel, Obadiah, and Habakkuk when God comes back with his chariots (UFOs).</a></p>

<p>You must understand that much of the world lives in sin, openly and without a care in the world. Just look at what you are doing, you are literally going around being a know it all the point that you think you somehow figured it all out and can somehow debunk the Bible. That&#39;s a pretty large assumption.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Btw, I&#39;m sure you know all those bad things are old testament. Matthew 5:17-18 says Jesus did not come to abolish the old testament. So if you don&#39;t do those things, does that mean you&#39;re going to hell? Why not? Jesus said you must follow all of his laws, new and old.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Matthew 5:17-20King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.</p>

<p>18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.</p>

<p>19 <strong>Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</strong></p>

<p>20 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So here we can clearly tell that Jesus was pretty much clear on people that would go around teaching men it&#39;s okay to sin and denouncing the Bible. As you yourself have mentioned that only God may judge our spirit but man can judge the flesh. The commandments of the Bible should be followed to the best of our ability, for only God himself is perfect. Aiming high to make sure you are not breaking them will help one lead a righteous lifestyle. I cannot tell you what we go to hell for, I am not the most high. A man who has the wisdom inside him though is a man that will question every action when it needs to be. A man who doesn&#39;t will walk the earth concerning himself only with the flesh, ultimately drowning in sin.</p>

<p>44 Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</p>

<p>45 And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.</p>

<p>46 Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?</p>

<p>47 He that is of God heareth God&#39;s words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You cannot hear his words because God has blocked you from doing so. Instead, go and live in the flesh as you praise it so much. You don&#39;t deserve to know the knowledge of the Bible just like Jesus said.</p>

<p>Thing is there is 0 evidence that we were here when Earth formed and a plethora of evidence that we arrived billions of years after. The Bible cannot be evidence to support the bible. I can do the same thing with Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings. It doesn&#39;t prove or disprove anything.</p>

<p><strong>Simply put, it came from the Bible. Of course, the Bible doesn’t say explicitly anywhere, “The earth is 6,000 years old.”</strong> Good thing it doesn’t; otherwise it would be out of date the following year. But we wouldn’t expect an all-knowing God to make that kind of a mistake. </p>

<p>God makes earth</p>

<p>God makes man a few days after</p>

<p>The genealogies begin 6000 years ago</p>

<p>Your bible does say it. Whether you understand it or not doesn&#39;t matter. The Bible gives you a very detailed time line of these people&#39;s lives all the way back to the first man whom was supposedly created days after the earth. 6000 years</p>

<p>You on the other hand have taken it upon yourself to publicly announce how much God doesn&#39;t exist while clinging on to science which is fascinating in my honest opinion.</p>

<p>This is what separates you from real scientist because no real scientist would say such a thing. Both interact with each other and for someone to think they don&#39;t just proves they put more faith in science than they do the words of God. Which is something only a wicked man would do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And the passage was written by man. The Bible is proven to be a collection of stories and poems from many men. Often contradicting itself, constantly being disproven, and based on 0 evidence. There is 0 proof Jesus existed outside of the Bible.</p>

<p>Your God has supposedly said that he will give evidence if I need it to believe. Why won&#39;t he give it to me? Why would your God want me to burn in hell? He&#39;s willingly withholding evidence from me even though he&#39;s given me permission to ask for it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m serious. One shred of solid evidence of something that is reproducible and testable would immediately convert me. On the spot my faith would dwarf yours. But until then, I keep looking and I have yet to get any.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is actually a very well put website on the subject, <a href="http://realhistoryww.com/world_history/ancient/White_people.htm">http://realhistoryww.com/world_history/ancient/White_people.htm</a></p>

<p>History will show us that the original people of all nations and genepools were in fact black, through the offset of becoming Albino, they would separate the albinos from the general population. This in turn would cause the Albinos to obviously breed among themselves and with other nations as well until you we got the Asian/White/Turkish races we see today. This is due to migration when Alexander the Great (first white conqueror) defeated Cyrus The Great and pretty much conquered the entire world. Before this, many parts of Asia and Europe were predominantly black.</p>

<p>This is why you will find that people like Hitler&#39;s blood contained African DNA. Because every white person alive today comes from a black ancestor if you go back far enough. The issue of race came into a global effect at the rise of white supremacy. This is why Alexander The Great would go around knocking the noses off of statues in Egypt. It was known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenization">Hellinization</a>. Let me be clear, I understand human history and both sides are wrong but I simply wanted to state where the racial change happened. Black over white and now white over black.</p>

<p>You will find that black gives birth to white but white does not give birth to blacks unless one of the parents is black, which of course means that the baby is mixed. </p>

<p>Now if you google &quot;can white people give birth to black babies&quot; you will find 2 stories, one is a lie and the man is a cuck. </p>

<p>The other involves a story all the way back from 1955 in Africa where a girl was born from two white people and she was black. It is not clear on if there was infidelity in this case but I suppose anything is possible. Although it should be noted that the clear gap in decades from an actual story of this happening is much further than it is for blacks which happens every few months (likes it&#39;s new or something for some reason).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say no one could prove either way. I said I cannot prove God doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>But to claim that he does you need evidence. If you have an idea that is backed by 0 evidence, it&#39;s not a valid idea. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but your entire premise is built on unknowns that come from a book that was written by men that uses itself to support itself. That&#39;s not logical, that&#39;s not valid, that&#39;s not how you learn about the world around us. That&#39;s circular reasoning and you learn nothing.</p>

<p>We can observe and test the natural world around us. By doing so, we 0 evidence that God exists. So how can we come to the conclusion he does exist if the evidence doesn&#39;t support it?</p>

<p>If you&#39;re being charged with a murder, but there is 0 evidence that connects you to said murder, would you expect to be declared innocent or guilty? I would hope innocent and if the justice system worked as it should, you would be. The only people who know the truth are the people that committed the murder and the victim(s). Since we can&#39;t ask the victims, we use evidence to decide who is guilty. Eyewitness testimony is the weakest form of evidence as people have been known to lie and even misremember memories. Thus physical, tangible evidence is the most reliable as it cannot lie. It can be misinterpreted but it cannot lie. The best way to avoid misinterpretation is to examine every detail possible and try to come up with the simplest, least convoluted answer. It would take extremely complicated stories to conclude that you committed the murder if there is no evidence that concludes it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Done plenty of research and I&#39;m not done. But the more actual non-biased research I do, applying reasoning, and testing the Bibles claims, the more it seems like an impossibility. I can&#39;t blindly believe in God just as you cannot blindly believe in Allah or the tooth fairy. Just as those seem illogical to you, God is illogical to me. We have evidence that contradicts many of the Bibles claims and the lists grows longer with time. Before long, it will more than likely follow the path mythologies such as shamanism and the Greek pantheon traveled- a series of myths and moral stories that are only believed by a select few due to the world gaining more accurate knowledge than those mythologies claim.</p>

<p>That&#39;s fine the you don&#39;t feel the need to prove your beliefs. Just don&#39;t be surprised when people call you out on it and call your beliefs out for what they most likely are, myth derived from religions that preceded it. Noah&#39;s ark = epic of gilgamesh. Virgin birth, resurrection, etc = Zoroastrianism. Don&#39;t be surprised when people tell you your thinking is flawed as you believe based on 0 proof. (Let&#39;s be honest, if you had proof, you&#39;d share it with everyone. You&#39;d be the most famous person in the history of the world. The person that proved God was real.)</p>

<p>My position is only that I require evidence of claims of the world around me. The evidence points towards our universe (and time) coming forth from a singularity. The evidence points towards life evolving over the course of billions of years through a series of changes to the gene pool as a result of environmental pressures. The evidence points towards the Bible being a series of books put together by a select group of men, deliberately leaving out many stories (such as Lilith) for the purpose of controlling people and other non divine reasons.</p>

<p>Now whether you choose to believe this evidence is irrelevant. It exists. Now what&#39;s great about it is if you don&#39;t believe it, then use their methods to show why they&#39;re wrong. Every scientific article that details an experiment or observation will detail out the entirety of the methods and instruments used. They will detail their process out step by step by step. They want you to do it yourself. They want you to try to disprove them. If you do disprove it, you have just learned about the world. If you cannot disprove it, you build upon that experiment to find out why you cannot. Then maybe you can disprove it, maybe not.  But you keep looking for answers.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t believe evolution, go find some fossils and have them radiometrically dated yourself. Do the experiment yourself.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t believe in the big bang, build or buy your own telescope(s) to study the stars and planets. You&#39;ll probably need some mathematical knowledge, but that&#39;s ok. We can agree mathematics is a useful tool to learn about the world around us, yes? (Ex: How long would it take you to get to work? Using calculus that answer is quite simple given the necessary info).</p>

<p>By using these methods, you can learn yourself that the Bible is most likely incorrect about the universe. The difference between you and i, as I used to be Christian, is that I have an innate desire to know the truth, no matter what that truth may be. You are comfortable with being wrong as long as you feel good about it, and you will protect that feeling in the face of truth.</p>

<p>Now whether you choose to believe this evidence is irrelevant. It exists. Now what&#39;s great about it is if you don&#39;t believe it, then use their methods to show why they&#39;re wrong. Every scientific article that details an experiment or observation will detail out the entirety of the methods and instruments used. They will detail their process out step by step by step. They want you to do it yourself. They want you to try to disprove them. If you do disprove it, you have just learned about the world. If you cannot disprove it, you build upon that experiment to find out why you cannot. Then maybe you can disprove it, maybe not.  But you keep looking for answers.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t believe evolution, go find some fossils and have them radiometrically dated yourself. Do the experiment yourself.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t believe in the big bang, build or buy your own telescope(s) to study the stars and planets. You&#39;ll probably need some mathematical knowledge, but that&#39;s ok. We can agree mathematics is a useful tool to learn about the world around us, yes? (Ex: How long would it take you to get to work? Using calculus that answer is quite simple given the necessary info).</p>

<p>By using these methods, you can learn yourself that the Bible is most likely incorrect about the universe. The difference between you and i, as I used to be Christian, is that I have an innate desire to know the truth, no matter what that truth may be. You are comfortable with being wrong as long as you feel good about it, and you will protect that feeling in the face of truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will reply just because I don&#39;t appreciate people putting words in my mouth or trying to twist them to ad hominem.</p>

<p>By making the claim &quot;you can&#39;t prove God is or isn&#39;t real&quot; I&#39;m stating that we must use evidence to discover the truth. The evidence thus points towards the Christian God not being real, not a God in general. And I said it&#39;s likely a myth, likely is a big difference than is.  Again, the evidence supports what I say.</p>

<p>I can give you evidence, lots. Will you honestly and objectively look at it? If so, I will gladly provide it to you.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to run away when you fail to defend your beliefs, by all means. I&#39;m willing to admit I&#39;m wrong and I hope I am wrong about a lot of things. I hope to learn more and more about the world we live in. I can&#39;t help you if you want to stay in a bubble.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, I&#39;d hardly call this a debate as you have asked a lot of questions but addressed only on or two of my points. A debate is an exchange of ideas. You haven&#39;t challenged my ideas. Only stated &quot;buy you said you can&#39;t prove God isn&#39;t real&quot; (how this automatically means he is real is beyond me. That&#39;s why the burden of proof is on you, not me). If you want to debate, you can begin by addressing several of the issues I&#39;ve brought up.</p>
