        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For the past 2 years, I have been delving into astral projection, channeling, and just plain research gaining contact and information about the Hyperborea. That is what I have chosen to call them, they&#39;re not literally the mythological Hyperborea, but there are a few similarities. I find it easier to use certain names and terms from human history to make it easier to comprehend. </p>

<p>I have communed with them and they&#39;ve shared much of their knowledge with me. They have said they plan to make their presence much more obvious in the coming years. </p>

<p>First, we&#39;ll answer some FAQ:</p>

<h2>Who are the Hyperborea?</h2>

<p>The Hyperborea were a massive interstellar civilization spanning much of the Milky Way. In their prime they lived on hundreds of plants. This was many many years in the past, before life on Earth even began to walk and breathe on solid land. Their original planet was very much similar to ours, except as a whole somewhat colder. Physiologically, they&#39;re very similar to us, or more accurately, we&#39;re very similar to them. </p>

<p>At their peak they were thousands of years above our own technology. They were virtually ageless, they could travel many times faster than the speed of light, and could harness incredible amounts of energy. They were also very spiritually advanced as well. </p>

<p>Except that didn&#39;t last, long story short, they attempted to collectively ascend to a higher plane of existence, what we would call godhood. It failed, and that sent a big shockwave across their collective consciousness. Magnetic poles shifted, people became anxious, paranoid, delusional, natural disasters shook their worlds, people began to die in the millions from new diseases that just sort of started appearing. This killed 99% of the population and left the remainder mostly infertile, and many at least somewhat insane. They&#39;ve barely survived, but have managed to hang on and have retained some of their technology. </p>

<h2>What do they want with humanity?</h2>

<p>There are many Hyperboreans who want to rebuild what was lost. There are sort of different classifications of Hyperboreans based on what their answer was to the Fall. Some retreated into Matrioshka Brains, some decided to conquer other planets by force and enslave their population, some renounced advanced technology and lived short and simple lives, others wanted to mold viable planets into Hyperboreans. The latter are the ones who found and molded us. I can go more in depth on the different groups if anyone asks.</p>

<p>They want humanity to take the Hyperborea&#39;s place and rise to the levels they did. They guided our evolution, the reason we look so much like them was intentional. Our evolution could have easily went in an entirely different direction, but they made sure it didn&#39;t. They&#39;ve also guided our culture somewhat, but this has met with limited success.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot more to it than this, but I didn&#39;t want to make this post too long. Feel free to ask any questions and I&#39;ll answer the best I can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, you fucked up the timeline there: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In their prime they lived on hundreds of plants. This was many many years in the past, <strong>before life on Earth even began to walk and breathe on solid land</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So they&#39;re billions of years ahead of us. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>At their peak they were thousands of years above our own technology</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There you fucked up. They&#39;re only thousands of years above us, yet they&#39;ve been living on hundreds of planets billions of years ago? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>people began to die in the millions from new diseases that just sort of started appearing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So a civilisation that is virtually ageless, has conquered the speed of light, yet a disease just pops up and they&#39;re like ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ <em>&quot;oh well fuck me right?&quot;</em></p>

<hr/>

<p>So if they&#39;re an advanced civilization, why don&#39;t they just tell us how to travel faster than light? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Their civilization when it was at its peak lasted several thousand years, but the fall makes up most of the time between their beginning and now. During that time they weren&#39;t really advancing, if anything they were falling backwards when it came to technology. </p>

<p>Their collapse happened very fast, massive earthquakes, tsunamis, violent storms, etc. a lot of the normal infrastructure that would have been in place to control any disease that popped up couldn&#39;t handle it. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve asked them similar questions as to why they&#39;re holding out on the technology and they&#39;ve pretty much said that we&#39;ll have to develop it ourselves and that they&#39;re only there to make sure we have the ability available. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It can be easy to dismiss this post as fanciful but the message that our own thoughts affect our physical environment, not only each other is exactly why so much money is spent controlling our thinking. </p>

<p>From around the middle of the post:</p>

<p>There is another problem with reporting on insights gained when engaged in what I now call thought traveling, it is without language as we are trained to understand language,  and not too different from trying to make translations from ancient documents with language keys but no awareness of the complex context and meanings that were characteristic in their time.  We don&#39;t/can&#39;t write down all the nuances of verbal language in text and we can&#39;t verbalize at all the language of  of the basic energy that is thought or to some intent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not very good at art, but I can describe a few of their technologies they&#39;ve shown me. I kind of have to be vague about it since their explaining it to me would be like trying to explain to a medieval peasant how a plane can fly. </p>

<p>For one thing, they sort of cheated FTL technology, instead of actually making a ship travel faster than the speed of light, they made the space around the ship actually warp to move the ship from place to place. The closest thing in human terms would be an Alcubierre drive, but different in a way that&#39;s hard to explain. </p>

<p>The ships themselves are sort of giant cylinders, but I&#39;ve seen them have attachments at the side. Hyperboreans live in continent spanning cities with a lot of taller arcologies. There are also a lot of seasteads with sort of weird tubes connecting them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they want to keep themselves hidden from humanity why have they interacted with you? If they do not wish to hide from humanity why are they not communicating with humanity as a whole?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to say I don&#39;t believe you but I am a healthy skeptic. Have you taken measures to confirm this is true and that you are not having delusions? It would be wise to seek medical help just in case. If I began to hear voices in my head I would logically come to the conclusion that I am likely not communicating with aliens but am (like many other people) experiencing a hallucination. Medical help is then the logical way to go as medication should not have an effect on a legitimate connection and would fix my problem if I was suffering a delusion. </p>

<p>Ask the voices a simple list of questions that you would not know but a race of aliens (or even just one) shaping humanity would now or be able to easily observe on Earth. If you can answer them all for yourself without google awesome. Write them down and confirm they are correct after using an online engine. If you cannot get the answers play it safe and get medical help. </p>

<p>If the voices (I apologize if it&#39;s not in the form of voices but it&#39;s the way I visualize it) cannot answer all four of those questions without you looking up the answers before hand I would suggest seeking help. </p>

<p>If they can answer those I would like to know when they will reveal themselves to the general public?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m on the fence with channeling. I have read many channeling sessions and what comes from them are amazing. Almost too amazing. They tell us they want the best for us but keep remaining in the dark. They keep saying &quot;just a bit longer before we make ourselves known&quot; type of stuff.</p>

<p>On the other side I have also read that any entity you channel is actually a demon. And that channeling can only bring in a demon entity and it will tell you everything you want to hear as demons pretty much lie all the time.</p>

<p>How can you trust this channeling and know for certain they are who they say they are?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My first (most vivid) memory was a UFO sighting with my mom and sister. I was four, my sister was six, and my mom was thirty three or four. We came home from grocery shopping, although I have no memory of that, and during the trips between the car and house, we saw what basically looked like a star, but it was moving...kind of swimming in the night sky. It pulsed, grew, shrank, disappeared, reappeared...all of which was very graceful. Then, it seemed like it was coming for us, so I turned and ran to the house...but I wasn&#39;t scared. I remember having a smile on my face, like it was a game of tag. The three of our stories are exactly the same and we still talk about it to this day. ....last summer, I was outside at night, meditating, and was at it intensely for awhile, this time, with my eyes completely open. Eventually everything went white. I felt as if I had travelled somewhere.....it felt very heavenly. Like the collective consciousness? I dunno, but it felt incredible. When I snapped back to reality, I saw three UFOs directly above me, doing the same things as the one I saw when I was younger. ........so yeah, there&#39;s that. </p>

I don&#39;t even know if it was technology, maybe there wasn&#39;t a pilot, could have been energy based. Who knows?? I mean, you can try your hardest to take this away from me, whatever.....I know what I saw, I know what my family saw. If you could understand how lucky I feel, blessed, you would be jealous.

    <div class="md"><p>I am not very good at art, but I can describe a few of their technologies they&#39;ve shown me. I kind of have to be vague about it since their explaining it to me would be like trying to explain to a medieval peasant how a plane can fly. </p>

<p>For one thing, they sort of cheated FTL technology, instead of actually making a ship travel faster than the speed of light, they made the space around the ship actually warp to move the ship from place to place. The closest thing in human terms would be an Alcubierre drive, but different in a way that&#39;s hard to explain. </p>

<p>The ships themselves are sort of giant cylinders, but I&#39;ve seen them have attachments at the side. Hyperboreans live in continent spanning cities with a lot of taller arcologies. There are also a lot of seasteads with sort of weird tubes connecting them. </p>
