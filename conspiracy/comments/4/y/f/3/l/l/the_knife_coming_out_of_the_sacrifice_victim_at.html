    <div class="md"><p>is there no security - especially at the shiva statue? no surveillance cameras that could show the girl getting back up? one would think they&#39;d include that with their press release, ey?</p>

<p>edit: so, for real, me and 6 of my besties could go chainsaw that statue down and nobody would do shit? or, to go completely over the top, we could stage a friggin <em>human sacrifice</em> (real or fake, who knows from the security cameras) with a huge fucking knife (real or fake, who knows from the security cameras) and nobody would even try to stop us? damn..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having been to CERN, here&#39;s what I&#39;ll say. The shiva statue is close to a residential building and there&#39;s definitely some cameras pointed that way.</p>

<p>Also there are manned guard stations at all entrances and it&#39;s pretty strict, you have to get a visitors pass and they wouldn&#39;t let non-CERN people stick around late at night. Whoever that is, they&#39;re definitely CERN employees or scientists on a research project.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so if this is true (and to be fair, you&#39;re still just somebody on the internet), that <em>at least</em> means that this sacrifice is a hoax performed with management knowledge. at worst, it&#39;s murder caught on video, if not blatantly thrown in our faces.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The issue I see with this is it&#39;s only a handful of people at most, it&#39;s shiva which barely registers on the list of demons, and their positioning at the time of sacrifice is pretty damn off. I would put this at the level of teenagers experimenting with the occult when they found a strange statute in their neighbours yard. </p>

<p>Looks absolutely nothing like a regular black mass, and way way way off for anything more sinister </p>

    <div class="md"><p>don&#39;t know why you got downvoted.</p>

<p>I developed a dark sense of humor too since as a child I saw people making sick humors too. but now I realized they weren&#39;t joking. people are twisted.</p>

<p>and I&#39;m 100% with u/nisaaru, there is nothing funny about the video.</p>

<p>why would someone even stage a mock satanic ritual at CERN? that guy who tries to shrug this off as a joke must be one of them.</p>

<p>since they know everyone up the ladder is with them, they make fun of all the truthers.</p>

<p>and they don&#39;t even try to hide this shit anymore. because it&#39;s true, they control everything!
the police, the law.</p>

<p>another thread in here says the guy who took this video was murdered. can&#39;t find the thread. any ID? he sounded american.</p>

<p>make sense since he haven&#39;t censored his voice in the video. and the facility had high security. can&#39;t be that hard to find out who would spend the night late at CERN.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. I got down voted because they are lurking.</p>

<p>It would be simple to release CCTV footage of the girl getting up and them all laughing after the &quot;fake&quot; ceremony . But they won&#39;t. The media which we know is the same as (((them))) made sure to push a story out claiming this as fake with no investigation.</p>

<p>Nothing to see here folks!</p>

<p>Edit: the fact that when you freeze the frame you can literally see the knife pulled out is bloody, is just so fucked up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the video you see them take a quick stab. But blood or no blood it comes off like some Blair Witch production. Dude films the intro, gets vocally exasperated periodically and then cuts off with a jerk right on the money shot, just like a low budget horror flick.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also a little fishy that the MSM has picked it up and YouTube doesn&#39;t seem to be removing the video.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They honestly could be summer students. CERN brings in a lot of interns who wish to study physics and natural science. And, I&#39;m not sure about you, but it feels like there is a certain <em>conspiracy culture</em> that is amassing very quickly. Maybe people are waking up, or maybe people like Alex Jones (who rides the Trump train) brings some outlandish ideas out into the limelight. Granted, many of these talking points are hyperbole, mis/disinformation, and not true to the crux of what&#39;s really going on. However, I get the sense that it&#39;s becoming <em>hip</em>. </p>

<p>So, I&#39;d put money on this being malarkey and these people want to fuck with conspiracy communities. I&#39;m sure they&#39;re aware of some of the more nutty ideas surrounding CERN. </p>
