        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">30</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-02-28 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/covertoperations911.html">covertoperations911</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><ol>
<li><p>Why did more than one hundred eye-witnesses and earwitnesses to the attacks believe that multiple perpetrators were involved? Why did more than forty of these witnesses identify other suspects by name?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did numerous witnesses report hearing fully automatic fire?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did at least 35 witnesses hear shooting and explosions in the school after the gunmen had purportedly &quot;committed suicide&quot;?</p></li>
<li><p>Why was the gun Klebold supposedly used to kill himself found in his right hand, even though the wound was in the left temple and he was left-handed? Why was the shotgun Harris supposedly used to kill himself seen under his leg in photographs?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did investigators ignore so many compelling leads that suggested a wider conspiracy?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did police concentrate on &quot;setting up a perimeter&quot; around the school when dispatch was hearing the sounds of gunshots in the school? Why did police take such a long time to enter the school, and why after entry did they wait three hours to enter the library where the shooters had last been seen? Were they really, as Sheriff John Stone indicated, &quot;outgunned&quot; by two teenagers who could not aim? Why were other emergency personnel told that they would be shot if they tried to enter? Why was a police sniper with a clear shot on Klebold given an order not to fire?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did teacher Dave Sanders, who students were able to keep alive for three hours, die within twenty minutes of being taken into police custody? Why did they take so long to locate him when students were urgently telling them his location? Why was his shirt taken off?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did two teens who, contrary to public belief, were not bullied, had many friends, and were not psychopathic destroy their own lives and those of at least twelve other students and one teacher only six weeks before graduation?</p></li>
<li><p>If Harris and Klebold knew they were almost certainly going to be killed, why did both make plans for after the massacre? Why did Harris continue to do schoolwork and keep his grades up until the date of the attack? Why was Klebold telling others how excited he was to attend college in Arizona? Why did Klebold say on tape at prom night: * &quot;Dad, we&#39;re going to laugh about this in 20 years&quot;? Why did Harris make plans with old friends in New York for that summer, and tell at least one online friend about these plans? Why did Harris ask a teacher for help with an English essay days before the massacre? Why did he put his schedule in to work for the week *after the massacre?</p></li>
<li><p>Where is the evidence from gun shot residue tests on Harris, Klebold and the other suspects? Why were fingerprints from Harris and Klebold only found on two of the hundreds of pieces of evidence taken into possession. Whose fingerprints - if any - were on the many bombs and weapons found?</p></li>
<li><p>How were Harris and Klebold able to secretly transfer 99 explosive devices - by some accounts more than 120 - into the school? How were able to position them inside several vehicles - not their own - near the school? Who owned these cars and when and how were they cleared of involvement?</p></li>
<li><p>Why is it considered fact that Harris and Klebold placed the &#39;diversionary&#39; bombs that exploded at South Wadsworth when there isn&#39;t any evidence at all that they did? No physical evidence linking them to this blast has been produced, nor have any witnesses placed them at the scene. One witness reportedly saw David Caravan, a member of the Trench Coat Mafia, fleeing the blast site with a smile on his face. An unidentified &quot;transient&quot; was discovered hiding in a nearby storm drain. Others spoke of a mysterious &quot;survey crew&quot; that &quot;moved the backpacks&quot; and may have placed them themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>Why did authorities claim that the two shotguns recovered did not have serial numbers when in fact they did? Why did they make no attempt to find out who sold the Hi-Point 9mm rifle and the pump-action shotgun used in the attack?</p></li>
<li><p>Are persistent rumours that the school administration was warned based in truth? Why was Principal Frank DeAngelis running up and down the interior cafeteria stairs almost immediately before the shooting started?</p></li>
<li><p>Was there indeed a &#39;fire drill&#39; scheduled for later in the day, as one science teacher told his class? Were bomb threats called into the school that morning, as two sources claimed - one of whom told the news that morning and later died in a highly suspicious plane collision? Why did one special ed student make comments about &quot;bombs in the trash can&quot; the day before?</p></li>
<li><p>Why didn&#39;t the Final Report of the Jefferson County Sheriff&#39;s Office state that the suspects never entered science rooms 1 and 8, despite the fact that shell casings were recovered in both locations?</p></li>
<li><p>Why didn&#39;t the Final Report of the Jefferson County Sheriff&#39;s Office make no mention of the brief exit of a gunman on the eastern side of the building, as seen by many witnesses?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did police warn students of a gunman positioned on the roof if it was simply a &quot;repairman&quot;? Why did witnesses see two men on the roof and why did the students see him aiming what looked like a rifle? Why has Chris Clarke told three completely different stories about where he was when the shooting started and two about what he was at Columbine High to do that day? Why did he fail to recognize his own service van when he was rescued by Denver Police Officer Wayne DePew, who reportedly commandeered it - the keys were conveniently left in the ignition - and used it to rescue Clarke? Why did no other officers see this rescue, including the ones Officer DePew claims to have been with? Is it simply coincidence that Officer DePew&#39;s son attended Columbine High, witnessed disturbing, mysterious activities in the school, and was died in a strange &#39;accident&#39; in New Mexico in 2013?</p></li>
<li><p>Is it simply coincidence that &quot;crisis training drills&quot; were held at Columbine High in the weeks before the attack? What was the nature of this training and who scheduled it?</p></li>
<li><p>Why were at least one police officer and one sheriff&#39;s deputy already at the school when the shooting started? Was the maintenance man in Clement Park, Dick Clark, correct when he claimed that he observed &quot;an undercover cop&quot; in the park before the shooting?</p></li>
<li><p>Why is it frequently claimed that there were no security cameras in the library or administration areas when many witnesses saw such cameras? Why does local media refuse to release their on-scene video footage from the first half-hour of the attack?</p></li>
<li><p>Where is the evidence taken from the computers of members of the Trench Coat Mafia? Where are the scores of missing interviews with students, including many of those in the science hall where some saw a gunman who appeared to be *&quot;in his thirties&quot;? Why are thousands of pages of investigatory material - including hundreds of reports and tips from witnesses unconnected with Columbine - still sealed?</p></li>
<li><p>Why has the school district&#39;s own report on the massacre, which included the extensive disciplinary records of the members of the Trench Coat Mafia, remained sealed to this day?</p></li>
<li><p>Why was no attempt made to interview Eric Harris&#39; psychologist, who prescribed him Luvox? Why was no attempt made to analyze &quot;white pills&quot; discovered in Klebold&#39;s room? Is it a coincidence that Sgt. Randy West was the man who instructed officers to follow neither lead, and is it also a coincidence that &quot;Sgt. West&quot; does this in many other instances throughout the files?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did investigators show absolutely no interest in the fact that many planned attacks on schools were surfacing in the Denver area and around the country during this same time period? Why were so many of these plans made in advance of the attacks?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did the FBI and the ATF immediately become involved? Why were all but one of the &quot;investigatory&quot; teams headed or co-headed by an FBI agent, with the exception headed by a &quot;former&quot; FBI agent who was now with the Colorado Bureau of Investigation (CBI)? Was the crime scene &quot;federalized&quot; soon after the initiation of the attacks, under powers granted by the Anti-Terrorism Act signed by President Bill Clinton in the wake of the Oklahoma City Bombing and precisely three years before on April 20, 1996?</p></li>
<li><p>Why was top FBI psychologist Dwayne Fuselier, whose sons attended Columbine High and involved with the Trench Coat Mafia, selected to <strong><em>head the investigation?</em></strong> Even though his sons produced a video for video class in 1997 with members of the Trench Coat Mafia, including  <strong><em>suspect Brooks Brown</em></strong>, featuring four trench-coated gunmen shooting through the halls of the school before blowing it up? Why didn&#39;t he recuse himself from the investigation and why did his superiors openly refuse to remove him? Is it simply coincidence that Fuselier was a key &#39;negotiator&#39; at both the Waco and Montana Freemen sieges, both of which involved acts of severe brutality by federal law enforcement?</p></li>
<li><p>Why was the U.S. Attorney&#39;s Office consulted on &quot;prosecutive decisions&quot; with regard to the massacre - a local crime?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did personnel from the LAPD and the L.A. Sheriff&#39;s Office travel to the scene afterward? What was the subject of a ten-minute call between the Jefferson County Sheriff&#39;s Office and the NYPD on the day of the massacre?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did two high-ranking military officers - a colonel and a general - appear on scene in camouflage uniforms? Why was the memorial service - held at a public park - ringed with military trucks? Who authorized a group of military jets to do a flyover and why?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did the Federal Emergency Management Agency hold a four-day &quot;disaster training course&quot; eighteen months before the massacre and &quot;designed specially to adress the needs of Jefferson County,&quot; for future sheriff John Stone and other county officials?</p></li>
<li><p>Is it coincidence that the episode of The Promised Land on CBS scheduled for that week featured a kid firing a gun in front of a Denver high school? Is it coincidence that the episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer on WB for that week featured a plan by a student gunman to kill everyone at his school? Is it a coincidence that MTV scheduled a program called Warning Signs, produced by the Justice Department, which was about violence and its effect on young people, to air two days after the massacre? Is it a coincidence that the History Channel had scheduled a program called Slaughter at Schools for May 10?</p></li>
<li><p>When ABC&#39;s 20/20 did a show about the disturbing &quot;death education&quot; programs in the early nineties, was it simply a coincidence that they featured Columbine High School?</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>In <strong><em>1968</em></strong>, a feature film entitled <em>If....</em> which portrays disturbing sexual abuse and bullying in a school culminating in two male students shooting students from the school&#39;s rooftop in a surreal, dream-like sequence in which they simply <em>&quot;discover&quot;</em> a bag of weapons. </p>

<p>The film was directed by Lindsay Anderson, a cryptographer for the Intelligence Corps of the British Army. The star was Malcolm McDowell, whose father was in the Royal Air Force and who starred in <em>A Clockwark Orange</em>, which depicts mind control projects being conducted by the British government.</p>

<p>There are persistent rumours that MI6 agents appeared on scene soon after the massacre, and it is a fact that the British Royalty own vast amounts of land in Denver. It is also a fact that the Mayor of Denver at the time maintained a very close relationship with the British Royalty and regularly visited London to meet with the Queen. </p>

<p>It is also interesting that some of the earliest school shootings occurred in Canada, which was also a major outpost of CIA mind control research and <strong><em>a British colony.</em></strong> Then there was the massacre in Dunblane, which occurred in <strong><em>Scotland</em></strong>. The investigation implicated members of the British elite, and all of the <em>&quot;inquest&quot;</em> - headed by Lord Cullen - sealed all records related to the case. There was also the massacre in Port Arthur in <strong><em>Australia</em></strong>. </p>

<p>Is it coincidence that the earliest school attacks - both small-scale and large-scale - occurred in British colonies or is the phenomenon really sponsored by the Tavistock Institute? They <strong><em>openly discuss</em></strong> using <em>&quot;shock events&quot;</em> to influence society.</p>

<p>On April 16, 2007, 33 were killed at Virginia Tech. Two weeks before, Tom McNulty, the Home Office Minister, lectured at the college. His ministerial responsibilities included the police service, counter-terrorism and crime reduction - including that which relates to firearms. Shortly afterward, the Queen made her first official visit to the U.S. in sixteen years. It had been planned well in advance of the attack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Port Arthur massacre is fishy as fuck. </p>

<p>The alleged shooter has an IQ of 66 and had only practiced shooting cans in the bush with a rifle, yet he managed to score 20 head shots from the right hip in 90 seconds. They also performed the Beirut triple (a technique to stop carbombers) where they shoot one bullet at the vehicle to sight, one into the engine block to stop it and one into the driver. </p>

<p>Hobart morgue had just got a 22 capacity refrigerated morgue truck a couple of weeks earlier, a bunch of press were in hobart for an international conference, the gun restriction legislation was already written before the event (similar to PATRIOT act), there was a trauma conference at the hospital that finished just before the shooting, there was allegedly military vehicles in the port that morning and there&#39;s some stuff I&#39;ve found of Israeli spy Ari Ben-Menashe being in the country at the same time. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a bunch more. It&#39;s one of the most obvious false flags around in terms of inconsistencies in the official version and convenient coincidences. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1-3: statements taken by teenage victims can be full of errors, including how many people were seen, and who they were. 
6: this was protocol at the time.
22: a lot of the files you are referring to were purposely destroyed by the sheriff&#39;s office because they were being accused of having information that could have showed that they had evidence of the plans for this attack and did nothing with it ahead of time.</p>

<p>Not trying to fight against this idea completely, but there are legitimate answers to some of your questions. If you&#39;re interested, check out &quot;Columbine&quot; by Dave Cullen. It&#39;s a great expose into the whole situation.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This problem with this argument is that many of these students corroborate each other repeatedly on important points with regard to the description and identities of other suspects. </p>

<p>As an example, the description of the two trench-coated attackers accompanied by the assailant in a white t-shirt and blue jeans who threw a bomb on the roof:</p>

<p><strong>Chris Wisher (page 1261 in the 11,000 pages of released files)</strong></p>

<p>Chris states that he was behind the cafeteria about 100 yards away, and heard what he thought were fireworks. He turned and saw two kids wearing trench coats, and one kid wearing a white T-shirt who was throwing bombs onto the school. One of the trench-coated kids shot a shotgun at him, and then other kid in a trench coat had an automatic rifle. A little later, he and his friends also saw a person with a gun hiding in the bushes in Weaver Park.</p>

<p><strong>Jake Apodaca (page 653)</strong></p>

<p>He states that he saw 3 suspects, simultaneously. He was at the soccer field, heard firecrackers. He turned and saw two guys carrying shotguns, wearing black trench coats, black berets, black pants, black army boots, and black T-shirts. He had seen them at school before, but could not find them in the yearbook. A 3rd guy wearing a white T-shirt, jeans, light brown hair, that he had not seen him at school before, was seen throwing bombs onto the roof. It is not stated if the 3rd suspect had a gun or not. Jake also states that he saw a gunman with a shotgun hiding in the bushes in Weaver Park.</p>

<p><strong>Jonathan Cole (page 749)</strong></p>

<p>He states that he had met up with Jake Apodaca and Chris Wisher outside the main West entrance. There, he noticed two tall guys in black trench coats, no hats, one had on a ski mask, and one had &quot;puffy&quot; hair. One had a white T-shirt under his coat, the other had a black or dark T-shirt. These 2 walked over to top of the hill and looked down toward the cafeteria. He then saw a third male, wearing a white T-shirt and blue jeans, exit the school through the same door. This person looked over to the other two suspect, and yelled &quot;GO!! GO!!&quot;. The two suspects pulled out guns and began shooting. Jonathan began running, looked back and saw the person in the white T-shirt throwing some bombs onto the roof, which exploded. Several days later, when students were allowed back into the school to claim their belongings, he saw the white-t-shirted bomb-thrower at the school. This person is described as being 5&#39;10&quot;, wearing black glasses, and having collar length blondish brown hair. Jonathan was shown a photo lineup, but could not identify him as one of those suspects. Jonathan was about 73&#39; to 75&#39; away from the gunmen, but could not identify them.</p>

<p><strong>William Arapkiles (page 660)</strong></p>

<p>On 5/5/99, Billy states that he was at the soccer field, and heard firecrackers. He turned and saw 3 people near the West entrance. Two were wearing black trench coats, and carrying guns. The third was wearing a white T-shirt, and no visible gun. The person in the white T-shirt was pacing back and forth about 5&#39; away from the two gunmen. He saw the gunmen shoot toward the ground and into the air. He saw them shoot one person near the top of the stair, and another at the bottom of the hill, then a third victim that was trying to run away across the parking lot. The shooter then shot at the witnesses on the soccer field. Billy observed actions of one shooter, which seemed to him to be a jammed gun.</p>

<p><strong>Don Arnold (page 666)</strong></p>

<p>Don states that he was on the soccer field, heard firecrackers, and turned toward the school. He saw a &quot;short, pudgy&quot; male in a white T-shirt that was throwing bombs onto the roof. He did not see this person having a gun. Don saw another male standing at the top of the hill, shooting toward the parking lot. Don had gone shooting with his father before, and knew the sounds of gunshots. He heard two different gunshot sounds -- one was a shotgun, and the other was not. This shooter then turned and shot 5 or 6 time toward the soccer field using a shotgun. He saw that this shotgun was a pump shotgun.</p>

<p><strong>Pat Neville (page 1043)</strong></p>

<p>On 5/6/99, gave an account much like Don Arnold&#39;s. He was by the soccer field, heard firecrackers, turned and saw two suspects. One in a black trench coat, tall, all in black, shooting people with a long gun. The other had a white T-shirt, blue jeans, no visible gun, and was throwing bombs onto the roof.</p>

<p><strong>Arthur Curtis (page 765)</strong></p>

<p>Arthur was also on the soccer field. He only saw 2 shooters. One was tall, with long hair, and wore a black trench, the other wore a white T-shirt. He saw the one in the black trench coat carrying a sawed-off shotgun. Arthur states that he could identify the one in the trench coat if given a picture. He saw them shoot at groups of people and at the soccer field witnesses. He reported that the one in the white T-shirt descended the stairs, fired a few shots, and went back up the stairs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Mike Kenny (page 938)</strong></p>

<p>Mike was also on the soccer field when here heard a noise like firecrackers. He looked and saw two people about 100 yards away. One was in a black trench coat and black pants and was holding a TEC-9, the other was about 10 feet behind him and was wearing a white T-shirt and blue jeans. They appeared to be together. The one in the trench coat was shooting, but Mike couldn&#39;t tell if the one in the white T-shirt was shooting or not. The trench coat shooter shot at the players on the soccer field, who ducked and ran. Mike looked back, and saw explosions on the roof. He did not see anyone throw a bomb up there, but either of the two suspects he did see could have thrown a bomb to that location.</p>

<p><strong>Jason Brehm (page 718)</strong></p>

<p>On 5/5/99, Jason give the following information: Jason walked out the West main doors, and saw a figure in a black trench coat, leaning against a post outside the library North door. This person was a little shorter than 5&#39;11&quot;, with a round face, and was not Eric or Harris. This person had a black hat turned backward, black boots, and one pants leg tucked into a boot. This person also has a large, full, black nylon bag with straps at his feet. Jason walked to the soccer field, heard firecrackers, and turned around. He turned, and saw the guy in the trench coat still there, with smoke rising beside him. He said this lone gunman walked down and back up the stair, shooting, then threw some bombs onto the roof, then ran back down the stairs and shot a different, louder gun, which Jason thinks was a shotgun. He thinks that was when Lance Kirkland was shot in the face. As Jason was running away, he saw a figure in a white T-shirt walking calmly from the parking lot towards the shooter.</p>

<p><strong>J-u-s-t-i-n Woods (page 1268)</strong></p>

<p>J-u-s-t-i-n was on the soccer field, and states that he was about 50 feet away, and saw two guys come out of the West entrance of the school. He identifies one shooter as Dylan, describes him as wearing a trench coat, a black hat, and no mask, carrying a handgun with a banana clip. He says that the other suspect wore a white shirt, black pants, boots, not hat, no mask, and more clean-cut that the other. This suspect had a shotgun, leaned against the fence and shot at people. Klebold was shooting at @#%$ and the other people on the soccer field as they ran away. He heard explosions, and saw smoke on the roof of the school.</p>

<p><strong>Bryan Stepp (page 1179)</strong></p>

<p>On 4/30/99, Bryan stated that he was playing soccer, and saw two guys near the West main entrance. One was wearing all black, black cargo pants, black trench coat, and a hat. The other suspect was wearing a black trench coat and a white shirt, and a hat. He saw the first suspect bend down and light fireworks or pipe bombs. When he stood up, Bryan could see he held a gun with a banana clip. He said that someone walked out of the West entrance door, and this suspect shot at this person, who then fell down. Bryan said that this suspect shot at students down the hill from him, and they all ran away except one, then the shooter shot at the student in the soccer field, who fled. When Bryan looked again, he heard explosions and saw smoke above the roof of the school. He also saw the banana-clip shooter shoot out the windows in the double doors of the West main entrance, then both shooters walked down the stairs toward the cafeteria, where they shot out a window.</p>

<p><strong>Evan Vitale (page 1243)</strong></p>

<p>On 4/20/99, Evan stated that he was in the Sr. parking lot, in a car that was about to leave school. He heard a &quot;pop pop pop&quot; and looked, and saw a kid on the top of the hill, shooting a rifle, about 30 shots. This gunman was wearing a white T-shirt, a trench coat, black pants, had dark hair and dark skin. He saw another individual in a dark trench coat, a black ball cap worn backwards, and long, blond hair, who was running up and down the stairs outside the West side of the cafeteria. As the car began pulling out, Evan noticed a third suspect. This person was stand by the wall next to the West side of the cafeteria. This suspect was holding a pump shotgun, and wore a white shirt and black pants. He was very sure this was not Dylan. Evan did not believe it possible for this suspect to be the same as the shooter on the hill, as it seemed that this would have required this person to move too far too fast.</p>

<p><strong>Trent Karnes (page 911)</strong></p>

<p>Trent was the driver of the car Evan Vitale was riding in. He was in the parking lot when he heard what he thought was someone roofing. It was 6 or 7 rapid gunshots. He turned and saw a person at the top of the outside stairs, holding a rifle, leaning on a fence, shooting down the hill at people. He was wearing a white dress shirt, black dress pants, and a thin black vest. Trent saw another person, about 6&#39;2&quot; or 6&#39;3&quot; tall, in a black trench coat, black pants, medium brown shoulder length hair, a black leather hat, and sunglasses. He saw this person running up and down the stairs, apparently looking at the victims between groups of shots by the first person. Trent estimated the distance at between 100 and 200 yards. He also mentions that there was a kid wearing a white T-shirt and faded blue jean shorts, standing, watching and smiling. He thinks this kid was not part of it, only that he thought it was a joke, as apparently did the other people he saw smiling as they ran.</p>

<p><strong>Mindy Pollock (page 1093)</strong></p>

<p>On 4/26/99, she gave this information to the FBI: She was about to get into Trent&#39;s car with Evan, where she heard firecrackers. She looked, and saw a man running up and down the stairs, and another standing at the top of the stairs shooting people. She thought is a skit. She described the running man as wearing black pants, black shirt, a black hat backwards, a black trench coat, and carrying a silver handgun, which she did not see him shoot. She described the shooter as wearing black pants, a white shirt, black suspenders, a red hat backwards, and a huge black gun.</p>

<p>Similarly, how does this explanation account for students who reported seeing suspicious activity <em>before</em> the massacre?</p>

<p>Melissa Chavez, for example, said that she met Harris, Klebold and four other males at the mall. They showed her a map of where they were planning to bomb the school. (9023) <a href="http://hugequestions.com/Eric/Columbine/GirlSaw3BoysWithGuns.mp3">Another girl reportedly</a> saw three members of the Trench Coat Mafia - none of them resembling Harris or Klebold - outside in the parking lot shortly before the shooting began with guns. Another witness claimed he saw Robert Perry, a member of the Trench Coat Mafia, driving near the school that morning. Others said they saw Joe Stair at the school that morning, and at least one student placed him at the school during the shooting. Perry was identified by many different witnesses as a gunman, and many witnesses also reported the suspects conversing with a male they addressed as <em>&quot;Joe.&quot;</em> <strong><em>Perry and Stair claim to have been at home asleep for the entire morning.</em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>6: this was protocol at the time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The &#39;stand down&#39; orders issued to the police sniper were not protocol, nor was the threats to shoot emergency responders who were trying to evacuate students. </p>

<p>One sheriff&#39;s deputy actually reportedly said that he was issued orders <a href="http://hugequestions.com/Eric/Columbine/FBIandATFinvolved.mp3">not to rescue victims outside.</a> Similarly, Sanders lay bleeding for nearly four hours before he was retrieved by police, despite the fact that students had been urgently alerting them to his location for hours. He then dies within twenty minutes of being taken into police custody.</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost like they wanted to maximize &#39;civilian&#39; casualties. All of it collectively establishes a pattern of inaction by the armies of law enforcement personnel on scene.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>22: a lot of the files you are referring to were purposely destroyed by the sheriff&#39;s office because they were being accused of having information that could have showed that they had evidence of the plans for this attack and did nothing with it ahead of time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, they were destroyed as part of a cover-up. Of course, it is possible that they were simply concerned about accusations of criminal negligence or it could <em>also</em> relate to the many dark secrets surrounding this attack.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not trying to fight against this idea completely, but there are legitimate answers to some of your questions. If you&#39;re interested, check out &quot;Columbine&quot; by Dave Cullen. It&#39;s a great expose into the whole situation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I actually suspect that <em>Columbine</em> is disinformation. Cullen completely ignores all evidence of a wider conspiracy.</p>

<p>Dave Cullen was a Second Lieutenant in the U.S. Army before working as a computer systems developer for Electronic Data Systems, which includes among its clients the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Marine Corps, the Defense Information Systems Agency and the U.K. Ministry of Defence. He <em>&quot;has worked in most regions of the U.S., as well as England, Kuwait and Bahrain&quot;</em> according to the biography once posted on his website.</p>

<p>He is, by all appearances, a U.S. intelligence asset. </p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it interesting how he has written the best-known book on the massacre while Michael Moore produced the best-known film about it <strong><em>at the behest of Thomas Klebold and Brooks Brown</em></strong>? It&#39;s all propaganda and perception management.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suspect adult parties were on site coordinating the assault. In addition to the man in his thirties who was seen firing a shotgun in the science hall, there was a man in his mid-twenties who was seen with a group of members of the Trench Coat Mafia shortly before the attack. </p>

<p>There are also many suspicious circumstances surrounding Chris Clarke, the mysterious <em>&quot;repairman&quot;</em> who was on the roof that day. </p>

<p>Assets of the U.S. intelligence services orchestrated this horrific tragedy.</p>

<p>Wish you great luck in your research. If you&#39;ve got any theories or thoughts you&#39;re willing to share, I&#39;m extremely interested. With all the crazy going on in the world today, this case is still very troubling to me and has pulled at my conciencer for almost two decades.</p>
