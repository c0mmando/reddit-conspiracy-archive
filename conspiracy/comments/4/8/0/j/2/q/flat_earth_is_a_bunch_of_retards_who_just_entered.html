    <div class="md"><p>Nah, been here for a couple of years. </p>

<p>What&#39;s the point of talking about this? If it&#39;s such a simple explanation as you posit, then why talk about it? Why dignify it with your astounding deductive reasoning that they&#39;re all stupid? Hardly worthy of a post. </p>

<p>It seems to me that you just want to stir shit around the issue and make it seem as if it&#39;s still up for contention. There&#39;s some stupid people who follow it sure, but people like high priest aren&#39;t stupid, they&#39;re just being paid. They can&#39;t just come in and poo poo everything and then be a flat earther or then they&#39;ll easily be dismissed. So instead, they post good info on vaccines, false flags and all the easy to digest conspiracies so that they have more cred when they post their flat earth bullshit. </p>

<p>I have a bunch of beliefs that are pretty out there which I&#39;m pretty set on and it&#39;d take quite a bit to change my mind on them, but I&#39;m not spending hrs and hrs trying to convince people of them. I don&#39;t really give a fuck what other people think about them. Why is that user so desperate to save everyone from this deception? Why do the AE911 mob mobilize with such vigor in every 9/11 thread? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I once discovered that <strong>the Flat Earth Society</strong> is headquartered in London and only a short distance from <strong>the Tavistock Institute</strong>, which was established by the Psychological Warfare Section of British Military Intelligence as a &#39;think tank&#39; on social policy and behavioural research. It is believed to be the worldwide center for mind control operations of the power elite. The Stanford Research Institute is reportedly its American branch.</p>

<p>And meanwhile, the map used in the symbolism of NASA, the United Nations and the U.S. Geological Survey features the world as it is portrayed by flat earth theorists. Furthermore, the World Atlas uses the flat earth model as well. What is going on? Some very strange form of psychological warfare?</p>

<p>Is it a part of Tavistock&#39;s plan to return the masses to <em>&quot;mystical primitivism&quot;</em> through a carefully controlled <em>&quot;revolution&quot;</em> of drug use, free love and occult revival? Is it simply designed to create confusion? </p>

<p>I was once a part of an online radio broadcast that covered conspiracy subjects from a very nuanced perspective. We never missed an opportunity to attack the various &#39;controlled opposition&#39; figures within the truth movement, and recognized that every aspect of the media - both mainstream and &#39;alternative&#39; - is owned by the power elite. and we had call-ins from various mysterious - often suspicious - people. </p>

<p>In one case, an individual named <em>&quot;Tom&quot;</em> called in and began arguing the Flat Earth Theory. He later began discussing <em>&quot;extraterrestrial visitations.&quot;</em> He had also briefly mentioned that his uncle worked for the CIA. In our chatroom, I pressed him on the matter. I asked him that since he himself said <em>&quot;once CIA, always CIA,&quot;</em> did he acknowledge that his uncle is a CIA asset? </p>

<p>After several attempts at evading the question, he admitted that his uncle was indeed an Agency asset.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Will do.</p>

<p>One of the earliest and leading promoters of the modern flat earth theories was William Carpenter, an English occultist who was deeply interested in mesmerism and spiritualism. </p>

<p>Carpenter was a disciple of Samuel Birley Rowbotham, an English &#39;inventor,&#39; writer and <em>&quot;itinerant lecturer</em>, who organized a utopian socialist commune in the Fens. He held patents for <em>&quot;cure-all elixirs&quot;</em> similar to the kind John D. Rockefeller&#39;s father William, known as &quot;Devil Bill,&quot; marketed from town to town. <a href="http://www.theflatearthsociety.org/forum/index.php?topic=61376.0">Here it is revealed</a> that the colleges where Rowbotham claims to have earned his medical degree have no record of his attendance. He is a highly mysterious man, and we know virtually nothing of his life outside of his &#39;flat earth&#39; writings. His frequent traveling - ostensibly solely for <em>&quot;lectures&quot;</em> - would be a good cover for intelligence work.</p>

<p>Is it a coincidence that both Rowbotham, Carpenter, and Samuel Shenton, founder of the first organized flat earth group, The International Flat Earth Research Society (IFERS), were all Englishmen? Shenton was the son of a Sergeant Major in the British Army. </p>

<p>I do not intend to insult the English, and in fact I have English heritage. It should be recognized, however, that Great Britain has been one of the international power elite&#39;s primary bases of operation for generations, Switzerland and Italy being two others. British Intelligence <strong><em>created</em></strong> the OSS and the CIA, and provided them extensive training during their early years. British Intelligence had earlier reorganized U.S. Army Intelligence along British lines shortly before World War I. Recent revelations about <strong><em>the Five Eyes</em></strong> confirm that the <em>&quot;special relationship&quot;</em> between the British Empire and its colonies is alive and well today.</p>

<p>U.S. intelligence assets were also involved, however. After Shenton&#39;s death, the reigns of the IFERS were passed to Charles K. Johnson, an <em>&quot;airplane mechanic&quot;</em> from San Francisco - a center of CIA mind control projects - who directed it from his ranch in Lancaster, Pennsylvania - <strong><em>near Edwards Air Force Base.</em></strong> There was also, of course, CIA asset <em>&quot;Tom&quot;</em> who entered our online chatroom and spoke about calling other conspiracy research shows to promote his flat earth theories. </p>

<p>Ellis Hillman, a British labour politician, briefly headed the IFERS. He was born into a political family, and his relatives included American labour leader Sidney Hillman <strong><em>and Chaim Herzog, the sixth President of Israel.</em></strong> In other words, Hillman was born to an elite bloodline.</p>

<p>In 1946, Hillman was recruited by the British Revolutionary Communist Party and joined one of its branches in <strong><em>London</em></strong> - one of the power elite&#39;s worldwide bases of operations, Rome being another. He <strong>corresponded with Natalia Sedova, the widow of Leon Trotsky,</strong>and played a key role in the Socialist Review Group. </p>

<p>Despite his lifelong commitment to the communist cause, Hillman was &#39;elected&#39; to the London County Council, which existed until 1965 when it was decided that there was no longer a &#39;County of London&#39; and it became the Greater London Council. Hillman remained there until 1981, and chaired its Arts &amp; Recreation Committee. </p>
