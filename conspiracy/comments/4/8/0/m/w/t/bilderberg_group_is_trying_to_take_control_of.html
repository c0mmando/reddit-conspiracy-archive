    <div class="md"><p>OK! Now we have you in the right frame of mind. Please note that I&#39;m trying to share information with you, and I&#39;ll answer anything you want to know.</p>

<p>Please note that the hashes are VERY easy to generate. The encryption part is actually very easy. You might be imagining a VPN of some sorts, where a stream is being encrypted with an SSL certificate, which is, as you correctly imagine, pre-generated. But Bitcoin transactions are very smallâ€”each block is around 1MB (with many transactions already being dumped because Bitcoin&#39;s Blockstream devs refuse to consider raising it), so it&#39;s no big deal to make sure that blocks hash correctly.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-Bitcoin-miners-actually-solving-What-kind-of-math-problems-are-they-solving-and-what-do-they-achieve-by-solving-them">From here:</a></strong></p>

<p>Miners are solving hashes of the next block.  In bitcoin the algorithm used is SHA256.  A hash is the word (can be noun or verb) for a cryptographic algorithm that produces a repeatable but non-reversible string of numbers and letters, in SHA256 the outcome is a 256 bit string.  Input data can be anything, one number or the entirety of wikipedia will both hash to a 256 bit string when put through the SHA256 algo.  Changing one single letter in Wikipedia will completely change the 256 bit output string.  And obviously, you cannot generate wikipedia based on a 256 bit string (if you could you&#39;d have the world&#39;s best compression algorithm), thus it is non-reversible.  But as long as it is the same exact data, the same exact hash will be calculated from that data every time, thus it&#39;s repeatable.</p>

<p>So now that you know what hashing means, what is being hashed?  Many things, all the data contained in the next block in the blockchain.  Blocks contain transactions and block header data.  When the miner&#39;s node receives new transactions from the network, the miner incorporates them into the next block&#39;s data and continues hashing.</p>

<p>Block headers contain 6 things:  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>The miner&#39;s client version.  Pretty straight forward, the version number of the software the miner is using.</p></li>
<li><p>The hash of the previous block in the blockchain.  This is what was calculated by the miners last time, and is now being calculated for the next block.</p></li>
<li><p>The Merkle root of all transactions on the block.  This is confusing for some, but it is basically just a hash of all transactions in the block.  When a new transaction comes in, there is a new Merkle root.</p></li>
<li><p>A timestamp.  </p></li>
<li><p>The target difficulty of the network.</p></li>
<li><p>A nonce (random number).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>All of that data is getting hashed through the SHA256 algorithm into a 256 bit number.</p>

<p>5 and 6 need more explaining.  The difficulty is adjust every 2,016 blocks.  The reason for the difficulty field is to keep blocks being found on average every 10 minutes, no matter how many miners there are.  The more miners, the higher the difficulty.  Miners are hashing billions of numbers per second between 0 and 2<sup>256.</sup>  The number that miners generate must be a number smaller than the target difficulty of the network to be valid.  That&#39;s how the network keeps blocks being found every 10min on average.</p>

<p>But if miners are calculating billions, even trillions (the whole network put together is about 350 petahashes per second) of times per second, and if the input data stays the same, won&#39;t miners just be calculating the same thing over and over again, until the timestamp changes or a new transaction comes in to change the input data?  Yes.  That is what the nonce is for (number 6).  The nonce is a random 32 bit number that miners insert into the block header.  As mentioned, even the smallest change in input data will completely change the output hash.  So miners can add in random bits of data in the nonce so that they aren&#39;t calculating the same thing over and over, and have a new chance at finding a hash number lower than the target difficulty with every calculation.</p>

<p>Hope that makes sense, happy to answer any follow ups :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the information. So every time a difficulty is &quot;solved&quot; those numbers are encoded in the blockchain? And those numbers are useful to for generating keys for the SHA-256 algorithm. Is that not correct?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but no, not in the way you&#39;re thinking. Each block must hash to the one below it, and the ones that come after also must hash. That&#39;s it. The security from the mining comes in that if you have 100 blocks and I want to steal your coins in block 25, I have to 1) rewrite block 25 and steal your coins, 2) then beat all other miners to re-write all the blocks from 26 and up. Not possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are mistaken. There are two ways it could be accomplished, both are certainly unlikely due to the amount of resources required but they are absolutely possible. </p>

<p>First is obviously by obtaining a massive amount of bitcoin ASICs (computers specifically designed for mining bitcoins) you could eventually gain 51% or more of processing power by significantly increasing the available processing power. </p>

<p>Second would be to gain control of 3 of the largest mining pools, either through collusion between these entities or acquisition by resources. You would then, in an instant, control greater than 51% of the available processing power. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it is likely to happen, but it is possible to accomplish and would be pretty devastating for bitcoin.  </p>

<p>that&#39;s bullshit Btc can&#39;t be &#39;controlled&#39; unless the whole code was changed, and that&#39;s not going to happen --</p>

<p>The Blochchain can&#39;t be &#39;rewritten&#39; ,, essentially once the Btc algorythm began, it can only go through to completion of the 22,000,000 Btcs that can be mined</p>

<p>The thing about monopolizing Btc is that you still can&#39;t manipulate the currency to benefit you, </p>

<p>Anyway, bu the time people start using digital currencies we&#39;re going to have other things to worry about</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it isn&#39;t complete bullshit you fucking dolt. It certainly is theoretical, but it is a realistic possibility and is one of bitcoin&#39;s greatest concerns. You clearly have a facile understanding of the technologies involved in bitcoin or cryptocurrencies in general. Like I said, this would not be an effective method of controlling bitcoin, though it would grant whatever entity a significant amount of control over the block chain (including the ability to manipulate historical transactions, duplicate transactions, reject transactions, and perhaps even prevent the mining of bitcoin) and would almost certainly destroy any user confidence in bitcoin as a currency, effectively ending bitcoin. </p>

<p>Please Google 51% attack and stop thinking you know about things that you clearly do not know about. I love cryptocurrencies, I firmly believe they are the framework for the future of our society. That does not mean we should pretend that there are not clear caveats, and this is one of them.</p>

<p>You have NO IDEA WHATSOEVER about how Bitcoins are &#39;mined&#39; do you?  You <em>cannot</em> &quot;re-write&quot; the Blockchain!</p>

<p>The &quot;block chain&quot; is currently about 5gig in size, and ONLY the last 32 digits ared used for the next &#39;block&#39;</p>

<p>Each &#39;Bitcoin&#39; has a <em>unique</em> signature, as does <em>every</em> Btc transaction. You CANT &quot;manipulate historical transactions&quot;! </p>

<p>Sometimes &#39;forks&#39; do occur in the Blockchain (very rarely)but the computers &#39;fight it out&#39; amongst themselves until enough agree ... you can&#39;t &#39;force&#39; a <em>mathematical equation</em> with <em>only one answer</em> </p>

<p>it&#39;s things like this which MAKE Bitcoin so cool</p>

<p>TPTB tried a long time ago to become &quot;superminers&quot; with &quot;ASIC superhardware&quot;</p>

This is accomplished by either moving or excluding and recreating blocks in the block chain.

<p>Where&#39;s the bit about a &quot;51% attack&quot; in the &#39;paper&#39; you linked, huh?  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>You won&#39;t get far trying to baffle me with Bullshit.</p>

<p>Just becoz a persson puts a paper on github with lots of <em>apparently</em> &quot;sophisticated&quot; thoughts and calculations, does NOT make it True/correct.</p>

<p>&quot;who&#39;s the Idiot&quot;?</p>

<p>You&#39;re The Idiot here sunshine!  You just gave me a link to data <em>which supports</em> what I am saying!</p>

<p>Talk about shooting yourself in both feet </p>

<p>I&#39;d lmao if it wasn&#39;t So sad that retards like yourself actually <em>think</em> they know!</p>

<p>You know what &quot;thought, thought&quot; don&#39;t you? (you say you know everything else)</p>

<p>Who&#39;s DOING this &quot;51% attack?&quot; ... You&#39;re talking about fantasies ... I guess you wrote that 
&#39;white paper&#39; (that&#39;s ONLY 4 days old!)</p>

<p>Like I <em>already</em> said, the BIG banks TRIED THEIR BEST <em>several YEARS ago</em> to &quot;take control&quot; of Btc <em>and failed</em></p>

<p>that&#39;s bullshit Btc can&#39;t be &#39;controlled&#39; unless the whole code was changed, and that&#39;s not going to happen --</p>

<p>That is happening right now, with Blockstream.</p>

<p>Bitcoin can still be controlled, even though it is open source. For instance, if you are designing a car, but the car can only have two cylinders, then it will not turn into a bus, it will turn into a motorcycle. </p>

<p>This analogy is similar to Bitcoin&#39;s 1MB blocksize limit. This limit was put in to allow the programmers to block spammers from &quot;flooding&quot; the network with pointless transactions. That limit is still there today, and Blockstream does not want to change it. This means that demand for Bitcoin transactions will very soon out-strip its network capacity, leaving Bitcoin&#39;s blockchain available only to the highest bidder. Blockstream&#39;s planned &quot;Lightning Network&quot; will allow thousands of transactions to happen off-chain, and then be &quot;settled&quot; at some recurring time-period by one transaction to the Bitcoin layer. That transaction might cost tens of even hundreds of dollars, eventually, meaning that the only ones benefiting from these transactions will be the big corporations. </p>

<p>If you THOUGHT about it, you would see how this makes <em>perfect sense</em> -- for IF the multiples transactions total value was say, $100, and &quot;x%&quot; is paid, it stands to Reason that another group of multiple transactions that total $1million would have a larger amount paid BUT the percentage <em>stays the same!</em>.</p>

<p>Did you fail maths or haven&#39;t you learned about &#39;percentages&#39; yet?</p>

<p>Satoshi wrote a great program that took into consideration &quot;what if&quot; someone controlled &gt;50% of the computing power.</p>

<p>it&#39;s no longer worthwhile to try and be a &quot;supernode&quot; and &#39;control all mining&#39; .. that opportunity was gone by 2012. By which time the big banks were all running &#39;ASIC supernodes&#39; anyway</p>

<p>AND THEY (the Banks) SAID &quot;bitcoin is risky <em>becoz</em> &quot;it lacks a central controlling body&quot; --- what&#39;s changed since then?</p>

<p>you should read up on Btc protocol, it would stop you sayiong shit like this</p>

<p>Tell me, ALL the Big banks said Btc was a scam and that <em>everyone involved</em> would end up broke becoz of it, so they said to their customers &quot;STAY AWAY FROM BITCOINS COZ THEY ARE A SCAM&quot;</p>

<p>what changed since then?</p>

<p>You are absolutely <em>right</em> in your points about Satoshi, etc., and with settlements, with banking, here. Yes, I get how settlements work. NOTHING wrong with Bitcoin transactions happening off-chain. But will those off-chain solutions be truly decentralized? Or will they turn into chokepoints of censorship and control? We suspect that the blocksize cannot increase past a certain level because transactions do not scale linearly, and these solutions will be GOOD. <strong>But there is NO arguing the point that Blockstream is trying to choke the Bitcoin protocol in the here and now with their arbitrary 1MB limit in order to bootstrap those other solutions.</strong> It&#39;s too early for it. </p>

<p>Yes, the size of the blockchain is one issue</p>

<p>what makes you say this?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe Btc is a profitable revenue stream for centralized banking. shit, they TRIED to destroy ALL/ANY consumer confidence in it at the &#39;beginning&#39; 2010  onwards and esp after after the second &#39;crash&#39; in 2012. Then they played the ASIC card and dicovered in &#39;real time&#39; that they can&#39;t <em>profitably scam</em> Btcs</p>

<p>and here we are with people now proposing that <strong>the Blockchain is such an unbreachable entity</strong> that it be used to validate other forms of transactions too!</p>

<p>That&#39;s far from what that other joker is saying!</p>

<p>These Liquid dudes are just capitalizing on the <em>current fact</em> Btc usually need to be &#39;verified&#39; to be paid/converted to fiat (Or vice versa) at some stage. </p>

<p>The current &#39;6 confirmations&#39; required once could take up to a few hours. That is no longer the case but it can&#39; still take some time and it&#39;s here that Bitstream with it&#39;s Liquid protocols hopes to be of service. </p>

<p>I think many of those people are just being human and don&#39;t want to change .... &quot;if it&#39;s not broke, don&#39;t fix it&quot; type mentality.</p>

<p>I stopped mining a few years back ... just another one of the people with some the 85% of Btcs alread mined &quot;lost&quot; on a HDD somewhere!</p>

<p>In many ways the cryptocurrency projects (~200+) will need to be consolidated if people are going to use CC globally, which at the moment they do via converting the Btc into other fiat currency. I think &#39;smartphone wallets&#39; could eventually come to the &#39;rescue&#39; but TBH I can&#39;t tell the future :D</p>
