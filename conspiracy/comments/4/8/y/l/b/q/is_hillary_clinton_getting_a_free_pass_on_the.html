        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/18/AR2005061801105.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/18/AR2005061801105.html</a></p>

<p>Senator Byrd gathered 150 of his friends, collected &quot;fees&quot; bought white robes and hoods... And founded a new chapter of the KKK.  He once spoke of African American servicemen as racial mongrels and refused to fight alongside of them.  Yet both of the Clintons publicly endorsed Byrd... They endorsed him! Not the other way around.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/IPL2JlJBuqs">Hillary endorsing Byrd</a></p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/8Fg3XNTMzNo">Bill endorsing Byrd</a></p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/PnO6ai0Ktro">Byrd&#39;s infamous white nigger interview</a></p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/7XUvSzaxMic">CNN confronts Trump about Duke, then Duke responds to CNN and trump</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1945 Byrd penned a letter to Mississippi’s segregationist senator Theodore Bilbo, wherein he expressed anger over the Truman administration’s efforts to integrate the U.S. military. Wrote Byrd:</p>

<p>“I shall never fight in the armed forces with a Negro by my side ... Rather I should die a thousand times, and see Old Glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again, than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels, a throwback to the blackest specimen from the wilds.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now we have for the past week heard the media absolutely trying to assassinate the character of Trump based upon David Duke endorsing Trump, again not the other way around.  Duke endorsed Trump, Trump did not endorse Duke... Actually according to David Duke himself, he never endorsed Trump.</p>

<p>If we are going to analyze presidential candidate&#39;s associations with people who once represented the KKK, like Byrd and Duke.  Shouldn&#39;t we atleast have a fair playing field?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it worth mentioning that Senator Byrd left the KKK, recanted that part of his life, and repeatedly admitted it was wrong, and apologized profusely for it, all before he ever met Hillary?    Or that the NAACP issued <a href="http://www.naacp.org/press/entry/naacp-mourns-the-passing-of-u.s.-senator-robert-byrd/">this</a> statement when he died, addressing Byrd&#39;s &quot;transformation&quot; and showing appreciation for Byrd&#39;s support of the Civil Right Act?      </p>

<p>Byrd spent the second half of his life trying to make up for his dark past.<br/>
I don&#39;t think Duke has ever apologized for his Klan ties, has he?      </p>

<p>Is this significant to it not being brought up in the media?</p>

<p>The fact that he&#39;s dead and has been since 2010 might have something to do with it as well... As far as I&#39;ve heard, he&#39;s not currently endorsing anyone. :-)</p>

<p>That being said, yeah, the fact that he was once a member of the KKK isn&#39;t his life story. I want politicians to say, &quot;I did this thing and it&#39;s wrong.&quot; More, he even pushed to get people to <em>not</em> join, pointing out that the organization was an &quot;albatross&quot; around his neck, politically, even decades after leaving it behind when he spoke to young people in his state.</p>

<p>Duke, as you point out, is unapologetic and still very much in favor of a return to what he feels are the good ol&#39; days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh, what? It is the right - exclusively - that has kept Byrd&#39;s KKK membership, now 60 years in the past, at the center of public attention. And they always seem to leave out the part about how he renounced his old views DECADES AGO, and long before Bill or Hillary ever met the man. </p>

<p>But then, the right is desperate for an example of a Democrat they can use to suggest hypocrisy, or false equivalence, even if they do need to distort the truth and conceal most of Byrd&#39;s history in order to do it.</p>

<p>How weak is the argument that goes, &quot;yes, it&#39;s true, our GOP front-running is actively pandering to the KKK and white supremacists TODAY, and he has been going around the country saying amazingly racist things for the last six months. BUT ROBERT BYRD!!!1!!&quot;</p>

<p>You have to laugh at how pathetic that is, don&#39;t you?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why the right doesn&#39;t just man up and admit they are racists, instead of playing all these stupid &quot;but Byrd is a racist too!!!&quot; games.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exhalted Cyclops.  There&#39;s no &quot;Grand Cyclops&quot; in the Klan. </p>

<p>The ranks are, lowest to highest:</p>

<p>Ghoul (average Klan member)</p>

<p>Exhalted Cyclops (Leads a den, or group)</p>

<p>Grand Giant of the Province (basically leads a section, or a county)</p>

<p>Grand Titan of the Dominion (Covers several counties)</p>

<p>Grand Dragon of the Realm (controls a state)</p>

<p>Grand Scribe (Secretary of the Klan)</p>

<p>Grand Magi (Vice President)</p>

<p>Grand Imperial Wizard (President)</p>

<p>There&#39;s also &quot;Night Hawks&quot; who act as guards and assistants for the Grand Cyclops and Giant of the province, Furies who assist the Grand Titan, as well as Harpies who assist the Grand Dragon.</p>

<p>(As to how I know this, I grew up in Mississippi, and attended a private school where the Grand Dragon for the state sat on our school governor&#39;s board.)</p>

<p>Edit to add:</p>

<p>Before you ask me what it was like going to that school, being around that kind of people, let me head things off and see if I can answer the questions before you need to ask.</p>

<p>1.) I didn&#39;t have much choice in matters where I went to school. Most private schools in Mississippi have some tie to the Klan, usually minor, but it&#39;s there.</p>

<p>2.) They didn&#39;t really talk about things, though you generally knew who was associated with what.  Whose father was a Ghoul, or Cyclops, or Fury.</p>

<p>3.) I walked on eggshells the whole time I was there.  There was an unspoken undercurrent of threats for anyone who stepped out of line.  That&#39;s not just racially, either.  Anything that might bring too much attention to the school, would quickly result in trouble.  For example, one summer a boy in my Jr class was caught drinking under age and driving.  Even though he was out of the school at the time, he was still expelled.</p>

<p>4.) I try not to talk about that part of my past. If anything it just brings up more questions than I&#39;m comfortable answering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is completely untrue.  Perhaps the Tea Party was hijacked by the Kochs, but Tea Partiers are so far from being racist in my experiences with them.  They are all about Freedom and Liberty, for all.  True Freedom is you and me, and is completely color blind.  Your comparing the Tea party to the KKK is totally erroneous, and laughable.  You are so misinformed on this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why does it matter if Duke endorsed Trump anyways?</p>

<p>If Manson were to endorse Sanders then should Sanders or who ever be attacked over such an endorsement?</p>

<p>It&#39;s a pretty bad low blow to attack anyone over any endorsement.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not like Clinton or Trump is having a pot luck dinner at some kkk rally.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter really. The KKK is  basically a honey pot for the FBI at this point.  It&#39;s not like the KKK pushes the world to ww3 unlike pro-Israel groups who the establishment supports absolutely blindly.</p>

<p>Gangs kill more blacks every year than the number of  blacks killed in the history of the KKK. I don&#39;t see people go after cheap high point pistols but they sure love going people&#39;s 2000 dollar semi-auto rifles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Serious question - which black leaders have endorsed Trump? The only one I could find is Charles Evers, brother of a civil rights activist who was murdered in 1963. I remember Trump met with a bunch of black religious leaders some months back, but as far as I know none of them have endorsed him. </p>

<p>EDIT: I found another. The National Black Republican Association has officially endorsed Trump. Still, it doesn&#39;t seem like he has a whole lot of support from minorities. </p>

<p>The only problem I have is when one of those groups starts trying to piss on the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> tree to mark it as &quot;their exclusive territory&quot; and attacking anyone who wants to discuss a different theory.

They like to say they have changed, but the only thing that has changed is how they institute their racism. They do it now using the mantra of &quot;good intentions&quot;. Unfortunately it works. They&#39;ve managed to keep the blacks on the government plantation with entitlements. </p>

<p>Every other group that started out in inner-cities and ghettos worked their way out by their bootstraps. The Irish (<a href="http://www.africanamerica.org/topic/the-irish-the-forgotten-white-slaves">the first American slaves</a>) and the Jews to name a few.  </p>

<p>The blacks are still there after all these years. Why? Government entitlements most of which started with LBJ&#39;s Great Society program is the reason. That wasn&#39;t a coincidence or a sign of the times. It was calculated and it has worked. It took away incentive which kept the blacks in the inner-cities while at the same time buying their votes. Before the Great Society by percentage there were less broken homes, less fatherless children and less unwed pregnancies in the black population than there were in the white population.</p>
