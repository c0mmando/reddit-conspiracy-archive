<p>The system is afraid of a guy like this which is why the former President of Mexico, the current President of China and the POPE...basically all the players in the criminal new world order...hate Trump. Trump is a free agent that doesn&#39;t play by their rules. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump has said basically everything on every topic.  What that means is that he has said basically nothing on any given topic.  He is strategically saying vague things like this specifically for you (people like you).  You have latched onto this and will probably vote for him now regardless of the fact that he hasn&#39;t made you an actual promise and has no intention of following through.  </p>

<p>Everyone has that one topic that they want beyond all else, a thing that they want so badly that they will overlook or justify all other disagreements.  If a candidate hits it then they have captured your vote.  Trump is a master at saying all and nothing at the exact same time.  For those that want something specific, being vague is enough.  This is a masterful plan that is really effective at collecting votes from all different sectors of the population.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You assume too much. I have real problems with a Trump administration one being he will most certainly go into full dictator mode once elected. The problem I have with Trump now is that he intentionally dumbs down subjects by the way he speaks and when he does speak, he bloviates providing almost NO substance or specifics. </p>

<p>The only way he gets my support is if he continues to make enemies of the people who are at war with our freedom, plus it&#39;d be a cold day in hell before I vote for that corrupt lying POS Clinton. </p>

<p>and he needs Palin as VP, that would be the dream ticket for comedy 2016, four glorious years of amusement and fun.</p>

<p>IMHO Trump+Palin totally fcuking things up for four years would force the system to go back to a moral and ethical system, the law people would have the breathing space to reverse the illegalities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree.  A Trump+(idiot) presidency would not force the system to go back to a moral and ethical system.  It would legitimize the establishment system we currently have.  People would say &#39;this is what happens when you look at people outside the system.&#39;  It would make it that much more pressing that we get back to the status quo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just saying politicians lie so I don&#39;t know why you would want trump to speak pledges into existence, they have the same usual possibility of just lying anyway.

    <div class="md"><p>Your argument rests on the assumption that everything politicians say is a lie.  This is false.  Many politicians mean most of what they promise, they are just incapable of actually executing it.  You can get an idea for what types of laws the president will sign and veto though based on their pledges.  Take Obama, he hasn&#39;t been able to pass much but a lot of what he has gotten done is at least consistent with his platform.  For example, his stance on the environment is something he made clear.  He didn&#39;t pass laws to get much of it done, but he has made some modest movements in the direction of a cleaner environment.  </p>

<p>Trump doesn&#39;t even bother to be specific enough about what he believes to give us this idea.  Some think he will fight corporate greed&#39;s role in environmental damage, others think he will relax regulations on corporations by removing &#39;overbearing&#39; restrictions on environmental standards.</p>

<p>His lack of specifics is really important.  His lack of pledges is really important.  Your comment is a false dilemma logical fallacy:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is what you guys are interpreting as he will unravel 9/11?  Please give me a break.  The question was if he would target terrorist families.  His answer was that the terrorist families know what their fathers and sons are doing (9/11 hijackers went home before 9/11), so yes I will bomb them because them knowing their family is a terrorist warrants a trial-less death penalty that usually has collateral damage.</p>
