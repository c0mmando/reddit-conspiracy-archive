       He's signaling a lot of things. Trump recently made some comments about secret pages referring to the 28 missing pages of the 9/11 report where it alleges Saudi Arabia quaterbacked the 9/11 attacks and let the attacks happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The system is afraid of a guy like this which is why the former President of Mexico, the current President of China and the POPE...basically all the players in the criminal new world order...hate Trump. Trump is a free agent that doesn't play by their rules.

       Trump has said basically everything on every topic.  What that means is that he has said basically nothing on any given topic.  He is strategically saying vague things like this specifically for you (people like you).  You have latched onto this and will probably vote for him now regardless of the fact that he hasn't made you an actual promise and has no intention of following through.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone has that one topic that they want beyond all else, a thing that they want so badly that they will overlook or justify all other disagreements.  If a candidate hits it then they have captured your vote.  Trump is a master at saying all and nothing at the exact same time.  For those that want something specific, being vague is enough.  This is a masterful plan that is really effective at collecting votes from all different sectors of the population.

       You assume too much. I have real problems with a Trump administration one being he will most certainly go into full dictator mode once elected. The problem I have with Trump now is that he intentionally dumbs down subjects by the way he speaks and when he does speak, he bloviates providing almost NO substance or specifics.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way he gets my support is if he continues to make enemies of the people who are at war with our freedom, plus it'd be a cold day in hell before I vote for that corrupt lying POS Clinton.

       and he needs Palin as VP, that would be the dream ticket for comedy 2016, four glorious years of amusement and fun.

       IMHO Trump+Palin totally fcuking things up for four years would force the system to go back to a moral and ethical system, the law people would have the breathing space to reverse the illegalities.

       I disagree.  A Trump+(idiot) presidency would not force the system to go back to a moral and ethical system.  It would legitimize the establishment system we currently have.  People would say 'this is what happens when you look at people outside the system.'  It would make it that much more pressing that we get back to the status quo.

       I am missing why this is relevant after my comment.  Are you saying Trump lies?  Are you saying the others lie so Trump is better?  Are you saying he doesn't need to be vague because he could just lie?  Are you agreeing with 'Trump is manipulative enough toward the public he doesn't even have to lie'?

       I'm just saying politicians lie so I don't know why you would want trump to speak pledges into existence, they have the same usual possibility of just lying anyway. So your argument of him not hitting anything specifically is irrelevant, literally none of them hold to what they say anyway.

       Your argument rests on the assumption that everything politicians say is a lie.  This is false.  Many politicians mean most of what they promise, they are just incapable of actually executing it.  You can get an idea for what types of laws the president will sign and veto though based on their pledges.  Take Obama, he hasn't been able to pass much but a lot of what he has gotten done is at least consistent with his platform.  For example, his stance on the environment is something he made clear.  He didn't pass laws to get much of it done, but he has made some modest movements in the direction of a cleaner environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump doesn't even bother to be specific enough about what he believes to give us this idea.  Some think he will fight corporate greed's role in environmental damage, others think he will relax regulations on corporations by removing 'overbearing' restrictions on environmental standards.
      </p>
      <p>
       His lack of specifics is really important.  His lack of pledges is really important.  Your comment is a false dilemma logical fallacy:

       That is what you guys are interpreting as he will unravel 9/11?  Please give me a break.  The question was if he would target terrorist families.  His answer was that the terrorist families know what their fathers and sons are doing (9/11 hijackers went home before 9/11), so yes I will bomb them because them knowing their family is a terrorist warrants a trial-less death penalty that usually has collateral damage.

       He also got the number of aircraft wrong, stating that it was  the "third plane" which went down in Shanksville. Which either means he thinks a missle hit the Pentagon- or he can't count. Unfortunately I'm leaning towards the latter.

       I would say the narrative is on the edge of conspiracy but goverment friendly, I mean as long as he sticks to the "incompetence" narrative, there is nothing out of the ordinary, after all he is on a campaign, he is in attacking mode, he must be allowed to say things like that

       He won't save you. He won't bring justice to a completely broken system. He won't indict the real perpetrators of 9/11. He won't stop endless war. He won't destroy the Federal Reserve.

       As a candidate, Trump is responsible for taking the anti establishment sentiment that is sweeping across Europe and America and redirecting it into a candidate. Instead of over throwing the globalist regime.

       If this has affected Trumps mind, it shows why it was so important for us to promote the Saudi angle to 911. It could rescue America to have a President with a little bit of relevent knowledge about the world, like that the saudis are not gods gift to humanity. What if he actually starts investigating it when hes in office, can you imagine the shit storm, somebody with that level of power and genuine intent. Once you start turning over rocks you might not find Saudis.
