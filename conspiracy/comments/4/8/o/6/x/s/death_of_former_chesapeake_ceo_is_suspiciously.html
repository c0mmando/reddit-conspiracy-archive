       Imagine how it must suck for these guys...Driving along and all of a sudden, the car starts accelerating on its own, faster and faster and the brakes don't work, and before you can even reach for a phone to call for help, BAM, you are gurgling your last breaths, impaled in burning, acrid wreckage.  What a way to go.

       I'm not 100% certain the cause of death was someone hacking into his vehicles computer and taking over the controls... but the fact that the DOJ had indicted him the day before and he was denying the legitimacy of the charges makes me very skeptical. And on top of that the FBI is also misbehaving with the Apple backdoor nonsense. Our Federal government is not playing very nice right now

       If he was murdered, it seems far-fetched to me that it would be the DoJ (who just indicted him) and not whoever it was would be implicated by his testimony - he'd probably seek a deal with the DoJ and sell out others and possibly give information that would cause Chesapeake to appear on much shakier ground, so people could stand to lose more money than they already have with the oil boom-bust. And now he can't do that.

       Yea of course anything is possible. It just seemed like Aubrey was no shrinking violet, especially after reading "The Frackers" by Zuckerman, and he had already publicly stated that the charges were singling him out when the practice was very common (joint leasing).
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately in the times we live in, it is not easy to automatically assume no wrong doing on the part of Federal Agencies. The amount of times they lie to the public seems to outnumber the times they tell the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I work in the oil industry and it seems a lot harder for me to imagine an oil company having enough spare time on their hands to be able orchestrate a professional hit in a days notice. Usually that ability/skill takes a lot of time/knowledge to develop and most oil companies I know are too busy looking for oil, packaging deals, managing payrolls, networking etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       A Federal Agency on the other hand has access to a whole network of professionals who ONLY research how to make a clean hit, suppress dissension, eliminate threats to "freedom".
      </p>
      <p>
       Again I'm only speculating, and hate that I live in a world where trust in our current government has to be so low.

       Interesting point, I didn't think about the timing of the indictment dropping the day before - that brings up another aspect - was knowledge of the upcoming indictment circulated beforehand? I'm not totally convinced he didn't commit suicide, but you'd think he'd know he could plea down, they rarely seem to really hurt these guys like they do smaller-time crooks.

       After having read how Aubrey helped pioneer the hydraulic fracturing revolution, he did not seem like the type of man who would just "give up".
      </p>
      <p>
       Who knows why the DOJ "singled" him out as he publicly stated. From the outside looking in, it seems like a pretty bullshit charge and an attempt to jam him up.

       Of course I'm not saying this was definitively a conspiracy, but like the Michael Hastings case this one leaves us all asking the same questions. Was he suicidal? Was he drunk? The answers to either of those questions are very murky

       He is saying that Aubrey McClendon colluded with another company (or more) in the price fixing scheme.  It is easy to assume that he may testify against the others to lessen his sentence.  Therefore he would be a serious liability to some very rich and powerful people....
      </p>

       I'll add, the reports say 'he drove straight into a wall'.  Make of that what you will, but I'd lean towards a suicide...

       I personally think he knew he was fucked, depressed, and figured suicide was the easy way out.  Suicide seems a pussy way out so he feigned a car accident.  Might have also had a life insurance policy that wouldn't pay in the event of a suicide.
      </p>
      <p>
       As per hacking cars. I certainly know some people/groups have the ability to do that - but holy shit there must be thousands of easier ways to kill a guy on the down low...
