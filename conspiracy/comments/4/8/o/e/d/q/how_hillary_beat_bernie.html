<p>Hillary won six precincts in a row by coin toss because organizers refused to call for recounts. <a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2016/02/02/sometimes-iowa-democrats-award-caucus-delegates-coin-flip/79680342/">source</a></p>

<p>No. Neither choice is good.</p>

<p>Bernie is a communist. He claims to be a &#39;socialist,&#39; because &#39;socialism&#39; is <em>amazingly popular</em> among today&#39;s <del>idiots</del> youth and liberals who either lack the life experience to know or are <em>actively ignoring</em> the fact that communalism <em>fails at every level</em>. No, &#39;socialism&#39; is communism in a pretty new dress to appeal to ignorant, desperate masses.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>America&#39;s healthcare system is so bad it&#39;s not even funny anymore</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And <del>communism</del> <em>socialism!</em> is going to <em>fix</em> that for us, right? Bull fucking shit. The system is bad, yeah--it <em>really</em> is. But the last &#39;fix&#39; to healthcare, Obamacare, fucked over the middle class and <em>you people</em> went on and on <em>and on</em> about how great it was... right up until the premium and deductible hike <em>we all knew was coming to begin with</em>. So, you&#39;ll understand if I don&#39;t want any more idiots with <em>grand ideas</em> going anywhere near my medical system again any time soon, unless it&#39;s to dismantle Obamacare.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and it&#39;s entirely because of puppet presidents that maintain the broken corporate insurance system instead of adopting a national health service. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And who voted that puppet into office? Oh, right... the <em>same, exact people</em> who now want to vote a communist into office. You suckers keep falling for &quot;HOPE AND CHANGE,&quot; in the hope that shit will change if you just keep voting liberal. News flash: it ain&#39;t changing if you keep electing the same people, from the same groups, over and over. Bernie is no lord and savior, he&#39;s the same old shit in a new set of clothes (socialism!).</p>

<p>So what, everyone else in the world isn&#39;t a real man because they have a better, government run healthcare system? America is the last bastion of masculinity or something? </p>

<p>Too much pride will kill you. National healthcare, like the systems in Canada, Japan, Europe, or here in the UK have been proven without a doubt to be far more cost effective and deliver a far better quality of care than the privatised American system. I have no idea how Americans sleep at night knowing that despite being in the richest country in the world, they have to rely on a third world healthcare system each time they get sick,and the only reason why is because of hypocrites like you that will happily pay for a socialist pension, socialist law enforcement, socialist emergency services, but won&#39;t fit the bill for a socialist healthcare system. </p>

<p>Swallow your pride and selfishness for once, and think about the benefit of the superior system for your country as a whole instead of thinking only about the gold lining of your coat pockets. You&#39;re starting to reek of a corporate shill. </p>

<p>Go right on ahead. I&#39;m not stopping you. It&#39;s <em>your right</em> to defend your country economically. I&#39;m just saying that most of us don&#39;t do that shit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe if you didn&#39;t put corporations in charge of things that should be run by the government, they wouldn&#39;t be so easily corruptible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You say this as though the people we elect aren&#39;t in the pockets of the corporations. They are. Voting for a politician is voting for a corporation, several really, and there isn&#39;t much if anything we average American citizens can <em>do</em> about it short of revolution--and only a few of us really want that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s what Thatcher said about National Rail in the 80&#39;s. It hasn&#39;t exactly gone to plan. Corporations don&#39;t care about improving things, only profit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>True, as we&#39;ve seen with broadband in the US several times over. However, again, our politicians are out to fuck us.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What reason do people in Europe have to rise against their governments? We&#39;re nowhere near as fucked as the US has become.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because, despite the bullshit here with healthcare, Europe is actually closer to fucked than we are by taking in those &#39;fugees. Germany is one bad day away from hanging Merkel from a lamp post and returning to its roots.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Evidence around the world suggests otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And again, I reiterate, it&#39;s a matter of scale. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population">America has a ridiculously large population.</a> What works in small scale for you won&#39;t necessarily work for us, especially with all the people <em>already</em> on welfare and public assistance dragging it down.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Depends on why they&#39;re jumping off the bridge, doesn&#39;t it? You&#39;re no less of a fool for not doing something everyone else does, just because everyone is doing it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a bridge. Do not jump off it. This is common sense. I don&#39;t care if people say there&#39;s a portal leading straight to a lake of jello filled with naked, promiscuous women under it, odds are good they&#39;re <em>full of shit</em> and jumping off will get you killed.</p>
