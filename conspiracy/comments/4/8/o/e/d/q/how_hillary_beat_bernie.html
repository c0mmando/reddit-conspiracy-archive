       please don't go if that's you're reasoning -_- Unless you are a woman enjoying that you can be nude and frolic around, in which case, yes, nude, unbothered women. But you said naked so I assume you mean it in a sexual way.

       Granted, what those naked women do is fantastic, but it won't happen if you're perving 'em. Guys… meh… guys are utility but you'll see a looooooot of dongs. Lots of dongs. So many dongs.

       Too much pride will kill you. National healthcare, like the systems in Canada, Japan, Europe, or here in the UK have been proven without a doubt to be far more cost effective and deliver a far better quality of care than the privatised American system. I have no idea how Americans sleep at night knowing that despite being in the richest country in the world, they have to rely on a third world healthcare system each time they get sick,and the only reason why is because of hypocrites like you that will happily pay for a socialist pension, socialist law enforcement, socialist emergency services, but won't fit the bill for a socialist healthcare system.

       I'm not. I'm saying you're an idiot for equating masculinity with your anti-socialist beliefs. Go to Eastern Europe and see how long that kind of attitude will play out for you. Hell, they'll probably say that
       <em>
        you

       are a pathetic excuse of a man for relying so heavily on your employers.

       The problem is that the president can't actually do any of those things unless congress presents him with legislation. Which they won't. Bernie sanders was nothing more than the ron paul of this election cycle. A seemingly harmless old man spouting seemingly deep bits of wisdom in order to get voters motivated, so that they will go out and vote and give legitimacy to the system. Nothing he promised or said was viable or possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a casual glance at his record should demonstrate how legitimate he really is. He has accomplished nothing in his entire life. Not as a regular person or a congressman. He plays the political game lightly and keeps his head down. He makes bold speeches to empty rooms and has accomplished nothing.

       Seriously, what future?
Bernie won't get in,  not by popular vote. If in, his hands will be tied. 
Hillary stands a good chance. What will she do?  Nothing but perpetuate the current mess. She does not give a fuck about anyone but herself. 
The GOP candidates are pure puppets with their own religious agendas. No change. 
And you have The Frump, a self promoting prick who scares the  bejesus out of me.

       I can't vote, but perhaps people deserve what they get because of apathy. I also don't  see why politicians don't use referendum's, probably because it would take two years to organise one!

       They're literally keeping them offshore to avoid taxation.  And as long as it's offshore Sanders can't tax them.  I don't understand why people think Sanders can just break into other countries and steal money to pay off his own interestes.

       You would need to go to the UN to make it legal.  You need to change the laws in other countries to make it legal.  And the other countries won't go for it because they like having the money there.  Voting Sanders into the presidency won't change a damn thing.  You realize this entire premise is the theory behind trickle down economics?  Make taxes low enough that it's cheapest for the rich to live in the US.  It's better to have
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       money than
       <em>
        no
