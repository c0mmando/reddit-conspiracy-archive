       Imagine that somewhere in South Africa a group of individuals are being kidnapped or killed horribly. The U.N. has channels it must go through, procedural nonsense, a ceiling to which its powers are restricted.

       In order for a NWO to work, we'd need to rid the world of evil, corruption, and greed. Which is not possible. You'd also have to get rid of a few billion people. So, would you be first in line for the firing squad (I mean, you'd be sacrificing for the human species, no)? Because if you don't go, it's gotta be someone. Someone you may know/love/etc. If you answer no, then why should you be here instead of someone else? That right there proves, it'll never work.

       Advanced AI that is interwoven into government could help prevent or detect most corruption.  Reducing population could be obtained by controlling birth rates with birth control over time.  Every excuse that I've ever heard can be moderated with a little bit of technology if we so choose to use it.

       I believe, at the least, it's clear that a monumental lack of inter-agency communication took place--perhaps, even a decision to allow it to happen..for whatever reason. But, If we wanted to get into Iraq (as outlined by the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century">
        Project for a New American Century
       </a>
       ) it could've been done by easier means.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything further is still speculation, some of it being ridiculous. I do concede that something still isn't right, though. The inquiry took more than a year to get started, and spoke more of Middle Eastern policy than the actual event itself. The buildings certainly shouldn't have fell that way, or at all. I find issue with a lot of it. Something is amiss, but I think the actual truth is muddied by outlandish theories..and I've read them all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel something is seriously wrong there but stop short of believing that hundreds, if not thousands of people are involved in the act/coverup..compartmentalized or not.

       No idea, and I don't think anyone outside of the actual participating actors can assert otherwise. Convenient passports everywhere..some are still making phone calls after the fact..are they Saudi or not...were the planes really drones?

       ok, thank you. no offense intended: if that's where your knowledge level is, then you have no capacity to assess whether a 'one world government' is a good idea or not. you're simply uninformed and, frankly, naive.
      </p>

       research more, figure out 9/11, consider the implications, then reconsider your 'one world government' position.

       That would be a terrible idea, partly because it's already happening but in a very wrong way. The New World Order is exactly that, and while not being mentioned a lot by corporate media, is simply relocating its assets around territory (the entire world except major economies like and probably only China to an extent) in a non-official way. It's using controlled and predicted entropy to hide itself from our eyes.

       I believe we need to think bigger in order to advance as a species. The world is in peril, on many levels. The U.N. and Interpol can only do so much. Broadly speaking, I think it should be a natural progression to eliminate archaic borders and conduct our collective lives in more inclusive ways.

       I'm not speaking towards nefarious theories. I'm referring to the outright deletion of proper borders. If we look around, people tend to group together based on race/beliefs, so unofficial ones will inevitably take their place anyways. However, dissolving actual borders I believe would be to the betterment of mankind.

       Most people, if not all the people I know of who have held elected office, including myself, have a long personal history of community service starting at the local level with local charities and local organisations, in to the municipal govt level, and then the provincial or state levels before going on to the federal level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those of us who have been involved in even a small part of that process have a much clearer understanding of what exactly these various organisations and levels of govt actually do in the real world.
      </p>
      <p>
       So for what you are supporting, and presuming to educate us about your thoughts and beliefs, world government, you have no actual real world inkling of what it actually means. For you it is merely an exercise in theory. Your personal theory based on very little to no practical knowledge.

       The term "in order to advance as a species" means absolutely nothing within the context of world government or world politics.

       His qualifications would go a long way towards adding some semblance of credibility to this persons post. I find him and his post to be utterly arrogant. That kind of arrogance needs some backing up. My questions stand.

       And I said nothing about "third world subhumans". Do not put words in my mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is that most of the governments of the worlds various countries are not even close to being able to manage their own affairs anywhere near our basic standards for democratic processes and human rights. So, no, I am not interested in dealing with a world govt where the majority of the votes will go to corrupt third world fools and megalomaniacs. Just look at the unmitigated mess of the United Nations. If is a COMPLETE failure in every single way possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we have a world govt, they'd better have standards at least equivalent to the western word. And I would hope that the western world would lift their standards up a whole hell of a lot more in the process. Even the best of the western worlds systems of govts needs a lot of improvement.

       We do not need more govt, we need less.

       Western world which is so much better in your groundless opinion is only living a better life because of a history of occupation, slavery, and theft. And they still keep their puppet regimes in the third world countries you so hate.

       As for the "west is superior" argument, just remember how much debt US is in to private individuals, and that the federal reserve is not federal or a reserve. How is that different from puppet regimes, I don't really know.

       The history is meaningless in this discussion. The current and future state is very relevant.

       I never said the "west is superior". You numbskulls need to learn reading comprehension.

       I said that our democratic institutions and our basic human rights are functioning at a higher standard while most third world countries basic institutions either barely function or don't function at all.

       And don't try to tell me that that is not correct, because you know it is. You as much as admit it with your ramblings about puppet regimes.

       if you admit they are corrupt rulers then you also admit that western empires took a lot of their resources, and the corruption is something still happening today because of direct American/UN  control over these countries' affairs. So no, history is not meaningless.

       Where it concerns scale, of course. But, the ratio between citizen and representative official would be even larger. I'm not sure what everyone is afraid of. Short of Artificial Intelligence going mad, it's just a more inclusive more streamlined way of operating our planet.

       So everyone must conform to the laws of this NWO whether or not it benefits their specific region/population? Localized interests still need to be considered, so the citizen-representative ratio wouldn't be getting any smaller.

       Scaled up, it wouldn't be much different than what First-world countries already have in place. Just bigger, and encompassing more people. All people. Iran invading Israel would be about as ridiculous as Michigan invading Arkansas.

       I'm in no way trying to project some sort of utopia. Patriotism is swell, but I think some ideals won't carry well into our technological futures. The borders and archaic conflicts are holding us back.
