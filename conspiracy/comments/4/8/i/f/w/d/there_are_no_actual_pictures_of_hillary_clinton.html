       I remember during Bill Clinton's presidency a couple of photos popped up, but they were quickly swept under the rug with aggressive copyright action. Refusing to give up "unflattering" Hillary photos was supposedly part of what got Spy magazine shut down.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know there was at least one book published that had compromising (well, suggestive) photos of Hillary and Vince Foster as well as pregnancy photos of Hillary. The book argued that Vince Foster was Chelsea's real father. I don't know if the photos were genuine. I hope that helps you track down the book.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to keep in mind, back in those days the Internet wasn't really something that was commonly used. Rare photos stayed rare unless they got circulated. They didn't sit on a web site waiting to go viral at a moment's notice.

       There hasn't been much demand. The airbrushed Spy magazine cover featuring Hillary dressed as a dominatrix in leather was about as much as anyone has wanted to see of her. Take a look at what a hairy troll she was in the old Watergate era photos that have circulated and I think you'll understand why interest in her baby bump is so rare. I doubt she was even photographed that much before Bill was elected Governor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now and then a conspiracy theorist crops up trying to prove Hillary is not Chelsea's real mother, but they never seem to get much traction. There's simply no credible reason to fake the pregnancy. Unlike Obama's "Wife" we know Hillary is an actual female, so there's no sex change being covered up with fake kids. If Chelsea were adopted by Hillary then that would have made just as good a human interest angle as a biological child. The only real meat to Chelsea conspiracies are her biological father's identity. There's simply not enough that's been leaked / uncovered to prove one way or another who that is. Bill Clinton is as likely a candidate as anyone else.

       You are absolutely right but it just seems so odd, keep in mind, I'm not someone who subscribes to any conspiracy about the legitimacy of her motherhood. I just felt maybe r/conspiracy would have an answer as to why google couldn't gimme any pics of her ugly ass when she was pregs.

       Idk but bill had the measles as a kid which usually sterilizes men and its just fucking odd that she has no preggo pics out there. At all. Although Chelsea does look like her. Idk man, her whole life is shrouded weird shit. People dying, disappearing, committing "suicide".

       She's part of the secret Luciferian and/or Satanic subculture that has pretty much infiltrated and infected EVERYTHING.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you know Ken Starr was hanging out with and later legally defended Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted child molester, and helped cover up the network he ran with (including Bill Clinton), the general scam of how much evil has got us all fooled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both she and Bill are into some deeply evil shit. I didn't believe it when he was president, but I sure believe it now. America is ruled by psychopaths and sociopaths and criminals and the Satanically evil. It's terrifying if you're not a Christian, frankly, and even then pretty disturbing.

       Sorry about that pal, didnt mean to offend ya. Im wrong about the measles bit. Mumps is what can cause sterility. Why would me wanting me to see a pic of Hillary pregs bother you more than there be no pics of Hillary pregs?

       Mumps can cause sterility, but that's very uncommon.  Most of my parents' generation had mumps, including three of my uncles who are fathers.

       You make it sound like mumps causing sterility is pretty common.  You started out with the idea that Bill Clinton had some virus (you thought measles at first), and drew the conclusion that, therefore, he is likely to be infertile.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I am saying is that even though mumps can cause sterility, it's so very uncommon that it doesn't make sense for you to use mumps as an explanation for your original comment as to why Bill Clinton might be sterile.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, no, I am no restating things you said.  Meanwhile, why is your line of commentary driving like a stolen car?

       How many pregnancy photos can you find online of random obscure Southern Democrat lawyers from the 1970's? How many photos of Hillary Clinton are out there from that period of her life, pregnant or not? Just because she would go on to become famous is no reason for those photos to have been circulated. There were no paparazzi following her. She was a nobody, a random lawyer who'd been fired from a short stint job in DC for routine incompetence. It's unlikely anyone but Bill would have even wanted to TAKE the pictures.
      </p>
      <p>
       If such photos exist they're probably in a photo album in one of the Clinton estates. I'm not even sure the ones that circulated during the Clinton presidency were genuine.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a lot of questions and mysteries about the Clintons. The lack if pregnancy photos of Hillary Clinton is not one of them.

       Who said anything about a conspiracy? Two or three of you keep giving snide negative comments about some conspiracy you claim ive mentioned.

       I'm sorry if I come off as pretentious. As a pastor I'm accustomed to people who want answers and then ask follow-up questions being people who are seeking answers.

       Education? Wtf are talking about? You answered my post with a snide, dismissive response, and ended with a quip about how there are so many clinton conspiracies to choose from, that basically im dumb for asking about a picture you felt shouldn't be on the web anyway. And you're still being dismissively snide. Again, from the beginning you could have just said you didnt know or better yet, not respond at all. But no, because you're a belieber in jeebus, im supposed to heed your simple minded, after thought of a response as gold? Go ahead, tell me more about your fucking lifes mission on reddit in a conspiracy sub.
