<p>&quot;The Commission was initially given a budget of only $3 million, and after months of deliberating, they were given an additional $12 million .</p>

<p>Columbia Investigation: $50 million</p>

<p>Challenger Investigation: $75 million

<p>However the links to TubeChop didn&#39;t work for me, the video doesn&#39;t play. Other than that this is excellently summarized and to the the point, and most importantly it comes off as rational. </p>

<p>A few minor points:  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The 9/11 commission co-chairs wrote an editorial in the <em>NYT</em> stating their work was obstructed: <a href="http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/">http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/</a></p></li>
<li><p>The 9/11 commission was the 2nd investigation...the &quot;Joint Inquiry&quot; was the first and limited to the field of &quot;intelligence&quot;.  The 9/11 commission took many of its staff from the Joint Inquiry--which means the JI actually paved the direction of the 9/11 Commission.  Zelikow even wrote an outline within the first 30 days of the Commission being formed.</p></li>
<li><p>The 9/11 Commission office in DC was located in a building managed by the CIA  <a href="https://redd.it/206si3">https://redd.it/206si3</a></p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>This is wonderfully well put -- a brilliant website. I would like to capture one paragraph, which crystallizes the argument perfectly. Go onto the website yourself and explore more fully -- a few of you will be angry, but that&#39;s the prelude to taking serious action. It&#39;s time to lay your cards on the table.</p>

<p>&quot;I had seen a few conspiracy videos on YouTube in the past, but nothing ever clicked for me. I always felt “truthers” were being disrespectful to the victims’ families. I didn’t like the dramatic music/effects of the videos, the followers didn’t appear to be intelligent, and the whole “movement” had a cheap/tacky feel; as if they were trying to sell me something or wanted attention. But this time I tried not to let my past judgements get in the way of the information. I considered all the warnings, lies, cover-ups, physical impossibilities, endless coincidences, families’ struggles to find answers, and the ultimate motive of 9/11, all of which I will highlight in this document. Once I saw the big picture, it was blatantly obvious what they had done. I was freaked out, angry, and wanted to know more. For over two years I continued to learn about the true history of our country and the people who control it. I realized that 9/11 was only the tip of a massive, global conspiracy that has been around for over a century, and all of it was connected to the systemic problems we face today. I personally believe that people must come to face this truth if we are to have any hope of solving the issues we claim to care about. That is why I’ve put this together. &quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s unfortunately too late to expose the crime, the damage has been done. Moving forward we need to confront the roots of what made 9/11 and its aftermath possible. Criminality on this level cannot exist without our consent, and that inherently makes all of us responsible for the suffering of others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well done. It&#39;s crazy to think that this even needs to be done for people who are so hypnotized by the TV. It doesn&#39;t matter what bullshit(insert manipulative mainstream media) tells you, common sense and logic should at the very least give you cause to be skeptical. </p>

<p>NORAD didn&#39;t intercept the planes? REALLLYYY? The United States Government, fresh off 50 year cold war in which they stockpiled insane means of radar and preemptive measures to thwart this very kind of attack just so happened to have an off day?</p>

<p>All the cameras surveilling the Pentagon happened to be turned off?</p>

<p>WTC7 falls and BBC reports it before it actually happens? </p>

<p>You really, really have to almost go out of your way, to not see some tiny shred of evidence pointing to the possibility that the governments explanation for 9/11 was a straight up lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry if this has been addressed a million times or if I&#39;m completely off-base but I have a question.. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen a lot of theories surrounding 9/11 and I do recognize how insane it is that they blamed the collapse basically on heat, it looks like a professionally planned demolition, but why blame the government as opposed to well planned terrorists? Explosives don&#39;t have be huge or obvious to be effective? They could have been planted well before the planes hit no? The planes could have set off a reaction as opposed to causing the collapse? I understand the potential money and political gain aspect but still...</p>

<p>I promise I&#39;m not trying to argue or anything but I am honestly just curious as to why situational evidence against government seems to be more believable than terrorists understanding structural damage and going for maximum shock value with the planes instead of just blowing up the buildings?</p>

<p>Edit: I meant circumstantial not situational (I guess they pretty much mean the same thing though so it&#39;s ok) I&#39;m sorry it&#39;s late lol </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely suggest you read the document, I think it&#39;ll answer many of your questions. </p>

<p>Once you do, you will see that it&#39;s not just a random accusation: &quot;the government did it&quot;. The evidence all exemplifies direct  planning, complicity, and cover-up by factions of the government (these are not necessarily public officials). You will also see that this is nothing new for governments (not just U.S.). A shocking amount of terrorism throughout history has been state sponsored when you really study it (at least to the degree to which this document studied 9/11). Then you will see the bigger picture. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The public just won&#39;t grasp that people will do anything for two things: money and power. Clearly, 9/11 wasn&#39;t by any means ethical/humane, but if you were being offered mass amounts of money and power to cover this up, wouldn&#39;t you consider it? Plus, you have to understand no one is going to let this out. Why? Because who the hell would believe the President of The United States is planning to kill thousands. </p>

<p>Like I said people do unthinkable things for power and money. For example, Julius Ceasar was killed by some of his closest men, and a large part of why they did it was because they wanted to be on top. It is happened before, they just didn&#39;t cover it up.</p>

<p>That hasn&#39;t been the question for several years. The real question is when are we going to do something about it?</p>

<p>This time will we elect Mr Make America Great Again just to have him turn into Mr Business As usual?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say that the debunking claims are pretty strong. The full video is pretty damning for using WTC 7 as your &quot;smoking gun&quot;. Maybe you have something with a couple points, maybe you don&#39;t. Forgive me if I fail to take your word as gospel, but most of this will require a lot of research to corroborate. For example, several of the videos of Bush&#39;s slip ups are less than a minute long. I need context, and I need hard facts, not a reporter speculating. You say not to trust the media, and then you include clips from the media as proof. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an impressive write-up, but many of your conclusions are emotional appeals with little evidence. The one that sticks out, to me, is your point about the government killing it&#39;s civilians. All you say is that our government isn&#39;t what we think, that it&#39;s been subverted, and then provide no evidence. I&#39;m sorry man, but I&#39;ve worked in the government, and I don&#39;t see it. Some of your points are solid arguments for reopening the investigation, and actually funding it this time, especially the evidence of insider trading. That is interesting, and I didn&#39;t know of it. </p>

<p>I am very happy that you did not talk about jet fuel not being able to melt steel. That has been debunked thoroughly, and I applaud you for not including it. </p>
