We&#39;re all aware of the discrepancies in Kansas that the state is doing its best to shut down discussion and investigation over. I have heard from people on the ground in Texas of votes vanishing, being changed, and otherwise altered.</p>

<p>People have proven, again and again, that electronic voting machines are easily hacked. Some states have done away with them. </p>

<p>I just would think we&#39;d see more about this here. The country is literally under assault daily. Computerized voter fraud is one of many issues not being treated with the importance and study it deserves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That sounds more like bureaucratic bullshit getting in the way of an efficient system making sure people are eligible to vote or not.</p>

<p>Unless the people who set the system up made sure a loophole such as this exists so they can indeed use non-us citizens as voters, then that would suggest election fraud through voter fraud and instead of saying both I think because of the potential scale &quot;election fraud&quot; still fits as an accurate identifier for the fraud being committed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t get me wrong. I believe that election fraud if vastly more common [and more effective] than voter fraud. But I don&#39;t deny that voter fraud exists, too.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a big follower of a website called <a href="http://www.blackboxvoting.org">www.blackboxvoting.org</a> that tracks this stuff.</p>

<p>The reality is: The biggest threat to our democracy is electronic voting machines put up by companies that have financial ties to the candidates. Like when Marco Rubio vastly overperformed in the Iowa caucuses (getting anomolously high vote-totals inconsistent with all polling and exit-polling) and Microsoft [his second-largest contributor] was counting the votes. Whether Microsoft monkeyed with the algorithm or not, it&#39;s the appearance of impropriety that should have been avoided.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like having two boxers and seeing that the referee is the father of one of the fighters. That would NEVER be allowed. But, increasingly, in politics such conflicts of interest are being normalized--and we&#39;re being encouraged to passively accept it.</p>

<p>In Texas, people filmed their votes for Trump being flipped to Rubio. And it wasn&#39;t an isolated incident. There were literally hundreds of people documenting the same &quot;glitch&quot;.</p>

<p>There&#39;s mounting evidence that Hillary Clinton was the recipient of these &quot;glitches&quot; too.</p>

<p>The reality stands: Fraud does in fact exist. Which is precisely why the United Nations has observers who go out to countries to make sure that the exit poll totals somewhat match the vote-totals. When they don&#39;t match, that&#39;s a massive red flag.</p>

<p>We have this noble lie in America that fraud happens everywhere else--but not here. And it&#39;s a myth that the media perpetuates. So long as they don&#39;t hold people accountable, the fraud will continue--undeterred.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah, i&#39;m originally from new bedford. there&#39;s tons of video and photos on their local page where you can CLEARLY see that the polling place was obscured by the CROWD, but not clinton himself.</p>

<p>i personally know that makes zero difference, but the dumb fucks who came en masse to see a celebrity who most likely didn&#39;t even vote (new bedford&#39;s turnout was TWENTY NINE PERCENT, yeesh) blocked the entrance for nearly an hour. you literally could not push through the crowd to get there, nor could you find a place to park for over a mile away, as they did it in the most congested place in the city (public park with limited parking as it is), and in one of the most popular polling places in the city.</p>

<p>if you go to &#39;new bedford guide&#39; on facebook, you can see how much of a fuckshow this was, and how completely and totally illegal it was. not that anyone&#39;s gonna do a god damn thing about it.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t the state, it is the party workers.  When the general election rolls around it is also run by party workers (even if they are technically elected, who would want that job but a party person).</p>

<p>Touchscreens are a big no, no, unless they have a receipt printer that the voter can verify against. And any &quot;scan-tron&quot; type machines should take photographs of every ballot for scrutiny by the public. Storage and distribution of these photos might have been a problem in 1980, but it isn&#39;t anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wrote my local state representative about electronic voting machine hacking. This is the response I received back.</p>

<p>“A successful attack of the sort described in the YouTube video linked below would be very highly unlikely if not impossible on the State’s voting system.  As a matter of note, Mr. Curtis’s testimony occurred more than ten years ago and is well-known in the election community.</p>

<p>First, the voting system is tested and certified on the federal, state and local level.  On the federal level, the source code is examined to ensure it works correctly.  On the state level, the system is tested to ensure it counts votes properly and serves all our states election needs according to state law.  On the local level, logic and accuracy tests are conducted prior to each election during which a predetermined combination of votes are cast on numerous ballots and the results are checked to ensure the system is tabulating votes properly.  The system has always passed those tests.</p>

<p>After every election, the SEC conducts a statewide audit of all voting machines that verifies that the votes cast on each machine are counted accurately.  This audit examines the detailed audit data from every voting machine in the state and from the tabulating computer in each county and compares that data to reported results.</p>

<p>Even more relevant to the constituent’s concerns is the fact that no part of the voting system (machine, tabulating computer, etc.) is ever connected to the internet.  Nor does any component have any wireless communication capabilities.</p>

<p>I hope you find this information helpful in addressing your constituent’s concerns.”</p>

<p>Hooooooly crap, is that blatant. Apparently, he&#39;s gotten a &quot;warning.&quot; A warning? That&#39;s <em>it</em>? It should have been stopped at the time and the Mayor involved should be censured and recalled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah, i&#39;m originally from new bedford. there&#39;s tons of video and photos on their local page where you can CLEARLY see that the polling place was obscured by the CROWD, but not clinton himself.</p>

<p>i personally know that makes zero difference, but the dumb fucks who came en masse to see a celebrity who most likely didn&#39;t even vote (new bedford&#39;s turnout was TWENTY NINE PERCENT, yeesh) blocked the entrance for nearly an hour. you literally could not push through the crowd to get there, nor could you find a place to park for over a mile away, as they did it in the most congested place in the city (public park with limited parking as it is), and in one of the most popular polling places in the city.</p>

<p>if you go to &#39;new bedford guide&#39; on facebook, you can see how much of a fuckshow this was, and how completely and totally illegal it was. not that anyone&#39;s gonna do a god damn thing about it.</p>
