       I'd never heard of this until I noticed someone included it in their top 10 most intelligent shows.
      </p>
      <p>

       It was cancelled due to 'low viewership', despite AMC being very proud of it and it generally being received very well.  Its conspiratorial, secret society theme was
       <a href="https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2010/12/rubi-d02.html">
        'too close to home'
       </a>
       , and that's why it's not on Netflix, Hulu or Amazon, nor are there plans to release it on DVD.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that it's not even to be released on DVD means it needs a look.  I imagine it's still on bittorrent and usenet.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       EDIT: so I've been watching rubicon and I get why they are suppressing it.  Here's a short list so far, and I'm halfway through the season.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Show is about a 'fictional' intelligence consultancy called API or American Policy Institute which employs analysts who interpret data from the various alphabet agencies for meaning and actionability.  I guess they don't want people to know that our intelligence is not intelligent enough to do intelligence that they have to hire people.
       </li>
       <li>
        FBI raids API offices because of an alleged leak.  The employees are held there and each given a polygraph test.  One of the main characters is asked if he ever cheated on his wife.  The tester said, "it's important that you're honest about any
        <strong>
         <em>
          potential vulnerabilities..anything that can be leveraged against you in exchange for information"
         </em>
        </strong>
        Mr. Test asserts he hasn't cheated on his wife "it's telling you I'm lying.  But I never cheated on my wife.  Write that down please".  To which the tester said, "
        <em>
         Maybe you haven't cheated on her but in my opinion you will. In your mind you already have.
        </em>
        " --  "I love my wife." -- "Let's move on.  Are you a member of any terrorist organizations."
       </li>
       <li>
        OK towards the end of the season, Will discovers that the there are people receiving the analysis and direction from API who are profiting from world military events, disaster, etc; and even says he believes they are engineering those events.
        <strong>
         There you have it: Rubicon was saying what we say here all the time, that the global spook networks are false flagging and profiting
        </strong>
        This is why Rubicon was not only canceled but pulled from the shelves.
       </li>

       relevant : Brilliant but troubled code-cracker Will Travers ( James Badge Dale ) works as an analyst at a federal agency in New York City. Unstable since losing his wife and daughter in the 9/11 attacks, he considers quitting until his father-in-law and mentor dies in a train accident that Travers suspects wasn't an accident at all.

       probably woulda gotten into 9/11 only not in the way that "they' want.

       Serenity and Firefly were epic.  I really liked Joss' Dollhouse a lot also--thought it was an excellent concept; but talk about being close to home (the concept of monarch sex robots / superspies....through the contrivance of scifi brain reformatting)  It's why it didn't survive, though Whedon would never say so.
