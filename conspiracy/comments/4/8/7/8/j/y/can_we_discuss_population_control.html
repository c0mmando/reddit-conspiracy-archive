       It took our species millions of years to reach one billion people just over a century ago. In my lifetime alone, we have increased from 6 to 7.5 billion. I think everyone would agree that this exponential growth is unsustainable and possibly our greatest threat as a species, much more than climate change in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       We rarely hear it discussed in the media, or in public for that matter. I often read conspiracies involving people worried that one thing or another is population control, and everyone seems to hate the idea of it. Of course the leaders we have in power are the last ones I would trust to be in charge of deciding who gets to have children, but what is the correct answer here? How will this be implemented in the future?

       Yup. Although, I think overpopulation is the disinfo. Agenda 21 is real and what those sick fuckers want. All a part of the plan. Those two things work hand in hand, along with man made climate change (imo).

       It's not about density it's about resource consumption rate and the infrastructural incapacity to sustain it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like if you're playing original worldcraft RTS game and you've built out your city but need to build an army fast and you don't have enough orcs doing the mining or chopping the trees so you're stunted.  You can sustain your economy but building it rapidly is a no go.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the situation we'll be in, if suddenly China, India and Africa want to have nice first world power consumption tomorrow.

       I have never heard of this. A UN plan to encourage sustainability? I just skimmed the Wikipedia article:
Section I: Social and Economic Dimensionsis directed toward combating poverty, especially in developing countries, changing consumption patterns, promoting health, achieving a more sustainable population, and sustainable settlement in decision making
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder how they suggest a country achieve a sustainable population.

       OP, there is no "overpopulation". Almost 50% of global population lives in 2 countries and consume around 35% of global resource production
      </p>
      <p>
       We have a post-harvest loss of around 20%, going up to 30-40% in developing countries.

       Earth can hold about 10 maybe even 12 billion people with current situation BUT if you add free energy, secret tech, common sense and any other good quality that a human being can have and create then Earth can hold more then 20 billion people with good balance with nature itself... and by then even come up with some pretty creative ways for more "space".

       Do you have a source for the growth rate being exponential? It was roughly exponential in the middle of the 20th century, maybe 1920-1980, but since then, the growth rate as decreased, maybe even stagnated. That doesn't meaning global population isn't still growing, but that the growth rate is not increasing, a key characteristic of exponential growth.

       Yes, let's talk about population control, but let's talk about it honestly, for a change.
      </p>
      <p>
       The populations of white, Western nations are stable or falling. They are not increasing. Whites are not contributing to the human overpopulation problem in any way, shape or form. It is not our problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       The overpopulation problem is a problem of blacks, Asians, and Hispanics. They are the ones you need to criticize if you are angry about overpopulation. They are the ones who need to be addressed if you want the problem fixed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you are so concerned, go tell blacks to have fewer babies. Tell Asians that they must have smaller families. Let me know how you make out.

       Your wrong about the Asians actually. Their birthrates are falling too. In Japan for example it's actually a growing crisis. The difference is basically first world vs third world. The third world has high birthrates, and the first does not. Probably due to a number of things. Feminism in the 1st world, social security, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah it always annoys me how people concerned with population control suggest stuff like young White couples adopt an African child instead of have one of their own. That's genocide. You don't fix the problem that way. You fix it by promoting birth control in Africa in exchange for some better infrastructure or something.

       The pill started the sexual revolution and saw a decrease in the fertility rate of western nations. It also saw a sky rocket in divorce rates and the decline of nuclear families. Abortion has also contributed to this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of addressing the source of the problem and encouraging more people to have babies, governments are taking in more and more migrants to treat the symptoms of the problem.

       Don't try to mislead people. The entire population of all of the Americas is only 800 million, 320 million of which is in one country that you don't consider overpopulated. Hispanics are 450 million spread out across one and a half entire continents.

       Can't edit on mobile but I also suggest you look at the birth rates of South American countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if you don't consider them "western" you're going to be in for a rough time when South America continues on the path to becoming developed and ends up inevitably forging close ties with Europe. Italy and Chile have way more in common culturally than Italy and the US do.

       Yes, exponential population growth is unsustainable. However, capitalism relies on perpetual economic growth, which is really the result of population growth. Consequently, the wealthy are more than willing to let us overpopulate in order to get wealthier.

       That model is kind of breaking down though. Since it relies on consumption to generate profit. But people can't consume because wages are too low, and jobs too few. With the numbers of jobs only to get fewer in the years ahead thanks to automation.

       You got this sort of figured out, but kinda confused.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are totally correct that our exponential growth is the greatest threat to us as a species.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you miss is that we already killed ourselves, by creating climate change that is now beyond unstoppable.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, population control is a done deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, the interesting part relates to the media, the government, and so on.  Well, consider this: the catastrophic climate change model requires that the oceans absorb heat from the climate, and become warmer.
      </p>
      <p>
       NASA has released observations claiming that the oceans are warming, based on surface temperatures mostly.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the US Navy, and all the other world navies, go to great lengths to measure the temperature of the ocean in volumetric models, using sonar refraction to make a 3-D map of the warm and cool bodies of water within the ocean.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the US Navy knows a yes-or-no answer as to whether we have destroyed the climate.  And they haven't said anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, meanwhile, there are all sort of pieces of information indicating that the elite are either trying to get off the planet, or otherwise preparing for a major disaster.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I think you have your answer in what's going on around you.  Population control is happening right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       The elite aren't planning to save everybody, only themselves.

       Well, even in worst case scenario models of climate change, I don't think we become extinct. Something like 10 feet of sea level rise per century if I recall? That would sure put a dent in the population. Catastrophic for sure. Would likely make our breeding problem even worse with less land to populate though.
