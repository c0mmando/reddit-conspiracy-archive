       What is the point of working, being miserable, working hard everyday, coming home, sleeping then repeating the whole entire thing like a slave?

      <p>
       What is the point of life? What are we really meant to do with our life? Why were we born? What is the meaning of existence? How can we go through this everyday without knowing the true nature of our existence? PLEASE TELL ME.

       No one has the answers. If they say they do, they are lying. We are here, we are meant to be self aware. Whether you choose to be, is up to you. That is the point (imo). It's a ride. Your ride, so what are you going to do? I chose some ~10 years ago. My reality, is different than yours, trust me. Choose. It's your ride.

       If the meaning of life is to continue to live, then it negates and excludes the meaning of the purpose of its creation.

       You're pretty snooty for not having your own ideas about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did answer it. It's meaning is its point - to perpetuate itself.  And if that still doesn't satisfy you, try Tom Robbins' quote on "the meaning of life". It works fine for me barring any proof of the existence of anything else.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Our purpose is to consciously, deliberately evolve toward a wiser more liberated and luminous state of being;  to return to Eden, make friends with the snake and set up our computers among the wild apple trees.
       </p>
       <p>
        Deep down, all of us are probably aware that some kind of mystical evolution is our true task. Yet we suppress the notion with considerable force because to admit it is to admit that most of our political gyrations, religious dogmas, social ambitions and financial ploys are not merely counterproductive but
 trivial. Our mission is to jettison those pointless preoccupations and take on once again the primordial cargo of inexhaustible ecstasy. Or, barring that,  to turn out a good juicy cheeseburger and a strong glass of beer."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Or try Dexter Gordon's answer;
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       Or simply self-actualization.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a whole, we don't look or act very evolved at all. Right now the only proof we have of an assignable purpose for ourselves is that we're a disruptive force in nature.  And because the underlying mission is to perpetuate we'll continue on that vector until we actually start trending towards not perpetuating.

       From your last line, why don't you say the meaning is the complete opposite, to not perpetuate?

       The meaning remains the same.  To perpetuate. It's mindless in that sense, much like a virus or any biological entity.  The point being we may stop perpetuating because we literally would not be physically/biologically able to - having destroyed the environment to the point where it won't support it.

       To live well. To learn, research, understand. To socialize and be a part of a real community. To build positive relationships. To do what you want to with your life and work on what you really want to, what you are passionate about. To do what is right and make a positive impact on the well-being of others. To help others both physically and with their knowledge and understanding, without coercion.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are people that say there is no meaning, the only reason we exist is because of big bang/chemical reactions/evolution/etc. Or say that we are just here to pass on our genes. Or nothing really matters.... I understand these points-of-view and have struggled with them a bit in the past. However, even assuming that current science is spot on and we are just here because the circumstances were just right, that doesn't mean that we, humans as a species, and we, individuals, cannot have meaning. And it's not just to pass on genes, we can all affect the world even without having kids. I am agnostic, so I am not going to tell you that god has some special plan for us or that life is just a test by god or something like that. I don't think that someone else gives us our meaning, I think we have to find it for ourselves thru learning and understanding. We all have our own individual meanings, which contribute to what I think is the general meaning of human consciousness: to advance philosophy, science and human understanding as far as possible, to value and protect consciousness and its well-being and to create a society that encourages and supports these things.
      </p>
      <p>
       I cannot tell you the meaning of YOUR life. Or what you are supposed to do. I do think the above are good guidelines. I must also say that even when you find your meaning and what you want to do, it probably won't be easy (to say the least). We haven't yet created a society that encourages us to find meaning or do the right thing. We are still in a society where we must make money and that can be a hindrance. But, obstacles can make getting to the goal so much better.

       Instead he just kept asking "But why X, buy why Y" like a child. When I suggested a perfectly viable path of self discovery, OP met me with hostility and dismissal, indicating that he has no real desire to find answers and is just here to troll.

       Most people find meaning in (a) raising a family (b) working for a community (c) finding work that stimulates them. So, the ingredients are (a) finding your people (b) finding your mission within your group and (c) finding the type of work that engages you. Not rocket science. Humans aren't that complicated.

        Why would you be created by a creator
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There's your first failure. You're assuming you were created. By a creator. With a grand plan or scheme. Man dreamed up God because man needed purpose. "I must have some purpose, I must be
       <em>
        special
       </em>
       , because otherwise it would just be too sad if this existed by random chance." When you start from a flawed assumption you get flawed results.
      </p>
      <p>
       Start here, with a few basic assumptions:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         There is no creator.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There is no plan.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You are not special.

        There's your first failure. You're assuming you were created. By a creator. With a grand plan or scheme. Man dreamed up God because man needed purpose. "I must have some purpose, I must be special, because otherwise it would just be too sad if this existed by random chance." When you start from a flawed assumption you get flawed results.
Start here, with a few basic assumptions:
There is no creator.
There is no plan.
You are not special.
You are a product of random chance.
When you die, you cease to exist.
Make your own purpose to life. Enjoy life, every single second of it. Because when it's over, that's it. There is nothing else.
It is a horrible, nightmarish truth to swallow--but truth it is, as much as I wish it weren't. There is no justice, no fairness, no plan to reality but what we make for ourselves.

       A wise man once told me that the meaning of life was to simply give life meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
       This surly doesn't provide you with an answer, but a starting point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something humbling that I always refer back to when I feel the sense of pointlessness in our day-to-day life is Pale Blue Dot by Carl Sagen. in the grand scheme of things your life may be pointless, but on a small scale everything you do makes an impact.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you have no meaning for your life, and are making no impact on the world, this is something you must personally confront and overcome. I suggest meditation.

       I think there's an objective meaning to existence that is out there if one seeks it enough. Why else would we be created?

       This subjective answer of giving meaning to one's own life is sad because it gives you the comfort without knowing the true answer.

       To spread the gospel; Jesus is the answer. Not religion, a relationship. Seek him, read the Bible(basically the instruction manual), meditate on that. And spend time meditating/praying/talking with him. Regardless of all the preconceived ideas about Religion, or what people say..If I didn't have a relationship with Him, I'd have no hope.

       I would label myself a christian. But, christianity, islam, buddhism, etc. are religions, and religion is so outwardly based &amp; a 'checkbox' type of living(you do this/that/etc. then you'll make it to heaven/afterlife) and that's not what it's about. It's a relationship, it's about knowing Jesus, knowing his promises, and striving to be like him. So, Jesus, to me, is the reason I'm alive. Jesus/God created everyone of us with a purpose in mind. He also created us with freewill, because he wants us to willingly choose to live our life for him, to truely love him &amp; the people of this world. It's 100% a choice and is not to be shoved down your throat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus is the only answer, man. It's better than any other thing the world has got offer, nothing has brought me the peace, hope, and joy that my god has, ya know.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think I have a scientifically correct answer for you. Believing in Jesus requires a huge amount of faith &amp; trust in him, I know that.

       Dude the government has enslaved the people man. No doubt about it . Any alternative lifestyle that doesn't include working 9-5, shitting out kids, paying taxes, and watching tv is considered insane. But, it's our own fault as a collective. We allowed this to happen. And you have a choice just like everyone else. There's a whole other world outside of the U.S, maybe you should go explore it.

       I considered myself more spiritual. You do a lot of soul searching when your back to living a minimalistic lifestyle. So obviously I did a  lot of reading, meditating, writing. You figure out a lot about yourself that way. Just being away from home, outside of your comfort zone will do that. From there I moved to Los Angeles, which was huge change obviously, for work. But I'm not going to stay for too long.
You're obviously in an existential period of your life, which is fine, everyone goes through that. Get out, do some soul searching and you'll ascertain your own answers.

       I would've been afraid at one point in my life, but I was in the midst of a spiritual awakening of sorts and I had complete faith that the universe would provide. Not to mention I knew full well that life is a transient experience and I didn't want to die without taking a chance and seeing the world. There's too much to do and see to be stuck at a job for 50 years and retire [which is what you're conditioned to do] And that's exactly what the system has done to people, it has made them afraid to take a chance, it has made them afraid to live any other way.

       I think I have the answer, but not the solution: the point of life is to figure out why we are here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the point of life is to understand our existence, where we came from, who we are, and why we're here. As a child, you might expect that we would know these things, but as you mature, you realize that the human race doesn't know jack shit. We are just a bunch of primates with science walking around, looking at our feet, unaware of what the fuck is going on in this Universe. For christ sake, we don't even understand our own bodies. Isn't it interesting that we're all flying around the Universe (the Sun is moving, and so is the Milky Way) on this rock? Why are we on
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       rock? What is special about it, and about us?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're a scientist at heart like me, then you probably searched for god, and didn't find her. We know that life evolved on Earth, and at some point, man created god. Since then, billions of people have laid hope in false gods which were created by humankind. I, too, was Christian at a time, until I realized what complete and utter bull shit it is. That is why one of my fantasies is to live in ancient Greece, before cell phones, internet, pollution, asphalt, and even Christians themselves existed (Rome also fascinates me).
      </p>
      <p>
       So what is the point of life? To find god, if there is one (or many) IMHO, and to understand our existence and where we came from. Sure, life is a fun ride, have fun, procreate, help others, promote human knowledge, etc., etc., but really, what's the point? You live and die, and once you die, your life is pointless (I think we agree on this). I envision some sort of Space Odyssey 2001 type scenario being the point of our lives; since we were cavemen, we've been searching for that monolith and trying to find our creators. Because of this notion, I took up the study of physics in the hopes of becoming a rocket scientist, building rockets, and exploring the Universe (yes, it's an entirely ridiculous and idiotic boyish dream). I gave up the pursuit of rockets, and turned to nanoscience.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sad thing is that I know none of our generation will ever figure out the point of life in our lives. The universe is too big, and we are too small. There is a truth out there, but we'll never know, because life is a bitch and then you die.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't find god in the stars, and I haven't found her in the atoms, either.

       Does god have a cock and balls? Would those be like spiral and bar galaxies? I assumed some god of the Universe would be female because the only god I know is female--Mother Earth--and she will fuck you up if you disrespect her (also she gets moody every ~10,000 years and can be an ice-cold bitch!).
      </p>
      <p>
       To clarify my point about what is the point of life--why are we here? I said it's to find god. Surely, the simple, easy answer is to enjoy yourself, learn, procreate, etc. etc. This may be the point of
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       life, or
       <em>
        my
       </em>
       life, or
       <em>
        Shia LeBeouf's
       </em>
       life, however, the question was asked, "
       <em>
        What is the point of life?
       </em>
       " This implies life in general (specifically human life in general). I think that point is to discover where we came from and who we are (these are the questions we've been asking ourselves since probably before we developed language itself). So naively you might expect to be searching for god to find these answers (or maybe the Universe has no god, and we can only attempt to solve the Universe).
      </p>
      <p>
       So I think that the point of life is to discover who we are and where we came from. Furthermore I propose that humans will likely never figure this out, which is why our lives are pointless. You can therefore make up any reason to live to have any
       <em>
        point of life
       </em>
       that you desire, but you will never discover
       <em>
        the
       </em>
       point of life, most likely, because life's a bitch, and then you die.

       There is no point of being part of the system other than to be used. Government has molded us to be part of their herd. You either follow like most sheep do (work to pay debts, work to obtain objects that will never fulfill mans appetite for material possesions, come home to work some more, sleep and start anew. Day after day only to be given two days of a "weekend" where you cant truley rest because of lifes demands, so you continue. Day after day. A slave to their system. Living not for yourself and most not even realizing it) or you dont.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the ultimate meaning of life? There is none. Ultimatley, (logically speaking) there is no point to any of it. Not one thing you do will truley make a difference within this world. All "great" people of our past are now just another name in our peoples history.. and over time their names will have been forgotten. So why were we created? Perhaps it was by chance.. but thats a question none of us can ever answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now knowing you have no purpose to life and whether you live or die ultimatley doesnt matter.. well now you must decide whats worth living for. That answer varies with each individual. You obviously wouldnt fit in the "normal" mold then what else can you do? Leave, break from the herd and find your purpose. Leave everything behind. Travel. Find your purpose in life that will make it worthwhile because thats the only option youre left with if youve decided to continue living.

       I don't mean to tell you how to live your life, but it seems to me that if you are not happy, you should figure out why, then stop doing the things that make you unhappy. With all the spare time you will have I am sure you can experiment with new experiences to find out what
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       make you happy. Then keep doing the things that make you happy. If problems persist, repeat from beginning.

       Is happiness the meaning of our existence? Really? That's so insignificant. Be happy because of the minute and temporary release of serotonin and dopamine being released in our brains (and continue to seek out what causes it). I don't think that's what the meaning of our existence is. It's just a mechanism that helps perpetuate our existence by allowing us to engage in that which helps us survive. It doesn't GIVE MEANING to our existence. It's too superficial.

       It's too superficial to find something that makes you happy? I wasn't being specific and saying you had to follow a particular path to happiness. Just saying you should find what works for
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       . I can see how an aversion to happiness itself would make for an anxious lifestyle. Hope things work out for you, I really do.

       You are not understanding what I said. It's too superficial to be the meaning of existence. I stated what happiness is and what is meant to do. It's not a meaning to existence. It's a mechanism. Happiness in this case is a band-aid to discovering the meaning of existence. It is not the ANSWER to the QUESTION.

       There's got to be an after, don't you think? I'm not religious, but I feel like this life is a stepping stone to something else. This part may even not be going as planned by whoever started it all but I think that this version of life will cease eventually and all will be revealed. In the meantime I'm doing my best to open my eyes and mind and treat everyone compassionately so as to make eachother's temporary  journey easier.

       I've always felt strongly about this; this life is important but what's after this has to be too. This current life we are living is but a fleeting experience but it DOES matter, and sometimes I feel like it's a test for humans (and perhaps a game for whoever created us/started it all?) But maybe life is a test to determine our fate after death?. As I said I am not religious so let your mind wander here, but I believe we have a soul or a spirit that sets us apart as individuals and thus continues to exist when our physical shell runs down and dies. There have been many studies to prove the existence of a "soul" that individualizes us and actually "leaves" our body upon dying. Where does this soul go? What purpose does it serve? I think exploring those questions may lead to answers.

       I don't know, truly. I don't believe we will ever know until we die. But maybe TPTB know??? I've always wondered if that's part of the real conspiracy, someone somewhere knows the answers and is keeping it the biggest secret.

       TL;DR: You need to find a purpose in your life that will make it meaningful to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all, you need to take a deep breath and chill out. Nobody here is dodging your question. You need to calm down and try to reflect what people are telling you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think there
       <em>
        has to be
       </em>
       an
       <strong>
        objective
       </strong>
       meaning to existence? On what basis? Who said? You're assuming there is a creator. Do you know that? Even if we could know that, why do you assume the creator would give meaning to existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, I used to ask myself the same question, what is the meaning of life. But then I realized that meaning is purpose. Think about when someone asks you a question. You know what the meaning of the question is not just by the words, but also be inferring the purpose of why they are asking the question. Like someone asks you, "what are you doing this weekend?" You could just answer 'nothing.' But you will immediately ask yourself 'why are they asking me this question? Are they going to ask me on a date? What do they want? What is the
       <em>
        purpose
       </em>
       of this question?' The meaning of the question transcends the words and can be found by understanding the purpose of it. The same thing goes, by the way, for most utterances, not just questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Purpose gives meaning. So realize that when you're asking yourself 'what is the meaning of life' you are really asking yourself 'what is the purpose of life.'
      </p>
      <p>
       OK, so now I'm going to go a little meta. What is the meaning of human existence?  Or in other words, what is the purpose of human existence? Well, let me ask you: are there any species other than humans that ask that question? No. The quest for purpose has propelled humanity from the beginning to search for it. And what is our purpose? All religions seek to answer this question, and that is why they are ubiquitous and hold such power over the human imagination, because they give us a story to answer that burning question. Philosophy also seeks answers to this question. Science is arguably another manifestation of this, as it emerged from asking what is the purpose of things? (Aristotle, for example, argued that objects in the physical world have a telos, an immanent purpose, which caused things to happen.) Our search for purpose is behind our evolution as a species and our potential to overcome our physical limitations.
      </p>
      <p>
       OK, so I think the meaning of human existence (i.e., the purpose of human existence) is to find purpose. And in the smaller scheme of things, it is up to each of us to find a purpose in our lives in order to give it meaning. Most people are given a purpose through whatever religion they grow up with, and they don't question it. For those of us who have the (mis)fortune of not believing the stories we are told, we have to make meaning for ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, you need to find or make a purpose in your life that will make it meaningful to you. Whether it means making a family and doing your best to be a good parent, investing your time in a career that helps improve the lives of others, just trying to savor the various pleasures and physical sensations of this fleeting existence, etc. etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       For guidance and trying to figure out purpose and meaning from scratch, you should really read some philosophy. Perhaps start with the existentialists. Camus argued in his essay on the myth of Sisyphus that we gain purpose and meaning through struggling rather than through success, through the process rather than the result, through the journey rather than the destination.

       You've come here asking us for advice, but at the end of the day you're the only one who can give purpose to your own life. Good luck!

       <p>
        Why do you think there has to be an objective meaning to existence?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       As I stated before, I didn't create myself. There is obviously a subjective meaning to my existence. But to the creator, there would be an objective meaning to my existence from my point of view.
      </p>
      <p>
       Logically, everything derives from one. That oneness, may it be us, may it be everything, but whatever it is, is what 'created' us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Logically, everything cannot be derived from 0.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the 4th and 5th paragraphs, I already know this.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you know there are no other species that ask this question? The rest of that paragraph, I don't know why you wrote that. We already knew this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next paragraph, this is the same answer everyone gave us. If the purpose is To find purpose is redundant and a cop out. Making meaning for ourselves is the subjective meaning to our existence. It is not the objective meaning to our existence. If we created ourselves then your answer would have sufficed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Making life meaningful to you is immature and childish, and ignorant and is continuing in the blindness and acceptance of defeat.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of your answer is the continuance of a life of defeat. That is not the meaning to life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with the next paragraph. It was insightful. I came to this realization by myself already.

      <p>
       Maybe, but why do you you assume that 'that oneness' has a purpose for us? I don't see how that follows logically at all.

       What you are experiencing is the result of a society without any real culture and without cohesion. Find a group that shares the same values as you, the same vision for the future as you, whatever kind of group they are. People are happier when surrounded by those who are like them. In the past people have been drawn together by their shared culture, values, nationality and their religious views... unfortunately this is much harder these days. So think about what motivates you, what gets you passionate and find people that shares those things with you.

       It's not. What i'm trying to say is culture is what makes people "happy", it gives meaning to their lives. In the West traditional culture is mostly gone, so the next best thing is to associate with people similar to you. I think you will find that religious people feel a lot more satisfied with their lives than an atheist or an agnostic. This is because their beliefs give meaning and reason to their actions and their existence in general. They are also apart of a community of people that share their belief, reinforcing their faith and giving them a place to fall back on in times of need (strength in numbers). Religion is not the only example, people apart of political groups, hobby groups and the like will often experience the same things. But i used religion as an example because it's is often the base of a societies culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of individuals in Western society have nothing in the way of meaningful existence and the West is experiencing massive levels of mental illness (depression, anxiety). Our weekdays are spent often working terrible jobs, that are loathed, often these jobs include no physical activity at all. While weekends spent drinking, taking drugs and having lots of sex with strangers, devaluing sexual intercourse. Everywhere we are bombarded by advertisements for thing we don't want or need. Music, TV and Movies are filled and glorify sex, drugs and other perversions. The news  shows nothing but war, violence, crime and celebrities, and to make it worse we have become desensitization to it. The rich get richer, the middle class is disappearing and the poor get poorer (by the way capitalism is not at fault, it's corporatism, corruption and an apathetic public). The politicians do nothing for the people they "serve" they are bought and payed for and care only for their own wellbeing. One final point (there is more) Western society is being plugged into matrix. I mean look around you everyone is glued to their Iphone, laptop or other piece of technology. Conversation is being replaced with shallow electronic messaging and thinking being replaced with lines of code.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's is just a small slice that is wrong with society and I don't know you but I am confident that this is the reason why you feel the sadness and nihilism that you do. Western society and the "culture" that has emerged from it's current being is superficial and most people feel it what you feel, even i feel it.

       How about the ascension to higher state of understanding and being... without loosing yourself (true self as in consciousness, soul is just pure energy and body is nothing but a vessel in a way its a perfect balance and one can't go without the other in this space/time), ascension could be the final stage of any sentient being where freedom is absolute.

       I can't help but feel like you are asking so many questions as if you don't even care what the answers is as long as someone answers it, so with that said "do you really want to know of just how endless the answer is ?" because you know "sometimes questions are more important than answers."

       Your first paragraph is very abstract and doesn't contain much meaning at all.

       The second paragraph, I think you are annoyed because you realized I asked questions because no one is providing an answer and you can't come up with one either.

       Let's say I need to get from New York to California, I could walk and it might take a lifetime, I may die before I ever reach my destination and it will certainly be a miserable experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, I could hop in a car(take LSD), make the trip in a couple of days and enjoy the rest of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or even better, hop on a plane(dmt) and make the trip in a couple of hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hallucinogens are not mind dampening, they are actually quite the opposite. They allow you to see the world and explore thought patterns in ways that simply cannot be achieved, even after a lifetime of meditation.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you chose not to use external influences, what are doing here? Go sit in a dark quiet room for the rest of your life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, you should be ashamed of yourself for believing what TPTB have fed you about mind altering substances.

       Maybe there have been several people, and maybe some of them are people like Buddha and Jesus. They say enlightenment is the "death before death" and this may be why. If you basically figure it out, spending your life thinking about it more just seems pointless. This is why nirvana is the "extinguishing of the flame", you no longer need to seek because it turns out it's been right in front of you this whole time.

       Life, right now, is a way. There is a truth. We're born ignorant, we slowly figure out how the world works and how our minds work as we age.
      </p>
      <p>
       At some point you start to realize there's a lot of stuff that you simply cannot know because there's no evidence one way or the other. So you realize what's knowable and what's unknowable. You start defining that boundary more clearly. Then you start honing the "knowable" part, getting it more and more refined.
      </p>
      <p>
       As your view of the world gets more and more accurate, it takes less and less effort to maintain as the adjustments get smaller. At some point, you realize this burning striving in your gut is no longer necessary and is actually harming your mental well-being. You can accomplish a lot but still are a limited human being, so you can relax and enjoy the ride instead of worrying so much, and accomplish
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       instead of less by doing so because energy is not being wasted on ideation that is not serving any purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know the absolute truth, no one does, but this is my best guess so far.

       Wow. Somehow this brought clarity to me.

       What if the truth you're supposed to realize involves getting your mind so sorted out that you no longer need internalized negative emotion to drive your pursuit?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can swim 20 laps because you're angry. Or you can just swim 20 laps. The effect is the same, and one takes less energy.

       What if all this emotion pulling you to strive is actually blocking clarity, instead of bringing it?

       Yes, because the answer is something that is experienced in the moment, not something that is abstractly known.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's something that
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       , a process that occurs, not something that you can write down or say in a sentence, imo. You can never say "I have the answer" because that is just a screenshot of the real thing. You cannot "have" it, you can only
       <em>
        be
       </em>
       it, moment to moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you chasing after a piece of information that will explain everything, or are you instead actually chasing after a mindset or emotion that this information would give? You nor I will never know the full truth as a human, that's just a fact of life, so do not create emotional strain in your own mind over something that is far beyond the scope of any one human's brain. Can you imagine getting mad at an ant for not understanding calculus?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody knows the answer, and part of discovering the answer is realizing that this is the case.  The mental peace this generates gives you more control over your mind, and
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       is the answer. The problem isn't not-knowing, it's all these emotional knots we've got ourselves tangled up in. Or at least that's how my mind works.

       You're right, I can't be sure, it just seems like how it is. I think Godel's incompleteness theorem proves that a human mind can never fully represent the universe because it is contained within (is a subset of) the universe.

       As I understand it, it says that no system can have within it a representational system that represents the full system, without there being some loss. A perfect representation of any system is the system itself, you cannot understand the universe in something as non-complex as a human brain. You'd need something as complicated as the universe, to fully understand the universe. And since the human brain is a sub-set of this, full 100% perfect understanding is physically impossible. There's just not enough information density to encode all the patterns, so we have to pick and choose based on what we're exposed to, this gives rise to our limited human perspective.

       It proves my point more than it does yours, but it's possible this theory is wrong. It's also possible that we don't need to know every part of reality to understand the main gist of the key parts. Who knows.

       Think about what you are physically made out of... a specific combination of the same elements and energy that makes up our universe. We are the observers of reality in this universe. It has evolved us and all other kinds of life to experience itself in countless different perspectives and paths over time. Everyone of these experiences are important and necessary to continue improving the amazing evolution of being alive.

       We are actors playing our part in the quintessential fight between good and evil. Which side you choose, is up to you. Maybe there is an afterlife. I personally believe there is, then only everything makes sense, to me at least. But yeah, nobody knows the definite answer. It may get clearer only after death :p

       I don't know, truly. I don't believe we will ever know until we die. But maybe TPTB know??? I've always wondered if that's part of the real conspiracy, someone somewhere knows the answers and is keeping it the biggest secret.

        As your view of the world gets more and more accurate, it takes less and less effort to maintain as the adjustments get smaller. At some point, you realize this burning striving in your gut is no longer necessary and is actually harming your mental well-being. You can accomplish a lot but still are a limited human being, so you can relax and enjoy the ride instead of worrying so much, and accomplish more instead of less by doing so because energy is not being wasted on ideation that is not serving any purpose.

       Does god have a cock and balls? Would those be like spiral and bar galaxies? I assumed some god of the Universe would be female because the only god I know is female--Mother Earth--and she will fuck you up if you disrespect her (also she gets moody every ~10,000 years and can be an ice-cold bitch!).
      </p>
      <p>
       To clarify my point about what is the point of life--why are we here? I said it's to find god. Surely, the simple, easy answer is to enjoy yourself, learn, procreate, etc. etc. This may be the point of
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       life, or
       <em>
        my
       </em>
       life, or
       <em>
        Shia LeBeouf's
       </em>
       life, however, the question was asked, "
       <em>
        What is the point of life?
       </em>
       " This implies life in general (specifically human life in general). I think that point is to discover where we came from and who we are (these are the questions we've been asking ourselves since probably before we developed language itself). So naively you might expect to be searching for god to find these answers (or maybe the Universe has no god, and we can only attempt to solve the Universe).
      </p>
      <p>
       So I think that the point of life is to discover who we are and where we came from. Furthermore I propose that humans will likely never figure this out, which is why our lives are pointless. You can therefore make up any reason to live to have any
       <em>
        point of life
       </em>
       that you desire, but you will never discover
       <em>
        the
       </em>
       point of life, most likely, because life's a bitch, and then you die.
