       They just want the same or more rights as any other legally defined person. They are sick of other people getting in their way. They are just another minority being oppressed by old value systems. Our values need to change and we need to be more tolerant of corporate peoples. We need to give them more Oscars and put special bathrooms in school for corporations. They should be included. Their lives matter. In fact, they should have their own nation state with big concrete walls to keep out the haters.

       Do you really want a republican nominating Supreme Court justices?  Citizens United is the tip of the iceberg compared to what might happen with a 7-2 conservative supermajority Supreme Court.  I don't like it, but I will hold my nose and support Hillary if she gets the nomination.  A GOP win in november means that all of the progressive victories of the 20th century might be rolled back, and a drift toward something that looks more like a third world country.

       Plot twist. It will be Sanders that will keep it alive while telling everyone things are getting better. That is if he wins. Hes just another Obama. Look at his voting record. He is corporate to the bone with a shynier mask. I still think that real change will come only if Trump becomes the new president. The very fact by itself will have a lot to say about American politics in its current state and wether he breaks or fixes the country that i used to admire it will be reformed and possibly the treath of revolt or active revolution will be used to stear it in a direction that benefits more people than the ruling minority.

       I really don't understand this attitude, you honestly cannot be so sure that Bernie will win that you'll take a massive shit on the person who is slightly more likely to take the nomination. What happens if she wins, is everyone going to keep trash talking her all the way to a Trump presidency?

       It's fucking hilarious that these former pro establishment voters that probably voted Obama in twice are now all of a sudden shocked at how the system ditches them at a moments notice, but they're still rallying around a big government advocate. For one, the irony is hilarious because they'll be the same censors that shut out the far rights opinons despite pretending to be free speech advocates... And two, you probably all scoffed at Ron Paul supporters who pointed this bullshit out en masse almost a decade ago, but it didn't matter because you didn't agree with Ron Paul because he was an evil racist. Why is this sub all of a sudden in support of big gov? I miss the days of

       posting well researched theories about the deep state, breakaway civilizations, etc... This sub is just becoming a blend of alternative news stories and "omg guys Bernie Sanders is getting fucked over, how unfair!!!" despite this being par for the course for god knows how long. This sub used to have very deep discussions about reality...It's a damn shame.

       Most qualified to really fuck Americans over. Too bad the Deep State doesn't trust or want her to hold that position. The presidential puppet must not know too much, and must be trusted by the people first.

       I don't know if that's true. I think you're bound to see countless Bernie supporters either not vote, vote 3rd party, or vote Trump (if he gets the nom). I'm pretty far left and if Bernie doesn't get it, there's no way in hell I'm voting for Clinton. I think there are a lot of people who share that sentiment. But you are, of course, right. Many people will vote for the Democratic party and against their best interests if he doesn't win.

       I'm a Burnie supporter, and if he doesn't get the nomination I'm voting Trump. With Trump, only one of two things can happen: 1. He actually does really well  and fixes the country 2. He completely destroys the country. Either way, better than Clinton.

       I could never vote for this man.  His campaign is ran on hate.  He has no clear plan.  He has filed bankruptcy four times screwing over small business in the process.  Here is my biggest reason for not voting for him.  Donald trump isn't doing this because he is ready to give a little community service back to our country, he is running for personal gain!  Everything he does is to benefit him and he does not care who he hurts in the process.  He will lie and say what you want to hear and do the opposite without caring what anyone thinks.  He knows his followers are stupid he has pretty much said that.  Hillary has a whole other list of reasons I could not vote for her.  We are really going to be fucked either way and it will be because Americans do not educate themselves instead they join in on the propaganda they are being fed.  This is really scary in my opinion and could mean the end of the American Dream for our children.

       Are you kidding me?  I won't.  I've been a democrat most of my life and if Hillary is the candidate I will revenge vote for Trump. I've made it very clear to others that is what I will do.  Hillary is getting zero support from me. If Trumps not an option I'll vote the most likely candidate to legalize drugs because we're going to need them.

       An innocent question.  . . Given all of the shenanigans, corruption,  the game being rigged from the onset. All the crap the sanders team has faced. . . Why doesn't he pull up the stakes, call it for what it is. Withdraw, but stay in the game as an independent, taking his supporters and endorsers with him. I know the likelihood of him winning the presidency  is nil. But is that the end game? No. Transforming a corupt poltical system and restoring democracy is what its all about. There is a yuuge awakening in America and the movement will continue to grow.

       Itd be literally impossible for him to win as a third party. Ya he'd probably get a good chunk of votes but those would come from people who would've voted democrat securing a republican president. Unlike a lot of his supporters, he'd MUCH rather see Clinton as the president than any republican.

       This is really not productive. If you think she is not qualified (as I do for instance), you should point why that is the case and what exactly the problems are.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         For instance, the one I hear quite a lot is that she has foreign policy experience that other candidates lack. That's great, but I question whether she actually does have that or whether her experience this far has been any good. She didn't handle some situations very well (in fact, she did that quite poorly) - Benghazi was a disaster and she was largely at fault there. If you look at the timeline, she is really at fault there. Her defense 'what difference does it make?' is appalling.
Some may disagree with this, and that's fine, I would like to hear what makes her a good foreign policy expert - give me good examples of her dealing with things properly so we can have a good balanced view.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There is another often covered tendency that she will cater for women more, because she is a woman. This is clear nonsense. Being a woman is not a political quality (otherwise, being a man is also one, so other candidates would cater for men issues more - or are we to forget 50% of the population every election?). Besides, she was not the only woman running, why did we pick her as the voice of women (why not Carly Fiorina?).
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I think this type of discussion is more fruitful, and gets the message across, as well as invites those who support Hillary to counter our views (maybe we are wrong, don't be so dogmatic, we are clearly missing something if others think Hillary is a better choice). But this needs to be done in a sustained discussion, reading the arguments for Hillary's qualifications and not just dismissing them as propaganda. What you are doing is just polarising the situation. There is a reason why Sanders does not what to blackmouth Hillary - he is very well aware that that will drive the candidates to the right or not to vote at all (and I am guessing he keeps some things for later in the campaign).

       Her tenure in Congress is generally considered to be a joke.  She passed three laws that were
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_career_of_Hillary_Rodham_Clinton#Legislation">
        absolute nothingburgers.
       </a>
       : one names a post office, one names a highway, one designates a park.  So 'joke' is somewhat irrefutable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Granted, she only served for 8 years from 2001-2009.  I'm sure none of you got nearly as much accomplished in your 8 years by comparison.  (the difficulty and complexity of my 30 ish technology projects during that time were nothing compared to naming a post office.)

       It's funny that this very line of reasoning Americans get raked over the coals for yet it's okay when non Americans do it as long as it's directed at Americans. I haven't done any of that so how am I guilty? No matter how you spin it, Im not. Individual every day Americans who disagree with our status quo are not.

       Plot twist. It will be Sanders that will keep it alive while telling everyone things are getting better. That is if he wins. Hes just another Obama. Look at his voting record. He is corporate to the bone with a shynier mask. I still think that real change will come only if Trump becomes the new president. The very fact by itself will have a lot to say about American politics in its current state and wether he breaks or fixes the country that i used to admire it will be reformed and possibly the treath of revolt or active revolution will be used to stear it in a direction that benefits more people than the ruling minority.

       Do you really want a republican nominating Supreme Court justices?  Citizens United is the tip of the iceberg compared to what might happen with a 7-2 conservative supermajority Supreme Court.  I don't like it, but I will hold my nose and support Hillary if she gets the nomination.  A GOP win in november means that all of the progressive victories of the 20th century might be rolled back, and a drift toward something that looks more like a third world country.
