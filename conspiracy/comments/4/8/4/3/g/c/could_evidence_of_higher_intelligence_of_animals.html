       I could definitely see the potential detriment of the public finding out info about animals that may make them think twice before buying or eating them in the current form the largest industries are in i.e. inhumane killing, the animals miserable existence up until that point, etc. I think we've all met at least one of those people so alarmed by documentaries like Food Inc that they were at least temporarily turned into a vegetarian or vegan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you guys think that the intelligence of animals is misrepresented at all or potentially on purpose?

       Everything is suppressed. It's a consequence of being drained of most of our energy on a daily basis. You have no idea the things you could comprehend if your mental energy was given a chance to grow and fill you from head to toe.  If that sounds silly then it's just proof of how drained we are. Until you've sat completely still and watched the entire universe spin around you then it's probably hard to understand.  Stop talking. Stop thinking. Just feel. Feel so deeply that your true power has nothing else to do but show itself to you.

       Honestly I don't think we, as humans, are even qualified to assess the intelligence of another species. We can only assess their
       <em>
        human
       </em>
       intelligence (given that's the only intelligence we really can fully grasp). I suspect many animals and possibly even plants are more aware and capable on thought than we realize, but we just can't map it to a human intelligence scale because, well, they're not human.

       A bit of realism and learned helplessness in your words. Many people have emotional attachment to animals. There would be a lot who would connect what they learned to the relationships that have now or had in the past. It would be more a matter of education imo. Misinformation is abundant on the internet, and that's exactly what it would look like. News stations would only report to call people who believed in it stupid.

       Suppressed ?

      <p>
       Possibility the worse thing is incredulity and ridicule by academic community (taboo?). Though there are researchers and groups involved in trying to amass attention to the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another problem is we can only define intelligence by our perception. S.Lem "Solaris" is a perfect example.
