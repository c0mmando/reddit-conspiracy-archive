        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>TL;DR: The FBI clearly has the goods they need to put Hillary in jail for emailgate. Instead of actually putting her in jail, they probably prefer to hold a &quot;trump&quot; card should she be elected which will be used by the Deep State to ensure control of the USG. This is basically the MO for the FBI going back to the Hoover days - gather whatever dirt necessary to ensure that the politicians march in step with the desires of the FBI.</strong></p>

<p>The scariest thing about the 2016 election is the potential for capture of the election by the billionaire class. These are the capital owners, those tiny fraction of people who sit on top of the 2016 version of Feudalism: wide swaths of people pay a handful of billionaires rent of some kind to use property, whether it be land, resources, or shitty apartment complexes, physical or virtual.</p>

<p>On the right you have Trump, himself a member of the Billionaire class. This is the guy who described Mexicans: &quot;They&#39;re rapists.&quot; Yet he is the front runner on the Republican side for a position that brings with it the fucking nuclear codes.</p>

<p>On the left you have Sanders and Clinton. Clinton is winning the media battle thanks to her billionaire support. Twitter censoring, ComcastNBCUniversalMSNBC/CNN/FoxMurdockWSJ propaganda, huge air time thanks to her super PACs. She is totally paid off by the billionaires who will make sure she never has the &quot;political capital&quot; to reign in Wall Street (even as the Justice Department does nothing to prosecute actual criminal actions by the banks, despite having all the statutory power needed to prosecute).</p>

<p>But what is worse is that the Deep State of the United States Government - ie the 3 Letter Agencies FBI, CIA, NSA, DOJ, DOD - now have a perfect blackmail opportunity for Hillary. Obama is likely covering for her, but at the same time the fact that she stored classified emails on a private server probably means a jury would convict her. So were she elected (or not) the FBI would really have a gun to her head. In any case, she is a total hawk so it&#39;s unlikely they even need a trump card - but this gives the Oligarchy a way to ensure that it has subverted the few Democratic processes left in this country.</p>

<p>I really hope the US manages to avoid further descent into this Orwellian Feudalism nightmare future. Sanders would likely be a step in the right direction, but without total dismantling of the Deep State I think it&#39;s unlikely we will see this thing turn around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know that people who listen to tons and tons of highly opinionated, factually skewed information can often lose their perspective, but a note of caution. While it is simply taken for granted that Hillary is a major criminal figure to those who listen every day to Rush Limbaugh, Michael Savage, Glenn Beck, foxnews, Alex Jones, and/or other elements of the far right media, the &quot;facts&quot; are not considered so clear outside the thought bubble. Don&#39;t be surprised to learn that actually Hillary has not committed any crimes, or anything worth prosecuting. </p>

<p>Again, I get it: Rush Limbaugh can be very convincing. If you trust him and listen to him every day, you have probably long ago decided that Hillary is practically a crime boss. </p>

<p>Or if, heaven forbid, you were raised by parents who listen to Limbsugh and fox news, you have been having right wing bullshit drilled into your skull since you were crawling around on the carpet. </p>

<p>But being a right wing zealot does not make Hillary a criminal. She was simply following a permitted practice of using private email. It was not illegal. And the classified email she received was not marked classified until long after she received it. </p>

<p>The right wing has been hunting Hillary for thirty years and they have never turned up anything. But for some reason they remain convinced she&#39;s a crime boss just one step ahead of them. </p>
