    <div class="md"><p><strong>Just THANK YOU! for all of your amazing work. You are one of my heroes</strong></p>

<p>I used to think the problem with 911 Truth was that people hadn&#39;t seen the evidence. Now Ive realized the problem is that people do not want to know the truth because it is so disturbing. I have a good friend who lost two friends that day.  I could not even get him to sign ae911truth&#39;s public petition.  We really are herd animals.
When the truth is this disturbing,, I guess ignorance really is bliss, -as someone said in reply to one of my comments.</p>

<p>The silence of people like Glenn Greenwald, Amy Goodman, <a href="http://digwithin.net/2013/11/29/chomsky/">Noam Chomsky</a> etc has been another real shocker. It just shows the degree to which the vast majority of our media and academia is a managed affair. Thanks again!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is it a waste of time? What makes you think he&#39;s not controlled opposition. For me the coin dropped when Miles wrote (now I can&#39;t find where): Chomsky writes a 500 page book on manufacturing consent, but doesn&#39;t tell you (really) who they&#39;re manufacturing it for. That rang true to me.  </p>

<p>Anyway, for more on what controlled opposition is and how it works in the world today, I highly recommend <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/guru.pdf">this essay.</a>  No doubt you will tell me that this .pdf is also a waste of time without telling me why you think so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I think people often overlook is the Rockefeller-CIA ties to WTC being built--the Rockefellers and the CIA have a partnership that began with the Dulles brothers and their Sullivan &amp; Cromwell ties.  John Foster Dulles became a partner of S&amp;C, Allen Dulles worked there as well; together they overthrew countries for the corporate clients which S&amp;C represented.  JF Dulles was older than Allen--but they both had a role during WWI: JF Dulles participated in the financial swindles which helped &quot;rebuild&quot; Germany&#39;s industrial sectors while Allen Dulles just got his feet wet in Europe as a spy.  </p>

<p>By the 20&#39;s, John Foster Dulles knew Henry Luce (Time)--he passed this important link to Allen.  JF would be the bureaucrat who knew men like Hjalmar Scacht--they both knew how to cakewalk around banking regulations. Allen Dulles was a bit uncomfortable in the legal world--but still managed to pull off a few swindles in Latin America.  The important part was AD understood the basics; he could sweet talk the the victim into the ballpark--but it was JF who would write the contract.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, during WWII, it was JF who was sidelined and Allen who found his calling as a spy in Switzerland working for the OSS.  Before Allen went to Europe though--he began his OSS days at Rockefeller Center (ahem!) where the OSS had an office.  Allen worked there interviewing people coming back from Europe.  Both brothers were attached to republicans; so they both suffered a bit and waited out until Eisenhower got in office (&#39;53).  JF Dulles was Ike&#39;s foreign policy adviser during his campaign and was named Sec. of State after Ike got in office; Allen was named CIA Director.</p>

<p>So how does this connect to the World Trade Center?  I found out when I read Jim Garrison&#39;s book <em>On the Trail of the Assassins</em>--page 100:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to these articles, the CIA--which apparently had been conducting its own foreign policy for some time--had begun a project in Italy as far back as the early 1960&#39;s. The organization, named the Centro Mondiale Commerciale (the World Trade Center), had initially been formed in Montreal, then moved to Rome in 1961. Among the members of its board of directors, we learned, was one Clay Shaw from New Orleans.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was in the 60&#39;s that the WTC was planned--they had to use the power of <em>eminent domain</em> to get the land (which takes time)--but with Nelson Rockefeller in office as Governor of NY and the other Rockefellers in NYC pulling strings--it worked.  I&#39;m sure the CIA ties didn&#39;t hurt, either.  </p>

<p>After the towers were built in the 70&#39;s, the CIA began to have serious problems:  the Church Committee, the Schweiker Committee, the House Sub-Committee on Assassinations...GHW Bush was named Director of the CIA under Ford in &#39;76. </p>

<p>When Carter came into office--there were mass firings at the Agency and Admiral Stansfield Turner was named Director.  The CIA was in trouble--so it did what intelligence agencies do best: parts of it privatized and went underground.  This is when the Safari Club began...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry I&#39;m adding this after the AMA is over, but it&#39;s worth mentioning 2 things about the WTC in this historical context: 1) it was a work of islamic architecture by a japanese guy, 2) Allen Dulles was knights of malta; and therefore, together with the history lesson by smokinbluebear above,  the destruction of wtc was as much symbolic as strategic, which makes sense in my mind as a motivation for a pseudocatholic spymaster.</p>

<p>What&#39;s most interesting--and I witnessed this firsthand in nyc in 2014, the memorial was visually &#39;shielded&#39; around it by white sheeting material that appeared to be part of reconstruction efforts.  Around the visual block you had a roped off area forming a spiral around the memorial, and outside of that, policemen coordinating.  People formed a queue within the roped in area to gain entrance into the memorial. I didn&#39;t do it because the policeman I asked said it would be an hour wait.</p>

<p>In essence, this roped off area forced people to slowly circle around the memorial, which was itself, a square, black  reflecting pool with placards on all sides of the deceased around it.  Black square, circling around?  Ringing a bell?  Ok I&#39;ll just say it, they had <em>symbolically recreated memorial as the Kaaba</em> and were forcing people into participating in the ritual of the kaaba with the plaques in place of the black stone.  Most of the people there were evangelical type Christians on vacation like it&#39;s our own wailing wall, totally unaware of what they were doing.  </p>

<p>E: &quot;Fool me twice...You&#39;re fooled you cain&#39;t get fooled again&quot;  The mockery of it is astounding.  We&#39;re up againsts some mean people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry for writing this so far after the fact.</p>

<p>The facade---the overall placement of the buildings, the style and the vision.  It was created by a Japanese guy who loved Islamic architecture.  No doubt he was a freemason as well. Everything about WTC was symbolic.  The two towers represented Jachim and Boaz, making the WTC a reference to freemasonry, specifically &#39;shriners&#39; (islam in masonry), played off as &#39;the parapets surrounding kaaba&#39;--but that&#39;s misdirection.  </p>

<p>WTC&#39;s destruction is a phoenix theme, a foreboding of the destruction of the current and rebuilding of solomon&#39;s temple in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s what they are up to.  And why the elite are so gay for israel.. they want access and the means to rebuild temple of solomon while the world is destroyed or do one then the other.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Immediately after the article was published, it appeared that a response might be forthcoming due to inexplicable damage to several packages sent, via the US Postal Service, between some of the investigators who were involved. When my colleague Steven Jones sent a sample of the red-gray chips to my post office box in late April 2009, <strong>the samples had been removed from the double envelope package through a series of slits just barely big enough to slide the small vial out.</strong> The postal inspector never responded to my complaint. <strong>But when I later mailed something to my colleague James Gourley, the envelope arrived with a corner ripped out, in a gross kind of damage that neither of us had ever seen.</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m really glad that you&#39;re here.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t say how much I&#39;ve enjoyed the podcasts you did with The Mind Renewed.</p>

<p>Those have been great resources to link people to and got my husband questioning 9/11.</p>

<p>My questions....</p>

<p>1- Did anyone else at UL share your suspicions/questions about the WTC steel and the &quot;investigation&quot; into 9/11?</p>

<p>2- Do you think we will ever see a true investigation or wider acceptance that the 9/11 Commission was total BS, in our lifetime?</p>

<p>I also want to thank you for your work and continuing to speak out. Best wishes to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kevin,</p>

<p>I bought your book a few years ago after another reddit user recommended that I do so. <a href="http://imgur.com/PJejUbW">http://imgur.com/PJejUbW</a></p>

<p>I have read it, along with several other 9/11 books, watched all of the major 9/11 documentaries, and frequently research using the timelines available at History Commons. </p>

<p>That said, I still learn about new information every day.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which resources (print, video, online) would you recommend to others for research into the people and events of 9/11?</p>

<p>Of particular interest to me is William Rodriguez&#39;s testimony about hearing explosions before the first plane hit <a href="https://youtu.be/eS8URT9anUE?t=64">https://youtu.be/eS8URT9anUE?t=64</a> and after being interviewed for it, his testimony does not appear in the 9/11 commission report. What do you think about Rodriguez&#39;s testimony and have you ever had a chance to speak with him about his experience?</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>Towards the end of your book you conclude that:</p>

<p>&quot;Considering 9/11 as a product of a deeper, non-national (or trans-national) state brings to mind the Safari Club, which proceeded and drove organizations like BCCI.&quot; p.313</p>

<p>&quot;It would therefore not be surprising that a secretive group of deep state operatives embedded within the U.S. government might have taken action to secure the nations interests for the long term.&quot; p.315</p>

<p>Is this not exactly what people deep inside the intelligence apparatus would need to do in order to ensure American superiority in Eurasian-politics and the Great Game? </p>

<p>Given this viewpoint, it seems that you can see how they could justify 9/11 as being for the greater good &quot;The people who committed the crimes of 9/11 probably thought that they were doing the right thing.&quot; p.314</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you think that the U.S., Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Pakistan formed their own version of a trans-national &quot;Safari Club&quot; in order to attack the United States? If so, why do you believe that they would do this? What would be the benefit to each country doing so?</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>A few weeks ago, I made a post here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> that focused on the concrete evidence of Saudi Arabian involvement with 9/11. (<a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/46glp9/draft_of_saudi_involvement_with_911/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/46glp9/draft_of_saudi_involvement_with_911/</a>)</p>

<p>You have said that the Saudi&#39;s are definitely partially responsible along with Pakistan, the UAE, and the U.S. </p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would like to know, since many people here on reddit, wrongly focus on Israel, what is your opinion on Israel and 9/11? I personally believe that they were running counter-intelligence against known Saudi terrorists and simply knew an attack was coming. I do not believe that they actually played a significant role in the attacks. Do you agree with this? If no, why?</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Final Questions</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>What in your mind, what is one of the biggest occurrences with regards to the official story that does not match up in your opinion?</p></li>
<li><p>What has Saudi Arabia directly gained from their involvement in 9/11? (Obviously knocking Iraq out of their sphere of influence but what other justification could they have had for wanting to go forward with it?)</p></li>
<li><p>Why do you think that the Bush Administration (CIA,FBI,etc) made it so difficult for the 9/11 commission to investigate? Simply to cover up for their incompetence, or to cover up their involvement? The reason I ask is because Sandy Berger was obviously caught stealing documents from the National Archives to cover up intelligence that Clinton knew about supposed attacks. (Also Clinton not assassinating Bin Laden while on his hunting trip in the UAE). So it seems to me that it is not strictly a Bush Administration issue. <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a0405bergersentence">http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a0405bergersentence</a> </p></li>
<li><p>What do you think the redacted 28 pages of the 9/11 commission report contain?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The level of willful ignorance and shameless apathy is mind-boggling.</p>

<p>Moreover, there is so much misinformation and disinformation put out by the corporate media and on the internet.</p>

<p>i&#39;ve done a lot of the time-consuming work of vetting the evidence for you already.</p>

<p>All you have to do is Look, Listen and Learn.</p>

<p>Let us speak to the facts and allow the facts to speak for themselves. </p>

<p>If you have evidence to the contrary, then bring it forward for all to see so that we can learn together.</p>

<p>Sometimes people hold a core belief that is very strong. When they are presented with evidence that works against that belief, the new evidence cannot be accepted.
It would create a feeling that is extremely uncomfortable, called cognitive dissonance.
And because it is so important to protect the core belief, they will rationalize, ignore and even deny anything that doesn&#39;t fit in with the core belief.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Speaking of blind eyes, one interesting link between Israel and 9/11 that I’ve seen came from someone who was a central character in one of the most divisive arguments in the truth movement. That’s Shelton Lankford, who for the 12 years before 9/11 was the director of communications at Telos Corporation, where he worked for leading neocons like Fred Ikle and Stephen Bryen. Ikle was the founder of the U.S. PSYOPS program and Bryen ran JINSA, the Israeli interface with the Pentagon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, thanks for trying to explain. I&#39;m still having trouble understanding. You wrote that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>they believe the Torah says God will give it to them (aka that they&#39;re allowed to take it), which includes the promised land of &quot;greater Israel&quot; that extends through Iraq and Syria, from the Nile to the Euphrates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But also that they:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>use the Jewish people as a shield to hide behind</p>

<p>use religion to justify their crimes.</p>

<p>It&#39;s imperialistic greed masked as religious prophecy and divine right</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So on the one hand they believe in the Torah, but on the other hand they don&#39;t believe in it and are just using it as a mask and a justification. So what do they believe and what is their real motivation? </p>

<p>Also, if they&#39;re doing it only for greed, as you seem to suggest, why would they want a piece of land as worthless (from a natural resources perspective) as Jerusalem? Or really even the whole of Israel? I mean, I can understand why they&#39;d want Syria, Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, with all that oil, but why Israel? Is it sort of a beachhead they established so they could then push further into the territory? And if so, why have they given up territory they already captured, namely Gaza and the Sinai peninsula? Why did they (allegedly) stop Sharon from penetrating into the Egyptian mainland in the 67 war? </p>

<p>Sorry but I just don&#39;t understand how this all makes sense...maybe it does and I&#39;m just not seeing it...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So if they have no true affiliation beyond greed, and they don&#39;t really believe in God&#39;s promise to Mt. Zion, and they are apparently willing to cede territory they control around &#39;greater Israel,&#39; then why call them Zionists? That&#39;s what I don&#39;t understand about all of this. </p>

<p>I have often heard people who say that the Zionists control the world point out how the media is controlled by Jews. But you&#39;ve said that most Jews aren&#39;t Zionists, and in fact the Zionists aren&#39;t really Jewish. So the fact that the media is controlled by Jews is irrelevant. What&#39;s relevant is that those people are in cahoots with this cabal. And we also know that many of the people who are part of this cabal are not Jewish (for example with 9/11 we can name Bush [and his entire family], Cheney, Rumsfeld, Myers, Rice, etc.). </p>

<p>If greed and megalomania is really what&#39;s driving them and not any kind of religious affiliation and not a conviction or belief in biblical prophecies, then what&#39;s even the point of calling them Zionists? Why not just &#39;the powers that be&#39; or &#39;the cabal&#39; or &#39;the plutocrats&#39; or something like that?  </p>

<p>&quot;I would like to know, since many people here on reddit, <strong>wrongly focus on Israel</strong>, what is your opinion on Israel and 9/11? I personally believe that they were running counter-intelligence against known Saudi terrorists and simply knew an attack was coming. I do not believe that they actually played a significant role in the attacks. Do you agree with this? If no, why?&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m clearly not Kevin R Ryan, but I had to take you to task over your naive comment.</p>

<p>Wrongly focus on Israel...?</p>

<p>Israel were a massive part of 9/11...it is at this point that I know you&#39;re a shill, stupid or both.  I&#39;ve been researching this area for more than 15 years. Yes, since the day it happened...Israel&#39;s fingerprints are all over this operation.</p>

<p>That still only gives credence to someone having foreknowledge and is still far from being evidence of Israeli responsibility for the attacks.</p>

<p>They absolutely knew an attack was going to happen but the vast amount of evidence all goes back to Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>That&#39;s so stupid. There are witnesses who saw these guys literally dancing in celebration when the towers were hit.  A bomb sniffer dog flagged them and their van for explosives residue. Urban Moving Systems was, according to the FBI, a front for an intelligence operation and the owner quite literally fled the country. In fact, Urban Moving Systems sent people to the &quot;vicinity of the Flight 93 crash site&quot; on the morning of 9/11, and before Flight 93 had actually crashed. Are you saying that was just a coincidence?</p>

<p>It seems to me that you are in some type of radical denial about who was responsible for this attack.</p>

<p>No, you are refusing to answer or acknowledge why these men would have been celebrating a terrorist attack against the United States if they were merely conducting a surveillance operation. You simply keep repeating that you have posted facts, without actually proving you have done any such thing, or that the facts you claim to have posted are relevant or the complete story. In short, you are quite blatantly a liar.</p>

<p><strong>THERE was ruin and terror in Manhattan, but, over the Hudson River in New Jersey, a handful of men were dancing.</strong></p>

<p><strong>As the World Trade Centre burned and crumpled, the five men celebrated and filmed the worst atrocity ever committed on American soil as it played out before their eyes.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Who do you think they were? Palestinians? Saudis? Iraqis, even? Al-Qaeda, surely? Wrong on all counts. They were Israelis - and at least two of them were Israeli intelligence agents, working for Mossad, the equivalent of MI6 or the CIA.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.heraldscotland.com/five-israelis-were-seen-filming-as-jet-liners-ploughed-into-the-twin-towers-on-september-11-2001-1.829220">http://www.heraldscotland.com/five-israelis-were-seen-filming-as-jet-liners-ploughed-into-the-twin-towers-on-september-11-2001-1.829220</a></p>

<p>The official FBI report on the arrest of these five Israeli nationals can be found here:-</p>

<p><a href="http://www.takeourworldback.com/dancingisraelisfbireport.htm#transcripts">http://www.takeourworldback.com/dancingisraelisfbireport.htm#transcripts</a></p>

<p>But some choice excerpts include:-</p>

<p><strong>Explosives traces, &quot;positive result&quot; yielded by &quot;trained bomb-sniffing dog&quot;, Sivan and Paul Kurzberg / Ellner / Shmuel / Marmari / Urban Moving Systems white van.</strong></p>

<p>and...</p>

<p><strong>Israelis, &quot;visibly happy on nearly all&quot; of the photographs.</strong></p>

<p>and...</p>

<p><strong>Urban Moving Systems, a &quot;possible fraudulent operation&quot; that exhibited &quot;little evidence of a legitimate business operation.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>and...</p>

<p><strong>Urban Moving Systems, Israeli nationals&#39; unscheduled trip to vicinity of the &quot;Flight 93&quot; crash site in the early hours of 9/11.</strong></p>

<p>So I suppose the question is still why you ignored those facts? And I suppose the answer is still because you are here to purposefully spread disinformation on behalf of a third party.</p>

<p>9/11 encapsulated.  The actor who mentions &#39;the fix&#39; is a British actor called Patrick Malahide. Samuel L Jackson is the actor, that I can relate to aspects of 9/11, literally more than any other actor. A Time To Kill, Die Hard 3 and The Long Kiss Goodnight all contain ciphers/subliminal programming relating to 9/11.</p>

<p>Just one example of many, they&#39;ve been brainwashing entire societies and populations with these ongoing methods! This is just the tip of a huge iceberg.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks so much for joining us here--I have your book and keep track of your articles...You are definitely one of my favorite researchers/authors...</p>

<p>I wish there was more info on the exact improvements made when WTC 7 was upgraded to accommodate Salomon Brothers (from wikipedia): </p>

<ul>
<li>...more than 350 tons (U.S.) of steel were added to construct three double-height trading floors. Nine diesel generators were installed on the 5th floor as part of a backup power station. &quot;Essentially, Salomon is constructing a building within a building – and it&#39;s an occupied building, which complicates the situation&quot;, said a district manager of Silverstein Properties. The unusual task was possible, said Larry Silverstein, because it was designed to allow for &quot;entire portions of floors to be removed without affecting the building&#39;s structural integrity, on the assumption that someone might need double-height floors.&quot;[34] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_World_Trade_Center">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_World_Trade_Center</a></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p>It just seems like the floors with the additions would have behaved much differently than the other floors during a &quot;natural&quot; collapse--the upgraded floors were &quot;A CAGE WITHIN A CAGE.&quot;</p>

<p>The only other info is from a <em>New York Times</em> article...Any comments?</p>

<p>from assuredlyathrowaway&#39;s account last Saturday (is he a mod here? if not I&#39;ll rescind this comment):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are some very suspect dealings with which ae911truth has been involved; including but not limited to, overlap between their board of directors and the owners of certain alternative news sites, attempting to project panda a user who brought forth evidence of their monetary collusion, and continued attempts to bully AMA guests on this sub that do not agree with their narrative.
They are more than suspect in my eyes, and very much use subtle influence to advance their agenda; all hallmarks of some type of black op imo.</p>

Conversely, any idea why Putin has taken such a quiet and passive approach to 9/11?  Did Western security services (or the 9/11 faction(s) within them) soil his hands in advance, much like OK City seems to have been an operation to soil &amp; silence Bill Clinton in advance of 9/11?</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for all your diligent work investigating and exposing the cover-up and the suspects behind the crimes of 9/11. Great to have you with us, Mr. Ryan!</p>

<hr/>

<p>My first question concerns an aspect of 9/11 that, although iconic for the day, received little to no attention both from FEMA &amp; NIST <em>and</em> independent investigators: the &quot;dramatic&quot; (FEMA) South Tower fireball(s). </p>

<p>One popular criticism of A&amp;E we often encounter is that more chemists have signed the petition than civil engineers and architects have. </p>

<p>Deflagrations and BLEVEs are well-studied phenomena in the context of storage unit, chemical plant and transportation safety, hazard and risk assessment.<sup><a href="https://books.google.de/books?id=73M6aqqy-uUC&amp;amp;dq=fireball+diameter&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s">[1]</a>,</sup> <sup><a href="https://books.google.de/books?id=ARIOBAAAQBAJ&amp;amp;dq=fireball+diameter&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s">[2]</a></sup> </p>

<p>Lihou/Maund, Fay/Lewis, Hasegawa/Soto, Moorhouse/Pritchard, Hardee/Lee, Dorofeev et al, and many others have empirically correlated fireball diameter, duration and rise height with initial fuel mass with good predictiveness<sup><a href="http://www.academia.edu/4762254/Fireballs_from_deflagration_and_detonation_of_heterogeneous_fuel-rich_clouds">[3]</a></sup> (mostly in the form <em>D</em> = <em>k</em> × <em>m</em> <sup><em>n</em></sup> , where n mostly ~1/3 and k depending on the fuel).</p>

<p>Instead, Baum/Rehm&#39;s &quot;Simple Model&quot;, investigating only the first 2.5 seconds, proposes a completely different model (correlating expansion velocity, which all other researchers explicitly treat as constant, with the fuel mass) to conclude that 1500kg is a reasonable lower bound estimate for the amount of kerosene needed for the fireball (Prof. Quintiere raises similar concerns about the novel approach).<sup><a href="http://fire.nist.gov/bfrlpubs/fire05/PDF/f05179.pdf">[4]</a></sup> FEMA estimates 3000-10000 kg, NIST 4500 kg.</p>

<p>To my knowledge, only Karl Moor gives a &quot;truther&quot; estimate (from the diameter of the burnt-out soot cloud) and arrives at ~13800 kg, and indeed, a lower bound estimate of ~15000 kg seems to be more realistic, if a fireball diameter of ~130 m is assumed and Lihou/Maunds 6.2m<sup>0.32</sup> approximation used. That raises the suspicion NIST deliberately tried to obscure the true nature of the fireball, especially since their simulations indicated that 17% of the jet fuel would have landed outside the building from residual momentum and mechanical deflection <em>alone</em>.<sup><a href="http://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=101428">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>Do you think independent analysis of the fireball could help answer the question whether UA175 (hijacked by, let&#39;s say, &quot;MKULTRAed&quot; suicide patsys) or a drone hit WTC2?</p>

<hr/>

<p>My second question is more speculative in nature, but shorter: overall, do you get the impression that 9/11 went according to plan, or that it was botched (or even sabotaged by dissenters/rivals from within the circles of power) and what we saw was more a &quot;save&quot;/&quot;Plan B&quot;/&quot;9/11 light edition&quot; of what <em>should</em> have been even <em>more</em> &quot;awe-inspiring&quot;, devious and obscure, and <em>less</em> suspicious / self-contradictory / &quot;easily&quot; proven a stage magic trick? </p>

<p>I ask because I often find myself wondering how the masterminds could be so sure they would be able to sell Bazants Laws of Motion and Nistonian physics - if they simply didn&#39;t care, or if the psychology of &quot;mass hypnosis induction by shock&quot; is truly that well-tested and true.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine">[6]</a></sup></p>

<p>A third question: since 9/11 affected not only the U.S. - triggering NATOs first (and, so far, only) <em>casus foederis</em> (Art. 5)<sup><a href="http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_110496.htm">[7]</a>,</sup> thus compromising all allies as well - shouldn&#39;t the adjective &quot;international&quot; not be, by standard, an indispensable part of the call for a new, independent investigation of 9/11?<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160206030003/http:/www.htmlpublish.com/newTestDocStorage/DocStorage/cb75341e28cd45ebacc78af9bed0d4f6/SSRN-id2713267.htm">[8]</a></sup></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like this passage from your latest <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2016/02/investigating-911.html">article</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;It also helps to interview people who have detailed knowledge about the events. Most of the people who were present at the time of the attacks and during the official investigations are still alive and some of them will answer questions.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there anyone in particular you&#39;d like to see interviewed that hasn&#39;t been yet, or who you think could be pushed further with pointed questions?  I&#39;m thinking the teacher or staff at the Sarasota Booker Elementary school, the author of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pet_Goat">The  Pet Goat</a>, The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7OCgMPX2mE">firefighter</a> who famously stood next to Bush, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcq3YFq55n8">Max Cleland</a>, Steven Hatfill, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OBOnjK2_gs">Maret Tsarnaev</a> to name a few.  Hopefully more intrepid journalists like Luke Rudkowski find a way to get these guys on the record if they have anything they&#39;d like to say contrary to the official version of events.</p>

<p>Clouds of hot dust.  </p>

<hr/>

<p>“Then the dust cloud hits us. Then it got real hot. It felt like it was going to light up almost.” -Thomas Spinard, FDNY Engine 7  </p>

<p>“A wave — a hot, solid, black wave of heat threw me down the block.” – David Handschuh, New York’s Daily News  </p>

<p>“When I was running, some hot stuff went down by back, because I didn’t have time to put my coat back on, and I had some — well, I guess between first and second degree burns on my back.” -Marcel Claes, FDNY Firefighter  </p>

<p>“And then we’re engulfed in the smoke, which was horrendous. One thing I remember, it was hot. The smoke was hot and that scared me” -Paramedic Manuel Delgado “I remember making it into the tunnel and it was this incredible amount of wind, debris, heat….” -Brian Fitzpatrick FDNY Firefighter  </p>

<p>“A huge, huge blast of hot wind gusting and smoke and dust and all kinds of debris hit me” -Firefighter Louis Giaconelli  </p>

<p>“This super-hot wind blew and it just got dark as night and you couldn’t breathe” -Firefighter Todd Heaney / Quotes compiled from Kevin Ryan&#39;s blog. “When I get to the rig, about half a block down West Street, the building came down. It is the most amazing thing I have ever seen in my life.  </p>

<p>At first I look up and I hear a boom and a strange noise. I can&#39;t really describe it […] We hold each other, and then we get engulfed in that cloud right away. And we don&#39;t know what it is. It is such a weird color, and we don&#39;t know if it is going to light up or not. It is very hot.
138 We are in front of 90 West Street, just across the street from the south tower, and we really try to outrun it, but the cloud hits us so fast that we cannot run anymore.” - Battalion Chief Tom Vallebuona, Battalion 21, in Dennis Smith&#39;s Report from Ground Zero, Ibid., p. 123.   </p>

<p>“[T]he second building is starting to come apart. […] We run across the street back towards the World Financial Center and get to those big floor-level windows. Luckily for us the glass had been knocked out when the first building came down, so we [were able to] jump into the [lobby] and hide behind a large column just in the interior. But with all the windows out, it is like a large, open garage space. Then, hiding behind this column, my arms crossed like a mummy, I begin to feel the power of all the debris and rubble rushing past. And there is a great deafening noise. It feels like the world is falling apart. If you&#39;ve ever been at a demolition site, where you hear a building coming down, if you magnify that by a hundred or a thousand, it might have given you a good idea [of the sound]. So I stay pressed against the column, and first I feel a positive wave of energy go by, and then a negative pressure because it is creating a vacuum, and I am hoping that it doesn&#39;t suck me out. And then I can&#39;t breathe. I try to put my mask on, and then there is a tremendous amount of heat, but it only lasts for a minute before everything goes black.” - Firefighter Phil McArdle, Hazmat Unit 1S in Dennis Smith, Ibid., p. 119.

    <div class="md"><p>(1) Considering the evidence of &quot;long-game&quot; strategy preceding 9/11, should we not also take pause in considering long-game strategy <em>post-9/11</em>?  Specifically a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Could there have been &quot;long-game&quot; intent with the 28 pages?  How much of the 28 pages is a designated failsafe; not merely a limited hangout, but a trap?  I&#39;m aware of your writing on why Saudi involvement equals U.S. involvement.  But considering your work on Graham/Goss, which I find myself linking to frequently to rebut Graham&#39;s many credulous fans, could the 28 pages have been crafted/controlled as (among other reasons) a honeypot to intentionally jump-start &amp; manipulate an HSCA-style &quot;re-investigation&quot; into 9/11, not only as a &quot;centerpiece misdirect&quot; but as a momentum-killer for other spectacular leads?  Why wouldn&#39;t we anticipate that the example of 1977&#39;s HSCA would be on the minds of &quot;inside job&quot; participants as an example to be feared/learned from, as well as an opportunity, in leveraging a seemingly-inevitable &quot;opposition party&quot; re-investigation?</p></li>
<li><p>In another example of 9/11 &quot;long-game strategy,&quot; your colleague &amp; co-editor of Journal of 9/11 Studies, Graeme MacQueen, has pointed out the case of Gloria Irish, which seems to suggest a wider long-game plot, but more specifically a failed attempt to link the alleged hijackers with &quot;WMD&quot; toward an Iraq War justification.  Are there any other such glimpses of &quot;plan failure&quot; on (or surrounding) 9/11?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>(2)  Would you consider doing a &quot;Where Are They Now?&quot; piece on the suspects, in light of the significance of their long-game patterns of behavior?</p>

<p>(3)  Feel free not to answer any of the rest of these, because these questions are going into speculation here/into-the-fringe here:  How long do you entertain the possibility of 9/11 long game to have been?  Do you see evidentiary, strategic, or overall interrelated links between 9/11 &amp; &quot;Deep State Events&quot; from other decades, such as Iran-Contra or OK City?  In light of the many German connections to 9/11 (and other Deep State Events), are you aware of the <a href="http://spitfirelist.com/for-the-record/ftr-456-compendium-on-nazi-and-fascist-connections-to-911/">Hitler &quot;Amerikabomber&quot; and Nazi links to the specific date of &quot;9/11&quot;</a> (#2a, 42)?

<p>Book Discussion on The Presidential Recordings: The editors talked about <em>The Presidential Recordings: John F. Kennedy, Volumes 1-3, The Great Crises</em>, published by W.W. Norton. More than a dozen scholars, led by the editorial team, transcribed and edited thousands of hours of White House meetings secretly taped by Presidents Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon. The general editors and director of the project discussed the history of these tapes, their significance, the process of deciphering and transcribing them and the recent publication of the first three volumes of the Kennedy tapes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well there&#39;s always the story of the FBI giving their &#39;stooge&#39; detonators for the &#39;93 attack.  How come you don&#39;t know about that?</p>

<p>Found this post from 2004 and just by simply doing an ad-hoc search...I&#39;ve known about this &#39;93 aspect for years.</p>

<p>Quote:</p>

<p>Okay, for quick confirmation about the US supplying the bomb that blew up in the WTC in 1993 go to the New York times, get into thier archives and look for Oct.28,1993 and again on Oct.31, 1993 or You can go to the Chicago Tribune Dec 15 1993. Those front page articles all cover this.</p>

<p>What happenned was the FBI hired a 43 year old retired Egyptian military officer named Ahmad Salem to recruit a group to destroy the WTC. They paid him 1 Million dollars for the job. They also supplied the bomb material and detonators. At one point Salem got suspicous and asked the FBI why they were giving him a real bomb if it was to be just a sting operation. They told him not to worry and to let the operation go forward. At that point he got suspicous and began recording all conversations with them. He ended up secretly recording the head of the FBI in New York ordering him to let the bombing happen.</p>

<p>Transcripts of some of those recordings are in the Times and the Tribune. When You get right down to it, it was the Federal Govt. that wanted those buildings destroyed cause it was thier idea, thier bomb and thier money that paid for the whole dammed thing. They even recruited the head guy to do the job. Now this has all been in the papers and I have to ask, where is the outrage of the people?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read this guy&#39;s stuff and seen some of him on video, but if he doesn&#39;t know/won&#39;t address the prior WTC attacks and how the obvious hand of the Feds guided their terrorist puppets, it makes him a non-entity to me. Thank you for pointing this out. </p>

<p>Part of the plot of the film:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Disgusted at the world, Morlar has caused two recent disasters: an airliner crash into a London office tower...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This 1978 film was produced by the brilliant movie producer Arnon Milchan (who incidentally revealed recently that he is/was an Israeli intelligence asset). He went on to produce <em>Brazil</em> (1985), a film about false-flag terrorism committed by an authoritarian first-world government in order to justify enacting police-state surveillence conditions, and Milchan also produced <em>Fight Club</em> (1999) where he was personally responsible for changing the ending of the book to include the demolition of skyscrapers housing financial companies.</p>

<p>I noticed you mentioned Ridley Scott&#39;s Legend.</p>

<p>As for Tony (Ridley&#39;s brother)...I&#39;ve covered him extensively.  His film Beverly Hills Cop II has major events that occur on Sept 11th including airline flights listed for that day. His Enemy of the State has a Sept 11th birth reference, followed by a building (where the Sept 11th reference is made) which then blows-up and collapses &#39;wtc style&#39;. I wonder if he killed himself out of guilt for what he was doing to the masses?</p>

<p>The brothers are and were great propagandists for the elite.
Move along, nothing to see here.</p>

<p>This is so easy for me...it is like shelling peas.  It&#39;s easy, when you work out how mass mind control operates and functions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Neocons planned and executed the attacks of 9/11 with the help of a subgroup within the Pentagon, MI6, Mossad and the Saudi monarchy.</p>

<p>The level of willful ignorance and shameless apathy is mind-boggling.</p>

<p>Moreover, there is so much misinformation and disinformation put out by the corporate media and on the internet.</p>

<p>i&#39;ve done a lot of the time-consuming work of vetting the evidence for you already.</p>

<p>All you have to do is Look, Listen and Learn.</p>

<p>Let us speak to the facts and allow the facts to speak for themselves. </p>

<p>If you have evidence to the contrary, then bring it forward for all to see so that we can learn together.</p>

<p>Sometimes people hold a core belief that is very strong. When they are presented with evidence that works against that belief, the new evidence cannot be accepted.
It would create a feeling that is extremely uncomfortable, called cognitive dissonance.
And because it is so important to protect the core belief, they will rationalize, ignore and even deny anything that doesn&#39;t fit in with the core belief.</p>

In particular, you mention the <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02786820490250836">Analysis of Aerosols from the World Trade Center Collapse Site, New York, October 2 to October 30, 2001</a> paper. In this paper, a quote reads:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The concentrations of very fine silicon, sulfur, and many metals, as well as coarse anthropogenic metals, decreased markedly during October, probably in association with the cooling of the collapse piles. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems to corroborate the statement in your paper:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The occurrence of such extreme, sharp spikes in VOCs in air at GZ indicate something other than the behavior of a typical structure fire. Oxygen influx as a result of shifting of materials within the pile might have created an increase in combustion of material in localized areas. But these spikes in VOCs, at levels thousands of times higher than seen in other structure fires, suggest extremely violent but short-lived fire events. Probably the most striking spike in toxic air emissions, found in EPA monitoring data, occurred on 9th February, 2002. Note (Table 1 ) that this was nearly 5 months after 9/11, and after nearly all the debris had been cleared from GZ. In fact, the levels of some species, like toluene and styrene, were some of the highest observed at the site. But the levels of benzene and propylene detected on that day were far above previous measurements, at 610,000 and 990,000 ppb, respectively. Other VOCs were measured at their peak levels on this date, including 1,3-butadiene at 400,000 ppb.&quot; &quot;EPA also monitored very fine particulate matter (PM) and other sizes of PM. PM is probably the most reliable indicator for the activity of structure fires, as such fires are generally known to burn incompletely, and produce PM that drifts up and outward from the source. EPA data from the West Broadway sampling site, the location closest to GZ where PM was monitored, show the following trend in very fine PM (PM 2.5 , or all particles \ 2.5 l m) in October and November 2001 (Fig. 4 ). These data show that the peaks in levels of very fine PM near GZ correspond to different dates than the peaks for the previously discussed combustion products. The five stron- gest peaks in PM 2.5 levels are centered on 23th, 26th September, and 3rd, 10th, 20th October, closer in time to the events of 9/11. None of these dates correspond to the dates of five peaks in VOCs noted above. Additionally, it is clear that the levels of PM 2.5 emissions rose more gradu- ally, and died down more gradually, indicating slower fire dynamics as might be expected from the burning of the organic materials previously thought to exist in the WTC. <strong>These data suggest that the greatest level of fire activity, associated solely with the typical fuel sources expected in the WTC, was completed by the third week of October. That is, the materials expected to burn (incompletely) in a structure fire, producing PM, were largely burned off by mid- to late-October. Therefore, the extreme spikes in air concentrations of the five VOCs noted above, particularly on 3rd, 8th November, and 9th February, point not to other sources of typical combustible materials but to other forms of com- bustion. Such forms of combustion appear to be violent and short-lived, and thus similar to the effects of energetic materials, like thermite&quot;</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to know more about the UPS battery rooms that were in all three towers apparently. Here are my findings:</p>

<ul>
<li>UPS batteries were installed on the 81st floor of WTC2 in 1999, just 2 years prior to 9/11.</li>
<li>The 9/11 commission report notes sulfur as the cause of steel corrosion. Thermite doesn&#39;t use sulfur. However, batteries contain <em>sulfuric acid</em> which is corrosive.</li>
<li>The NIST report blames it on fires sustained by office equipment. UPS batteries are considered office equipment.</li>
<li>These batteries can short out, create an electrical arc, explode and cause chemical fires.</li>
<li>It is said the batteries could have weighed a sum of 48,000 lbs. For comparison a Boeing 747 carries a max of about 379,000 lbs of jet fuel.</li>
<li>The floor had truss work done to specifically support the heavier than normal weight of these batteries.</li>
<li>&quot;Molten metal&quot; was seen pouring out the side of the building. This was on the exact floor or one floor below 81 which is where the batteries were located in WTC2.</li>
<li>&quot;Molten metal&quot; was found at the bottom of elevator shafts. Could have been 48,000 lbs of battery acid that leaked on floor 81 and found its way to ground level via the shafts.</li>
<li>Sulfur reacts with water. Sprinkler system could have fueled it.</li>
<li>NIST has admitted to the UPS batteries being there. Prior confusion may have obscured this with the United Parcel Service (UPS).</li>
<li>In the 1993 WTC bombing, guess what the rental van was loaded with? Urea, nitric acid and <em>60 gallons of sulfuric acid</em>.</li>
<li>I was watching some random footage of ground zero, when to my shock and surprise a guy popped up on camera claiming he was just on the 81st floor and able to escape. His name is Mike Benfante aka the &quot;reluctant hero&quot; who claims to have wheeled a lady to the bottom with his coworker and also did two camera interviews right afterwards. VERY suspicious. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g11nNUqMcro&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=16m10s">video</a></li>

Dr. Wood is a forensic engineer and scientist. Dr. Wood conducts research and writes reports. That is what Dr. Wood does. Dr. Wood does not have a dog in this fight.</p>

<p>Mr. Ryan - What is the iron content of these samples? This is a rhetorical question so if you ignore it that would be a proper reaction.</p>

<p>The USGS values for the samples collected under the big dust cloud weren’t reported. Why? See Fgure 339 (a) (b) and Figure 340 (a) (b), page 324 of WHERE DID THE TOWERS GO?.</p>

<p>However, you must understand that what the USGS DID report in collected dust were biased samples. A lot of the material went up into the atmosphere, down the eastern seaboard, and wafted away. That dust wasn’t presented as a data sample in the USGS study. So, their study is bias. See Figure 337, page 323 of WHERE DID THE TOWERS GO?.</p>

<p>Note the caption to Figure 1 on this page:</p>

<p><a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2001/ofr-01-0429/spectra/index.html">http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2001/ofr-01-0429/spectra/index.html</a></p>

<p>“RS Figure 1. Surface sample collection locations in lower Manhattan Sept 17 - 19th, 2001.”</p>

<p>The USGS didn’t collect the dust samples until about a week later – AFTER it had rained about 2 inches (the back side of Hurricane Erin) and AFTER they had hosed down the streets. (Rain values are shown in the Glossary table in the back of WHERE DID THE TOWERS GO?.)</p>

<p>I read WHERE DID THE TOWERS GO? five years ago and know when someone is posting disinformation. If someone has not read WHERE DID THE TOWERS GO?, they have no standing to dispute it. ;-) ♥</p>

But rest-assured, none of it disappeared,, it was just blasted apart, even pulverized (for example virtually no macroscopic pieces of concrete could be found at GZ. That doesnt mean it wasnt there,, it had, for the most part, been converted into dust. Each of the buildings left a 1200&#39; radial debris field, as per FEMA.  </p>

<p>Nuclear weapons would have left very discernible traces of radiation, which were not present at GZ. So why would anyone think they were used?  </p>

<p>Things are often other than they appear.  The claim that <a href="https://ajl.smugmug.com/911/The-Pentagon/">No Boeing hit the Pentagon</a> is a perfect example. It&#39;s always good to remember that even though they are often the same they are not necessarily so: the way a thing appears vs the way it actually is, or was. </p>

whose words are those?  </p>

<p>-Oh are you referring to my opening line?  That&#39;s just a law of physics that matter/energy can only change form.. So if you have an intact structure and blow it to smithereens.. it may appear to have disappeared,, but we know that&#39;s not possible, right? Things dont disappear.. So it was all there. I dont really blame you for not thinking so though.. those were absolutely massive structures and they were shredded by very powerful, very systematically place explosives. We can see this when we study the slips of their destruction:</p>

<p>South Tower:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said all the things on your bullet list could be seen in that pic,, or were even present intact. Quite the opposite. </p>

<p>I said just bc we cannot see something in a photo doesnt mean it wasnt there and certainly if it was blasted to small bits we would not be able to identity them. Obviously youre not arguing they disappeared, right?  So I dont see where you should find any conflict with my comment.</p>

<p>The only thing i mentioned was the core columns.  I wrote: &quot;For example in this large res image you can see core columns that have been put in waiting barges on the Hudson.&quot; And you can. Just look at the image full size. I would never claim all those things in your list could be seen in the pictures. I was pointing out the absurdity of saying the doorknobs are missing. 
Heck, most of them couldnt even be found at the site,, they were so violently blasted apart. 
Richard Gage told the story once of the man whose company provided the corrugated metal decking (these were made of I think it was 18 or 20 gauge steel) that was used on every floor of the towers. He was down there at the site, at ground zero, looking for those and could not find any of them!  which is why i wrote, all but the most robust (as in steel columns) elements in the buildings were blasted into bits so small there were either unrecognizable or pulverized.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok, so my point is: thermite wouldn&#39;t do that. conventional explosives wouldn&#39;t do that. but a thermonuclear demolition would. (and, ok, a mysterious disintegration device could too, but there are many other problems with that hypothesis.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Certainly not traditional thermite, however <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/theories/thermitetech.html">thermitic nanocomposites</a> can be engineered to have the properties of high explosives. 
see also: <a href="https://str.llnl.gov/str/RSimpson.html">https://str.llnl.gov/str/RSimpson.html</a></p>

<p>The military also has all kinds of explosives lay people are not familiar with. The evidence seems to suggest more than one kind of material was used bc for example, we can see thermite at work <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SD2DBUJl0OM&amp;amp;list=UUSvrNB1pHmW4C5vpv-1BgUA">here in this clip</a>, with molten metal pouring out of the South Tower just below the point where a few moments later the building starts to come apart.</p>

<p>The explosive demolition that followed could have been the result of anything from an explosive mixture of thermite, to a high explosive aerosol (This is pure speculation of course) which leaves no trace and would explain its being so uniformly dispersed throughout the building which were aside from their vents, were hermetically sealed structures. This made the explosive energy even greater. Or it could have been something else we dont know about. But that explosives were used is without a doubt.</p>

<p>I think we can discount any kind of thermonuclear device bc it would have left very telltale signs of radiation, which was not present. I dont think he ignored it. We dont have a solid hypothesis for it. We know the thermite was present bc it&#39;s been documented 5 different ways, but that certainly does not mean other explosives were not involved and no one would argue this point. We have to go with strongest hypothesis but that doesnt mean there is a lot we do not know and may never know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I ask you a sincere question because you made an extraordinary claim, and that&#39;s how you answer? dont be obtuse?  How about instead of attacking me, you defend your position?</p>

<p>if that is your conclusion I imagine you have very good reasons for it. Dont assume that bc it may be obvious to you that we&#39;re all on the same page. Make a cogent argument. Aren&#39;t you here to share knowledge and learn?</p>

<p>I downloaded the files you linked and went right to page 131 where he describes &#39;mini-nukes&#39; -Of course I need to study the material further, but I think I read already that he postulates one device had been planted in the basement of each building. If this were true we would not have seen the synchronized top-down destruction the videos reveal the lower portions were subjected to.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve gone through them all (videos) frame by frame on professional video editing equipment. I can safely say the top sections were destroyed first, from the point of impact upwards at about the same rate as they were falling. This is very difficult to see watch the videos at full speed but that&#39;s why the toop sections seem to just disappear into clouds of smoke. </p>

<p>My guess is that the tops were destroyed first in this manner, in an effort to create a curtain of debris behind which to hide the demolition of the lower, as of yet fully intact, portions of the buildings. </p>

<p>Forensic video analysis done by a number of experts (see Journal of 911 Studies) clocks the destruction of the lower portions at about 64% the rate of freefall.. so nearly 40% slower than the debris from the top sections would be falling. Of course they failed miserably bc the tower were so tall.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hS--jU8DWUI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hS--jU8DWUI</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mT9Jt85SW38">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mT9Jt85SW38</a></p>

<p>But the demolition wave that tore through them, was very systematic and obvious. This can be seen in the videos and numerous of first-responders interviewed for the Oral Histories describe precisely that. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0Bu-0-eKJI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0Bu-0-eKJI</a> </p>

<p>The symmetry, speed and explosiveness all give it away. </p>

<p>How could a single explosive devise in the basement account for that? Dont all nuclear devices leave radiation behind?</p>

<p>Please, if you can&#39;t have a civil and intelligent conversation without calling me names or even defend your claims,, let&#39;s not bother. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry for writing this so far after the fact.</p>

<p>The facade---the overall placement of the buildings, the style and the vision.  It was created by a Japanese guy who loved Islamic architecture.  No doubt he was a freemason as well. Everything about WTC was symbolic.  The two towers represented Jachim and Boaz, making the WTC a reference to freemasonry, specifically &#39;shriners&#39; (islam in masonry), played off as &#39;the parapets surrounding kaaba&#39;--but that&#39;s misdirection.  </p>

<p>WTC&#39;s destruction is a phoenix theme, a foreboding of the destruction of the current and rebuilding of solomon&#39;s temple in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s what they are up to.  And why the elite are so gay for israel.. they want access and the means to rebuild temple of solomon while the world is destroyed or do one then the other.</p>
