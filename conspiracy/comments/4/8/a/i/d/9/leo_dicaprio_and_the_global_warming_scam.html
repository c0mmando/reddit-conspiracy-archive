       Here's my rant:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) His performance wasn't deserving of an Oscar. The movie itself was Oscar material, but not his performance by itself. He got it because he's a whiny bitch and people were tired of hearing about him not winning an Oscar. Now he can stfu and go away. And maybe he will start acting for the sake of doing it right instead of acting in order to try to get an award.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Pretty douchey of him to make it about a political scam. Seriously. How slimy can you get? He gets an award of a lifetime for being an ACTOR from the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts, and he stands there making political statements about pseudo-science and bald faced lies. In front of the whole world. He's lying and he knows it and the whole world knows it. Sad really. What a way to degrade the value of what should be a personal and professional honor.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Every time an alarmist says "climate change is real", everyone goes "right, sure, uh hunh". Just having to say it out loud reminds everyone how much of a scam it really is. If you have to defend it every time you open your mouth, it can't possibly be settled or generally believed. Much akin to Richard Nixons "I am not a crook". Yes buddy, we all know that you're a crook. Thanks for reminding us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dicaprio is a winner and a loser all at once. LOL.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I do congratulate him. Too bad he had to fuck up the acceptance so badly. I hope he can enjoy and appreciate what the award really means some time before he meets his maker. Then he might understand what hubris means.

       Regardless of what the truth is about climate change and what people feel about it, we all have to agree on one thing:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Guys with giant yachts who fly around on private planes should probably put their money and their actions where their mouths are.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So sick of people with private planes, yachts, and large gas-guzzling Black Caddie limo entourages lecturing poor people who do nothing but work, eat, and sleep to reduce their carbon footprint. Give me a fucking break. How 'bout you go to Flint and help people get some clean water or something? Or cut down your own "carbon footprint"?

       Not mad at all. People like Leo need to be called out. Even though their constant refrain of "climate change is real" does enough damage by itself without my input. But we do need to point out the obvious and hammer it home once in a while.

       Well yeah, the climate changes, always has and always will. it is most definitely real. Just, CO2 has very little to do with it. And restricting CO2 emissions is utterly pointless.

       I honestly haven't seen a single good reason to reject the scientific consensus that humans cause global warming. No doubt that fact is being used maliciously by malevolent powers, but it seems legit to me

       The United Nations IPCC is a political panel. Scientists do not write their reports.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are a few quotes:
      </p>
      <p>
       Quote by Chris Folland of UK Meteorological Office: “The data don't matter. We're not basing our recommendations [for reductions in carbon dioxide emissions] upon the data. We're basing them upon the climate models.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Quote by David Frame, climate modeler, Oxford University: “Rather than seeing models as describing literal truth, we ought to see them as convenient fictions which try to provide something useful.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Quote by Christine Stewart, former Canadian Environment Minister: “No matter if the science is all phoney, there are collateral environmental benefits.... climate change [provides] the greatest chance to bring about justice and equality in the world.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Quote by Timoth Wirth, U.S./UN functionary, former elected Democrat Senator: “We’ve got to ride the global-warming issue. Even if the theory of global warming is wrong, we will be doing the right thing in terms of economic policy and environmental policy.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Quote by Richard Benedik, former U.S./UN bureaucrat: "A global climate treaty must be implemented even if there is no scientific evidence to back the greenhouse effect."
      </p>
      <p>
       Quote from the UN's Own "Agenda 21": "Effective execution of Agenda 21 will require a profound reorientation of all human society, unlike anything the world has ever experienced a major shift in the priorities of both governments and individuals and an unprecedented redeployment of human and financial resources. This shift will demand that a concern for the environmental consequences of every human action be integrated into individual and collective decision-making at every level."
      </p>
      <p>
       Quote by Ottmar Edenhoffer, high level UN-IPCC official:  "We redistribute de facto the world's wealth by climate policy...Basically it's a big mistake to discuss climate policy separately from the major themes of globalization...One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with environmental policy anymore."
      </p>
      <p>
       Quote by Naomi Klein, anti-capitalism, pro-hysteria advocate of global warming: "So the need for another economic model is urgent, and if the climate justice movement can show that responding to climate change is the best chance for a more just economic system..."
      </p>
      <p>
       Quote by Club of Rome: "In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill....All these dangers are caused by human intervention....and thus the “real enemy, then, is humanity itself....believe humanity requires a common motivation, namely a common adversary in order to realize world government. It does not matter if this common enemy is “a real one or….one invented for the purpose."
      </p>
      <p>
       Quote by Dixy Lee Ray, former liberal Democrat governor of State of Washington, U.S.: "The objective, clearly enunciated by the leaders of UNCED, is to bring about a change in the present system of independent nations. The future is to be World Government with central planning by the United Nations. Fear of environmental crises - whether real or not - is expected to lead to – compliance”
      </p>
      <p>
       Quote by UN's Commission on Global Governance: "The concept of national sovereignty has been immutable, indeed a sacred principle of international relations. It is a principle which will yield only slowly and reluctantly to the new imperatives of global environmental cooperation."

       Are those climate scientists? I know there's a ton of engineering Phds who are young earth creationists. That doesn't mean they're right or count as an expert opinion. Regardless, raw numbers don't really mean anything here because there are so many scientists. What's the proportion? I've heard that it's &lt;10% of climate scientists are deniers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry but those graphs aren't really demonstrating anything to me. I know a fair bit about data and graphs, but nothing about climate so I can't hope to interpret them.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the quotes? I dunno- what they're saying doesn't sound like a conspiracy to me. It's sounds like a bunch of out of context quotes. And, like I said, no doubt people are using the fact of climate change to push their agendas. This doesn't mean that climate change is a lie

       And considering that the claim is that the entire planet is doomed and we have to completely decarbonize the economy and give the UN nearly a trillion dollars to somehow fix the problem, you'd think that you would want to put a little effort in to make sure it isn't what it appears to be by my post. I mean, due diligence dude. You gotta do your due diligence.

       But how can scientific concensus be a hoax? I'm entirely open to the possibility that they are well-meaning, but wrong. But to say that it's nothing but a conspiracy to empower the UN? Seems farfetched to me.

       There are just as many political motives to deny climate change.

       Two major claims of consensus. Naomi Oreskes and John Cook. Both crap science claims of a consensus. Fudged, cherry picked, statistically fraudulent, crap. Then the MSM ran off with many headlines claiming a consensus. These "studies" were so bad that Cook had one of his papers actually retracted. Do you know how rare and how bad it is to have a paper retracted?

       Edward Teller. The most highly respected physicist on the planet, possibly of all time. I would tend to lean towards listening to what he says when it comes to physics, because in the end, climate change is absolutely entirely rooted in the physics of heat transfer.

       One of the original 97% or 98% consensus claims were based on polling something like 78 actual "scientists" all of whom claimed to be climate scientists.

       LOL.

       So out of the million scientists in America, as you claim, if we were to apply this number to a simple calculation, that comes out to a .0078% consensus. LOL. I know that that's bogus, but that sure is funny. Don't you think?

       They describe the methodology of the study very differently here. They also provide some interesting statistics. Not a single peer reviewed paper that denies man-caused climate change? Sounds like a consensus to me.

       No one "denies" that man hasn't had some impact on the climate. But that means very little. What is important is whether or not man has impacted climate to more than a tiny degree. If the amount of impact is barely measurable or even immeasurable, then we need not waste any resources on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the wording used is exceedingly important and those putting the poll together and reporting on the poll did so in a less than honest manner.

       These Jews who run Hollywood, are not Jews per se (in the sense that most understand), see Michael Tsarion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term Juda means the "shining" or "illustrious ones." It refers to the members of the Gaonim, or the Cult of Aton, and not to some black-robe-wearing priestarchy. It refers to the eighteenth dynasty Sun Cult pharaohs of Egypt whose descendants hide under the names "Israelite" and"Judite." So when we hear that “David” and “Solomon” (whom we now know as Tuthmosis III and Amenhotep III) were of the "House of Judah" we understand that it was a reference not to the Semites, or the Levites and their ethnicity and theology, but to Egypt's Solar Cult and their theology.
