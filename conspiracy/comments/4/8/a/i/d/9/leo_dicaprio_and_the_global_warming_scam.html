        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here&#39;s my rant:</p>

<p>1) His performance wasn&#39;t deserving of an Oscar. The movie itself was Oscar material, but not his performance by itself. He got it because he&#39;s a whiny bitch and people were tired of hearing about him not winning an Oscar. Now he can stfu and go away. And maybe he will start acting for the sake of doing it right instead of acting in order to try to get an award. </p>

<p>2) Pretty douchey of him to make it about a political scam. Seriously. How slimy can you get? He gets an award of a lifetime for being an ACTOR from the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts, and he stands there making political statements about pseudo-science and bald faced lies. In front of the whole world. He&#39;s lying and he knows it and the whole world knows it. Sad really. What a way to degrade the value of what should be a personal and professional honor. </p>

<p>3) Every time an alarmist says &quot;climate change is real&quot;, everyone goes &quot;right, sure, uh hunh&quot;. Just having to say it out loud reminds everyone how much of a scam it really is. If you have to defend it every time you open your mouth, it can&#39;t possibly be settled or generally believed. Much akin to Richard Nixons &quot;I am not a crook&quot;. Yes buddy, we all know that you&#39;re a crook. Thanks for reminding us. </p>

<p>Dicaprio is a winner and a loser all at once. LOL. </p>

<p>But I do congratulate him. Too bad he had to fuck up the acceptance so badly. I hope he can enjoy and appreciate what the award really means some time before he meets his maker. Then he might understand what hubris means. </p>

<p>CO2 has never ever led temperatures ever, and they are not leading temperatures now:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sciencebits.com/IceCoreTruth">http://www.sciencebits.com/IceCoreTruth</a></p>

<p>The United Nations IPCC is a political panel. Scientists do not write their reports.</p>

<p>Here are a few quotes:</p>

<p>Quote by Chris Folland of UK Meteorological Office: “The data don&#39;t matter. We&#39;re not basing our recommendations [for reductions in carbon dioxide emissions] upon the data. We&#39;re basing them upon the climate models.”</p>

<p>Quote by David Frame, climate modeler, Oxford University: “Rather than seeing models as describing literal truth, we ought to see them as convenient fictions which try to provide something useful.”</p>

<p>Quote by Christine Stewart, former Canadian Environment Minister: “No matter if the science is all phoney, there are collateral environmental benefits.... climate change [provides] the greatest chance to bring about justice and equality in the world.”</p>

<p>Quote by Timoth Wirth, U.S./UN functionary, former elected Democrat Senator: “We’ve got to ride the global-warming issue. Even if the theory of global warming is wrong, we will be doing the right thing in terms of economic policy and environmental policy.”</p>

<p>Quote by Richard Benedik, former U.S./UN bureaucrat: &quot;A global climate treaty must be implemented even if there is no scientific evidence to back the greenhouse effect.&quot;</p>

<p>Quote from the UN&#39;s Own &quot;Agenda 21&quot;: &quot;Effective execution of Agenda 21 will require a profound reorientation of all human society, unlike anything the world has ever experienced a major shift in the priorities of both governments and individuals and an unprecedented redeployment of human and financial resources. This shift will demand that a concern for the environmental consequences of every human action be integrated into individual and collective decision-making at every level.&quot;</p>

<p>Quote by Ottmar Edenhoffer, high level UN-IPCC official:  &quot;We redistribute de facto the world&#39;s wealth by climate policy...Basically it&#39;s a big mistake to discuss climate policy separately from the major themes of globalization...One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with environmental policy anymore.&quot;</p>

<p>Quote by Naomi Klein, anti-capitalism, pro-hysteria advocate of global warming: &quot;So the need for another economic model is urgent, and if the climate justice movement can show that responding to climate change is the best chance for a more just economic system...&quot;</p>

<p>Quote by Club of Rome: &quot;In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill....All these dangers are caused by human intervention....and thus the “real enemy, then, is humanity itself....believe humanity requires a common motivation, namely a common adversary in order to realize world government. It does not matter if this common enemy is “a real one or….one invented for the purpose.&quot;</p>

<p>Quote by Dixy Lee Ray, former liberal Democrat governor of State of Washington, U.S.: &quot;The objective, clearly enunciated by the leaders of UNCED, is to bring about a change in the present system of independent nations. The future is to be World Government with central planning by the United Nations. Fear of environmental crises - whether real or not - is expected to lead to – compliance”</p>

<p>Quote by UN&#39;s Commission on Global Governance: &quot;The concept of national sovereignty has been immutable, indeed a sacred principle of international relations. It is a principle which will yield only slowly and reluctantly to the new imperatives of global environmental cooperation.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are those climate scientists? I know there&#39;s a ton of engineering Phds who are young earth creationists. That doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re right or count as an expert opinion. Regardless, raw numbers don&#39;t really mean anything here because there are so many scientists. What&#39;s the proportion? I&#39;ve heard that it&#39;s &lt;10% of climate scientists are deniers.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry but those graphs aren&#39;t really demonstrating anything to me. I know a fair bit about data and graphs, but nothing about climate so I can&#39;t hope to interpret them.</p>

<p>And the quotes? I dunno- what they&#39;re saying doesn&#39;t sound like a conspiracy to me. It&#39;s sounds like a bunch of out of context quotes. And, like I said, no doubt people are using the fact of climate change to push their agendas. This doesn&#39;t mean that climate change is a lie</p>

<p>The Oregon Petition is full of names of very capable people with advanced degrees in fields not related and closely related to areas of climate, like geology and physics. 31,487 of them. Look at the name on the main page:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.petitionproject.org/">http://www.petitionproject.org/</a></p>

<p>Edward Teller. The most highly respected physicist on the planet, possibly of all time. I would tend to lean towards listening to what he says when it comes to physics, because in the end, climate change is absolutely entirely rooted in the physics of heat transfer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one &quot;denies&quot; that man hasn&#39;t had some impact on the climate. But that means very little. What is important is whether or not man has impacted climate to more than a tiny degree. If the amount of impact is barely measurable or even immeasurable, then we need not waste any resources on it. </p>

<p>So the wording used is exceedingly important and those putting the poll together and reporting on the poll did so in a less than honest manner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s a globalist and part of the 1% and under...that&#39;s all you need to know.  The Oscars are a Judeo-Egyptian (mystery religion) ritual event, the statue itself is a rendering of Ptah/Sokar/Osiris (Sokar, angaram Oskar).</p>

<p>These Jews who run Hollywood, are not Jews per se (in the sense that most understand), see Michael Tsarion.</p>

<p>The term Juda means the &quot;shining&quot; or &quot;illustrious ones.&quot; It refers to the members of the Gaonim, or the Cult of Aton, and not to some black-robe-wearing priestarchy. It refers to the eighteenth dynasty Sun Cult pharaohs of Egypt whose descendants hide under the names &quot;Israelite&quot; and&quot;Judite.&quot; So when we hear that “David” and “Solomon” (whom we now know as Tuthmosis III and Amenhotep III) were of the &quot;House of Judah&quot; we understand that it was a reference not to the Semites, or the Levites and their ethnicity and theology, but to Egypt&#39;s Solar Cult and their theology. <em>Michael Tsarion</em></p>

<p>Sol-Om-On...Sol (the sun) Om (the lost word) On (a form of Osiris).</p>

<p>In short...
Progenitors of &#39;mystery religion&#39;, but under the guise of Jews.</p>

<p>Just wanted to point out that Solomon is just the Western &quot;version&quot; of his name.</p>

<p>The actual Hebrew name is שלמה, which is pronounced as Shlomo.</p>
