       Earth emits a burst of carbon monoxide (CO) a few days before an earthquake, according to geophysicist Ramesh Singh.
      </p>
      <p>
       The researchers discovered the connection between CO emission and earthquake by analysing satellite remote sensing data collected around the time when a 7.6 magnitude earthquake shook Gujarat in western India nine years ago killing about 20,000 people and rendering thousands homeless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Singh said that CO levels were taken by an instrument onboard NASA's Terra satellite — launched in 2009 — circling the earth in a polar orbit at a height of 705 km. The instrument measures CO concentrations at different heights and also computes the total amount of the gas in a vertical column of air above the earth surface.
      </p>
      <p>
       Analysis of the satellite data showed a large peak in CO concentrations during January 19 and 20 — a week before the main earthquake event. On January 19, the total CO in the vertical column was also higher than usual. After the 26 January earthquake the concentration of the gas dropped.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the scientists, CO gas is forced out of the earth due to the build up of stress prior to the earthquake "influencing the hydrological regime around the epicentre."
      </p>
      <p>
       Singh said an anomalous increase in land surface temperature a few days prior to Gujarat earthquake — as inferred from the data of NASA's other satellite MODIS — is also related to the CO emission. "The increase of column CO and concentrations of CO may have enhanced the land surface temperature," he said.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The anomalous changes in CO concentrations prior to the main earthquake event and enhancement of temperature of the earth surface observed from MODIS satellite data give an indication of coupling between land and atmosphere," the scientists report. Singh said observation by other researchers of a sudden increase in water vapour in the atmosphere and changes in the ionosphere a few days prior to the Gujarat earthquake all seem to be connected.

       It may not happen but it's not bull.  Atmospheric heating was observed in Chile, Japan, China, and in the article cited India.  It could be CO, it could be atmospheric electrons acting differently.  People have seen a strange glow in the air before them too.

       Well now, to be fair, a CO emission right before the India earthquake could just be coincidence.  One data point isn't enough to make predictions.  But if you can go back in time and correlate CO emissions with other earthquakes in a similar manner, then you have something.

       I agree.  I'm gonna see if I can find old CO data vs past earthquakes.  If a big earthquake does happen this week there, this would be a first good step into real prediction forecasts using this method.

       Yes, true. Today, after the 7.9, I think the point is being missed by some today. The Japan CO emission affected JAPAN. I suspect the CO emission from California will affect CALIFORNIA- don't see how it could possibly relate to Indonesia's quake today. Not to mention that they get these kind of quakes ALL THE TIME (sorry, I know this was posted 2 days ago- just throwing my 2 cents in there).

       Could be, but it doesn't explain why Japan's CO emissions that we saw before the 'big one'
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       affected only Japan. I get what you're saying but I suspect that these emissions are indicative of a potential earthquake where they occur. If your theory were true, then when Japan had their emissions, the effect should have been parallel with a county on this side of the ocean.

       I do believe that when

       pressure is released on one side, it can affect the other side of the world. I'm no expert in any of this and this is all speculation. Just a thought ;)

       Japan, Sumatra, China, India.  That's enough points to start with.  This is a new avenue of research, not tin foil stuff.  It could be CO emissions or electron concentration, not sure yet but if this is a pre-cursor, you can bet it will be studied more intensely.

       TEC in the ionosphere.  Could be related.  Could contribute to heating as well as the vapor concentration that causes a glow or iridescence that some have sighted in the atmosphere before big earthquakes.  Look up videos of earthquake lights.

      <p>
       There was a 5.3 quake in Cali just two weeks ago as well. How often does this outgassing happen? How much was outgassed, is it in normal range? Could this outgassing be in response to that earthquake, or is it something more? What's the consensus on this CO outgassing predicting hypothesis?

       Hi guys! Thanks for the summon. I just got summoned over on a
       <a href="/r/collapse">
        /r/collapse
       </a>
       thread as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quite frankly I'm not sure what's going on. There simply isn't enough historic evidence to suggest that one thing or another is related.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand that as you've called me, you may be thinking this could lead to a big quake? Or indicative of one to happen soon?
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is the case then I ask you to go and prepare. Get together an emergency kit and create an emergency plan. Go through it a couple of times with your family and spread the message of being prepared.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://getthru.govt.nz/how-to-get-ready/emergency-survival-items/">
        Here
       </a>
       is a really good resource for an emergency kit and how to put one together.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately I cannot say that there is a link between this and a possible future quake but I can say due to the nature of the state, I would be prepared whether this was happening or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please do be prepared!

       Just because I'm curious, why is it that Chile can suffer an 8.3 earthquake and 99% of structures suffer little to no damage, but when a 5.x earthquake hits the US or Taiwan or some other country it causes lots of damage? I don't even go outside for anything under 6.5... Are building codes just less strict in the rest of the world?

       a bit of both i think. chilean building codes are very strict and revised after each contingency, so there is an active engineering effort around earthquakes and a certain continuity due to the frequency. add to this evacuation plans + increasingly fewer old buildings to crumble and you have lower death tolls. there is also an element of calm in the face of quakes (the idea of chileans not batting an eyelid at quakes that would cause panic elsewhere is not entirely false, we get a lot of movement).

       You're kit includes excessive water and that is heavy.  It also doesn't have a means to filter more water than what you bring.  Why not instead bring 4 lifestraws or a 2 bag nanofilter system or sawyer mylar filter?

       I've spent 2+ months outside on a trail carrying up to 4L of water at a time, and hiked over 2000 miles in the mountains and plains on both coasts.  You don't need to carry more than that (1 gal) unless you are in the desert or an arid place and walking over 12mi with no water.  Water is everywhere, you just need to have technology to filter it properly.  The things I linked to above are ultralight and allow you to store up and move quickly.  But keep in mind the best place to store water however is inside your own body (cameling up).

       Oh if you're moving with it, definitely agree with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the time though, it's often safer to stay at your property and thus the water can stay where it is. A few drops of colourless/fragrance free bleach is also a good way to sterilize water. Leave it to sit for 30+ minutes.

       Hmm. Could this be "the big one"? I'm not a geologist or a scientist but I'm seeing some patterns here. Been seeing a lot of subliminal messaging in the media and literature regarding the "big one" on the west coast.

       I'm guessing within a week based on the Gujarat earthquake data.  Occurred roughly within the same time-frame.  The off-gassing happened on January 20th, then the earthquake on the 26th.
      </p>
      <p>
       This event happened around Feb 26th, so plus six days should be around Wednesday of this week?

       This comment and earthquake (which wouldn't be classified as major) are 3 months too late.  Also, what would possess you to come back to this?  You might be a little too wound up.  Good luck.

       Nice redditing with you guys! I live 45miles away from Mt Rainier in Washington State. A major earthquake will probably trigger the eruption.

       In the geosciences field here: though there's always new information like this regarding strange precursors to earthquakes, there's simply no way to say with confidence C02 levels can indicate a future earthquake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other odd and understudied coincidences regarding earthquake predictions involve strange blue lights on the horizon - the Japanese even have a word for it, and culturally attribute it as a warning for tsunamis and earthquakes, yet we still haven't even managed to confirm their existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       But California is a lot like Istanbul or Japan in terms of earthquakes being a "when" versus an "if," so better safe than sorry! So with that being said, here are some helpful life tips when living in an earthquake prone area:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        When buying a house: avoid properties constructed on landfill (e.g. San Francisco wharf-area), and consider looking at houses constructed on natural mountains - most mountainous regions of california consist of granite and other rock that absorbs shock and can reduce damage caused by liquification and the like (can refer to groundwater coming to the surface due to plate movement as well as solid ground actually acting as a liquid during earthquakes). Also avoid houses that are built above garages - unfortunately very popular in cities like San Francisco to maximize space, but the rather empty foundation of the garage can cause the whole house to collapse beneath it,
        <a href="http://myweb.wwu.edu/debari/web/scied/eqslides/baesieq16.jpg">
         which looks something like this
        </a>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       There is such a thing as quake proof garages, so be sure to ask if looking at a home with a garage as the first floor!
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Be aware if you are near a fault line. There are more faults than just the San Andrea, though that is obviously the biggest and scariest of them all. Every fault has the possibility of movement no matter how small, and large quakes can trigger multiple quakes at multiple plate boundaries.
         <a href="http://shafter.kernhigh.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/faults.jpg">
          Here's a pretty decent map of all relevant faults in California
         </a>
         but the Bay Area alone actually has dozens.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If an earthquake occurs and you can get out of a building in less than 10-20 seconds, go outside and away from large buildings and trees as quickly as possible. Rule of thumb is the further away from things that can fall, the better! If in your car, pull over at the nearest safe spot (if on a bridge, continue at speed of traffic if possible until back on land). If you are in a building and have no immediate escape, crawl under a table or any overhead barrier that can protect your body (most importantly your head!) in case of structure collapse. You know the joke of going under a doorway? This can actually work if no better overhead protection is available at the time.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       -As soon as it is safe to do so, shut off the electricity, gas, etc. of your house. You never know what structures and pipes have been damaged until it can be inspected, and it would be a damn shame to survive the initial quake only to be killed by a fire due to structural damage afterwards. This can also greatly reduce risk of further damage to the building. Better safe than sorry is the key here.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Be prepared for aftershocks, which can be longer and sometimes stronger than the initial quake. If you're near the coast, be prepared for earthquake-related after events such as tsunamis, and evacuate accordingly.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Have an emergency kit of water, basic first aid (bandages and wound-cleaning supplies are a good start), and basic medications. Pro tip: if you want large amounts of basic medications that would otherwise be shady to get in large quantities over the counter, medications such as penicillin can be bought in large quantities for fish aquariums, and are nearly identical to the human version though much nastier to consume and far cheaper. Canned foods are also a good thing to have around, but water is most important. This stuff should be kept in a place that would be realistically easy to get to in case of an earthquake - the trunk of your car, for example. Government aid sometimes comes too late due to infrastructure damage and the like, so you want to be able to treat basic issues like wound infections on your own if need be.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Your town likely has an official emergency area to evacuate to. They are usually large, structurally sound buildings such as sports stadiums. Know where these places are by heart, as they will likely be the first places with food, aid, and a safe place to sleep if one is not available to you. Emergency services will also most likely be found here. For families, this is a great place to tell your children/family members to meet/immediately go to in case they are not with you during an emergency. Good example, most children who survived Katrina separated from their parents did so because they found an emergency shelter within good time.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Do not go back into buildings immediately after a quake! Some buildings look rather unaffected from the outside until one second later, they're in shambles. Avoid older buildings specifically - newer buildings follow building codes that consider earthquakes, the pretty victorians unfortunately did not.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Own a wind-up powered radio. In case all communications are down, this is a fantastic way to receive direction to the nearest shelter as well as staying up-to-date on news post-quake.
        </p>

         The researchers discovered the connection between CO emission and earthquake by analysing satellite remote sensing data collected around the time when a 7.6 magnitude earthquake shook Gujarat in western India nine years ago killing about 20,000 people and rendering thousands homeless.
        </p>
        <p>
         Singh said that CO levels were taken by an instrument onboard NASA's Terra satellite — launched in 2009 — circling the earth in a polar orbit at a height of 705 km. The instrument measures CO concentrations at different heights and also computes the total amount of the gas in a vertical column of air above the earth surface.

       The satellite recorded data nine years ago but was launched in 2009?

       So predicting a 'major' earthquake in the next week is pretty damn easy. Especially in an area that is highly active like the West Coast of N. America.

       NASA has released a statement saying that the data collected and analysed by the EOS-Terra satellite was incorrect due to hardware issues caused by an inclination adjustment maneuver on Feb. 18th. When going back to science mode from sleep mode for this adjustment, the satellite's SWIR and LWIR (Short-wave Infrared and Longwave infrared) focal planes had not yet stabilized causing incorrect readings starting on Feb. 25th.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR - EOS-Terra satellite needed to make an adjustment and this caused incorrect data to be analysed.

       Seems like it was more like a release &amp; dissipate than the steady stream of the leak given the 3 timeframes, which I assume follow each other.
