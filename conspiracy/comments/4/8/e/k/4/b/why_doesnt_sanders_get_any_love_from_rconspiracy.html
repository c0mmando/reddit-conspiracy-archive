       Serious question. Why is trump the preferred option here?
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I can see (and I'm not American or in the US) sanders has been in office for years, hasn't used that position to enrich himself, seems to stand for the common man and would like to see big business and billionaires share some of their ill gotten gains with the 99% of normal people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton, well we all know she's just a self serving crook.
      </p>
      <p>
       The republican candidates seem to be the usual assortment of career criminals.
      </p>
      <p>
       And trump whilst he used to be a self confessed democrat is running on the republican ticket (that in itself confuses me no end).
      </p>
      <p>
       But what I don't get is the love for a guy who isn't from the political establishment but is very very clearly from the monied establishment. What has he got to attract voters, especially people who are a bit more awake than the average person.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guys a billionaire, you don't get to be a billionaire without screwing other people out of money, without being in the right club etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would he do right by most people when it's in his interests to keep the status quo, to keep the banks as one large criminal cartel, to keep the shady practises that allow him and his buddies to fuck over the world every single day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok so he's no Rothschild but this is a guy who is very firmly part of the club that control governments and politics globally.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I say serious question so hold off on the knee jerk down votes and help me understand this. As I say I'm not in the US so maybe I'm missing something but this is like the UK  deciding the head of BP is a good choice for prime minister or something

       Because some of us don't want socialism? Is that sooooo hard to believe? Not to mention, he is a wolf in sheep's clothing. I don't support Trump, but I can see/understand why others may. I think the whole thing is a joke. My country is already burning, and I live far from the homeland, next to Canada. Build a wall, and I'd have to go through it, if I decided to go back into the lower states, lol.... Shits a joke... I think it would be interesting to see Trump in office. Doesn't mean I'd vote for him. But I'm sure as shit not going to vote for Bernie, or anyone for that matter.

       See again I don't get that. The rest of the world doesn't really view socialism as a bad thing for a start and by any other countries standards most of the people labelled socialist in America just aren't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't get what's wrong with socialised healthcare where getting ill won't risk bankrupting you, I don't get why taxing the rich more is a bad thing. Just examples obviously but as 99% will never be in the rich club how the hell can "socialist" policies be seen as a bad thing?

       America was the world first of free men. Truly free men.

       The Murcia rhetoric is all well and good. But look up the declaration of Arbroath, pre dates the constitution by a bit and was used as a basis for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that brings me back to my point, trump shouts freedom but wants to do all sorts of things to curtail it, it makes no sense to me

       Because many of us are small government people. We want the federal government to be as small as possible and out of our lives. Socialism expands and already gigantic government, gives it more money, and in the processes takes steps to be more of a part of our lives. If you want to live free without the government dictating your lives (like me and many others), you would be against socialism, as we are. If you're happy with it in your country, by all means pursue it. If people want it, well they can move to a socialist country, because the majority here in the US do not want it.

       See this is a disconnect I don't get.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a Brit right leaning is seen as a selfish ethos with the examples being the big banks, big business, the military industrial complex etc. These to us are what the right looks like.
      </p>
      <p>
       The right is the side that enables all these bastards to subjugate the masses, it's the right that takes from the poor to enriched the few.
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes no sense that the right in America is seen as the side of freedom when to those of us outside the US we see your right as the side that ensures the rich stay rich with proven lies like trickle down economics, lies that ensure free healthcare will never happen but the insurance industry and big pharma will get ever richer.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get the personal freedom thing and the right to be able to make a fortune if you want and are willing to work hard. I mean I'm not for the redistribution of wealth and property to make us all equal in a communist state for example but it seems to me the worst of the bad options available is the political right in America.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look they are all complicit but I don't get the "buy in" that a vote for the right is a vote to support the American Dream or that supporting trump is somehow supporting change. The guy is literally the shiny example of the establishment that rules above politicians

       i agree. they still gotta go with a coherent narrative for his tv 'personality'. i'm thinking he lets in a few million 'refugees' then zomg a few thousand end up being terrorists and he 'has to' declare martial law. borders are closed, exit visas required.

       and for a foreigner ... sanders is just the same ... he is a corporate shill who will vote like the puppet master will say, on the important issues. which just proves elections are rigged, they have bought almost/probably all candidates even "radicals" like sanders who have like zero chances of getting elected and even if they do somehow strike the lottery, they thought about that too.

        Sanders is a total moron.

       the consensus is that politics is a "conspiracy", more people are realizing that most politicians are puppets. Bernie makes some good points but i'm sure he's on someone's 'leash'.

       i think the best anyone can do is make their choice for the candidate they consider the lesser evil. (voting really doesn't decide who becomes POTUS)

       This is what I mean. How can you not support breaking up the bullshit that is the big banking industry. These fucks are at the root of most of today's problems and it's all over the world not just the US.

       The chances of anyone normal, not born a millionaire and working to break into those ranks is slimmer than it's ever been. The gap between rich and poor is the largest it's ever been in human history. Hell even medieval kings didn't have the wealth or power held by the rich today.

       Because many of us are small government people. We want the federal government to be as small as possible and out of our lives. Socialism expands and already gigantic government, gives it more money, and in the processes takes steps to be more of a part of our lives. If you want to live free without the government dictating your lives (like me and many others), you would be against socialism, as we are. If you're happy with it in your country, by all means pursue it. If people want it, well they can move to a socialist country, because the majority here in the US do not want it.
