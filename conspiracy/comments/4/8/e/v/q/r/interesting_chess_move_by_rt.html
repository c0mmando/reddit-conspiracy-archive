<p>but they cut it short, cutting off the part where the journalist grabs the ss agent&#39;s neck afterwards, which biases the story.</p>

<p>this puts cnn/bbc/fox/etc in an interesting position. is it better propaganda to expose rt slanting the news? or is it better to just ignore the video?</p>

<p>your move, corporate media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah they don&#39;t show that part either. (actually i wonder why.?) it wasn&#39;t really a choke - the ss agent grabbed him by the throat and slammed him to the ground. probably a krav maga move - takes real contempt to do that shit to somebody if your life&#39;s not in danger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>nah the reporter tried to leave his little &#39;free speech zone&#39;, the ss agent tried to stop him, the reporter said &#39;fuck youuuuu&#39; and bucked his chest against the ss agent...</p>

<p>...<em>THEN</em> the ss agent throat-slammed the guy. totally uncalled-for level of aggression - not like the reporter had a knife or gun. (and the agent probably did.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea i suppose you could say that if you weren&#39;t tasked with protecting the president of a leading nation from threats. Sounds like he got overly aggressive in a place he clearly shouldn&#39;t have and the SS agent neutralized a perceived threat. Maybe he should have placed the reporter in a different hold but I don&#39;t think it was like he was trying to cause grievous injuries</p>

<p>a free country doesn&#39;t treat their free press like this. nor any citizen. the ss agent has no more rights than the reporter, nor does trump have any more rights. government is using violence to restrict our first amendment rights.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are you so upset? The reporter provoked a physical response from another human being with disrespect and threatening posture. He knows this man is trained to act accordingly to being physically threatened. The reporter is only human after all and humans although &quot;created equal&quot; as you say, humans do not react in equal measure to all things regardless of circumstance. This is at it&#39;s base form, is a man disrespecting another man verbally and posturing himself threateningly toward him. That other man reacted accordingly, within his training to non-lethaly subdue the threat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>if you think &#39;disrespect&#39; warrants a potentially lethal response, then you are a broken little bitch inside. not as an insult, but as a statement of fact: your ego is fucked and it needs to be fixed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you trolling or do you think that having your opinions logically debated warrants name-calling? Which one of us is a bitch? The one getting mad that someone has valid points on an internet forum? Or the one with perfectly reasonable points that take into account the fact humans knowingly bring violent confrontation upon themselves like this reporter? Again, the reporter did not step on the SS guy&#39;s shoe in a gas station. He did this at a place where his actions are highly inappropriate.</p>
