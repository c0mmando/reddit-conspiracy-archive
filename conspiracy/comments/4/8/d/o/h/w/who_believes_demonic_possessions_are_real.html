    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t allowed to see her. My father grew up with her and escaped as soon as he was 18. This was traumatizing to my dad, obviously, so he talked about it A LOT. I heard some crazy fucking stories. Apparently she was a totally beautiful, normal, functioning woman until one year when my dad was about 5 the two of them set off to another city to stay with his moms friend. The friend needed emotional support while her partner was gone and her house she claimed was possessed/haunted. My dad and Grandma stayed for a week. He said she came back as a different person and he has a complete memory blackout of the visit. It all went downhill from there! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right?! My dad has actually written out a rough draft of his childhood as a short biography because it&#39;s such an intense story he has mild hope that l maybe one day someone will pick it up and want to publish it hahah I&#39;ve realized that truth is usually much stranger than fiction, definitely true in this case.
He said there were times when she would have an &quot;episode&quot; and her face would contort in such a manner that it made her look masculine and inhuman, and her voice would change to this deep impossible pitch he could never replicate, alongside incredible superhuman strength. Crazy shit. Sounds insane but I&#39;ve had my own experiences with supernatural/spiritual entities that have confirmed my belief that this is all true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve come to realize that many possessions are misdiagnosed by &quot;professionals&quot; as a mental illness. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s because they just don&#39;t understand what they&#39;re dealing with and chalk it up to a &quot;crazy person symptom&quot; or if they&#39;re afraid to admit that demonic possessions are real. My Grandmother exhibited supernatural strength, spoke in languages she had never before been able to speak, knew things about strangers she couldnt possibly naturally know, spoke in the voices of many different demons she claimed possessed her body, attempted to kill both her children because The Devil told her to then she would be &quot;set free&quot;, foamed at the mouth and vimited black bile during an episode that turned into a physical attack on my father; etc. this woman was possessed by demons, but she was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic.............a normal housewife doesn&#39;t suddenly have superhuman strength and can prophesy upcoming events in strangers lives due to a sudden onset of schizophrenia. That&#39;s just not reality. I&#39;m very sorry about your mother, I&#39;m not criticizing your comment in any way btw just wanted to make it very clear this was no mental illness!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk. I was being serious though. I asked one night in a drunken stooper, that the Creator (God at the time), prove to me the existence of thyself. I asked the &quot;Devil&quot; the same question (and said, if God doesn&#39;t answer, possess me), and now, I&#39;m a completely different person, I&#39;m no longer Catholic, moved into the wilderness away from all my family, and for the most part feel alien. I love nature and life, and myself (at the time, I didn&#39;t). This was years ago, when I was younger. Not sure which side took over me, but something did. </p>

<p>I also have other interesting supernatural stories, in regards to my childhood.</p>

Apparently, as a kid, I had a knack for interacting with beings not on this dimension. Once when I was ~8, another time when I was ~15. One user on here, pointed me in a very interesting direction, in regards to Celtic mysticism. Very interesting stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, can&#39;t say I have been possesed or know any second-hand stories about possesion. But I have looked at demonology, (along with Gnosticism and hermeticism) recently &amp; I have a few questions. What is the demiurge? Who or what is YHWH/Allah? All powerful creator god or demon by many names? What is Yaldaboath? Who is Abraxas?

    <div class="md"><p>I do. Im christian &amp; demonic possessions are mentioned a few times. I always thought it all died out in ancient times. I mean Ive been part of a wiccan summoning circle out of curiosity &amp; it&#39;s all placebo effect. Same with wigi (cant spell it) boards. And satanism with the goat horns upside down pentagram wasnt a thing til the 60s. </p>

<p>But that all changed after a story my dad told me about when he was a bible study student. I was stuck in disbelief waiting for a punchline but he was fully serious. Too long for me to bother typing on my phone. Pretty much the exocism took 4 attempts over a 6month period. She wasnt certain at first but her coverent was trying kill her which is why she seeked them out. They once watched gashes appear across her stomach &amp; it spoke when commanded to. The bit that hit it home for me was when he spoke of them intentionally getting pregnant then miscarriaging so they could use the fetus for the magic. Reminded me of a verse I once read about the power of life flowing through the blood. Really fucked up shit. Why someone would want to seek something like that out is beyond me. Who wants extended life as an abused slave.</p>
