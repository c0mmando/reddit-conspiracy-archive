        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In 1967, Muammar Gaddafi inherited one of the poorest countries in Africa. A typical Saracen land filled with strife and poverty, it did few things to bother the great lords of the West.</p>

<p>Little did they know.</p>

<p>From the day Gaddafi took fate into his own hands, Libya thrived - a stable government was established, the oil flowed and there was peace. Each home had the modern comforts known to the Westerners - cable TV and Internet, appliances, air-conditioning. The economy was booming. Where once stood a barren land was now the richest country in all of Africa, and perhaps in the world. A place where the resources of the country truly belonged to the people and not to some corporation, and where a true democracy was given to the people.</p>

<p>However, this would not go unnoticed by the US and its&#39; friends. Gaddafi was a ticking time bomb - poorer African countries would flock to Libya&#39;s great wealth like a moth to a flame. There would be a union - the people of Africa would realise that they should not tolerate foreign exploitation of their continent&#39;s resources and rise up.</p>

<p>In 2011, a UN coalition airbombed Libya and destroyed all that was good. Peace, order and prosperity, all shattered in one swift, savage strike.
A man who has done so much good, who has sacrificed a part of himself to make Libya a better place, is now being cursed and injured by the masses. Our media called him a crude dictator, a ruthless tyrant. Now that &quot;freedom&quot; was brought by the West to Libya, what happened?</p>

<p>After my recent tour through North Africa, I passed through Libya to see things for myself. Where was the great Libyan country that I had once heard of? Where was the good that the West promised?
From my journeys, I can assure you that it&#39;s a pile of rubble. Countless buildings destroyed, poverty, filth and disorder. So many militias, just nitpicking over the same religion with different ideologies.</p>

<p>Thank you, UN, for UNdoing so much good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Back in about 2006 a buddy of mine had a college room mate whose father was Libyan, and his mom American. He was a great kid, and he and I came to be good friends.</p>

<p>Over his life his family had moved back and forth from the US to Libya several times. I asked him what life was like under Gaddafi. Having listened to decades of demonizing propaganda pumped out by the media, I expected to hear HORROR STORIES.</p>

<p>I was very surprised to hear him describe the country as being very modern and prosperous, and that for the most part, the Libyan people were very happy and satisfied with their government. Knowing that Libya is Muslim, I asked him about how life was for his mom and sisters and other women. He said that their time in Libya was very enjoyable, and that aside from the custom of dressing modestly, life was quite comparable to here in the states.</p>

<p>I tried to contact him after SHIT HIT THE FAN, but was unable to find him. </p>

<p>What our NeoCon-Zionist leaders in the &quot;West&quot; did to that country was part of the larger <strong><em>&quot;Arab Spring Cleaning&quot;</em></strong> - a total destruction of the political landscape of the region. </p>

<p>Unconscionable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why wouldn&#39;t it be true?
Unless we would consider watching the &quot;news&quot; and all the hate speech from the so-called &quot;experts&quot; that call Gaddafi a murderer and a terrorist. They&#39;re the same type of people as those that murdered him in cold blood.</p>

<p>And don&#39;t get me started on the Rothschild family. They own over $500 trillion dollars and about every major company that exists nowadays. In fact, they own about everything that&#39;s around you. It&#39;s their unsatiable greed and others that think likewise that brought ruin to Libya.</p>
