       I'd have to go Sanders. He barely even gets a mention on CNN, which is the "unbiased" news source. Also, he would seriously change the game on political donations.

       Watch the media on this, too - they've said he lost big last night. He won every state his team said he would, and virtually tied in a bunch of others.
       <em>
        He didn't lose. He's not out for the count, no matter what the pundits say - and look up those pundits if you're curious, to find out what their conflicts of interest could possibly be...

       They're trying to demoralize people into thinking it's a done deal so that they don't go out and vote. Check the connections between media and the Clinton Foundation, and it becomes very, very clear the psyop they're engaging in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't fall for it, people. Do your research and vote your conscience. We don't have to have a Kodos vs. Kodos election. If the election was completely rigged, they wouldn't have to go to all this effort - so much money being funneled into "shaping public opinion."

       I would think billionaires would welcome another billionaire in to office.  Trump fits that category well and has used the same loopholes in avoiding taxation.  Billionaires buy elections and policies and their support will go to who they believe will not increase their taxes such as higher capital gains as well as whoever they believe they can persuade to make decisions and ultimately laws in their favor.  Those behaviors are the reason our economy is in the state it is today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sanders is anti-billionaire and a lot of his focus is on restructuring tax laws.  Those changes would increase taxes for the rich and would surely deter votes from the rich.  So you are likely correct in assuming Sanders would be the least likely candidate billionaires would want in office.

       Lol, all of sanders policies would transfer wealth from the poor and middle class to the rich. Just like the current statist policies. Except it would be at a higher rate with the old fart in charge.

       Sanders. Trump is one of them and they're well aware of it. He's as connected to the elite as the Clintons, and through the same people (see also: Jeffrey Epstein). Wasn't a Saudi sheik always bailing him out when he ran into trouble? The one who bought his yacht and then gave it back?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's if he's planning on actually going the whole way or not. I wouldn't doubt some Clinton Foundation and other influences (check their
       <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/02/26/a-searchable-index-of-clinton-foundation-donors/">

       </a>

       Problem here is not which candidate, its the concept of financial mobility. Sanders' policies operate under the concept that we are in a vacuum. Billionaires can move. If you over tax them, they move away to a more "Billionaire-Friendly" countries, same with corporations. Unless you plan to freeze their assets, they will leave, as will corporations, making a negative overall impact by shifting jobs, taking revenue out of the stream of investment, etc.

       Financial mobility is being fucked sideways for lower, middle, and upper class (i.e., not the big, big guys) and it's getting tougher. Try moving money from bank to bank or carrying cash around. Do you think it's odd that the TSA naked scanners catch cash more often than guns?
      </p>
      <p>
       And there's a reason there's so much talk about purely-electronic cash. Bet the elites will find some way to exempt themselves, but we plebes are looked upon with suspicion as possible terrorists for paying

       Sanders wants to tax the system more (not just the big, big guys but anyone above average), because thats what socialism does, it controls the flow of wealth through redistribution. Trump really has said anything of value, Hillary is a career criminal and Cruz looks like a pedophile priest. They've finally given nothing but sh*t for options

       I typically vote third party, sick of the mainstream candidates (last election was basically Romney and Obama trying to out neocon each other. "I'll bomb them!" "I'll bomb them harder!"), but there is no way I could have foreseen the shitshow we currently have before us.

       i think Sanders. if he attempts to do what he says, it would be their worse nightmare. not that i think it would be an 'easy' fight (or winnable) but it would be interesting &amp; helpful to get people 'involved' in what's happening.

       Yep. And that's why the choice they've set up is a false one. Trump is an easy buy, if Clinton hasn't bought him, it's a matter of time (I'm convinced this has already happened). His finances aren't what he says they are, he gets bailed out on the regular by a

       Well, Berny's tax plan has the highest tax bracket at around 52%, so that will make all the large corporations and billionaires leave America taking all the jobs with them.

       I know.  There are no billionaires
       <em>
        or
       </em>
       jobs in Belgium, Finland Sweden, The Netherlands, Luxembourg or Denmark.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I'm pretty sure that percentage is a marginal rate so for the bracket that qualifies for it, their first X income will be taxed in the lowest bracket, X after that in the second lowest etc. and only income beyond that which puts them in the highest bracket will be taxed at 50% so realistically there are many many more nations with effectively higher top brackets (at least 20, probably far far more).
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus the idea that billionaires create jobs is fundamentally flawed.  It essentially suggests that supply creates demand which is backwards.  Billionaires have no incentive to start businesses that create jobs if people on average have too little money to increase their expenditures to support new businesses.  When you look at marginal expenditure rates (the increase in personal spending relative to the increase in available money) it is always higher with lower income groups.  The lowest income groups will spend nearly or even over 100% of increased income while the highest groups fall well short of 50%, essentially putting the rest of the money out of circulation in order to create more money for themselves to no benefit to the vast majority of people.  That means that the best way to pump more money into the economy is to have tax breaks for middle to low income people who will then have more disposable income to do things like eat at restaurants more or buy more luxury goods or buy cars or houses more often etc.

       Right now, many billionaires are basically just farming poor people, extracting blood from barely-surviving stones. Look at Warren Buffett as an example - predatory loans for his cruddy mobile home con job company (
       <a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/2015/04/03/17024/warren-buffetts-mobile-home-empire-preys-poor">
        Clayton Homes

       ) then buying into Coca-Cola and Davita Dialysis at the same time. And Trump's buddy (he wants him as Treasury Secretary!) Carl Icahn, who makes his bones investing in MLM schemes like Herbalife.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's not stupid, but he's farming poor people. Why? How many jobs is he really creating? What is he plowing his wealth back into?
      </p>
      <p>
       People give Amazon shit, and I am kind of annoyed by Bezos' apparent influence on the Washington Post these days, but they at least plow their money back into their business and they are not spending all their time exploiting the poor like the Wal-Marts and Clayton Homes of America. (Also, note that this is one company Trump vows to "go after".)

       Corporations use governments to create temporary monopolies (via patents, copyrights, trademarks, etc). or do drive out competition with creating barriers to entry to they don't have any average Joe going up against them. Globalists want free trade yes, but still under one control, theirs.

       We cant embargo a product or company based on them not being in the U.S. The demand remands the same, purchasing power will remain the same. When there is a demand with no legal supply, black markets rise, shifting the power to the most violent. I also believe corporations also have enough influence to impeach a POTUS long before the sting of "embargoing" the products. Companies today are going through cost focused cycles, when economies stagnate, companies find ways to cut costs because they are at a price peak for their product so they cant raise prices. As an example, Medtronic got hammered by U.S. and left.

       We have an issue there, though, where corporations and government are sort of the same entity now. What we need is a shakeup to shake out the corruption, we're at peak corruption for the US; I fear a Clinton presidency will bring us to unprecedented heights. Her history - that's what she's all about. Quid pro quo politics, money, power, money.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way to stop it is for the people to slow it down; Trump and Clinton will speed it up, very scared of either or whoever the parties put up to replace them. Only way to slow it down is actually band together for an anti-corruption and collusion candidate. Only one I see clearly here is Sanders; but the Republican establishment hates Kasich so much, I think he's an option, too. It's interesting that both Kasich and Sanders have the relevant experience, but are constantly discounted by the establishment.

       Then why would they leave and take all the jobs with them?
      </p>
      <p>
       That is what I was responding to. Essentially, if the corporations leave, and completely destroy the US economy, it will be an 'attack' on the US far more severe and personal than any terrorist attack. The people would have nothing at all left to lose and if their government did not do something to protect them, they would revolt.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's a moot point because as you said the government is so corrupt that even if Sanders does become president it will still be under corporation control. They would have no reason to leave.

       I'm not convinced they'll leave actually - and bunches have already left via the Ireland and offshore route. There's an interesting article out there about Sanders and Burlington that's worth reading re: how small business flourished in Burlington, how he ended up best buds with the biggest oligarch in town, and basically, sort of "If Burlington's any litmus (though there's no guarantee that it is, but it's a data point), entrepreneurs don't have much to fear." I'm probably going Kasich because I'm not registered D, but I could live with him based on my research. It's up to everyone to do their own research, though, and keep an open mind about all comers. Except Clinton, good gawd. If what's in the public domain is the tip of the iceberg, we're so fucked if she makes it.

       Socialism partially works on a small level, not on a country wide scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       They wont take it in the shorts, they will leave. And the lowest portion of our class system will end up inheriting the mess in terms of "hands on" jobs and overall less money to them because of how many palms get greased in a socialist economy. Greece falling flat on its face should let you know that socialism is a disease.

       I want true democratic capitalism - but unfortunately, it all feels like fascism right now because corporations and government are colluding. Sanders won't succeed in "making America socialist" - we still have multiple branches of government. But what I do want is some push to put people in jail, make them ashamed of their corruption, and bring us back down to a level where we can be capitalists again, at which point, human avarice will grow, we'll be back where we are now, and people will band together to smash it down again. Life's a cycle, unchecked anything brings us wildly out of control. Our country's a mess right now, controlled by a few oligarchs - one of the biggest thinks she's going to get control of the country - and then we're really fucked because no one with any power, so far, has had the balls to really challenge her on her corruption.

       he is a democratic socialist, which means his politics are democratic but his economics are socialist. The U.S. will never go full socialist under Bernie, because that's not what he believes. I personally want to believe that it will be Hitlery Clinton and Donald Dfumpf and he will fire enough crap her way that it will force the general public to look at her long list of crimes and how many people have "suicided" themselves in proximity to the Clintons, but they're friends irl and Trump will play nice, especially if he loses and has to put up with his Freinemy being the POSTUS

       He'll get something in exchange, I'm sure. Given the weird statements related to Trump around the Epstein trial (one of the underage girls' lawyer said Trump had nothing to do with anything; though Ghislaine Maxwell and Epstein reportedly both used Trump's club to recruit underaged girls), and the number of phone numbers Epstein had for Trump, I wouldn't doubt that Trump has a lot of dirt on someone - and probably Bill. The Clintons have a lot of money funneled through the family Foundation, I'm sure they'll work a deal somehow.

       after all, but there's a couple of out there prophecies that Obama will be the last American president. They're kooky, but I can see some weird, weird scenarios. Like Hillary wins the general election, but the indictment drops right then and it's rock-solid and well-researched (a long shot, but...this is the craziest election cycle and different factions of our government appear to basically be at war with each other, if you look back at different incidents like Benghazi, the Petraeus scandal, the current FBI data-grab being dissed by ex-NSA head, et al).

       I mean, in a perfect world, Libertarianism would work. Business owners would care about their product, their employees, their customers, and stewarding their environment so that they can continue to be successful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, people for some reason don't want to play the long game, they want the short-term (one of the few perspicacious things said by Clinton - the quarter-to-quarter earnings game fucks us all; I'd go farther and including "returning stockholder value in cash," "four year vest cliffs," "revolving doors," and "golden parachutes" to the list). What do we do about it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Put people in jail when they are obviously, overtly corrupt and hurting their customers, their employees, and their environment. But due to the amount of money in politics, this shit doesn't happen. Occasionally, the government sues and levies a fine, usually peanuts in comparison to the corporation's income, which goes...
       <em>
        right back to the government
       </em>
       and to heads of agencies that turn around and then work at the companies, a clear conflict of interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just want a President that will put some people in jail to clean things up a bit. It's funny, people dis GW, but he did actually do (a very little of) this (although there is talk in conspiracy circles that some of this was retaliatory, like that Cable guy that refused to share user data w/the Feds, so...also, TARP pretty much negates any DoJ prosecutorial anything, IMHO). But hell, if people aren't going to have enough pride and decency to run their companies ethically, why not scare a couple into it?

       Problem with this is that if everyone did the right thing then the justification for government over economics would be null and void. Politics is one of the few jobs that if you do it right, you work youself out of a job.

       The best thing about Bernie Sanders is that he has absolutely no hope of winning, ever, in any respect. Even if Hillary Clinton is assassinated because she won’t be arrested and even if she is executed for treason after being arrested, Joe Biden will be brought forward by the DNC and Sanders will be thrown into the garbage.
      </p>
      <p>
       My third greatest joy in life right now is watching Sanders’ supporters froth themselves into an apoplectic rage when their mental illness that causes cognitive dissonance rubs up against the reality that is Trump and true American ideology (read: not the treason they support).

       Or you two (one) could actually have an argument. Pretty simple.

       I’d love to hear you explain how Sanders’ voting record isn’t actually real and that he magically did the opposite of what he did.

       There's a rule against calling people shills in this sub - guarantee BJIR has already reported your comment because that's their MO. But good eye - the account's argumentation techniques are textbook - whether it's pro-GMO, pro-Clinton, pro-Trump, pro-Flat Earth, pro-whatever flavor of the month crazy theory they want to use to discredit conspiracists, they all use the same playbook.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm kind of cheered, though, that they do such a shitty job AND most readers are sophisticated enough to see it these days.

       Edit: He reported me for pointing out his unsourced copypasta. Too funny. As entertaining as he is, I DO wish we could have damned conversation about political conspiracies in this sub without being derailed by these fools, though.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Thousands of contributions to Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’ campaign in January violated federal campaign finance laws, election regulators said on Thursday.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Federal Election Commission sent a letter to the Democratic presidential candidate’s campaign committee on Thursday with a 90-page spreadsheet listing 3,457 “excessive, prohibited, and impermissible contributions.”
       </p>
       <p>
        “Although the Commission may take further legal action concerning the acceptance of [excessive or prohibited] contributions, your prompt action to refund the prohibited amount will be taken into consideration,” the FEC told the campaign.
       </p>
       <p>
        The FEC sent a letter to the Sanders campaign earlier this month flagging an additional 1,316 “excessive, prohibited, and impermissible contributions” in the fourth quarter of 2015.
       </p>
       <p>
        The commission also noted disbursements from the campaign that failed to include required documentation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some of the campaign’s legal problems stem from enthusiasm for Sanders’ candidacy from foreign nationals, many of whom have publicly revealed donations to the campaign in violation of U.S. election laws.

       He'll get something in exchange, I'm sure. Given the weird statements related to Trump around the Epstein trial (one of the underage girls' lawyer said Trump had nothing to do with anything; though Ghislaine Maxwell and Epstein reportedly both used Trump's club to recruit underaged girls), and the number of phone numbers Epstein had for Trump, I wouldn't doubt that Trump has a lot of dirt on someone - and probably Bill. The Clintons have a lot of money funneled through the family Foundation, I'm sure they'll work a deal somehow.

       after all, but there's a couple of out there prophecies that Obama will be the last American president. They're kooky, but I can see some weird, weird scenarios. Like Hillary wins the general election, but the indictment drops right then and it's rock-solid and well-researched (a long shot, but...this is the craziest election cycle and different factions of our government appear to basically be at war with each other, if you look back at different incidents like Benghazi, the Petraeus scandal, the current FBI data-grab being dissed by ex-NSA head, et al).
