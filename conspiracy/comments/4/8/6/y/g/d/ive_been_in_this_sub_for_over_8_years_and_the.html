       Free speech is fun until a small group of people with a hateful agenda decide to corrupt it because they can.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll always support free speech just as I'll always rail against perversions of it which represent dominance by a minority willing to step outside the legal bounds (vote brigading, multiple accounts etc.) to create a flase impression of majority opinion.
      </p>

       It's actually quite relevant here to mention the fact that Hitler was legally elected (Brownshirts).

       Lack of independent media and freespeech  helped dark triad Hilter rise to power. American corporate funding also didn't help. More freespeech could have prevented the rise of Hilter. A strong independant media could have exposed Hilter for the evil man he was rather than being voted Time magazine man of the year. F the mainstream media. They failed to do their job. Censorship just leads to extremism.

       Free speech is awesome.  A minority of hateful people diverting rational and polite discussion into generalized hatred of a religious or racial or cultural group is exactly what Hitler did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Time's Man of the Year award was never meant to denote the "best" man of the year, just the most influential for good or ill.

       I never claimed man of the year was meant to denote "best" man of the year.  Did Time expose him for the monster he was known to be? The mainstream media was as  at fault,  maybe more, for the rise of Hilter than the brownshirts. Hilter wasn't named man of the year in 1943 even though he was the most influential man of that year. This is just a corporate PR spin from a rag of a magazine called Time. F the mainstream media. Absolute freespeech and an independent diverse media is the answer.  Not the problem. Censorship pushes speech underground. Adults don't like to be treated like children and told what they can or can't say.

       Again, censorship does suck.  I have not argued that the posts I dislike be censored.  Only that those comment have changed this sub from a place for rational discussion into a hate-filled circlejerk.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also relevant is that years ago when I worked in a copy shop someone brought in a vintage 1933 (I think October) NYT page with a front page article talking about how great Mussolini's Italy was.  This was, of course, about 1 year before the plot that Smedly Butler alleged was the planned time for a fascist takeover of America.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying the mainstream media tells us the truth, just that a grossly biased anti-Jewish bias serves a different yet no better agenda.

       Tried it.  Done.  I'll always love the discussion of various rationally based ideas but this is just no longer a place for it.  I guess I'll still be here to upvote and downvote stuff but I'm increasingly of the opinion that the morons outnumber the rational thinkers to the point that it's not worth casting my (hardly) pearls unto (worse than) swine and that I should bow out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course I'm lying and in a moment of rage or actually having unexposed information to contribute, I'll probably comment again, but as far as "Yes, good point and here's why" or "That's wrong and here's why"  I'm gonna sit the next 9 months out.  We'll see what happens when one of the god-awful Republicans (on average as bad as Hillary) candidates becomes president.

       Rational debate and the validity and eloquence of my views are irrelevant.  99% downvotes of things that even slightly suggest that that all Jews aren't evil or that the post is applying a double standard, is antisemitic etc. are silent.  The vast majority of the respondents who bother to post anything either accuse of being a shill or assume I am a Jew generally provide nothing in the way of rebuttal, just routinely snide and often sometimes bigoted insults.
      </p>

       These people are an over-represented virulent minority that render cogent argument and rational debate completely moot.

       People who blindly and ignorantly believe everything that they read and hear feed that dominant minority you speak of and as such, feed in reverse on the fear they produce.  There is no way to escape the perversion of the gatekeepers out there.  Its only becoming more subversive and tricky, and folks are getting evermore clouded in their judgement and rational thinking skills due to the amount of distractions, pollutants, etc.  If the majority knew what was being accomplished in their names, people might take issue.  That day?  IDK?

       There's a lot of ugly on Reddit in general. I posted something about a possible sleeper cell being taken out and a bunch of whiny racists jumped in to bitch about the fact that the news covered some Muslim guys dying and used it to rail against both Muslims and Blacks. Our top-voted post the last few days was a stupid (and incorrect) meme about the wage gap - which was not even a conspiracy - that brought every sexist teen and his pappy out to play.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there were a lot of good comments in both threads, too, and actually some good conversation if you could get past the "LOLZ Feminsmsms/Mooslims/Blackz ow my ballz" brigaders (most of the culprits weren't regulars to the sub).
      </p>
      <p>
       This, unfortunately, is Reddit, and, I fear, the world at large (look who the media wants us to choose from for President, ffs - an avaricious fascist or a sentient circus peanut fascist) and there's shit-all we can really do about it except keep rowing through it. Or turn off the computer and stop talking to friends/relatives/strangers forever...
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes it sucks, I know I questioned and still do question myself for spending too much time on Reddit after my couple of arguments with the lolboys (none of which were regulars, btw), but I like it here, I like the people here, I like the topics and discussions here, and if I can wade through the stupid, there's a lot of good to be had and a bunch of good, smart, and well-meaning people.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's your choice to leave, I guess, but the best way to combat bigotry and stupidity is to point it out. Pretending it doesn't exist ain't gonna help, letting it pass uncommented on ain't gonna help, either (also, metathreads are likely not to help - better to comment in whichever threads you're referring to to combat propaganda if you believe it to be propaganda).

       As I said.  8 years here.  The last 4 have been a complete waste of time as my opinions and those of others that don't fall into step with bigotry are not really visible because they are so heavily downvoted.  Pointing out that that graph was a eogery got downvoted
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       it was removed from the link listings on /conspiracy which means that people messages otehrs to come downvote me which means that antisemites are using the same tools to notify one another of posts and links to downvote/comment on as are the ultra-zionists they hate so much.  360-shitfest.

       Who cares about downvotes...that's how you know you hit a nerve. And don't most people read the new queue set to like -500 or something? I know I do. If they're using the same software, maybe they're all the same people and a couple useful idiots mixed in.

       Nono.  What hits a nerve is that people either respond with irrational hate or downvote without a response.  I don't really want to waste my time expressing an opinion that no one is going to either see and agree with or see and rationally disagree with,  All I tend to get as a response now is "Evil Jews fesaio, fadsnfo and fjiewofjweio." and a bunch of downvotes hiding my points from those who might be interested or disagree with me in a well though out way.

       Nah, I fought against the bigoted retardification of this sub for a while.  I'll just call it a day and maybe I can find a sub that still talks about conspiracies instead of being filled with people who post that "Scheming pedophile Jews control our media and brainwash gentiles into dying for Jewish bankers' profits" ad infinitum.

        It's been a steady increase over the last 4 years. Now we're up to videos of Hitler posts calling on non-Jews to rise up against their Jewish masters with titles like "He was way ahead of his time" that get 66% approval. Also posts like this with flagrantly false titles that get 90% approval and slurs in the comments are generally ignored by mods.

        White supremacist sites have been openly discussing using this sub as a recruiting ground for years. The irony is they're using the same tactics that Hasbara and JIDF groups are using to control relevant discourse on /worldnews and elsewhere.

       If you want to argue that my point is that my agenda is trying to reverse the progression of this sub from rational, fact-based discourse into flagrant antisemitism, guilty.  I' totally guilty of that.  You win the argument that I don't want this to become even more a sub devoted to bigotry.

       I just see the great strength of Reddit as being its great weakness: one person's individual opinion used to matter.  Then large groups of easily directed sheep banded together (on whichever side of whatever) and intentionally tried to create a false image of consensus of their view despite their being in the minority.

       It will always happen as the forum itself and the perceived benefits of leadership within it grow.  It's a sad aspect of human nature.

       Even if the hive mind of reddit down votes your post. Who cares. People will still be able to see your posts in the new section. Reddit points aren't worth anything anyway. Also evil people post disinformation to discredit information people in power don't want to be seen. Then they can just scream conspiracy.  If you are a person of goodwill post information you believe in.  Leaving isn't going to help. This subreddit will only become a darker place. The solution to darkness isn't to run but rather to be a light.

       All valid points.  I just miss the days when I would write like two pages about real factual stuff regarding conspiracies and have one of the many people here who I know respectfully disagree and once in a while one or the other of us would walk away with a new but of knowledge.

       Absolutely.  Censorship is horrible.  However if you tell someone with the mental capacity of a 10 year old that Jews are evil and emphasize that to the exclusion of the evils of non-Jews you just breed hateful, misinformed drones.  Let's face it.  Reddit has come to have a significant portion of users with the mental capacity of 10 year olds, thanks in large part to their slightly less idiotic leaders herding their flocks of idiots here to preach the word of Lord Idiot.

       Just pass over the post if you don't like it.  In a free society all viewpoints are discussed even ones you don't agree with. Even though 30 % of the postings on this subreddit I don't agree with,  this is better than censorship. Even disinformation can sometimes be interesting. Effective disinformation is truth + bullshit.  Looking for the truth within disinformation can be interesting and informative.

       Yeah, you're right.  I'm giving up on this forum of discussion because people are free to exercise their right to be irrationally antisemitic (within limits) and now this is a sub with a plurality of posts about that instead of being about actual conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just choose not to sift through a significant portion of hate posts that lead to hive mind antisemitic downvotes (same but opposite reasio I don't comment in /worldnews) and irrational replies in a sub that used to comprise polite and rational discussion of conspiracies that aren't essentially "TEH JOOS DID IT!"

       For Christ's sake.  You honestly think that your previous comment doesn't imply that?  Look at my comment history.  Do I make shit up that would be easily contradicted because...  Whit, what is your theory?  I want those ~~sweet, sweet~ useless useless upvotes?  This is a ridiculous line of attack.  Even the most cursory examination of my comments will show that I maintain unpopular viewpoints as often as popular, post in a variety of subs and obviously don't cultivate karma cince I've managed about 23,000 comment karma and negligible post karma over 8 years (most of my posts have been /self).

       You're OP is a joke, dude. I'm here quite a bit, and I'm not seeing all this "anti-Semitism/Bigotry!". And if on the odd chance there is blatant racist posts, it's usually by "new" members (Joshua Goldberg types) who get downvoted, and are doing it on purpose. That's in the minority, and far from the majority here.

       Hate speech? Are you fucking kidding me? Learn that others will have other opinions and there is no such thing as "hate speech". The most vile speech is to be protected, if we want free speech (that's the damn point of it, not to protect popular speech). Grow a thicker skin. Sounds like you want a safe place.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's as far as I read, go find a safe place. I must warn you though, there is no such fucking thing as a safe place. Deal with it. There are ignorant/vile people in the world, and rather than censoring them, you should engage with them. Maybe you could help change their views/educate them.

       OK.  I happen to believe that black Americans should rise up and overthrow white Americans and end their oppression.  #Blacksupremacyisright.  Now, consider if I say this endorsing the views of someone who was in part responsible for the murder of millions based on an attempt at racial supremacy.

       Cool beans, that's your right. Just because some one says it, and then some deranged person does it, doesn't make you responsible/guilty of that persons actions. Speech !== actions. Actions are punishable. There are no thought crimes. This is what you're apparently not understanding....

       Maybe to you, but to others it's not. You're not guaranteed to be not offended. This whole, I'm offended, shut up, is what is destroying the country. There are no guarantees of not being offended. You can try and create a safe place as much as you want, but guess what, they could offend someone else. See? You in college or some shit? You don't seem like you have real life experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there is evidence that there was no Hitler final solution to kill Jews. There was no "holocaust". Prejudice, yes, but no different than what the US did to American Japanese/Germans/Italians. The only difference is, that Europe was the stage of the war, not the US. Historians are re-investigating that history. But, people like you, would call that anti-Semitic. Facts are not racist/prejudiced. Facts are facts, even if you are offended by them. Grow the fuck up.

       Hey, I'm not campaigning to criminalize advocating hate speech.  One of the necessary downsides of freedom of speech is that people have a right to be stupid and say stupid things (within broad limits).  I just don't want to be a part of a sub that has been perverted towards hat speech when it was designed to be about conspiracies.

       Never did I say I was offended.  I've heard retarded shit like this my whole life and there's virtually nothing that will offend me.  I'm saying it's stupid and it belongs in a different sub and that I mourn the loss of this sub as anything of than a place for people to circle-jerk about hating Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       I with these poelpe would shut up, but again, just saying they've ruined the sub.  I report slurs and shill accusations...  The rest is just the disintegration of this sub as place for people to politely discuss politically hidden facts into a place to irrationally hate on a huge and diverse group of people based the actions of a few.

       Not reading past here.  I've examined all the evidence presented to that effect and it is all both flawed and decisively contradicted by much more robust evidence to the contrary.

       That is an opinion you may hold.  I strongly disagree, but your saying that does not contradict the spirit of this sub.  I have not and will not complain about it as it is not categorically a defamation of an entire race of people.  I disagree, but we'll let that one lie.

       Truth hurts.  Jews are at the forefront of scheming. It's in their nature. How does a "nation" operate if it lives among its adversaries as a tiny minority and has no standing army? Through subterfuge, lies, conspiracy etc. Mossads motto might as well be the entire Jewish people motto

       I haven't really seen much of that, certainly not enough to rage quit. I would likely feel the same way if people were bashing Jews simply for being Jewish. Any anger directed towards Jews should be directed towards their elite instead, we share the same enemy.

       I was raised Jewish before renouncing it. If you can't recognize that Jews are in a unique spot at the top of a lot of ladders in modern society you're just an idiot. There is a reason Jews have been kicked out of a ton of societies as diverse as Babylon and Shakespearean England, and the reason isn't an irrational hatred of Jews.

       There are countless examples of minorities being in above average positions economically.  Chinese in Indonesia or most of Southeast Asia.  Shia in Iraq.  Anglos in South Africa.  Asian Americans earn more than white Americans and on and on and on.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of Jews it has to do with cultural cohesiveness and spending wealth within one's own community.  The International Jew by Henry Ford is rightly considered antisemitic but it goes into this aspect of cultural economic self-reinforcement and suggests that other groups should engage in the same centralization of wealth based along cultural lines.

       Well we agree then. I would say Jews successful bind together and rise to the top of whatever society they inhabit, and for this reason almost always exert a disproportionate amount of influence for their numbers. I would say this is the reason that they've been kicked out of so many societies and that when someone brings this up they're called anti-semetic.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you agree with all this then what is the problem? That's all anyone is saying and you're calling them anti-semetic, but you just said it was true. Do you not see a problem with an extremely small group rising to the top of and exerting a huge amount of influence on a society? Would you not think it was a problem for the U.S. or any society if 80% of movies were made by Nigerian people, Nigerian people owned every television station, and most record labels, and Nigerian people ran the Federal Reserve, and most banks, and Nigerian people were over-represented in almost every branch of government, etc.? You really can't see why that would be a problem?

       I am accomplishing nothing against an influx of hate-illed people.  I've gotten a couple people banned for it and at least one pst removed but based on the rules, you can just post a video of a Hitler speech glorifying the message that white Americans must rise up against the Jews (and unspoken, but a part of white supremacist doctrine the other non-white people who are their pawns) and it won't be banned because they didn't use a slur; they just said all Jews are evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get your point but sometimes fighting the good fight is a complete waste of time.  Reddit is run by extremistss now.  Whether pro-Israel Hasbara types in /worldnews re anything involving Israel/Palestine or antisemites who pretend that they're not antisemites while decrying the cultural trend that motivates them to deny being antisemites...  The point is I don't give a shit any more.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has gone from a forum for duscussion of conspiracies to one of how evil Jews are and if you disagree you are downvoted to oblivion so no wone will read well thought coments, only hatemongering.

       Yet the frontpage is mostly politics, not 'hatemongering'. I just quickly looked at the top 50 posts and there's one post critical of dual-citizen Jews, one. I personally don't see Jews as the primal source of all evil in the world and inherently evil, Aaron Swartz's life makes a mockery of anyone who claims this. There sure are some shady fuckers though

       i find the jewish powerblock in this nation to be very dangerous and debilitating to this nation.  if you know a better way to describe the jewish power block, im all ears. but until then, yeah, its the jews. maybe not all of em, but there arent enough of em that arent part of the problem to matter.   and yeah 'zionism' is more than jews.  dont you worry about them, there are other fish to fry first.

       Here's a better way to describe "the Jewish power block" (I think you mean bloc BTW): A small minority of Jews are a part of a non-religiously oriented class of ultra-rich individuals and families who unscrupulously use their wealth and connections to alter the lives of many others in order to suit their own goals.

       It's funny how you generalize everything you don't like about politics and economics with three letters.  The world requires in depth explanation, far more than I gave.  You can just stick with arbitrary defamation of a certain group but that doesn't mean it reflects reality.

       its real enough that jews have been expelled 109 times from 84 countries.  thats the clinical definition of a shitty track record, and certainly demands a level of scrutiny not needed with other groups of similar population numbers, such as Laplander-Americans.

       Being a consistent religious minority sucks.  Jews haven't been expleeled from any nations as recently as would be relevant to Laplander-Americans.  The vast majority of the expulsions and pogroms came during a time and in a place where and when Christians persecuted other Christians for being the wrong kind of Christians.  What do you expect would happen to members of a small and relatively prosperous non-Christian religion?  Scapegoating for everything that goes wrong which is exactly what's going on in this now irrational sub.

       Btw, it's not conspiratorial at all to go to a conspiracy site and start demanding that one group become off limits. But your just doing, like I said, what's in your nature. Criminalising anti Semitic opinions is always on the to do list, intellectual freedom be damned.
