    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say part of that is to create the same situation as ww2 in Europe. Everyone hates the Muslims, they get interned, ten years from now they get the Muslim nations states as outlined in the new map for the Middle East. Shia state, Sunni state, Kurdish state, and making Mecca to medina the Islamic state. Same way they moved people around in India and Pakistan. Take another generation to ferment more hate between each Muslim group. Then they can have another amazing war, then they can malgamate the Middle East in say 75-100 years. </p>

<p>We think in hours, they think in centuries. People can&#39;t even remember what happened yesterday, let alone plan a generation ahead. That&#39;s why we&#39;re peasants and the rulers are rulers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not even sure I know how to interpret what you are saying.  I mean I definitely recognize the words, they just somehow seem to lose their meaning and only confuse me when strung together like this.  It seems like you are saying the islamic plan was to create refugees?  So they suckered the US in to obliterating them so they would appear to be refugees, which are actually a vanguard for an islamic invasion? Which of course must now occur since their actual homes cities, hospitals and schools have been shelled?  Strikes me that arranging for the destruction of your own country is not the best way to invade another.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why else would Turkey be trying to kick off world war 3?</p>

<p>Little known fact: Israel, who hunts down and kills former Nazi SS leaders involved strictly administratively with the concentration camps, repeatedly has denied the Armenian genocide of 1.5 million that occurred under the Ottoman Turks for political reasons. It&#39;s a felony in many countries to deny the holocaust, yet, the entire nation pushing for these laws denies the killings of 1.5 million Armenians. </p>

<p>All the billions given for &quot;AID&quot; to Israel are funding weapons of war to be used against civilians.</p>

<p>Turkey has repeatedly demanded NATO interference in it&#39;s operations against Russia, and violated cease fires. &quot;CIA weapons&quot; are being sold openly on terrorist marketplaces, and terrorist are driving toyota trucks gifted by Obama. Not to mention the billions in money being funneled to them by Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>it&#39;s only a matter of time until shit kicks off. The next US  president will decide whether or not to send thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of young European and American men to die in the meat grinder. This is very, very serious my friends and should be watched closely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know that turkey is just the jumping point for Isis. Turkey isn&#39;t directly responsible for their creation. The cia is most likely responsible for the official creation of Isis. And most likely Hillary Clinton and her cronies. They took gadaffis arms and shipped them to turkey. Then they ordered the Iraq army to stand down in the initial invasion to give them American military vehicles for the operation. </p>

<p>Remember Isis only became nessesary after the un shot down the initia invasion of Syria. Back then Kerry was pushing for using Jordan and turkey as base of op for &quot;rebels&quot; aka paid foreign mercenaries. </p>

<p>The people didn&#39;t buy the freedom bullshit so the Isis psyop became a staple. 3 years ago no American wanted to touch Syria, one fake video of a beheading was all it took. Isis was already officially being supported by the us, but the rebranding as the bogey man was needed to sway public opinion. </p>

<p>Like I said in the other post I made people have zero ability to remember and retain info. If they did they would have laughed at this Isis bullshit. People ultimately love a good holywood style propaganda flick. It&#39;s like the last 15 years of BS never even happened. The liberals that hated war now love it again. It&#39;s mind blowing. Obama got a peace prize for starting 3-4 wars. Lol. I shouldn&#39;t be laughing but at this point what else can I do. </p>

<p>now they even push NATO-propaganda with billions because EU-civilians dont believe this shit anymore and are ANTI-war</p>

<p>so an organisation like this has a lot room for terrorists like turkey ...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A couple of thoughts.</p>

<p>One, if we were getting the whole story from the news, you&#39;d think there would be a lot more outrage over Turkey&#39;s little &quot;adventures&quot;.</p>

<p>Two, it may very well be the the Turks are doing some kind of dirty work in exchange for Erdogan&#39;s family getting a chance to make piles of $$$ off that ISIS oil.</p>

<p>It might also be evidence that ISIS is kind of fake and nobody really gives a fuck (at the top level) whether Turkey is helping them out or not.</p>

<p>Last thought. There seems to have been a pretty strong effort to ignore/downplay the Turkey-ISIS connection. A common reaction over at <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> is that this story is just Russian propaganda that they&#39;re putting out to get even with the Turks.</p>

As long as they&#39;re in NATO they can do whatever they want and are essentially untouchable, this allows the US and it&#39;s Globalist employers to use Turkey as a proxy to pull whatever shady destabilizing shit they want in the middle east without themselves looking bad to the public. The average voter will hate/blame turkey instead of their own government, turkey will be protected from the geopolitical consequences of their actions, the usual suspects will get richer and the rest of us get fucked over.</p>

<p>Stories critical of the Turkish government took off in 2013 with the Gezi Park protests:</p>

<p>&#39;A wave of demonstrations and civil unrest in Turkey began on 28 May 2013, initially to contest the urban development plan for Istanbul&#39;s Taksim Gezi Park. The protests were sparked by outrage at the violent eviction of a sit-in at the park protesting the plan. Subsequently, supporting protests and strikes took place across Turkey, protesting a wide range of concerns at the core of which were issues of freedom of the press, of expression, assembly, and the government&#39;s encroachment on Turkey&#39;s secularism.&#39;</p>

<p>Then the Turkish government banned youtube and twitter: </p>

<p>Isis is also the name of a very important Egyptian goddess the occult elite is trying to summon. It&#39;s how they want to create the NWO (The Age of Horus). Horus is the child of Isis in Egyptian mythology. Aleister Crowley -- poster child of the satanic elite ruling this world -- talked about the New Age as the &quot;Age of Horus&quot;. Crowley was coincidentally also the father of Barbara Bush. </p>

<p>The Statue of Liberty is based on Lucifer and Isis, btw. </p>

<p>By plastering the term &quot;Isis&quot; in the media all the time and thus influencing the public consciousness, the elite is hoping to summon the spirit of the ancient Egyptian goddess in this world. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>But why would they want to drag themselves into a potential war with Russia?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The United States, at Israel&#39;s behest, wants control of Syria without actually confronting Russia head on. Thus they use Turkey as their proxy and can blame the misgivings on the rogue state. ISIS is a creation of the CIA and Israel&#39;s Mossad. It serves the dual purpose of helping overthrow Assad as well as fostering a general consensus that the &#39;war on terror&#39; should continue and be well funded (guess who prospers when there are wars - the Military Industrial Complex). btw, that term was coined by Republican President Dwight D Eisenhower on January 17, 1961 in his farewell address where he warned us that their undue influence on American foreign policy would keep America at perpetual war (think he was right?). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex</a>
Guess who benefits most from the profits of the Military Industrial Complex. The .0001%, who own half of all the wealth in the US, and their Wall Street Investment banks. Care to take a stab at the nationality/religion of most of these people? Hint - Marcus Goldman, Samuel Sachs, Lloyd Blankfein, Ben Bernanke, Larry Summer, Paul Volcker, Timothy Geithner, Jamie Dimon, Alan Greenspan, Paul Wolfowitz, Hank Paulson, Richard Perle. I am neither bigoted nor a racist. I am only stating facts. Cui Bono - to whose benefit. Follow the money. I will stop here and let you learn the rest on your own. The rabbit hole is deep. Do some digging.</p>
