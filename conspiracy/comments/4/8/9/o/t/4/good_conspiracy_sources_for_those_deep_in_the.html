I&#39;ve been asked on countless occasions to guest on radio shows and podcasts, but I decline them all.</p>

<p>Since your focus is on language as a cultural explanation, what do you think of John Allegro&#39;s book &quot;The Mushroom and the Cross&quot;?  He&#39;s got a similar take, his is with translations and transliterations across similar languages of adjacent or historically successive civilizations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I learned it from youtube! Actually, it was from the <a href="https://corporationnationradioarchives.wordpress.com/2014/02/27/radio-show-number-89-february-27-2014/">Corporation Nation with Clint Richardson</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ChristianRemedyInLaw">Daniel from Christian Remedy In Law.</a> I recommend listening to Clint&#39;s show with Daniel first to get a better understanding.</p>

<p>Then, start acquiring original copy books from local thrift stores, estate sales, garage sales, amazon, etc. Once you have a few, keep them close so whenever you see or hear a word that might have a different meaning then what you&#39;ve thought or have been taught, look it up. First in an unabridged dictionary if possible, as this will have more words and longer definitions then a college dictionary. Read everything about the word that is printed and understand what it signifies. Then &quot;as above, so below&quot; look at the word above and below your original word and their definitions. If you have a thesaurus, look up the word, and then go back to you dictionary to define any word you didn&#39;t know the meaning to from the thesaurus. Give yourself some time, and be ready to curse out loud. If you&#39;re still looking to fry your brain, pick up Blacks Law or Bouviers and dive into the matrix. Want more? Pick up the bible and use the concordance to find the meanings of its words.</p>

<p>I have yet to read John&#39;s book, but look forward to it :-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed.</p>

<p>&quot;It is easier to trick someone, than it is to convince them that they&#39;ve been tricked&quot;.  - Mark Twain</p>

<p>Edit: It&#39;s everywhere, without our realizing it. For instance, the statement, &quot;Sort of like orwellian language control.&quot; Adjectives add flair to the main noun, but can never change the root meaning. So the statement shrinks down to, &quot;Sort of like control&quot;, and that it what it&#39;s all about, control. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Outside my own work...I recommend the following:</p>

<p>Secret Societies and Psychological Warfare, Michael A Hoffman (elite twilight language etc)</p>

<p>The Secret Teaching of All Ages, Manly P Hall (for mystery religion)</p>

<p>Fritz Springmeier, any of his stuff for elite &#39;bloodlines&#39; etc.</p>

<p>Blood on the Altar, Craig Heimbichner (for OTO).</p>

<p>Dope Inc, by EIR (historic global banking/drug cartel and British Empire)</p>

<p>Programmed To Kill, Dave McGowan (serial killers, military/govt program)</p>

<p>Hypnotism, George Estabrooks (CIA, mind control), I have a copy but prices are now through the roof!</p>

<p>Comyns Beaumont, generally any, for ancient pre-history and religious practices etc. Again, now very, very pricey books!</p>

<p>The Sync Book I &amp; II, Alan Abbadessa (synchronicity, which I was supposed to contribute to, but I ended up declining.)</p>

<p>Those are some of my choices.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I might recommend None Dare Call it a Conspiracy by Gary Allen, just to get a sense of the political (described as hard right wing) argument against the so called NWO.  Allen was a major figure in the John Birch Society, which has actively been promoting the idea that there is a long term conspiracy to develop a socialist world government.  You can read Marrs or Icke or Cooper or listen to Alex Jones, but they&#39;re less academic in their approach and take a lot of their info/ political screed from the JBS, so you might as well start with something more rounded (albeit politically charged and &quot;extremist&quot;)</p>

<p>Here are books by academics who are involved in forming and delivering the &quot;NWO&quot;:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Open Conspiracy - HG Wells</p></li>
<li><p>The New World Order - HG Wells</p></li>
<li><p>The Grand Chessboard - Zbigniew Brzezinski</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Brzezinski started the Trilateral Commission with David Rockefeller and also presided over the CFR, the sister society of Chatham House (RIIA) in the UK.  These are primary hierarchical organizations in disseminating agenda among the political &quot;elite&quot; in the west.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Brief_History_of_the_Future">A Brief History of the Future</a> - Jaques Attali (Former adviser to President François Mitterrand and first president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>The prospective part begins at the third chapter, which predicts the fall of the US Empire before the end of the ninth form of capitalism, estimated to take place around 2035.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Edward Bernays - Propaganda</li>
</ul>

<p>Bernays is the founder of Modern PR and explains how PR is used to manipulate public opinion.  Check out Adam Curtis&#39; century of self for a great documentary on the subject.</p>

<p>Here are books by academic authors with access to the &quot;inner circle&quot;:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Trap - Sir James Goldsmith</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an insider look at trade agreements and how they are leading to a long planned New World Order.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PQrz8F0dBI">Here he in on Charlie Rose in 1994 talking about GATT</a></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Tragedy and Hope - Carol Quigley</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Historian Carroll Quigley claimed that the Round Table Groups were connected to a secret society, which South African diamond baron Cecil Rhodes is believed to have set up with similar goals. Rhodes was believed by some to have formed this secret society in his lifetime. This secret society is supposed to have been named the Society of the Elect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some good choices there.  I note you included &#39;elite one world cheerleader and programmer&#39; HG Wells. I see Jimmy Goldsmith too, he was very rabidly anti-EU (EU, the Orwellian/Wellsian nightmare come true) and rightly so, it&#39;s the European wing of the NWO.  I read Sutton&#39;s book on Wall St and Hitler and that was a good read also.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trust me...there is nothing trivial about my writing, it is meticulously sourced and cross-referenced to hell and back. None of this is easy to explain (how could it be?), it takes a lot of work putting these things together...I&#39;m just one man battling against a multi-billion dollar industry.</p>

<p>My main areas are &#39;mass group mind&#39; MSM manipulation (mainly via entertainment, stealth brainwashing), mystery religion (masonry/OTO) and global events.</p>

<p>There is nothing trivial about brainwashing/influencing entire societies (not imo) and it is even less trivial when &#39;barely veiled&#39; nefarious propaganda techniques, are employed via mass media and its full spectrum dominance over the lives of virtually everyone.</p>

<p>mystery religion (masonry/OTO)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>here&#39;s my problem, though.  Masonry and OTO are cults based on the mystery schools.  The catholic church and scientology use the same structure and similar rites.  They&#39;re emblematic of a structure and system of power, and no doubt they&#39;ve had their own influence.  They teach a concept and act as fraternities for initiates.  But JayZ or Katy Perry flashing a theosophic symble or the mano carnuto, doesn&#39;t mean that they are &quot;in the illuminati&quot;.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s one thing to deconstruct Albert Pike or Manly P Hall, but when every occult or esoteric symbol is used to prove somebody is at the top of the pyramid, it loses meaning.  There a lot of people in secret societies.  Most of them just use it for networking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t be a deliberate fool.  OTO is the &#39;academia masonica&#39; (the super rite of collective masonry, distilled into 11 degrees), these puppets/marionettes are used to seed and promote the OTO agenda...whether they&#39;re fully fledged members of the inner circle is irrelevant, they are at least pawns, one way or the other. Why else do you think that the pattern of this, is so easy to identify and spot?  It is launched and promoted like a form of viral marketing. Mystery Religion/Masonry/OTO...IS symbolism, that is the whole point and why this is so crucial!!!</p>

<p>You really need to brush-up on Mystery Religion, your understanding of it is severely limited...its source goes back to ancient Egypt. The Catholic Church promotes the idea of an external deity...OTO teaches that &#39;man IS god&#39;...the polar opposite! OTO merely borrows &#39;ceremonial&#39; aspects from the Jesuits, not its beliefs ffs! The fact that you fail to appreciate this clear distinction, displays a form of ignorance/misunderstanding on these matters. Show me where the Catholic Church have advocated that ultimately &#39;MAN IS GOD&#39;...please enlighten me!</p>

<p>&quot;One of the founding tenets of the OTO is to shape and manage American popular culture&quot;  <em>Craig Heimbichner - OTO Blood on the Altar</em></p>

<p>Yes...and I&#39;ve found much of their occult activity secreted everywhere throughout MSM culture, some &#39;veiled&#39;, &#39;barely veiled&#39; and outright &#39;overt&#39;.</p>

<p>Are you able to explain to me...the reason for the exponential increase in &#39;mystery religion&#39; (mainly via MSM) content (veiled or otherwise) that has and is being flooded throughout popular culture? Don&#39;t you find it strange, that MSM is seeding and promoting this type of phenomena and increasingly so? </p>

<p>I&#39;ll give you a point for mentioning Scientology, which is merely &#39;mystery religion&#39; but in slow-motion.  Hubbard was a Crowley (OTO) adherent, who worked with Parsons (Crowley disciple and Pasadena OTO head).</p>

<p>Hey, listen...I didn&#39;t mean to call you a fool (I take it back), I just find this sort of explaining very, very frustrating. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you still have to read between the lines on some things.</p>

<p>For instance, look at where this praise is coming from for Antony C Sutton&#39;s work:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In his book Between Two Ages: America&#39;s Role in the Technetronic Era (New York: Viking Press;1970), Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;For impressive evidence of Western participation in the early phase of Soviet economic growth, see Antony C. Sutton&#39;s Western Technology and Soviet Economic Development: 1917–1930, which argues that &#39;Soviet economic development for 1917–1930 was essentially dependent on Western technological aid&#39; (p.283), and that &#39;at least 95 per cent of the industrial structure received this assistance.&#39; (p. 348).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Professor Richard Pipes, of Harvard, said in his book, Survival Is Not Enough: Soviet Realities and America&#39;s Future (Simon &amp; Schuster;1984):</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;In his three-volume detailed account of Soviet Purchases of Western Equipment and Technology ... Sutton comes to conclusions that are uncomfortable for many businessmen and economists. For this reason his work tends to be either dismissed out of hand as &#39;extreme&#39; or, more often, simply ignored.&quot; (p. 290) </p>
