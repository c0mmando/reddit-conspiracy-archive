<p>&quot;Judge Andrew Napolitano warns &#39;She should be terrified of the fact that he’s been granted immunity,&quot; adding that &quot;they would not be immunizing him and thereby inducing him to spill his guts unless they wanted to indict someone.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;The Judge explained that only a federal judge can grant immunity and will only do so if a sitting jury is ready to hear testimony from the &#39;immunized person,&#39; suggesting the investigation is well on its way to a possible indictment.</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;We also know they are going to seek someone’s indictment, because they would not be immunizing him and thereby inducing him to spill his guts unless they wanted to indict someone,&#39; he said.&quot;</p>

<p>Let&#39;s just hope they put the poor guy in witness protection...</p>

<p>and someone on another thread made this comment:  She has reportedly threatened a sort of &#39;information samson option&#39; - if she is indicted, she will reveal all of her shady deals which are widespread and heinous enough to bring down the federal government. (Bring it on)</p>

<p>Very interesting.  Do you by chance have a source for this &quot;information samson option&quot; claim?  That would be one way to try and prevent the indictment from being dropped.  I can only imagine the type of dirty laundry she has at her disposal.  </p>

<p>And I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re &quot;well-adjusted&quot;.  Your ability to quote Krishnamurti doesn&#39;t prevent you from still being part of the system - a tiny little shit cog in the big shit wheel of planetary enslavement.</p>
