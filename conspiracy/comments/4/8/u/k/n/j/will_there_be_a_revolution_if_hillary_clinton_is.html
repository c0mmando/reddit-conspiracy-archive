       In my adult life,  I've never, ever seen so much fever on both sides of the political isle against Hillary Clinton.  On the right,  this is one of the main reasons Donald Trump has been so successful,  and the left, one of the reasons Bernie Sanders has been so successful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can the left and right forces against Hillary Clinton join forces and revolt against the establishment of both parties,  and start a meaningful revolution?

       I think it will be Trump v. Sanders in the end. Something will happen regarding Hilary's scandals, and will be out. I think this is the plan, to further continue the illusion of our system. Also, both Trump and Sanders are collectivists, which plays into the NWO agenda, going on right now.

       It’ll be Trump vs. Biden, hopefully. Bernie might well die of a heart attack and there’s no way they’d let him get the nomination anyway.

       You underestimate TPTB's understanding of psychology. People always fight for the underdog. Give them this false illusion of victory, and well, they will continue buying into system. Bread and circus, and business as usual. Pretty simple tactic. It's basically manufactured consent. Reverse psychology.

       I will be very surprised if it ends up Trump vs. Sanders.   These are both anti-establishment candidates,  which leaves the establishment without any choice.   I am actually hoping for this scenario,  but when you factor in the super delegates,  and the possibility of a brokered convention,  I see no way for Sanders, and perhaps Donald Trump to make the nominees.

       most of the people who carry guns in our country, as in police and military, aren't rich and they lost homes and pensions and they are sick of her shit and what's been going on in this country.  i can see it being bernie after the FBI arrests her.  people at the FBI have said they will go public if needed, they are sick of her getting away with murder.

       Very interesting.  Do you by chance have a source for this "information samson option" claim?  That would be one way to try and prevent the indictment from being dropped.  I can only imagine the type of dirty laundry she has at her disposal.

       maybe. that'd be a good time for a huge, multi-city nuclear false flag - aka, 'the sampson option'. lock down the country into martial law for our own protection.

      <p>
       meanwhile 'isis' (mercenaries) stage ongoing terrorist attacks. sometimes they attack resistance elements. sometimes the resistance elements are labeled 'isis' and destroyed by dhs.

       There should be, but there wasn't after 911, so I wouldn't be surprised if we the sheeple continue to do nothing but huff and puff and come on reddit and gripe and complain and rant and rave but then make sure and go to sleep at a decent hour so we won't show up late for our pencil pushing 9 to 5 the next day.

       Okay.  Well...now the pieces have been put together...and look at us.  We're still making sure we go to sleep at a decent hour so we don't wake up late for our pencil pushing 9 to 5 the next day.

       And I'm not saying you're "well-adjusted".  Your ability to quote Krishnamurti doesn't prevent you from still being part of the system - a tiny little shit cog in the big shit wheel of planetary enslavement.

       Civil disobedience is extremely necessary, but that won't happen much if at all without a serious communal effort.  Individually? that will happen very little if at all.

       It’ll be Trump vs. Biden, hopefully. Bernie might well die of a heart attack and there’s no way they’d let him get the nomination anyway.

       I will be very surprised if it ends up Trump vs. Sanders.   These are both anti-establishment candidates,  which leaves the establishment without any choice.   I am actually hoping for this scenario,  but when you factor in the super delegates,  and the possibility of a brokered convention,  I see no way for Sanders, and perhaps Donald Trump to make the nominees.
