       If you consider yourself an open minded person, at least read through this, i don't give a shit about the down votes, at least allow the other side to talk after you downvote it.

       Mitch McConnell, last week said even if the GOP selects Trump that they will drop him. Whether this means they'll run another candidate against him as a third party or they'll outright tell the registered Republican party voter to piss off and deny the rightfully elected nominee, which in itself is against the very basics of a Republic.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this doesn't scream that he isn't one of them I don't know what would.

       First it was Jeb! that was slotted as the guy to take on Clinton from the beginning, even before he announce he'd run, he was the favorite by far. Trump announced the very next day. And we all know what happened to Jeb after that. Then Rubio became their horse, now Rubio is failing. What are they to do now? Can't get behind Cruz, because he's as anti-establishment as any. Carson's clearly in Trump's corner and Kasich may be as well, if not, he doesn't hold enough weight anyway. Maybe we'll find out their next move within the next 24 hours or so. Bet your ass it will be Romney v Trump in the end of this thing and it will legitimately be Establishment v Trump with Romney carrying the Hillary/Bill/W/H.W/Rubio/Boehner/McConnell/Obama torch.

       ^  Here is where Romney will announce his campaign, expect Rubio to bow out and endorse Romney immediately.

       This is the most cut and dry example of straight up political civil war that is happening right now. The people want Trump, you personally may not, but as a whole the people across all demographics want Trump. The media is doing its damndest to push the bullshit. Trying to portray supporters as backwoods, toothless, racists. As well as trying to make him come off as some sort of nazi.

       Trump is the guy that everyone here has been waiting for. He wants to audit the fed, he wants to do away with NAFTA and the rest of these garbage trade deals, he wants to expose the truth behind 9/11. This is

       , you have a guy that has hi-jacked one half of this monster that is our government. And they are panicking.

      <p>
       For those of you that already understand this, disregard, but i see a lot of anti-trump on here and honestly IMO if he doesn't get the nomination it will only solidify my speculations i have. At that point there will be no hope left for this country.

       By the way he disavowed the KKK asshole the
       <em>
        first

       time it was ever brought up, and several times afterwards but here we are a week later and they are still smearing him.

       Just my 2 cents. If you don't like him, why? He is literally what we all have been asking for.

       i'm no fan of trump that is for sure but you make good points, i mean hell i would vote for trump over hilary for sure.
but do i really want to see trump as president? fuck no, but then you stop and wonder well who if not him?
      </p>
      <p>
       personally i support Sanders, but its becoming pretty clear the DNC will do everything they can to reject him and i would rather deal with trump than Hilary.

       so personally my top three are
1) Bernie
2) Trump
3) kill myself

       this is really conflicting as i want them to succeed in becoming president and hopefully cleaning this shit up (or at least in trumps case give it a try) but i am also a bit excited to see TPTB fuck up by killing one of them and getting the real party started.

       I said this in another thread and it sums up my feelings well: Trump is the best candidate, because almost all the things he says are what we need. As we all know, politicians tend to be dishonest with their platform, so he could just be lying. But, if he is elected, only one of three things could happen:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Trump does the things he promises, the whole country moves in a positive direction
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         He's in on the NWO scheme, which is the norm so that would be the "control" option of this little experiment. No changes.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         He's batshit crazy and he ruins the country. The people get fed up and final revolt.
        </p>

       Not a big trump fan here, but it IS refreshing to see someone say what they will.  I have never seen a politician speak so freely. (because he is not a politician).  About the KKK...that is a f-ing joke.  If anything it is a clear condemnation of the journalistic class.  Trump is battling two fronts and the Democrats couldn't be happier.  They are convinced he can't win a general election, and they are probably right.  So the GOP has dropped the ball again, splintered, and continuing their downward spiral.  Side note:  Superdelegates, lobbyists and
 superpacs will be the end of us.

       Just because Trump is shaking things up and creating a whirlwind for the Republican party doesn't mean he is the answer to our problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is a smart man (to an extent) and he knows what the general public wants to hear, he knows we're fed up with big government and the diminishing middle class, but this isn't NEWS. Everyone is aware of this fact, he is only using it to sway us that his approach is going to somehow be different.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's basically the same argument that Bernie is making on the other side. Neither of them actually adhere to their party's fundamentals, and are pushing to get the popular vote by saying what the people want to hear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry to be a pessimist about elections but if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Especially when it comes to politics.

       Trump definitely doesn't hold any principles that I share, and I don't think he's the "answer" in any way. Having said this, he is now playing a very critical role in exposing the elite and the true motivations of the party leaders - they could care less about the people - their only interest is maintaining their grasp on power, money, and war.
      </p>
      <p>
       For this reason alone, he is playing an incredibly valuable role, and I thank him.

       The problem is that Trump has absolutely no way of making his list of promises happen. He will be subject to the same agenda any other nominee will be when they take the office. Add to that the sociopathic tendencies and the cadre of Authoritarian Americans who believe in a Unitary Executive trying to propel him to power, and you bet your ass any logical adult is unsettled by his rise to power.
      </p>
      <p>
       His snubbing by the GOP means literally nothing for his qualifications to lead this country. In fact, I'd say it's a indicator of what little grasp of reality the GOP still has.

       Alright, first off, Trump is a BluffMaster. Almost everything he said is a lie.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         He is self funded guy. 
A: No, he inherited millions. That is not self funded.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         He runs business efficiently and would balance the budget.
A: No, he has filed for at least 4 chapter 11 due to excessive debt.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Thousands Muslims dancing on 9/11.
A: Not credible. No robust evidence. In fact there is actual evidence of 5 Israelis who were caught by NJPD with explosives and one witness seeing them jubilant on 9/11.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         He said all of his products are great and people love him for that.
A:

       Yeah, none of those videos have him saying he supports her. He says nice things about her and Bill, but he's even asked the question whether he supports her or not. And he won't answer.

       When you make a claim you need to back it up with a source. The cute google for you thing only works if I were randomly asking a question. I simply asked you to prove your case and it seems like you can't.
