<p>Only 25% believe the US&#39;s version of the conspiracy theory.

<p>You started all of this by attacking anyone who doubts the Bush/Cheney story as &quot;insane&quot;, and then to boot you supported your viewpoint by stating a blatant falsehood about world opinions on the subject. You&#39;re clearly deeply ingrained and partisan about this subject and I think that your passive-aggressive attacks against those who doubt the official story are a result of projection.</p>

<p>Sure the story may have been buried pretty early, but the fact that even with all that secrecy one reporter was able to gain so much insight is astounding and shows that people are pretty bad at keeping secrets. There are numerous documented leaks from the Manhattan project, but most conspiracy theories that require large numbers of people simply don&#39;t have the same level of documented exposure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tell them about Project A119 - top secret plan to detonate a nuclear bomb on the moon:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A young Carl Sagan was part of the team responsible for predicting the effects of a nuclear explosion in low gravity and in evaluating the scientific value of the project. The project documents remained secret for nearly 45 years, and despite Reiffel&#39;s revelations, the United States government has never officially recognized its involvement in the study.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>In the application, Sagan gave details of the project research, which Davidson felt constituted a violation of national security. The leak consisted of Sagan revealing the titles of two classified papers from the A119 project—the 1958 paper Possible Contribution of Lunar Nuclear Weapons Detonations to the Solution of Some Problems in Planetary Astronomy, and the 1959 paper Radiological Contamination of the Moon by Nuclear Weapons Detonations.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>As a result of the publicity the correspondence created, a freedom of information request was lodged concerning Project A119. It was only then that A Study of Lunar Research Flights – Volume I was made public, over forty years after its inception.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So? I&#39;m not arguing that a lot of people claimed to have heard explosions or whatever. I am arguing that there is no comparison to the witnesses and whistle blowers of the Catholic Church abuses and the Manhattan Project to the witnesses at 9/11. The former were people who were intimately involved with the situations and knew exactly what was going on. The latter were people who were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time and testified to seeing or hearing whatever.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is that one of the biggest flaws in 9/11 conspiracy theories is that not a single person involved in the actual conspiracy has come forward, which destroys the entire argument that OP is trying to make.</p>

So we have &quot;in the vicinity of Vesey Street&quot;, &quot;several blocks&quot; from the
crash site, &quot;a few blocks&quot; from the crash site.  The problem is, these are
either in the wrong direction, or are the wrong distance.  The Vesey Street
or front of 7WTC claims have the passport travelling in exactly the wrong
direction, and it seems whoever made this up forgot which flight Suqami was
supposed to be on.  AA Flight 11&#39;s impact with the northeast facade was
almost dead centre, and the building&#39;s core absorbed much of the aircraft.
Some of the densest parts from AA Flights 11 and 175, such as landing gear
and an engine, passed right through the Towers and were found several blocks
away from the crash site.  The vast majority of the debris remained in the
Towers, and there were no other reports of parts bouncing back.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK.  I agree with OP. How the church hide the <em>rampant</em> pedophilia within their ranks (and have for centuries) is a good example of a large group of people keeping a nasty secret from the public eye, much like the perps of 911 could arrange. All involved have a vested interest in keeping the secret whether it is wealth or power or a continuing life. </p>

<p>Now, back to that passport thing...</p>

The Church has just been good at keeping it away from public eyes. But no matter how many people dug and delved, assuming that the conspiracies are true, not one person of the thousands <em>directly involved</em> in the planning and execution of the 9/11 attacks has come forward.</p>

They are labeled as paranoid idiots who&#39;s opinion is not worth listening to.

And they continue predicting, that everything will be screwed up very soon for years and years and nothing happens. Which makes everyone who listens to them and talk about it look like nuts.

    <div class="md"><p>It was kind of an open secret. There were news articles published about it for decades. Anyone who did an ounce of research would have found numerous court cases, cover ups, victims, and indictments. It&#39;s just that the Church made a huge effort to ensure that it never receives any national attention or headlines. There were always plenty of people who were first hand witnesses and/or victims that were willing to speak out, they just didn&#39;t really have an outlet for it.</p>

<p>The Manhattan Project that another user mentioned, was completely different. Every country was working on an A-Bomb. The concept was well understood by that time, they just didn&#39;t have the implementation. Similarly, everyone knew that <em>something</em> was going on at Los Alamos, and most probably suspected it had something to do with The Bomb. It was just that no one working on it was going to blab. Furthermore, it was wartime. The US public was very adept and compliant at keeping government secrets, thanks to a massive propaganda campaign.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>people often debate brave new world vs 1984.  The thing that resonates about both Wells and Huxley is that they were both part of the elite science/ technology community, and had considerable insights into the philosophies which drove the evolution of society.</p>

<p>The fabian-esque agenda that Wells pushes in his &quot;New World Order&quot; and &quot;The Open Conspiracy&quot; isn&#39;t original to him.  The concept of incremental socialism (attributed to the Fabian Society and UK Labor Party) isn&#39;t unique.  It IS a pervading and ubiquitous ideology among an elite political class, but they will tell you that it&#39;s not, if you ask.  It is an open conspiracy, which will be denied out one side of the mouth while a two step forward and one back approach is maintained to fulfill an agenda.</p>

<p>Wells isn&#39;t predicting so much as he is laying out an agenda.  Huxley is delivering a warning, as is Orwell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the main problem with this, and the reason it has never fully came to be, is that the people who started it are already dead. And a lot of these groups and their resources have been taken over by people who do not share the original goal, and instead have perused their own. Instituting a global conspiracy in pieces was a great plan, but a human&#39;s life span is only so long...</p>

<p>Just look at the left in america. On one hand we have all these socialists who were trained/educated in the 60s and 70s, who fight to tear down their own country in the name of so called social progress, and on other hand they are directly allied with radical muslims that want to institute an oppressive global caliphate and even more horrible chinese communists who want to create their own global chinese dynasty. How did this happen? When the soviet&#39;s pulled out their funding and support, a power vacuum was created. The puppeteer walked away from the play and these two groups wandered in and filled the void. They talk the talk, and they walk the walk, and the left who only knows how to obey mindless rhetoric, falls in line with two groups who are blatantly opposed to the things they claim to support. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>honestly, i don&#39;t even understand the omelette metaphor, but you did a better job with it than i wouldve.</p>

<p>I have my own concerns about world order.  Centralization is natural, but it doesn&#39;t consider the human.  When someone on this sub talks about New World Order, it refers to the negative aspects of western global hegemony and a dystopian 1984/ brave new world future.  When someone in a &quot;debunking&quot; sub refers to the term- they&#39;ve characterizing it as a ridiculous, paranoid &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;.  When George HW or Kissinger refer to it, they&#39;re talking about dominating global trade and arms in competition with China/ Russia, a step towards Wells&#39; goal of an authoritarian but just world system of governance.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have solutions.  I have concerns and objections.  I think caroll quigley took issue with the lack of transparency.  Chatham house rules means nobody talks about what is said outside of the walls of the organization.  You&#39;ve seen one leaked copy of bilderberg minutes.  The discretion is justified by giving people the forum to speak candidly without the inevitable reproach of soundbites, but the reality is that the PEOPLE would not appreciate the lack of voice in their governance, nor would we vote for what are seen as necessary changes which will negatively affect our individual lives for the &quot;benefit of society&quot;.  </p>

<p>&quot;why should I have to get a vaccine that might have side effects?  My likelihood of contracting measles is negligible.&quot;  but if we weren&#39;t scared into or MANDATED to get the vaccine, then not enough people would to grant the herd the immunity which makes the virus so scarce.  So THIS is the open conspiracy.  This is the honest conversation that I&#39;d like to have.  But if you bring up the fact that measles stories in the news ARE propaganda (regardless of the more honorable intentions they may serve), you&#39;re castigated.  We are not worthy of having these discussions.</p>

HG Well felt freedom to publish his thoughts in his Open Conspiracy book and why not, there wasn&#39;t bad intentions in there . . . naïve but not evil.

<p>In USSR it wasn&#39;t a dictatorship of the proletariat. That&#39;d be dictatorship by everyone meaning not centralized. Similar to how you can&#39;t have socialism in one country. And can&#39;t have the leadership of a socialist country centralized in one city, such as it was in Moscow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t tend to read &quot;evil&quot; or even selfish intentions for ANY large scale conspiracy.  I think the morality is different than my own, but I think people generally believe in their own intentions.</p>

<p>As far as Wells&#39; utopia and his documentation of it, I gather that this was greenlit by the Royal Society if not written on their behalf.  Interestingly, with regards to my former literary comparison- perhaps Huxley&#39;s book was too.  </p>

<p>IN fact, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Henry_Huxley">Huxley&#39;s grandfather</a> (who studied under and worked for Charles Darwin) was Wells&#39; mentor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that making &quot;difficult decisions&quot; can require a lack of empathy.  I think that there are certainly people in power who are sadistic, but probably more sociopaths than psychopaths.  </p>

<p>The interesting thing about 1984 in relation to this topic, is that 1984 is not the final product, but a step along the way to the global utopia.  It&#39;s about nationalism and a manufactured enemy as a means to subjugation and compliance of the population.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>not necessarily...  I think the rational is that they are benevolent rulers who bring order from the chaos.</p>

<p>I&#39;m playing devil&#39;s advocate here.  We&#39;re idealists.  In the real world, terrible things happen.  Sure, there are terrible people, but even normal people are capable of terrible things, and strength rules.  So would you rather have a strong neutral authoritarianism (who does some bad things in the name of balance) or a strong malicious totalitarianism?  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t necessarily believe that those are the two options, but I think a lot of people DO believe that, and to them- sacrifice is part of this order.  The idea of trading away your daughter to marry the enemy because it will benefit your family and your kingdom in the long run.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I&#39;m not supporting it.  I&#39;m an advocate of truth and pacifism.  That&#39;s for me, because that&#39;s part of my personality and I think there need to be people like me to keep a balance.  If everyone were like me in that regards, then there would be no wars.  But not everyone IS like that, so in that world, I see why there also need to who aren&#39;t like me.</p>

<p>As far as they&#39;re concerned, a war they can control is preferable over one they cannot, which leads to totalitarianism.  So they think that by supporting a more extreme version of islam to burn down the middle east/ islamic culture from the inside out, they can rebuild the temple in their own image.  Unsustainable systems are basically a built in kill switch, developed to suit their purpose and then self destruct.  It&#39;s why we support deposable dictators.  It&#39;s why the the economic system is cyclical by default.  It grows until it is too big for its environment, then collapses to be repurposed and rebuilt with whatever modifications are necessary for the next step towards the goal.</p>

<p>But the system currently requires faith, otherwise the chaos would be less easy to control.  That&#39;s why conspiracy theorism is dangerous- because it represents a lack of faith in the system, which points out the faults in the structure before the structure is supposed to be pulled.</p>

<p>I never specifically said it was a problem, but I&#39;m sure you can find many arguments against it- likely the same arguments that you would find against the EU or trade agreements which take power over government out of the people&#39;s hands and put it in the hands of technocracy/ plutocracy, bureaucracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the catholic church, being one of the most powerful political bodies in europe for over a thousand years, has constantly been accused of corruption and abuse during its entire existence. All the sub groups splitting off of catholism had less to do with their actual interpretations of the bible, and more to do with the fact that bishops and priests constantly abused their authority while justifying it as &#39;lol interpretations&#39; of the bible. This knowledge has been lost to modern audiences, since the socialists who push aethism heavily discourage any investigation into the history of the religions they denounce as primitive and backwards. Theology was, for a long time, essentially an extension of philosophy and it expounded a lot of good works which socialists refuse to admit exist since it conflicts with their version of history and why religions are bad. A side effect of this unspoken ban is that we also lose chunks of the church&#39;s normal history, including both it&#39;s crimes and it&#39;s achievements. </p>

<p>Never forget, the real reason the left has a hardon for hating the church in modern times isn&#39;t because of the child molesting, but because in the 1960s and 1970s, primarily Irish Catholic Lawyers and associated political groups fought strongly against the normalization of pornography, attempting to get it ruled that porn wasn&#39;t in fact protected &#39;free speech&#39;. </p>

<p>Ultimately any example you want to use to show that people in large groups can keep a secret is a bad example because to use that example, it must no longer be a secret. The only good examples of large groups keeping secrets must, almost by definition, still be secret.</p>

So we have &quot;in the vicinity of Vesey Street&quot;, &quot;several blocks&quot; from the
crash site, &quot;a few blocks&quot; from the crash site.  The problem is, these are
either in the wrong direction, or are the wrong distance.  The Vesey Street
or front of 7WTC claims have the passport travelling in exactly the wrong
direction, and it seems whoever made this up forgot which flight Suqami was
supposed to be on.  AA Flight 11&#39;s impact with the northeast facade was
almost dead centre, and the building&#39;s core absorbed much of the aircraft.
Some of the densest parts from AA Flights 11 and 175, such as landing gear
and an engine, passed right through the Towers and were found several blocks
away from the crash site.  The vast majority of the debris remained in the
Towers, and there were no other reports of parts bouncing back.</a></p>
