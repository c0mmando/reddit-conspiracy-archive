        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We&#39;ve said before freemasons are luciferians.  Gnostic globalists who exploit their hierarcy for it&#39;s compartmentalization and secrecy in order to abuse the lumpen masses.  That they commit treasonous acts for the cross and crown in order to abuse nonmasons.  </p>

<p>If you are a freemason you might get offended at that.  Whereas your defense is a natural, possibly a noble tendency, if you honestly believed your organization were wholesome and good.  But I believe you&#39;d do well to learn more.</p>

<p>And let me start by saying, I&#39;m not here to judge.  I don&#39;t care if your higher-ups worship lucifer, as I feel it&#39;s their right in a secular society that respects an individual&#39;s choice of which dieties to worship.  I don&#39;t condemn pagans or wiccans, I know a few.</p>

<p>But you don&#39;t see them spiriting away wards of the state to brainwash them into assassinhood or sex robotry; or shooting unknowing people with raytheon microwave devices; gangstalking them and cutting brakes on their cars; spying on them with stingrays; or controlling public opinion through scripts along with an army of liars.</p>

<p>In addition to those things I mentioned, I don&#39;t like lying, organizing in secrect, spycraft, false representation, and conspiracy.  Conspiracy is what a secret society engages in, if it turns out they commit crimes; which they certainly provably do and have done. (Murder, Prostitution, Police bribery (Jester club / Hellfire club) and P2 are examples).</p>

<p>My warning to potential or current low-level freemasons is this: you had better know what you&#39;re getting into.  If you want power and you know they are luciferians: fine, go for it.  I hope you get everything you have coming.  I just don&#39;t like the idea that some old goats pulled the wool of over a sheep&#39;s eyes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you know anything about psychology, reading the bible from that perspective, the old testament god jehovah was psychopathic manipulator with possibly borderline personality disorder (&quot;I hate you, don&#39;t leave me&quot;) -- an entity with a boundary-disrepecting (asking sacrifice of a persons children or livestock (ie: injuring their livelihood)), manipulative personality betraying paranoia and irrational fears of abandonment.  </p>

<p>Then, immediately after all this abuse and improper demands, this entity rebrands itself as an ever-loving god Jesus.</p>

<p>You are talking about a religion designed to create disempowered, dysrgulated monarchs yes-bots.  It&#39;s a trick.  You all fell for it.</p>

<p>I agree with others here, there&#39;s nothing wrong with gnosticism and magic; but I would add the stipulation:</p>

<p>That humans should be worshipping art, science and themselves since we are the authors of said art and science (ie man; ie: &quot;the temple of man&quot;, ie: the pyramids were a temple to worship MAN).  We created everything around us.  We didn&#39;t steal fire from the gods.  It happened around us by natural forces and we figured it out.  No gods needed.  It was an emergent property of the operating system of reality around us.  You can say lucifer created that, fine, but it&#39;s imminently obvious to any rational person that he&#39;s not needed in this equation.</p>

<p>Anyway.  Once we start worshipping man, it will become incredibly unethical and immoral to take ANY life, even the worst criminal, for taking a life of a human would be akin to taking a life of a god / goddess.  Culture framed around this would overnight become orders of magnitude more moral.  Wars end.  One world government happens, only not like the scary one you think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing bad with gnosticism/luciferianism to me. </p>

<p>As another poster said, Lucifer was never an evil force in this mythological framework ( old testament ).</p>

<p>As for the freemasons, it&#39;s same recipe as scientology. Clueless people on the bottom like u/Tyler_Zoro greatly proves with his enthusiasm, and a bunch of psycho/sociopathic people at the top.</p>

<p>Now being a sociopath in training myself ( i try to consider it a tool but it&#39;s hard to resist to identify since it&#39;s about morals ) i see this just as a natural conflict.</p>

<p>There is no shame in being the bear who run towards his human meal.
There is no shame in being the man who pulls a shotgun at the bear.</p>

<p>There really isn&#39;t shame in the natural outfit of the world. Obviously when you want a society you need morals since it&#39;s about a system that work together.
If any part is broken or damaging the cause you either fix ( education, punishment, etc ) or throw it away ( kill, exile ).
The problem lies in how you frame society. If for a selective group of people Society is about them and their circlejerk, they will try to fix the rest in being their puppy slaves.
This is healthy to a level since a natural outfit on top of societary view is a necessary release valve ( to not become a super stressed SJW etc ). Every healthy person implements somehow, perhaps in low doses. It&#39;s the principle of self-benefit and free choice.</p>

<p>The problem starts when any group is be able to make other groups/people ignore that natural outfit. This group will lose touch to reality and submit to the other group.</p>

<p>Society becomes an integrative framework of life ( a falsehood ) instead of being the supporting cornerstone of said process. A cage.</p>

<p>Our ethics nowadays are, as a whole, denying us the right to shoot the bear who&#39;s have been eating us for a while. Since they don&#39;t help our natural cause, they are to a degree to be thrown in the mud. </p>

<p>People in this sub can only try to spread enlightenment about the cabal/bear. 
My personal solution has been to scare the bear off me ( after all, if you don&#39;t give him reasons to pursue you harder than the rest, it&#39;s only a mental attack ), and look for other survivors which can still walk after the assault.</p>

<p>No, i never joined a secret society. I just read some books when i started reading about conspiracies, then some articles. I &quot;know&quot; the high rankings of freemasonry are basically elite connections.
I wanted to comment about the luciferian/gnostic bit since i hold those philosophies in high regard. You from this post alone are probably much better versed than me in this one subject.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is a fantasy hyperbole, and it is my way to see this situation. 
I used a bear since it was the attacker of my first example and i like using &quot;fantastic&quot; metaphors, as it takes the focus away from the situation and shifts it on the mechanic that creates it. However that exact quote i admit to be a stretch.
What i meant with that is that i broke every form i could know of indoctrination the elite played on me. I don&#39;t buy their terror and i don&#39;t buy the guilt they want me to feel. I used to feel incredibly bad and confused back in the days where i was played by their indoctrination, now it&#39;s mostly peace. And that&#39;s because my spirit is ( or cos i perceive it as ) safe from the cabal now. The point was that is an active process of confrontation with the reality of this stuff that helped me, not blind denial. The cabal offense is mostly spiritual so if you can send it away on a emotive and intellectual level your brain will be safe from it. Until they find another way, i guess. One day they may cost me the life ( as many more ), but i can atleast get there peacefully and without outrage. Most of the time atleast.</p>

<p>Note that no Mason (or law enforcement) ever retains any of that material (nor would they wish to, as the liability is enormous). That&#39;s collected on behalf of the parent and they leave with everything (DNA swabs when they&#39;re done are done in the parents&#39; name and the results sent to them from the lab, not to anyone else).</p>

<p>The CHIP program is a great thing, and I&#39;m proud to be part of an organization involved in helping to prevent such tragedies!</p>

<p>I&#39;m not claiming to know for certain but, you should check out Captain William Morgan (not joking haha). He wrote a book called <em>The Mysteries of Freemasonry</em> in The early 1800&#39;s.</p>

<p>Also, from his wikiepedia: &quot;On <strong>September 11, 1826</strong>, Morgan was arrested for nonpayment of a loan which the creditor claimed he had not repaid, and for supposedly stealing a shirt and a tie, charges that were probably fabricated; according to the law, he could be held in debtors&#39; prison until the amount owed was paid, making it more difficult to publish his book.&quot; <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=kbM-AAAAQBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA139&amp;amp;dq=%22william+morgan%22+%22mason%22+%22theft%22+%22shirt%22+%22tie%22&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=pGAYVZHWJIe1sQSDkoKABA&amp;amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%22william%20morgan%22%20%22mason%22%20%22theft%22%20%22shirt%22%20%22tie%22&amp;amp;f=false">Source</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m well aware of Morgan, his kidnapping and subsequent rise of the anti-Masonic party, a period during which almost all of the East Coast&#39;s and much of the West Coast&#39;s Lodges went dark, and Freemasonry was almost extinguished in the US.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s evidence of local idiots being local idiots (and, sadly, Freemasons in name if not action). But that has nothing to do with the OP&#39;s claim that &quot;freemasons are luciferians&quot;.</p>

<p>For evidence that the Morgan affair was not a representation of Freemasonry as a whole, note that there had been dozens of exposes of Freemasonry before and hundreds since... and in all of those cases the exposer remained unmolested. It is clear from the history that the New York Masons who committed these cowardly acts were, in fact, the exception to the rule.</p>

<p>But again... still not satanists.</p>

<p>I also have to say this.  Freemasons have said they worship lucifer flat out.  google youtube freemason says he worships lucifer.

    <div class="md"><p>When doing police work to catch a serial killer or murderer or mob boss who hasn&#39;t left fingerprints, bullets, hair or other definitively identifying clues, then they rely on circumstantial evidence.  How many pieces of evidence is needed to make someone a person of interest?  A suspect?  Or even convict them?  Well it depends on whether or not the police believe that they have a 100% likelihood of convincing a jury.  Right?</p>

<p>How is it done?  They look at associated data.  Associated groups.  Criminal associates.  Placing them at crime scenes or near crime scenes.  Or their failure to account for their location during the time of crimes.  Etc.  This is triangulation.</p>

<p>Ok so act like a jury now.  How many pieces of triangulation / circumstantial evidence do you need to be convinced that freemasons are luciferians?  3?  10?  How about over 100?  How about over 1000?</p>

<p>Including testimonials I mentioned.  These examples use citations from masonic books and masons own words:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So... you posted a bunch of links and some are even full-text duplicates of each other. Obviously the text in those documents is too long (and mostly content-free) to respond to in detail, but let me just cover the bases of what they get wrong as a whole:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Pike and Hall Lucifer quotes: Lucifer is an important name in Judeo-Christian belief, and no analysis of an organization whose moral allegory is entirely based on Judeo-Christian scripture could be complete without at least touching on that name. However, both Pike and Hall make it quite clear that they are using that name in a cautionary sense. Pike explicitly says, and I&#39;m quoting the first article you linked, here, quoting Pike, &quot;[Lucifer] blinds feeble, sensual, or selfish souls? Doubt it not!&quot; So yes, if you read your Isaiah 14, you will find that Pike is paraphrasing the old Testament&#39;s warning to those who think they are the most important person in the world. It&#39;s an important lesson. Hall says basically the same thing.</li>
<li>Symbols: yes, Freemasonry uses a lot of symbols and some of them you can also find in nefarious places... but if you&#39;re a competent conspiracy theorist, then I should not have to explain to you the difference between <em>correlation</em> and <em>causation</em>. In this case, symbols like the five-pointed star have a very clear historical progression, having been used by Christianity first, then Freemasonry, and then (most likely because Freemasonry is a rich source of symbolism) by the 19th century occultists like Levi and only then by the 20th century satanic groups like Levay&#39;s. We can&#39;t stop the Levis and Levays of the world from misappropriating our symbols, but it doesn&#39;t make us the bad guys.</li>
<li>Conflation of Freemasonry and Freemasons: Sources like Hall and Waite are fraught with potential errors in analysis because the vast majority of their work and writings were <em>not Masonic at all!</em> In fact, Hall didn&#39;t even join the Fraternity until late in his life, well after almost all of his writing about the Fraternity and its place in history (much of which was liberally sprinkled with his unique blend of flight and fancy). Books like Waite&#39;s <em>The Mysteries of Magic</em> are not Masonic books. Freemasons exist in all walks of life. We are ministers and firefighters, authors and computer programmers, artists and ditch-diggers. You can&#39;t cherry pick the ones whose non-Masonic work you most disagree with and paint us all with that brush.</li>
<li>The assertion that Freemasonry is a religion: It&#39;s not. It&#39;s simply not. The point of confusion that many people have is that we refer to a deity by name, &quot;The Grand Architect of the Universe.&quot; So clearly that&#39;s some Masonic deity, right? Nope. If you actually go through the degrees this becomes much clearer, but to sum up: the Grand Architect is a label, a placeholder. Each individual Brother has their own belief (it&#39;s a requirement of membership) and Freemasonry will never seek to modify that belief. Every symbol and name and idea in the degrees <em>must be seen through the filter of your individual belief</em> or it is meaningless arm-waving. There&#39;s no such thing as a Masonic deity... only the deity you walk in the door with your faith in. Freemasonry stresses your obligation to your religion and to your God, it does not seek to supplant or modify either, ever!</li>

<p>Positive claims require evidence. Claiming that such evidence is easily obtained is not evidence.</p>

<p>Freemasons have said they worship lucifer...</p>

<p>No, they have not. That video you linked to has been spread around a lot, but harassing an old man who is clearly having trouble putting two words together and then going &quot;aha!&quot; when he says something that parses the way you want isn&#39;t evidence. The man can barely answer the question, &quot;what have you been doing?&quot; for God&#39;s sake! I&#39;m surprised he didn&#39;t say, &quot;I am Lunchmeat.&quot;</p>

<p>But you haven&#39;t addressed the real problem: how is this strain of nefarious skulduggery that you suggest exists having a universal influence over Freemasonry? How would YOU influence a massive and decentralized collection of autonomous administrative bodies? What could you accomplish through such tenuous influence over jurisdictions that can rarely agree on what the fundamental Landmarks of Freemasonry are?</p>

<p>The conspiracy theorist always begins their analysis of Freemasonry by modeling it like any other organization, but I&#39;m unaware of any other organization that has a truly decentralized administrative structure, and that punches a massive hole in most conspiracy theory right out of the gate!</p>

<p>I would say two things: there&#39;s nothing in the degrees about Lucifer, so that&#39;s his interpretation, and though I personally disagree, I&#39;ll never say that another Brother&#39;s interpretation of the degrees is &quot;wrong&quot;.</p>

<p>Second, I do take exception to the word &quot;worship&quot; as we are not a religion. We might refer to a figure allegorically, but worship is left for you to pursue as your personal faith dictates outside of the Lodge.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I will say that I&#39;m not expert on Pike, but I&#39;m not aware of a &quot;doctrine&quot; quote. What I am aware of is this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lucifer the Light bearer. Strange and mysterious name to give to the Spirit of Darkness. Lucifer the Son of the Morning. Is it he who bears the Light and with its splendors intolerable blinds feeble sensual or selfish souls? Doubt it not!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is that the one you mean?</p>

<p>If so, that&#39;s not literally about Lucifer the Biblical character, just as the entire scope of Masonic allegory is not about the characters that are introduced.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what I believe Pike is saying: knowledge is power and all power has a potential dark side in how you use it. What you do with power is a matter that you must consider well ahead of time. If you walk into this for selfish reasons, you will only harm yourself. If you walk into the quest for knowledge with a pure heart, then there is nothing you cannot accomplish.</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s always true in every walk of life whether you&#39;re talking about a college education, studying the past, self-knowledge, etc.</p>
