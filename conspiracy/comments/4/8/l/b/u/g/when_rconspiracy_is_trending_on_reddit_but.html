        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Subreddits are supposedly chosen for reddit&#39;s trending list to give them extra exposure and advertising on the front page.  It helps give the smaller non-default subreddits a chance of reaching a mass audience.</p>

<p>As we know, what happens is a banner appears above the frontpage listing all the trending subreddits for a particular day.</p>

<p>This is EXCEPT when there is a RedditLive thread active.</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/trendingsubreddits/comments/48f8ql/trending_subreddits_for_20160301_rdrumpf/">Yesterday r/conspiracy was trending.</a>.  However, this event was marred because for the whole day a RedditLive thread covering &quot;Super Tuesday&quot; was masking the trending list.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/ah9AUGn.png">[Screenshot]</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302034157/https://www.reddit.com/">[Archive Snapshot]</a> showing trending subreddits hidden</p>

<p>As soon as <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was no longer trending and todays new list of trending subreddits was put up the RedditLive thread was removed.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302081646/https://www.reddit.com/">Snapshot</a> from just now with trending subreddits in clear view</p>

<p>So the only people that really saw that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was trend were those who were linked to it from <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a> and <a href="/r/subredditdrama">/r/subredditdrama</a> .  So the whole thing was a shitshow for those mocking this subreddit and a negative experience overall. </p>

<p>Conclusion</p>

<p>It seems that the reddit admin can claim to treat <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> fairly by letting it trend yesterday.  However, it wasn&#39;t trending in a way that was equal to how other subreddits trend.  This supports the hypothesis that the admin are trying to keep <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> off the front page whiles giving the appearance of being content neutral.  </p>

<p>General Thoughts</p>

<p>The whole choice of trending on reddit seems to be arbitrary and not based on metrics.  Right now people are complaining about the Hillary Clinton hashtags on twitter (#WhichHillary ) whose trending seem to be manipulated by those with political interest.</p>

<p>I personally think that reddit&#39;s trending list needs similar scrutiny and questioning.  Everyday people understand &quot;trending&quot; to be an objective measure of popularity and so trending subreddits should be chosen fairly and presented fairly. This does not seem to be something reddit takes seriously.  While reddit isn&#39;t always serious, the integrity of the voting, ranking and trending is something that should be taken seriously by everyone.</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="/r/NotTrending">/r/NotTrending</a> is a celebration of not trending on reddit.  I will try and post more general updates there but I thought it was right to start a discussion here.  Maybe some people are happy that this subreddit was not exposed to the frontpage as it should have been because they don&#39;t like the tourists</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thankyou for also noticing the voting/commenting on this subreddit </p>

<p>What I saw happen on r/conspiracy yesterday, was that there were a whole load of reposts from a few users trying to make the front page of this subreddit look interesting to outsiders or maybe to push all their little agendas/ favorite posts on outsiders.  </p>

<p>So we were flooded was the old  stories of Aaron Swartz , Eglin airforce base and internal links to 2 year old stories on this subreddit about pedophiles. </p>

<p>Take a look at what one user was posting</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302111736/https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/search?q=author%3AOrangutan&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;sort=relevance&amp;amp;t=day">https://web.archive.org/web/20160302111736/https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/search?q=author%3AOrangutan&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;sort=relevance&amp;amp;t=day</a></p>

<p>It is all the kind of stuff that people might nod when they see it and upvote but there really was nothing new about them to create new comments. </p>

<p>So I agree there was some orchestrated manipulation in the subreddit itself yesterday but not necessarily of the sort you are thinking </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I also do not think it is very constructive to be singling out individual users unless they are trolling and blatantly shilling lies and misinformation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t really single them out at least not by name.     Anyway, it is factual and the easiest way to point out what was happening.  You think it is a good thing that one user floods the subreddit with 33 posts including quite a few reposts that were obviously going  to be easily upvoted and domianate the hot list.   I thought it made this subreddit feel like it had not moved on from tired old conspiracies that had already sat on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> that even I recognised .  Many of those posts had counter arguments or elaborations when originally posted but produced bland discussion as reposts.   </p>

<p>&quot;Flood the airwaves&quot; is just another form of censorship and a way for authorities to hide undesirable content.  I generally think it is not a terrible thing for people to see every day conspiracy as it never matches the rhetoric of this subreddits detractors.  But someone posting a &quot;best of&quot; is nice too.</p>

<p>The main thing that this this example shows is that the positive energy of this forum for upvoting good content can also be used to bury content.  So a bit of cynicism and questioning is healthy too.      </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong><em>Censorship</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Reddit, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Google</em></strong> are already rigging the access to &quot;controversial&quot; issues in relation to the 9-11 Attack, US Intelligence Community, Military Industrial Complex, US Warfare, Financial Sector, Mega Corporations, Key Figureheads and Politics. </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>1 Example:</em></strong> Some of the articles and research done just a few years ago, after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden">Mr. Snowden</a> made his startling revelations about the US Intelligence Community blatantly illegally spying on all US citizens and the methods they use, has either gone completely missing or has been buried under mountains of government friendly data and lies. The search logarithms, offered by certain private companies, has been modified to &quot;disappear&quot; the &quot;controversial&quot; data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>2 Example:</em></strong> If you search the internet for 9-11 related material, you are much more likely to find scientifically inaccurate material, deliberate misleading material or material planted by the US Intelligence Community, than you are finding useful material for further study. This is especially true if you are unfamiliar with the subject at hand, you simply will end up with a &quot;The Arabs did it in corporation with the evil Reptilians using Alien Weapons&quot; which of cause will scare away any sane person. Sometimes you see the Reddit moderator team blatantly censor new 9-11 articles by rigging the votes, only to allow a blatantly misleading wave articles and posts to flood the r/conspiracy forum. </p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>3 Example:</em></strong> If you post anything on Reddit about the crushing inequality, corporate crimes, financial crimes, financial rigging (LIBOR, FOREX, gold, silver, interest rates) your comments section will be crushed by waves of paid government Shills &amp; Pundits (or smart computer logarithms). If your post made it to the front page, they will immediately remove it and sometimes ban your account. Most &quot;controversial&quot; posts will die a silent death due to rigging of the voting mechanics (their favorite method).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>This post got the &quot;death kneel AutoModerator&quot; message! This post will disappear from the front page within minutes or hours, because it doesn&#39;t receive any more (or little more) votes and comments (85% likelihood).</p></li>
<li><p>Do not blame the Moderator, he is (properly) merely a foot soldier in the grand scheme of things, waging the war on behalf of his Masters and Patrons. Maybe he will get a medal!!!</p></li>
<li><p>Posts critical of a mega corporation or some other mega sized business entity are routinely &quot;removed&quot;, &quot;rigged&quot; or &quot;Scrubbed&quot; away from the front page, especially from r/news and r/worldnews. The same goes for any post critical of the US Intelligence Community, US Military Industrial Complex, the US based Financial Sector and the US Political Leadership. Any serious post about 9-11 will get hammered immediately.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Most of us on the r/conspiracy forum knows about these activities, they are designed to mislead the public. Every time we post about this particular subject, one among many heavily censored subjects, they disappear rather quickly from the front page. Reddit is nothing more than a Corporate Owned Mass Media platform controlled by the Fascist US government. No Need to pretend otherwise. </p>
