       How?  This movie should have gone down as the worst movie ever.  It just plain sacked.  Now it's one of the most decorated movies ever.  What a joke.

       Hi thanks for your great comment.  No I've been banned 27 times.  This is one of the greatest action movies of all time that was ruined by this remake then decorated with 6 Oscars.  Not talking about your normal jew hate although I'm on board.  This is as horrible as remaking Annie with black people.

       Shut it.  The conspiracy is that it is a crappy remake of a cult classic and Hollywood tells you it's great.  Anyone that saw the original hates that piece of crap.

       That movie was cool as fuck. Going to war with a car loaded with drummers and an insane mutant guitarist? Cool. As. Fuck. Fuck you and your shit taste in movies. Sorry it wasn't cerebral enough for you, they can't all be made by Woodie Allen I guess. PS: It's "sucked".

       Have you ever seen Mad Max or The Road Warrior?  This was another remake because Hollywood has no new ideas.  They screwed it up so badly it was heartbreaking.  I hate child molesters and WA fits that.  Made Mad is a cult classic and the remake didn't need a new storyline with chappy costumes and an idiot playing a guitar.  This is movie magic that was regurgitated quite horribly.  Giving this movie 6 Oscars is a conspiracy because not only was the movie a disaster it shows that Hollywood will tell you that it's not and to buy it.  Thanks so much for your silly opinion.

       I can literally repeat the script from Mad Max word for word. And I didn't hate Thunderdome all that much either, so there. I bet you watched Mad Max once because some film school buddy of yours assured you it was good. Oh, and PS: ALL the Mad Max films (except the first of course) are either remakes, or re-imaginings (Well.... A case COULD be made that Thunderdome is a sequel of MM2 I guess), NOT sequels. Bet I just blew your tiny mind.

       Why and how would you make those assumptions.  Mad Max was the original and the Road Warrior not MM2 was the sequel.  Thunder dome was made way too late and was a piece of crap.  I'm a huge fan of the originals.  Thunder dome was a money grab.  Not a film school knob and no you didn't come close to blowing my mind.  You must be an eastern arsehole.

       Mad Max: Fury Road was written and directed by George Miller, the writer and director of the original Mad Max movies. This was the film he always wanted to make and now technology has allowed him to do so. Sorry you didn't like it, but it's not just some Hollywood remake that's ruined the image of the originals.

       The movie sacked ass and had no business collecting awards.  It looked like a child's movie with a stupid dumb looking villian.  The original movies are awesome and I credit him however he is old and tired now and he sucks at his job.  The academy s decision not to give a black person a nomination was their right even if you don't agree but to give this movie Oscars was a slap in the face to any minority.  This movie is shit.

       Do you have a strong opinion as to which film should have won according to any of those wacky/technical Oscar categories?

       I'm gonna jump on the "good movie" bandwagon here.  It was pretty good.  Charlize Theron was amazing.

       This is not only my opinion.  Millions of people call the original a cult classic.  This was a remake that sacked.  Nobody cares which Oscars were won.  They will just stick on the movie "Winner of 6 Academy Awards".

       I bet you had a great time watching Peter Pan too.  Why tell us your opinion on the movie?  Mad Max is loved by millions of people.  There is no denying that.  This was a remake that sacked and they gave it 6 Oscars.

       Fury Road wasn't a remake.

       In the context of the Mad Max franchise, it was quite disappointing, but it was clearly a technically challenging project; I can see how it might garner some Oscars for that.

       I can literally repeat the script from Mad Max word for word. And I didn't hate Thunderdome all that much either, so there. I bet you watched Mad Max once because some film school buddy of yours assured you it was good. Oh, and PS: ALL the Mad Max films (except the first of course) are either remakes, or re-imaginings (Well.... A case COULD be made that Thunderdome is a sequel of MM2 I guess), NOT sequels. Bet I just blew your tiny mind.

       Mad Max: Fury Road was written and directed by George Miller, the writer and director of the original Mad Max movies. This was the film he always wanted to make and now technology has allowed him to do so. Sorry you didn't like it, but it's not just some Hollywood remake that's ruined the image of the originals.
