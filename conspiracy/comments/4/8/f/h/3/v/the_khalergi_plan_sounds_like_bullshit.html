<p>No, I’m saying you don’t know what they mean because you’ve deluded yourself into thinking a point has been proven by invoking their use itself rather than by actually HAVING a point.</p>

<p>Disregard the vulgarity and then explain how the statement is wrong. We can run through it line by line, if you like.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This will end in disaster if we don’t stop them.</p>

<p>Coudenhove-Kalergi plan exactly, yes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is impossible to integrate millions of non-white, non-Christians</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, this is also proven–by history, by practice, and by the fundamental nature of the invaders’ ideology itself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Their IQs are way too low</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rather than give any statement as to the absolute intelligence required for the concept of integration (or any necessities in that regard), we can simply say that their IQs are, factually, lower than that of Europeans’.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>zero impulse control</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I sort of don’t want to split up the two groups, but we may as well. Islam explicitly says to have no impulse control in the invasion of non-Islamic areas. Numerous studies show that male behavior is heavily influenced by the operational sex ratio–or the ratio between fertile females and sexually active males.</p>

<p>If male and female numbers are equal then the best strategy is for a male to find a female, pair off, and protect/provide for his own kids.</p>

<p>If there are more fertile females than males, the best mating strategy for males is to put less resources caring for their kids and more resources trying to mate with multiple females. (note l: urban blacks in America fall into this category because of the amount of young black males either in prison or killed by other black males. result is that black males spend more time chasing other women and less time being fathers) (note 2: possibly bigamy became common in these societies to prevent the excess of available females from encouraging men to sleep around instead of be fathers)</p>

<p>If there are more males than females, the males that have mates get obsessed with protecting them from the surplus males, who form rape gangs to try to get access to the smaller numbers of females.</p>

<p>In polygamous societies, every man that has two wives creates a man who can never mate unless he rapes. Bigamy effectively turns a balanced operational sex ratio into a heavily male-biased one. Islam is a codified set of behaviors for protecting females from rape gangs (burka, can’t go outside without male guardian) and exporting the surplus males to neighboring societies so they don’t bother the local females (jihad). That is, essentially, Islam–a code of behaviors designed by a guy with multiple wives in a bigamous society to keep womanless men away from his wives.</p>

<p>The surplus males generated by bigamy are told, “These women are off-limits; they’re spoken for by more powerful men in your society. If you want to get laid, your only option is to go out and conquer something and take their women.” This is how Islam spread so quickly in its first few centuries and this is the driving force behind the huge amount of young men flooding into Europe today. They are not refugees, they are sex tourists. It should be no surprise they are so rapey.</p>

<p>As for the subsaharan invaders, here’s what we know: 1) The melanocortin system partially controls physical aggression. 2) MAOA-L is more prevalent in genetic negroids than in other groups. There is a well-defined correlation between MAOA-L and aggression. You should know what these two things imply by now. Oh, and vitamin D deficiency is linked with a decrease in impulse control, and Europe receives less solar vitamin D than other regions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mixing with such an inferior breed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, let’s work only with the relative rather than the absolute. Miscegenation has been long proven to cause genetic damage. In most cases, the children are at a much greater risk of being incompatible with any potential external medical treatment than any other group. If you’re mixed and need a bone marrow transplant, you’re dead. End of story. Never mind if you need an organ. Neither of your parents will be compatible.</p>

<p>Fuck’s sake; learn what <em>Nazis</em> are, too. East asians refuse miscegenation and you’re not fucking whining about them.</p>

<p>First of all, the issue at hand isn&#39;t about right or wrong, it&#39;s about racism and biggotry. The vulgarity is a part of the racism... they&#39;re also not an inferior &#39;breed&#39;. IQ isn&#39;t a very effective measurement for intelligence. Science hasn&#39;t found a correlation between IQ and race. Science has however found a correlation between Quality of life and IQ. Seeing how a lot of black people in America have had a poor integration into Society, this particular topic speaks for itself.</p>

<p>&#39;&#39;East asians refuse miscegenation and you’re not fucking whining about them.&#39;&#39;</p>

<p>Poor point, try again. We&#39;re talking here about the Khalegi plan. Not East Asia and the Policies in the countries over there.</p>

<p>&#39;&#39;As for the subsaharan invaders, here’s what we know: 1) The melanocortin system partially controls physical aggression. 2) MAOA-L is more prevalent in genetic negroids than in other groups. There is a well-defined correlation between MAOA-L and aggression. You should know what these two things imply by now. Oh, and vitamin D deficiency is linked with a decrease in impulse control, and Europe receives less solar vitamin D than other regions.&#39;&#39;</p>

<p>Show me a valid piece o&#39; research that proves said point. Possibility of the researchers having focused their efforts on African Americans is there. I wish to check such doubts.</p>

<p>&#39;&#39;The surplus males generated by bigamy are told, “These women are off-limits; they’re spoken for by more powerful men in your society. If you want to get laid, your only option is to go out and conquer something and take their women.” This is how Islam spread so quickly in its first few centuries and this is the driving force behind the huge amount of young men flooding into Europe today. They are not refugees, they are sex tourists. It should be no surprise they are so rapey.&#39;&#39;</p>

<p>At the same time, these people are often not teached proper conduit and better moral understanding. I am sure that once integrated properly, said behavior will not occur substantially more then with white folks.</p>

<p>&#39;&#39;Objective truth exists. I don’t give a fuck about moral relativism; it’s not real. If the statements are true, they’re true. If the statements are false, they’re false. It is not wrong to say true things. It is wrong to say false things.&#39;&#39;</p>

<p>That&#39;s good, that means you agree with what I said about some of those comments being racist.</p>

<p>What part of this is unclear to you? The fact that you’re a moral relativist or the fact that truth exists regardless of what your feelings say? </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Was the prophet Muhammad a mussulman? Did he lead an exemplary life by Islamic standards? As he spent most of his as a roving warlord, the Islamic State is living the example much more than any westernized kebab.</p>

<p>Do you agree that beliefs affect behavior? For example, if one believes that homosexuality, apostasy, and blasphemy are crimes that should be punished by death, do you think that makes the person holding that view more or less likely to commit violence against a blasphemer, apostate, or queer?</p>

<p>What counts as “Islam” and “Islamic”? If the words spoken by Muhammad and the life he lead don’t count as Islamic, you’re a retard. Do the things Jesus said count as Christianity? Of course.</p>

<p>If a Quaker or Buddhist or Hare Krishna goes on a killing spree and says he is doing it in the name of Jesus or Buddha or Krishna, are there any parts of the Bible or Buddhavacana or Bhagavad Gita that support him? Did the Buddha ever encourage murder? No. So you could very easily say that the attack was un-Buddhist or un-Krishna.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia has public stoning as a (rare, but) legal form of execution. Homosexuals, adulteresses, blasphemers, and apostates are regularly executed. Is that un-Islamic? Seriously, is Saudi Arabia un-Islamic? That would be like suggesting that Vatican City isn’t Catholic.</p>

<p>This all boils down to people thinking that religious beliefs are all the same, which is utter bullshit. Some religious teach peace and have long histories thereof (Buddhism, Jainism, Hare Krishna-ism, Quakerism, etc.); others teach violence and have histories of violence–Islam being the chief proponent.</p>

<p>&#39;&#39;counter-intuitive&#39;&#39; this is a key part of my initial post.
Since things cannot be just handed to you, I will explain as to why this Khalergi plan is counter-intuitive. What&#39;s their end goal with this plan? I read that it&#39;s to ruin diversity which supposedly makes people easier to be controlled. -If this supposed end goal is different, please do enlighten me-
My argument of it being counter-intuitive falls with the fact that a lot of people are being indirectly controlled through the diversity that the Khalergi plan wants to eliminate.</p>

<p>P.S. One minor annoyance that I have with some of the Khalergi plan conspiracy theorists, is that they claim it to be the end of the white race. Even though it applies to every race.</p>

<p>Hey! You understand that ‘diversity’ means having different people <em>remain</em> different! Fuck yeah; good for you!</p>

<p>How are they being controlled <em>through</em> diversity? How are hundreds of disparate elements easier to control than one large element?</p>

<p>Picture this. You’re out on the Texan plains, riding your horse, tasked with bringing down to pasture your herd of animals.</p>

<p>You ride over the ridge, and there they are, in all their glory. Two of every animal (within reason; this is an analogy). Lions, tigers, bears, elephants, giraffes, sheep, cats, pigs, cows, emu, aardvarks, etc.</p>

<p>Now it’s time for you to open up all their individual pens and herd them a hundred miles north. Together.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Or you could have a herd of only cows. Or sheep. Or goats. Then you actually have a herd mentality and the motion of one can directly affect the other (like fish). Heck, to move sheep around, you can even employ the use of a non-human! A sheepdog! That’s even less work for you.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, <em>this</em> plan applies specifically to Europeans (and thus caucasians) and always has. The addition of non-whites does not mean that their numbers are affected in the genocide of whites (in any way but increasing).</p>

<p>Well, sadly enough for your analogy, races aren&#39;t the same as species. I still don&#39;t see how this makes &#39;herding&#39; factually easier, since in reality, people&#39;s decision making isn&#39;t mentally divided by race. Here is an interesting &#39;analogy&#39; of sorts. </p>

<p>&#39;If a white person sees a black person jump off a bridge, he will feel just as inclined to jump off that bridge as when that black person is actually a white person. The only thing that could change that, is if that white person cares about race or subconsciously believes in certain racial stigmas that were pumped into his brain.&#39;</p>

<p>You can insert any race you want into that analogy.</p>

<p>Just in case I will explain my analogy. A person&#39;s subconscious sheep is not inherently more inclined to follow the decision of a black or white person until an actual difference is made. Basically race &#39;propaganda&#39; creates that difference for people.</p>

<p>Racial differentiating came to life by people creating brotherhoods around their race, to make it easier to recognize your supposed enemies and allies. I personally doubt the Khalergi plan can ever function properly in the future with our new means of information sharing and in our modern society.</p>

<p>This racial differentiating is no longer a core part of modern society. Knowledge and information sharing is much more expansive now. And people don&#39;t have to rely on creeds anymore in order to survive. Thus, using race to differentiate friend from enemy is no longer &#39;needed&#39;.</p>

<p>No it doesn&#39;t, it purposefully seems like it does at the start. Read it completely.</p>

<p>I remember quite a long pointless exchange where it took you a while to get some evidence out there. You ignoring every question in which I asked if you are trolling. I seriously think you are a Political troll now simply because of your method. You seem to mix valid points with invalid ones and trollish responses.</p>

<p>&#39;&#39;They built in the fucking formatting. Are you being intentionally dense about EVERYTHING?&#39;&#39;</p>

<p>The site gives the tools, the user has the preference. This is seriously you arguing about me not conforming to the sites way of quoting. Pointless, much like this discussion with you.</p>

<p>&#39;&#39;YEAH, it’s not like every single thing we are in every measurable capacity is based thereon or anything.
Oh, wait...&#39;&#39;</p>

<p>Like I said, &#39;&#39;for points like these&#39;&#39;</p>

<p>Give me a reason as to how that is not the case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;&#39;Disregard the vulgarity and then explain how the statement is wrong. We can run through it line by line, if you like.&#39;&#39;</p>

<p>First of all, the issue at hand isn&#39;t about right or wrong, it&#39;s about racism and biggotry. The vulgarity is a part of the racism... they&#39;re also not an inferior &#39;breed&#39;. IQ isn&#39;t a very effective measurement for intelligence. Science hasn&#39;t found a correlation between IQ and race. Science has however found a correlation between Quality of life and IQ. Seeing how a lot of black people in America have had a poor integration into Society, this particular topic speaks for itself.</p>

<p>&#39;&#39;East asians refuse miscegenation and you’re not fucking whining about them.&#39;&#39;</p>

<p>Poor point, try again. We&#39;re talking here about the Khalegi plan. Not East Asia and the Policies in the countries over there.</p>

<p>&#39;&#39;As for the subsaharan invaders, here’s what we know: 1) The melanocortin system partially controls physical aggression. 2) MAOA-L is more prevalent in genetic negroids than in other groups. There is a well-defined correlation between MAOA-L and aggression. You should know what these two things imply by now. Oh, and vitamin D deficiency is linked with a decrease in impulse control, and Europe receives less solar vitamin D than other regions.&#39;&#39;</p>

<p>Show me a valid piece o&#39; research that proves said point. Possibility of the researchers having focused their efforts on African Americans is there. I wish to check such doubts.</p>

<p>&#39;&#39;The surplus males generated by bigamy are told, “These women are off-limits; they’re spoken for by more powerful men in your society. If you want to get laid, your only option is to go out and conquer something and take their women.” This is how Islam spread so quickly in its first few centuries and this is the driving force behind the huge amount of young men flooding into Europe today. They are not refugees, they are sex tourists. It should be no surprise they are so rapey.&#39;&#39;</p>

<p>At the same time, these people are often not teached proper conduit and better moral understanding. I am sure that once integrated properly, said behavior will not occur substantially more then with white folks.</p>
