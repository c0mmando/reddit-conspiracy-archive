        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I know this has been a hot topic as of late and people in this sub have been trying to figure out how to deal with them. I spent about 15 mins looking at a few different subs and found some pretty interesting info. There are many ways to be a paid shill, but if you do just a little digging you can easily spot them. Here&#39;s some rules I&#39;ve found help, it&#39;s not a concrete theory but a hypothesis.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Posters must gain credibility: most of these shills take it to the extreme. An incredible amount of posts over a short period of time. </p></li>
<li><p>Not always the case but short account life span </p></li>
<li><p>Most users have specific habits ie: they frequent certain sub&#39;s, shills tend to crawl, many different topics, only one or two comments on a certain post.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Below I&#39;ve posted some profiles that raise suspicions:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/XdOeyxV.png">http://i.imgur.com/XdOeyxV.png</a> (high karma 1 month life span)</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/jQNves5.png">http://i.imgur.com/jQNves5.png</a> (post crawling too)</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/9YNwwyk.png">http://i.imgur.com/9YNwwyk.png</a> (Reddit must be a full time job)</p>

<p>Normal looking account:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/scS35OX.png">http://i.imgur.com/scS35OX.png</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m not implying that the above accounts are paid shills but there are definitely some odd metrics associated. If anyone else feels like digging or has suggestions for spotting these shills please feel free.</p>

<p>Another thing I&#39;ve noticed with these high activity accounts is the attention to grammar and punctuation. It seems like their posts and comments are being proof read for errors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know bots are prevalent here, I was inspired by the confessions of a Hillary shill post to do some investigating. r/politics seems flooded with them. I&#39;ve noticed on here as well that its a combination of down votes and post flooding. Although its hard to tell because the accounts don&#39;t seem to have any odd metrics. I posted a link to a news source from a personal friend of mine working in Beruit reporting on the Syria situation about 6 hours ago and got down voted into oblivion. I had 3 upvotes then got down voted like crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;ll never vote for anyone graduating from that place?  That just seems extremely narrow-minded.  I would put far more weight on his actions - the legislation he supported and what he accomplished while in office.  That seems like a more accurate way of gauging his future actions.  Plus he&#39;s been a politician for so long it&#39;s not difficult to see what he spends his effort on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, or you could have reviewed his history in Congress and seen what he&#39;d actually done and seen for how long he&#39;d done it to get a sense of how likely he was to do what he said he would.

    <div class="md"><p>I just don&#39;t think that university stands out much more than Harvard, Yale, and thousands of other US universities.  Certain subjects tend to be conservative - economics and law, for example.  I think you do a disservice to people if you look at the location of their higher education and decide if they&#39;re bought or not.  It&#39;s just not that meaningful.  Harvard is notorious for taking the best and brightest kids with the most desire to bring about social change.  Then they have them intern with high paying corporations and slowly win them over with money.  But that doesn&#39;t mean if you went to Harvard you&#39;ve been bought!  Many of those students go on to be social justice warriors.  You need to look at actions.  Look at the legislation Sanders has actually voted on and see if you agree with it or not.  That&#39;s concrete action in political terms.  That&#39;s actually what counts.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, that&#39;s actually an action she&#39;s taken that reflects what she might do in the future.  I think this is something reasonable to base your opinion on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you have a point with him supporting Israel.  I believe that supporting Israel is a necessity for him politically, but in that sense he would be like any other politician sacrificing their values to get elected.  Honestly, I think if he were elected and really tried to take action against Israel there&#39;s a decent chance he would be assassinated.</p>

<p>The system is rigged in this country.  You can vote your conscience and never get anyone elected or you can choose the lesser of two evils and then you&#39;re arguably making a difference.  I think you should vote your conscience, it&#39;s just important that your vote is informed.</p>

How shills normally search for threads is by title in the search box, then sort by &quot;last hour&quot; or 24 hours to find the threads with most current activity in any subreddit.

A shill when presented with information that contradicts their message, either dismisses it as &quot;an opinion or unproveable&quot; or ignores it all together. Also no matter how civilly you refute their point theyll go to ad hominem quickly spouting &quot;racist&quot; &quot;anti semite&quot; etc, and the most famous shill libe &quot;just because I dont agree with you doesnt mean im a shill&quot; actually, it usually does, this is the conspiracy sub, if youre here pushing gov narrative we all know why</p>

<p>If you have a system someone will try to game it. Every single time. </p>

<p>Now I do think honest to goodness shills are much rarer than people will think. Usually its just the misinformed. If you speak the truth and dont resort to name calling it will do more to render a shill neutralized. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s important to remember that most conspiracy-denier accounts are just blithering idiots, rather than paid or self-appointed shills (eg the swivel-eyed Talmudists like duckvimes, Tokkul or Shredder13).</p>

<p>However, one thing I have noticed is that a lot of suspicious accounts seem to be knuckleheads who build up &quot;credibility&quot; (karma and a posting history) on subreddits like <a href="/r/nfl">/r/nfl</a> or their local football team&#39;s subreddit. Which makes me think they&#39;re probably shaven-headed androids from Eglin.</p>
