        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here&#39;s an excerpt from the post:</p>

<p>&quot; Is the world conspiring against us? Is the world out to get you, out to keep you restricted, out to keep you from doing what you really want to do? Well, surprisingly yes. Let me explain...[sic]</p>

<p>...The market determines all of this. The market is composed of literally millions of people and businesses all competing as fiercely as possible for survival. Every single one of then having to assume risk and having to trade time and labor for capital. The supply and demand balance determines prices, and the dentist, butcher, and rice farmers are simply using their skills to their own personal advantage. They trade a service or good to grab your money. They are in it for the money.</p>

<p>Which leads us back to the first proposition. Is the world out to get you?...[sic]</p>

<p>...But wait a second. Money is time and risk quantified.</p>

<p>Except for banks. Wait a second, that doesn&#39;t seem fair. That sure seems like they have a competitive advantage now doesn&#39;t it? Banks can create money with no exchange for labor and then loan it towards an asset that&#39;s value equals the money they are loaning. Meaning, there is no risk involved and no labor or time being exchanged. Sure seems like everything is lopsided in their favor now doesn&#39;t it. They can do this as long as they can remain solvent**.</p>

<p>So when you take a mortgage out, you are literally a little money slave to the institution that is &quot;loaning&quot; you the money they created out of thin air. Their money is backed by an asset that is equal to the amount that they loaned so there is extremely little risk. If you default, they play musical chairs with the house and it is filled with another sucker soon after.</p>

<p>Unless everyone stops paying at the same time. Then there is no one to hop in their musical chair, and the banks solvency becomes an issue because houses are not fungible***.</p>

<p>Guess who are worse than the banks?...[sic]</p>

<p>PM me if you&#39;d like the ling to the entire article</p>
