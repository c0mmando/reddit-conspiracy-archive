<p>Some people truly believe in this prophecies, and so they do things that fulfill them. How many Christians are convinced the Jews need Israel so that Jesus will come back? How many Muslims see ISIS as the army that will usher in the days of peace and Muslim dominion over the earth? </p>

<p>what i think actually happened was this: people in the CIA and in GW&#39;s cabinet knew an attack was going to happen.  they probably even knew details.   but they allowed it to happen so they could enact plans they had already formed 30 years prior, which needed a pearl harbor type catalyst to be enacted.</p>

They simply state that once the top failed, global collapse became &quot;inevitable.&quot; The only full explanation using this hypothesis comes from Bazant, with his &quot;crush down, crush up&quot; theory. And that has been refuted in the <a href="http://www.civil.northwestern.edu/people/bazant/PDFs/Papers/D25%20WTC%20Discussions%20Replies.pdf">Discussions/Closures section</a> of his own paper, <a href="https://vid.me/u0gZ">physical testing</a> and at least three separate, peer reviewed, published papers:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>SUMMARY</p>

<p>A number of simple, transparent calculations of the North Tower collapse were presented in
[5] and the conclusion was that assuming even a modest resistance of columns during their
destruction would cause an unacceptably long collapse time. It is only when perfectly
frangible columns were adopted that the fall time was as low as 15.3 s. This removes the PCF
mode, as defined here, as a viable hypothesis of collapse.
Y
et, the PCF achieved significant popularity, as based on [1] and [2], while the next work
[12] did not contribute anything new to the core of the subject. These papers, purporting to
explain the collapse, suffered from three fatal errors, as detailed above. Also, the whole
methodology was not justified. Some incredibly short fall times were quoted by the authors,
while all solutions were of a black-box type. The presentations in these papers are not a valid
description of what happened. The reasons for a smooth motion history and promptness of
collapse of the North Tower remain yet to be determined.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fatal Error #1:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The main paper proposing the PCF mode [2] had several discussers involved. The closure
of the discussion [15] pointed out a few flaws that crept into the competing analysis [3],
although these flaws had no adverse effects on the results. The defense of the analysis
presented in [2], on the other hand, was essentially relying on ignoring the arguments to the
contrary. The gross underestimate of the energy absorption capacity of the squashed column
that resulted is named here as the fatal mistake No.1.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fatal Error #2:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From the above assumption Bazant concluded that after the initiation of failure of the
critical story, the columns in that squashed story offered only negligible resistance. That led
to the assumption that the upper part of the building, above that story, would be in a free fall
until a complete flattening of that story. At the end of the critical story squash the free-drop
velocity is over 8.5 m/s, resulting in a destructive impact. This in turn culminated in [2] as a
conclusion of a quick collapse of the entire edifice. We call this a “vanishing story
assumption” and refer to it as the fatal mistake No.2. (This free-fall assumption was not
openly stated, but there are numerous hints in [1, 2, 6] and [12] implying that it was used in
computational procedure.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fatal Error #3:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The texts of the criticized papers mention both criteria, although in a confused manner. In
[2], a statement on p.311 tells the reader that, in fact, the energy criterion renders the strength
criterion irrelevant. The conclusions echo that by saying: 
What matters is energy, not the
strength, nor stiffness.
Confronted with the results of discussion [3], showing a prompt arrest,
Bazant took a small step backward in Closure [15] by saying that the strength criterion was
valid in statics, but not in a dynamic environment, where inertia forces are involved. Thereby
the author missed the fundamental point, namely that 
the initiation of motion took place in a
static environment and therefore meeting the strength criterion was indispensable.
(Dynamics enters later, when significant accelerations or inertia forces are developed.)
Conclusion: The results were obtained while ignoring the strength criterion and are therefore
invalid on this count alone. (This was a visible confusion between statics and dynamics and
is regarded here as the fatal mistake No.3.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bazant and Zhou [7] published a paper titled “Why Did the World Trade Center Collapse? Simple Analysis” providing the engineering community with insights into why those steel structures collapsed. In their simple analysis it was assumed that the columns failed due to folding at the localized plastic hinges. This type of model is commonly employed for laterally loaded beams and girders, that is, assume that these structural members form plastic hinges at mid height during the motion of one storey closing the gap distance with its neighboring storey by bending into a closed scissors state. Bazant and Zhou [7] postulated that at least one plastic hinge and no more than three plastic hinges, per column line are needed to operate simultaneously in order to allow the upper part to continue moving down. It was argued that at the end, the sum of the rotation angles of the hinges on one column line cannot exceed 360°, and therefore, the most optimistic plastic energy dissipation in a column was taken as the plastic bending moment Mp of one column times the combined rotation angle of 2 radians. In one sense, it might be argued that such a hypothesis would overestimate the energy absorbing capacity, since the possibility of fracture in tension zones of the plastic hinge is excluded. On the other hand, the plastic hinge assumption might underestimate the capacity by virtue of disregarding the axial energy capacity and ignoring the slenderness parameter that is key to column design. An earlier study on square hollow shaped columns clearly shows that employing the plastic hinge analysis method very much underestimates the energy absorbing capacity during a squash type mechanism of collapse [8]. This investigation intends to explore whether H-shaped structural columns absorb more or less energy than predicted by the plastic hinge model [7]. This paper presents experimentally established energy dissipations associated with axially loaded H-shaped columns of intermediate slenderness and compares them to those established based on a plastic hinge model.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Conclusion:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While our test program was very limited in the both the number and types of experiments undertaken, our findings suggest that the energy dissipation of axially loaded columns depends on various parameters, namely, slenderness of the column, tensile strength and the ductility of the material, and so forth, and its estimation is not a trivial matter. While the plastic hinge model does have merit in its simplicity and may be better suited for analysis of laterally loaded members, its application to axially loaded columns warrants caution. There clearly are limitations to applying such a model when dealing with structural members that primarily resist axial loads. Overall, there is a need by the structural engineering community to further investigate the issue of energy dissipation potentials of steel columns and their role in mitigating progressive collapse of buildings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The geometrical, inertial and material data were provided in FEMA Report (2003) and summarised accordingly in Szuladzinski (2003). The most frequent explanation of the collapse mechanism of the buildings was a successive flattening of stories referred to as pancaking. The best known writer putting forward this hypothesis was Bažant, in Bažant and Verdure (2007) as well as in earlier papers. One of the discussion papers to Bažant and Verdure (2007) was Szuladziński (2008) where a detailed calculation of failure over the most heavily damaged story was presented. For the collapse to initiate the strength of the critical story had to be gradually degraded to just below the weight of the structure above it. The calculation showed that the energy lost in column squashing was larger than potential energy of gravity available for the process, thereby indicating the arrest of the motion. That calculation was done in reference to the vicinity of the critical story. In contrast, this paper takes a broader view of the entire building and its energy balance. <strong>In investigating the possibility of pancaking collapse all assumptions, often resulting from uncertainties in the available data, are made in a manner favourable to this collapse hypothesis.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Conclusion:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In summary, the pancaking mode is not a realistic proposition, as the calculated fall 
time becomes much too long. The only way 
to approach the observed duration is to 
assume pattern 3, <strong>quite an unrealistic proposition.</strong> This is not to say that the mode could 
not last only during <strong>a small part of the collapse,</strong> followed by a <strong>later arrest</strong> and a change of 
the collapse mode. 
The subject of a progressive collapse of a 
concrete building comes naturally, as it is 
related to column frangibility. 
A concrete column can undergo only a very small axial 
shortening prior to collapse. The energy absorption due to crushing is miniscule 
compared with a steel column of the same strength. Therefore, concrete columns may be 
seen as resembling the ideally frangible elements.</p>
