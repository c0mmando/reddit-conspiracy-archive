    <div class="md"><p>&quot;It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.&quot;</p>

<p>-Jiddu Krishnamurti</p>

<p>I moved to Alaska. I have ~30+ acres of land, a dog, and a cabin/home I built. I  drink (a lot, lol.. my own brews/cider, though!) and look at the stars every night. I see the animals around me, and try to be one with nature. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve divorced myself from the system as much as I possibly can. I have internet, and an emergency phone, but the rest is mostly off the grid living (I use wood to heat this place). I&#39;m away from the hustle of the cities/burbs, and god damn, I&#39;m happier than I&#39;ve ever been. </p>

<p>I&#39;m alone, but at the same time, not. I have to survive and that gives me life purpose. Some may work in a cubicle 9-5, but I have my own unregulated calendar. If I have to skin a deer, I can do it the same at 9am or 3 am, doesn&#39;t matter (my boss, is me). I live. I drink. And say fuck society.</p>

<p>I&#39;m drinking now, so, sorry if this is all over the place. I don&#39;t have anything to do tomorrow, because it&#39;s cold as balls, and well, I make my own rules. What day is it? Cheers!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just set a goal. Land up here is cheap (even out West, if you don&#39;t want to be in no man&#39;s land). You can get 20 acres for ~20k (depending on where you pick, I&#39;m above the arctic circle, cheaper for me, lol). Set your mind to it, and do it. It&#39;s a tough life, but the freedom is amazing. And maybe we could kick it, drink some, and you could play some music. Cheers, mate! Your music is awesome! Been following since you posted here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have faith.</p>

<p>&quot;But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them—bringing swift destruction on themselves. 2 Many will follow their depraved conduct and will bring the way of truth into disrepute. 3 In their greed these teachers will exploit you with fabricated stories. Their condemnation has long been hanging over them, and their destruction has not been sleeping.</p>

<p>4 For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them to hell,[a] putting them in chains of darkness[b] to be held for judgment; 5 if he did not spare the ancient world when he brought the flood on its ungodly people, but protected Noah, a preacher of righteousness, and seven others; 6 if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them to ashes, and made them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly; 7 and if he rescued Lot, a righteous man, who was distressed by the depraved conduct of the lawless 8 (for that righteous man, living among them day after day, was tormented in his righteous soul by the lawless deeds he saw and heard)— 9 if this is so, then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials and to hold the unrighteous for punishment on the day of judgment. 10 This is especially true of those who follow the corrupt desire of the flesh[c] and despise authority.</p>

<p>Bold and arrogant, they are not afraid to heap abuse on celestial beings; 11 yet even angels, although they are stronger and more powerful, do not heap abuse on such beings when bringing judgment on them from[d] the Lord. 12 But these people blaspheme in matters they do not understand. They are like unreasoning animals, creatures of instinct, born only to be caught and destroyed, and like animals they too will perish.</p>

<p>13 They will be paid back with harm for the harm they have done. Their idea of pleasure is to carouse in broad daylight. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their pleasures while they feast with you.[e] 14 With eyes full of adultery, they never stop sinning; they seduce the unstable; they are experts in greed—an accursed brood! 15 They have left the straight way and wandered off to follow the way of Balaam son of Bezer,[f] who loved the wages of wickedness. 16 But he was rebuked for his wrongdoing by a donkey—an animal without speech—who spoke with a human voice and restrained the prophet’s madness.</p>

<p>17 These people are springs without water and mists driven by a storm. Blackest darkness is reserved for them. 18 For they mouth empty, boastful words and, by appealing to the lustful desires of the flesh, they entice people who are just escaping from those who live in error. 19 They promise them freedom, while they themselves are slaves of depravity—for “people are slaves to whatever has mastered them.” 20 If they have escaped the corruption of the world by knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and are again entangled in it and are overcome, they are worse off at the end than they were at the beginning. 21 It would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than to have known it and then to turn their backs on the sacred command that was passed on to them. 22 Of them the proverbs are true: “A dog returns to its vomit,”[g] and, “A sow that is washed returns to her wallowing in the mud.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of us were asleep once. An when I was, I laughed at people like me now. It is hard for some people to come to terms with the fact that what they have been told their whole life is a lie. An if you put hands on them trying to make your point you will alienate them more. A lot more people than you think are awake but they are not ready to admit it for fear of the title. An when you try to share an they try to use terms, remind them of the &quot;sticks and stones &quot; shit an if meaningless titles stop them from seeking the truth they have lost. You can also look at it like christans do when they try to make everyone else one of them. We know the truth and wish for others to learn it as well. Well according to christans jebus is the truth and they want everyone to know. Show them the water.let them choose to drink.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea of better tomorrow for all... the Utopia. I think for many it all comes down to how strong their Will really is and in today&#39;s sick world the Will is tested every single day. Then again not all are the same, some are manipulated and indoctrinated and can&#39;t even see the real world, others aren&#39;t even aware, some just don&#39;t care, few live in the world of their own, many have problems that outweigh anything outside family... there are many types or factors and some just want to see the world burn :[</p>

<p>With love in your heart and truth in your mind you can never go wrong, violence of any kind is just a temporary fix and will create just more ripples with problems that will never stop.</p>

<p>The more I look into conspiracies, the more I want to share my findings with others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s part of your problem right there.  I investigate the things investigate and uncover the things I uncover almost completely for the purpose of edifying <em>myself</em> and no one else; for the purpose of coming to understand more and more just where I am - what planet and civilization I find myself in.</p>

<p>If others find out some of the things I&#39;ve found out as well and come to some of the the realizations I&#39;ve come to as well, then great.  However, I don&#39;t investigate the things I investigate for the purpose of talking to others about it and trying to convince anyone of some of the deep truths I&#39;ve uncovered.  I investigate to, again, elucidate the true state of existence <em>for MYSELF</em>.  If others wish to find some of those things out as well, then great.  If they don&#39;t want to, however, then okay.  I focus and work on my <em>own</em> edification first and foremost - no one else&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s one of the stages.</p>

<p>Eventually you chill out a bit and it doesn&#39;t drive you batshit.</p>

<p>I actually went crazy for a few months before I came around, it wasn&#39;t good.</p>

<p>I started having massive panic attacks and ended up doing some pretty hefty damage on a 72 hour hold.</p>

<p>As time went on I learned to accept that, yeah, we&#39;re fucked and there&#39;s no stopping it. There has to be a catastrophic shift in paradigm before we can move forward and that shift is going to suck.</p>

<p>I deal with sheeple by alienating them.</p>

<p>My current endgame plan is buy some rural property and live in relative peace with my wife and dog. But I won&#39;t shocked, surprised or caught off guard is shit hits the fan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was hard for a long time, I won&#39;t lie, it still is sometimes, especially when you see how many people lose their s#!t over some dumb dress color or a flippin&#39; football that wasn&#39;t correctly inflated, this crap is all over the news, everyone&#39;s talking about it and it&#39;s a huge deal while other important issues are shrugged off as trivial. It is maddening but I think it&#39;s a fairly normal response for people to want to reject information that would completely turn their world upside down, not everyone can handle what they&#39;ll see if the pull back that curtain and so it&#39;s easier to label the messenger as crazy, which isn&#39;t at all fun to have happen especially if it&#39;s family members and close friends doing it.</p>

<p>What can you do? Its like that saying, &quot;you can lead a horse to water but you can&#39;t make it drink&quot;. Personally, I read a lot and am always hoping to discuss these topics because I think their important but I&#39;ve come to the realization that it&#39;s not fair to them for me to just throw this information at them, I mean I&#39;d prefer to see people care about being swindled and lied to or whatever but the truth is that isn&#39;t my call to make and their entitled to believe what they wish, even if I can provide a ton of evidence proving their wrong, I still can&#39;t tell anyone what to believe. Figuring that out has been the key to sanity for me. I&#39;ll still share what I know if its relevant to conversation and see how it&#39;s received by my audience and go from there. </p>

<p>I also write and that helps to just get it out. That&#39;s all I&#39;ve got, simple little thing but it&#39;s made life easier, so...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I mean it&#39;s fine to throw in a little nugget here and there to see if anyone has interest in discussing things further, I would suggest you do this after a bit just so that no one can jump to the that person must be crazy explanation that seems to be common in these situations. </p>

<p>Just, you know how it can really annoy people when super religious people, the fanatics I guess really tend to kind of force their views on others? Its the same sentiment here, some people just won&#39;t hear it for whatever the reason may be. I don&#39;t want you to think I&#39;m saying not to talk about these things, not at all, just try not to bombard people with anything they aren&#39;t ready to hear. </p>

<p>I personally could discuss this stuff all day every day so if you want feel free to message me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You also shouldn&#39;t just assume you are wrong. Find your truth and use it as an anchor as you navigate the waters of life, question everything, just respect others views and where they are in their journey. Personal growth is I think what we should all seek so that&#39;s commendable. If there is any advice I can offer its this, keep an open mind, an open heart, and never place yourself or anyone above another, we are all human(I think). Anyway good luck.</p>
