       America doesn't need walls or armed gates to keep its citizens from leaving. It's a much more sophisticated sense of imprisonment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its first defense is an implanted sense of patriotism. I say implanted in the sense that 1) Schools are told what to teach K-12 kids by the government, and if the school doesn't teach what the government tells it to, the school loses funding and eventually bye bye school. How can we be absolutely positive that what we are learning about American history is 100% accurate? I would like to hear other versions of American history to back this idea up. 2) We're more or less forced to say the "Pledge of Allegiance" every day at the beginning of class (ever try or see someone try to remain seated during this? Usually pisses the teacher off and the kid gives in.) This to me is a form of brainwashing, but I can see how people might say that it has no real implication on their world views. I also would like to discuss what you all think of playing the National Anthem before certain events and if that registers the same feelings as saying the pledge. After this sense of patriotism is implanted in a citizen, where the citizen believes its country is #1 in the world and its government can do no harm, why would they ever WANT to leave?
      </p>
      <p>
       However there are free-minded people who see through the facade. That's where the 2nd line of defense comes in.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is done institutionally as well throughout the schooling years. We're always told what life without a college degree looks like (broke and homeless). I am not arguing that you are much more likely to wind up this way without a college degree, but just hang with me. So then we turn 18 and are faced with a life-determining decision. At this point we can choose to quit school, but are so afraid of the consequences that not many people do. We can join the military and show off our "sense of patriotism," but to a lot of us that's just suicide. Or we can go to college, where we're promised from day 1 a job and comfortable life. However by the time we're out of college we have so much debt that there's no way we could just get up and move out of the country. And so we're forced into a life of imprisoned slavery to work ourselves out of this debt. For a lot of us, there's no getting ahead, only working to relieve the debt we accrued, and by the time the debt is paid off, a lot of the time we're too old and invested in America to do the things we wanted to before.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm curious to see what Conspiracy thinks of all this and also to see where the discussion goes. Cheers!

       but tl;dr: we spend our whole lives running a corporation called JOHN SMITH (for example) for the bank of london. the us govt is a corporation, not a republic. they own JOHN SMITH. they do not own John Smith.

       I've internalized and expanded on this but I haven't done any paperwork so far other than writing a formal complaint against policemen that stopped me illegally one time. There is another great series called "Creditors in Commerce", which tries to combine the spiritual and the financial side of living as a freeman.

       I don't think it's about the money. Honestly, money is just paper and digits on the screen. It's about the whole attitude of not being a scared little child when the police tries to intimidate you. Creditors in Commerce series deals with becoming a "creditor" - one who does not refuse unreasonable requests others place before him, but doesn't accept them unconditionally either. Instead, it's about negotiating, something I think none of us receive adequate training or education in.

       The idea that, when a bank sends you a contract, you can cross the parts you don't like and add terms you would like to see enforced and send it back to them to have it become legally enforceable if they sign it is completely insane, but is actually possible, only if you try.

       The government "borrows" money on our heads. The amount is based on our average lifespan. Change your name to all caps and you become a proper noun (or something like that) and a corporation. You can write yourself checks based on the value the government has placed on you...and avoid taxes.

       There is nothing special or unique about any of the nationalistic, patriotic rituals or institutionalization in America that hasn't happened elsewhere in history.  Most countries of the world attempt to culturally inculcate their youth into patriotic fervor as well.

       You might be onto something if you just scrap all of the assertions of jingoism and focus on the debt slavery angle.  That's where we really get screwed.

       After more thought I disagree with you here.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're right that it's not unique to America and it happens in different countries across the globe and has happened throughout history as well. However this doesn't mean it's a good thing, and it certainly doesn't mean it's a bad thing either! I was replying to someone else in this post and explained that it depends on the values being taught.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ... it depends on the values you are being taught. How many people are born and the first thing they think is "Fuck America, I'm going to fly a plane into their center of commerce!" Probably not many, but these values have been instilled in them through similar practices as saying the Pledge. The difference here is in one case a society pledges their allegiance to a country and the other prays to a god or gods. However as stated before, it depends on the values being instilled, and once again I must ask "Do I trust my government?"

       You fucking learn words.  I never said that nationalism was good or bad, but you never even noticed, apparently.  All I said was that the US is no different than anywhere else when it comes to nationalism.  All that idealistic stuff you were emoting, and the conclusions you came to, well, that's on you.  So you are disagreeing with what, exactly, now?  You don't even know, do you?

       Yes, and people get really up in arms about it if you choose not to participate, like it is such a sacred thing to pledge your allegiance to a nation that steals your tax dollars to go and start meaningless wars that only ensure more destabilization in the world. That piece of horseshit was written by a socialist in 1892, in order to help sell some American flags that he was hawking to schools around the country, if I remember correctly.

       This is sort of a broad topic to talk about. Nationalism in essence is neither

        good
       </em>
       nor
       <em>
        bad.
       </em>
       It really all depends on the beliefs and values of the country you show your loyalty to. For example, Nazi Germany was one of the most nationalistic societies in history, but we all know how that worked out. My point here was to pick at the whole 'Murica attitude that more and more people seem to be adopting. This attitude is what I was talking about when I said:

       Ok, I agree with you here and honestly it's not a view I've ever had expressed to me before surprisingly. Its always shaming the founding fathers on Columbus Day or taking land from the Indians. Nobody has ever spoken up and said "Wait a minute, why are we ashamed of winning?" Our country was founded to get away from Britain and they were successful in their goals. However I must disagree with you that I am experiencing white guilt about them, I don't find myself feeling any bit of guilty about what we did to form the big ass country we have today.
I think the point of my argument got misconstrued a bit. u/brildenlanch posted about David Icke's "Matrix" which I was watching a bit of last night and he explained what I was thinking better than I did. He said something along the lines of, we want our citizens to think certain ways about certain ideas but people are born with open minds. And so here's how we are going to program these people into thinking what we want them to think: We are going to take them away from their primary caretakers for 5 days every week in their formative years, and we are going to tell them what we want them to think. Then we are going to have them repeat our story back to us on a piece of paper, if they repeat it back then "Good for you! You're very clever!" If they don't do well, "We're going to give your parents a call!" Carrot and Stick approach. But wait, why would any reasonable human being allow a government to take their children away from them for 40 hours a week for this kind of brainwashing? David Icke says that its a form of newspeak -- giving something a word to mean the opposite of what it is, and we'll call it
       <em>
        education.
       </em>
       Again, I'm not arguing that I am better off in life because I've been educated, just pointing out the possibility of malpractice. I guess my only question remaining after pondering these theories is "Do I trust my own government?"

      <p>
       No, not necessarily unless you choose to believe the theory outlined in my last response. Even then like I was saying before while talking about nationalism, it depends on the values you are being taught. How many people are born and the first thing they think is "Fuck America, I'm going to fly a plane into their center of commerce!" Probably not many, but these values have been instilled in them through similar practices as saying the Pledge. The difference here is in one case a society pledges their allegiance to a country and the other prays to a god or gods. However as stated before, it depends on the values being instilled, and once again I must ask "Do I trust my government?"

       And it still is true! I am not arguing that I am much more likely to find a well paying job because of my higher education. That's why I said just hang with me. My intent by including this was to reference it later in the post when talking about the life-determining choices you have to make when you turn 18. I mean to make the point that you think you have those 3 choices; drop out, military, or college, but who in their right mind is willingly going to throw themselves into this future that they've been bred to fear?

      <p>
       Ehh, I kind of got lazy while making this point. When I said people join the military to show off their sense of patriotism, I was sort of mocking the advertising campaigns the military uses. Everyone has their reasons for joining whether its because they're poor, uneducated, or need help to afford school. The main point here was that military is just suicide to a lot of people. (P.S. Have you ever met a military man/woman who ISN'T gung ho 'Murica?)

       Actually, and I know I'm going to get lambasted for this but fuck it, it worked out
       <em>
        well
       </em>
       . Until it
       <em>
        didn't
       </em>
       . It was a slow creep sort of thing. Germany under National Socialism wasn't truly
       <em>
        bad
       </em>
       until Hitler finally followed through on his promises to the German people to do something about the ones causing economic problems. Oddly enough,
       <em>
        he was right
       </em>
       . If you take a look at history--hell, even recent history looking at America as your example--you'll see that the Jews have been kicked out of every country they've settled in for one thing specifically, time and time again: usury. Money lending. Economic warfare against a country and its peoples. There's a lot of research involved and I'm not getting into it at work, but it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       , in fact,
       <em>
        a thing
       </em>
       . Note: I'm not arguing that what Hitler did was right, I
       <em>
        am
       </em>
       arguing that what he did was
       <em>
        less wrong
       </em>
       than people make it out to be if you actually consider the history involved instead of simply looking at the "six gorillion."

        Ok, I agree with you here and honestly it's not a view I've ever had expressed to me before surprisingly. Its always shaming the founding fathers on Columbus Day or taking land from the Indians. Nobody has ever spoken up and said "Wait a minute, why are we ashamed of winning?" Our country was founded to get away from Britain and they were successful in their goals.

       It's something that has been going on for

        decades

       in American schools, slowly killing a sense of national pride.

       is your brainwashing program, meant to slowly destroy America.

        We are going to take them away from their primary caretakers for 5 days every week in their formative years, and we are going to tell them what we want them to think. Then we are going to have them repeat our story back to us on a piece of paper, if they repeat it back then "Good for you! You're very clever!" If they don't do well, "We're going to give your parents a call!" Carrot and Stick approach. But wait, why would any reasonable human being allow a government to take their children away from them for 40 hours a week for this kind of brainwashing? David Icke says that its a form of newspeak -- giving something a word to mean the opposite of what it is, and we'll call it education.

       This is all true

       , but I assure you, it once wasn't. There are a lot of things like this in place today, Common Core for instance, that our Founding Fathers would have declared war over.

       I'll answer that for you: if you trust the government, you're a fool. The greatest lie ever told by a government is, "I'm from the government and I'm here to help you."

       , in point of fact. My cousin was involved in Desert Storm and absolutely loathes the government. A childhood friend who used to be my neighbor back in the day was involved in taking Saddam's palace in a way I'm technically not supposed to know about, also thinks the government is full of shit and that America has allowed itself to go to pot.

       very interesting - i applaud your initiative on this. the whole establishing your 'claim of right' thing to get your $10M share of the country seems pretty scammy, but... what if?
