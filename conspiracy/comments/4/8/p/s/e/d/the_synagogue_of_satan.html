<p>Which is more of a religious sense (after hearing/commenting to OP many times). I&#39;m not saying other dimensional beings do not exist. Quite the opposite. I&#39;m saying, Satan is a broad term, used in religion, as a gate keeper, of the God v. The Devil/Satan/Lucifer/etc. Hope I clarified, cheers, and kudos! </p>

<p>So who is more enticed by Satan? Me or you? I live with nature and our Creator, yet you live for Satan&#39;s values. Greed, luxury, materialism, consumerism. You seem to want to bite the hand that feeds you. You want your cake and eat it too. Try it with a dog, it doesn&#39;t end up well for either ;). BrotherSpartacus, you are not as wise as you think. Also, tell them Northrop Grumman guys, I said HI. G&#39;nite.</p>

<p>You can have the luxuries in life and still be faithful to The Father. I do what He says to do. I love Him and I love everyone else and treat everyone like I would like to be treated. I do not want Christ&#39;s power and responsibility though. I just have His back. I will never go and hide in the woods on Him. </p>

<p>All in all, Jesus isn&#39;t the Son of God and their is no God. Look into the Flavian&#39;s of Rome. There may be a Creator, but it doesn&#39;t give a shit about you, or me (for that matter)....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and no. That story was just an interpretation of an actual event, The Great Deluge. Many other cultures/religions recorded the same event, with their own spin. So, a great flood did happen, yes, but regarding the whole &quot;Noah&#39;s ark&quot;, blah, blah, no.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That video has a lot of issues with it though, as do most hyperdiffusionism related theories. So first off, I&#39;m prett sure that video claimed humans have only been around for 6000 years, which doesn&#39;t make sense. Then it talks about the black knight satellite, which has been explained many times before. It then goes on to literally make up facts and present them as real, such as a claimed lunar mission that they just present and assume you won&#39;t question it. There&#39;s probably more I could say, but 1 hour is a long time, and I&#39;d rather not bombard you with 16 walls of text. Long story short, if ancient aliens existed, we&#39;d almost certainly find direct references to them, instead of taken-out-of-context references that aren&#39;t even about aliens.</p>

<p>No, quite the opposite. The video theorizes that humans have existed for far longer (ie. we have been here for 20,000+ years), than what evolutionary theory says.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Source?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Long story short, if ancient aliens existed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The video doesn&#39;t say aliens, quite the opposite. As in humans traveled space, not extraterrestrial beings.</p>

<p>I suggest watching the whole video, especially if you&#39;re going to comment.</p>
