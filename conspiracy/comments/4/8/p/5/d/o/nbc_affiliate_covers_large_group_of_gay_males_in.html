It&#39;s also extraordinary to find a common thread connecting all the victims in a particular area. So far, the only statistically significant attribute among victims is a high rate of whistleblowers, I believe. </p>

<p>Good to see this getting coverage. It <em>is</em> happening. It <em>is</em> very real. People will want to get on the right side of history with this one, and, at least, demand to know why documents from 2006 discuss bypassing normal human consent for experiments involving &quot;severe and unusual physical and psychological intrusion including mind-altering drugs and mind-control techniques.&quot;</p>

I also realize you are, essentially, on your own with this as you have extremely limited resources at your disposal.  I wish you the best, and hope you prevail.  And although its probably extremely difficult, I&#39;d suggest meditation...perhaps it can help quell the intrusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was first told they were evil spirits, then Russians, then aliens, and finally the CIA. That was five years ago. I did some googling and found a book by an ex-CIA scientist who they turned the weapons on. He was first told they were a satanic cult, then Russians, then aliens, then the CIA. </p>

<p>It all started, for both of us, with our phones and computers being hacked and destroyed with tech that was so advanced it seemed otherworldly. </p>

<p>We were both told we were &quot;activated.&quot; </p>

<p>I know it sounds insane, and it brings me a lot of shame talking about it. No one wants to be called crazy, but it&#39;s really happening. In 50 years it will be a footnote in history like MKUltra. </p>

<p>I was going to just keep it to myself, but it&#39;s only gotten worse and worse, and I feel a moral obligation to try to spread the word. I don&#39;t like doing this. </p>

<p>Feel free to dismiss my account, all I can say is I&#39;m 1000% sure it&#39;s happening. Please, though, if you think it&#39;s crazy and I&#39;m crazy- that&#39;s fine, but please treat me with dignity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. Yeah, they make you do things. It feels like an electronic possession. When they first hit me hard I was sitting in front of my laptop surfing the web, and they just took over. My fingers started typing on their own, &quot;Curiosity 36 is activated 666.&quot; </p>

<p>You don&#39;t hear the instructions. It&#39;s like being possessed by an AI. They give the AI instructions like, &quot;Now open the door.&quot; Of course, you feel they&#39;re talking to you, and, in the beginning, you converse with them. </p>

<p>They can take over your body and make you say anything they want. So I get tourettes type symptoms, where I&#39;ll shout out, &quot;Kill yourself,&quot; or, &quot;I am Satan.&quot; </p>

<p>According to the alleged ex-CIA scientist the kill version of the software is known by the acronym SATAN (silent assassinations through amplified neurons). It did what felt like a full possession of me many times. Big perverse grin, blank eyes, what little of you is there feels the human emotion of absolute horror, but there&#39;s electronically induced euphoria.</p>

<p>A lot of people, who aren&#39;t racist, hear hateful words about other races when they see them. They can duplicate the sound of your inner monologue so, unless it&#39;s extreme, it can be difficult to know what your thoughts are. I could go on and on. There&#39;s a lot more on my website if you&#39;re interested.</p>

<p><strong>2013:  Sky Deutsch­land to broad­cast adverts directly into train pas­sen­gers’ heads</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sky Deutsch­land has devel­oped tech­nol­ogy to trans­fer adverts from train win­dows directly and silently into com­muters’ heads.
Pas­sen­gers lean­ing their head against the win­dow will “hear” adverts “com­ing from inside the user’s head”, urg­ing them to down­load the Sky Go app.</p>

<p>The pro­posal involves using bone con­duc­tion tech­nol­ogy, which is used in hear­ing aids, head­phones and Google’s Glass head­set, to pass sound to the inner ear via vibra­tions through the skull.</p>

<p>A video for the Talk­ing Win­dow cam­paign released by Sky Deutsch­land and ad agency BBDO Ger­many states: “Tired com­muters often rest their heads against win­dows. Sud­denly a voice inside their head is talk­ing to them. No one else can hear this message.”</p>

<p>The voice comes from a Sky-branded trans­mit­ter made by Audiva that is attached to the train window.</p>

<p>BBDO spokesman Ulf Brychcy told the BBC: “If our cus­tomer Sky Deutsch­land agrees, we will start with the new medium as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>“Some peo­ple don’t like adver­tis­ing in gen­eral. But this is really a new tech­nol­ogy. [It might] not only be used for adver­tis­ing, but also for music, enter­tain­ment, mass trans­port infor­ma­tion, weather reports and so on.”</p>

<p>Sky Deutsch­land said it had not made a deci­sion on whether to launch the campaign.</p>

<p><strong>2007:  Voice to Skull Tech­nol­ogy in New York</strong></p>

<p>Via: AdAge: <a href="http://cryptogon.com/?p=1713">http://cryptogon.com/?p=1713</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>New Yorker Ali­son Wil­son was walk­ing down Prince Street in SoHo last week when she heard a woman’s voice right in her ear ask­ing, “Who’s there? Who’s there?” She looked around to find no one in her imme­di­ate sur­round­ings. Then the voice said, “It’s not your imag­i­na­tion.”</p>

<p>Indeed it isn’t. It’s an ad for “Para­nor­mal State,” a ghost-themed series pre­mier­ing on A&amp;E this week. The bill­board uses tech­nol­ogy man­u­fac­tured by Holosonic that trans­mits an “audio spot­light” from a rooftop speaker so that the sound is con­tained within your cra­nium. The tech­nol­ogy, ideal for muse­ums and libraries or envi­ron­ments that require a quiet atmos­phere for iso­lated audio slideshows, has rarely been used on such a scale before. For ran­dom passersby and res­i­dents who have to walk unwit­tingly through the area where the voice will pen­e­trate their inner peace, it’s another story.</p>

<p>Ms. Wil­son, a New York-based styl­ist, said she expected the voice inside her head to be some type of cre­ative project but could see how oth­ers might per­ceive it dif­fer­ently, par­tic­u­larly on a late-night stroll home. “I might be a lit­tle freaked out, and I wouldn’t nec­es­sar­ily think it’s com­ing from that bill­board,” she said.</p>

<p>Joe Pom­pei, pres­i­dent and founder of Holoson­ics, said the creepy approach is key to draw­ing atten­tion to A&amp;E’s show. But, he noted, the tech­nol­ogy was designed to avoid adding to noise pol­lu­tion. “If you really want to annoy a lot of peo­ple, a loud­speaker is the best way to do it,” he said. “If you set up a loud­speaker on the top of a build­ing, everybody’s going to hear that noise. But if you’re only direct­ing that sound to a spe­cific viewer, you’re never going to hear a neigh­bor com­plaint from street ven­dors or pedes­tri­ans. The whole idea is to spare other peo­ple.”</p>

<p>Holoson­ics has part­nered with a cable net­work once before, when Court TV imple­mented the tech­nol­ogy to pro­mote its “Mys­tery Whis­perer” in the mys­tery sec­tions of select book­stores. Mr. Pom­pei said the com­pany also has tested retail deploy­ments in gro­cery stores with Proc­ter &amp; Gam­ble and Kraft for cus­tomized audio mes­sag­ing. So a cus­tomer, for exam­ple, look­ing to buy laun­dry deter­gent could sud­denly hear the sound of gur­gling water and thus feel com­pelled to buy Tide as a result of the sonic expe­ri­ence.</p>

<p>Mr. Pom­pei con­tends that the tech­nol­ogy will take time for con­sumers to get used to, much like the lights on dig­i­tal sig­nage and illu­mi­nated bill­boards did when they were first used. The web­site Gawker posted an item about the bill­board last week with the head­line “Schiz­o­phre­nia is the new ad gim­mick,” and asked “How soon will it be until in addi­tion to the do-not-call list, we’ll have a ‘do not beam com­mer­cial mes­sages into my head’ list?”</p>

<p>“There’s going to be a cer­tain pop­u­la­tion sen­si­tive to it. But once peo­ple see what it does and hear for them­selves, they’ll see it’s effec­tive for get­ting atten­tion,” Mr. Pom­pei said.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, researchers developed voice morphing technology that allowed them to create convincing representations of the voices of a number of United States generals. In 1999, Los Alamos researchers replicated speech patterns from a 10-minute recording of General Carl W. Steiner and played the general a message: &quot;Gentlemen! We have called you together to inform you that we are going to overthrow the United States government.&quot; Other voice clones included Colin Powell saying &quot;I am being treated well by my captors.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good resources. Your last link does not bring up voiceprints. Could you please correct it?</p>

<p>The written introduction to this video on youtube stated: &quot;Nationwide this crime is committed 60% percent white women ages from 30 to 38. But in Palm Springs it is almost 98% gay men,&quot; said Bond.&quot; No source was cited. There is no such statistic. </p>

<p>Analysis of surveys are severely lacking due to lack of surveys and lack of making the analysis public. I drafted a survey. The survey included questions on sex and sexual preference. No one volunteered to create a survey monkey. See survey wiki in <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">/r/targetedenergyweapons</a>.</p>

<p>It is unknown whether gays are a significant percentage of the population of targeted individuals. A dutch TI created a gang stalking wiki in which he alleged gay men were significantly targeted. On Peacepink, Hugh was criticized for not citing the source.</p>

<p>Someone PM me that Hugh had used an analysis of organized stalking by a French detective. The analysis was in French. I submitted it in <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">/r/targetedenergyweapons</a> and requested a volunteer to translate. No one volunteered. I preserved the post in the survey wiki but discovered today it had been deleted. Reddit&#39;s search engine does not bring up the post. Since last year, hundreds of my posts have been removed from the front page and from Reddit&#39;s search engine. Posts have been deleted from wikis. Wikis have been removed. Since last year, I have asked redditors to adopt wikis. They have not.</p>

<p>The introduction of the video: &quot;I reported people, someone for selling, I thought they were selling drugs and they were,&quot; said Ringger.&quot;</p>

<p>There have been reports of organized crime targeting people who report their crimes. Organized crime has access to power line hacking and satellite DEWs. See Perps: Organized crime wiki in <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">/r/targetedenergyweapons</a>.</p>

<p>&quot;Most of it is delivered by microwave and I believe it is satellite delivered.&quot; Microwave auditory effect is via microwave. Ultrasound hearing is via ultrasound. Apparently, the TIs in Palm Springs did not know how to use meters to measure microwaves and ultrasound.</p>

<p>The video introduction did not differentiate between hearing auditory voices vs. silent inner voices vs. subliminal messages. The introduction quoted one TI in which he implied the voices were auditory: &quot;&quot;I started hearing as you&#39;ll hear, hearing voices and what they&#39;ll call voice to skull or microwave hearing,&quot;  If the voices are auditory, they would be microwaved auditory effect. The audible voices can be measured using a spectrum analyzer.</p>

<p>Subliminal messages could be modulated in microwaves and ultrasound:</p>
