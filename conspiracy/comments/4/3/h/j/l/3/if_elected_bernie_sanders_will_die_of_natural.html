<p>He promises all the &quot;glorious&quot; free handout programs of Europe, yet neglects to mention the extremely regressive taxes, the key differences in culture and population size, and the fact that none of those countries actually fund their militaries because they rely on us to fight for them (freeing up money to go towards their welfare states instead). He also leaves out the part where nationalist parties and conservative welfare reform parties are becoming more and more popular in Europe because they&#39;re finally realizing that socialism doesn&#39;t work in the long run. Even scarier than his deranged views are the Modern Monetary Theory kooks he surrounds himself with.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/berniesanders/status/654741381294874624">On top of that, he&#39;s grossly ignorant of economics.</a> He has constantly flubbed the most basic facts; one that comes to mind instantly is his ignorance of the reasons why student loans differ from car loans or mortgages.</p>

<p>All of this is kind of null - since the guy isn&#39;t going to be elected, and even if he was none of his policies would stand a chance to be passed. </p>

<p>I think spending a little money to help our own rather than spending a ton to fight enemies on foreign soil is a good thing, not sure why you frame it as being so terrible. </p>

<p>And who exactly is realizing socialism doesn&#39;t work? You compare the US to &quot;those countries&quot; but I&#39;m not sure who you are refrencing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Destroy the Federal Reserve. Repeal the income tax. Business tax through the floor, high import tariffs. Tax business profits such that it is financially untenable to not reinvest said profits in the business, perpetually creating jobs.</p>

<p>Make the <em>concept</em> of single payer healthcare illegal. Repeal the unconstitutional Obamacare. Make it illegal to prevent cross-state insurance purchases. How the fuck is this even a PROBLEM? Rework both the AMA and APA to work exclusively on medical science, not consensus or feelings. Any doctor or psychiatrist who is threatened with death needs to know the government will protect him. Dismantle the FDA. Phase out government aid in all aspects of medicine. See below for why.</p>

<p>Repeal Common Core. Force school corporations to compete with one another for funding vis a vis quality of improvement. Now we have to be careful here: corporations must be forced to keep the students they are assigned and be allowed to hire/fire (distribute pay) based on merit. Then, and only then, can (and therefore should) the teachers’ unions be dismantled. Under the current system they’re a necessity to protect teachers from corporations (when corporations should be climbing over each other to win over teachers, who should have their pick of corporation–their responsibility, then, is to provide the quality of education they claim to be able to). End ALL government financial aid (here’s the “below”). Tuition has skyrocketed for ONE reason: schools know that kids will always be able to “pay” ANY amount through a government loan. Bring back trade schools and apprenticeships. Not all professions need college. Many HAVE to have on-the-job training to be hired in the first place that they CANNOT get now.</p>

<p>I have much more on this, but these are the bullet points.</p>
