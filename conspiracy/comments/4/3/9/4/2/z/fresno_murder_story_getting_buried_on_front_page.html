       The article is still high in r/news  (over 5600 up)  and very popular here, (over 6400 up)  yet somehow the story isn't on the Front Page.  Meanwhile, there is a pic of Antarctica from r/Earthporn (with 5200 up) that still stays on the main page.  They were both posted 17 hours ago.
       <br/>
       Now, I don't know much about Reddit and how uprooting works, but I also find it interesting, that the Fresno article on r/news shows different subreddits in the 'other discussions' than what shows here in r/conspiracy.    You would think that the same article, which is generating many up votes on two different subs would be matched up in 'other discussions', and still have a presence on the Front Page.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the comments from r/news I saw early last night was about blanket down voting ?   Now I've read a few posts here about this strategy used by governments to 'silence' any chatter, and it would make sense governments have these social media agents directing a certain narrative.        It also kinda lines up with the other stories that are now being connected to this. (not connected per say, but the stories being dug up about the corruption and cover ups etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there was the article about how these counties in CA have the highest police murder rate per capita.        Its all quite alarming.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit:  7hours after I made this post, the article has 6500+ votes here, and was on the front of r/conspiracy, Now looking for the article on r/conspiracy has it down at #78. (4th page)

       I saw the article on the reddit front page late last night, and came back to read more comments today, only to find the article was not to be found.  Search from the Reddit front page "John Lang" and got search failed error. Searched from the Reddit front page "Fresno" and got the search failed error. Just to see if the search function was working on the front page, searched for "breastfeeding" - no problem with the search.
Went to Google News - found this story was only being picked up by fringe news sites and one French newspaper. No one wants you to know about John Lang. Even on Reddit - Not a single new comment in 8 hours on the original John Lang story that was on the front page last night. The question is not, "Who was John Lang afraid of?" The Question is, "Who is afraid of John Lang?"

       Its all a little weird.  I usually post fairly politically charged articles on my Facebook.   Every day I usually get some response.  Most of my friends are 'in the know' so we usually debate a lot of these government 'mysteries'.    The only post that hasn't gotten any comments or likes was when I posted the Fresno article...

       I was surprised at the fact that your post had so few comments. What is going on?  No comments on the original article in eight hours? No likes on yours?  that is weird.

       ya, most of the comments are me replying to a few random points and whatnots.   Ive never had anything posted on Reddit get so many up votes.    Yet sometimes, some random comment I make in some other sub that would draw more response.   Oh well.  I just thought it was a weird thing to see it rise so fast, then just drop off.    The article  on r/news about the sex assaults in Germany/Europe held around 5500 votes on the main page for 2 or 3 days once it got going.   I don't know.

       upvotes arent the only factor. they also count how fast the hits come in and for how long   when the hits slow down,indicating level of interest. and how many people comment.  so the upvotes can be high  but if the hits start to wane  it moves over for something that is just a little hotter in interest currently. there really isnt any conspiracy here.   how many news storys do you see that get plastered up every where in msm and suddenly its just gone. cnnn and fox news monitor very closely theyre own comment sections and social media   when a story slows down they move on.   its about ratings and keeping people interested.

       there is though the mod factor that might be rushing it away to make more room i dont doubt that at all.    they just want the front to be as diverse as possible    good news, bad news.  happy news and s the usual nonsense.  i usually look at maybe the first page then click new.  you wont see any of that quite yet.

       More like keeping people Distracted. Not interested. People these days have no personal interests. the're sheep...they do what they're told and watch/listen to what they're told. That's it. The media knows that, and they also know how short peoples attention spans are...It's worse than a damn dog.

       The real sheep are those that think like this. Its easier to label everyone as complacent sheep instead of looking at yhe real issue of information suppression and subversion of efforts to keep the system honest. You add nothing to the conversation. You are the sheep. Do something other than bitch about things.

       Ya, its kinda scary.  And not that I have uncovered anything special, 
 but the more I post about this, and the more we discuss,    I can't help but get a feeling, that there is someone in Fresno following all this.

       The guy should of gotten himself a gun even if it means he had to borrow it from his friends or co-workers.

       The Threat toward his  safety was not  a what-if. It doesn't matter if he killed a cop in the process before dying a. He was going to die by the way things sound.

       What is the best plan of action of spreading the news of the this horrible situation. We need to get as many people in the public to be aware of what is happening in their own neighborhoods.

       its seems to be only word of mouth thats working.    I mean, it has been on the Front Page for a small amount of time,  but it was quickly buried for one reason or another.     Ive just been bringing it up with people in casual convo.   "Have you heard about that murder in Fresno?"

       I for one will be paying more attention to Fresno headlines in the future.   From what I've seen posted on different subreddits after this incident, most people 'claiming' to be from Fresno, don't seem phased that it could be true.   They pointed me in the direction of this article,
       <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/01/the-county-kern-county-deadliest-police-killings">
        http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/01/the-county-kern-county-deadliest-police-killings
       </a>
       and it was kinda crazy to see those numbers.  With all the attention on Chicago, this area seems to be forgotten about.    I don't know man.   I don't know what happened, or what IS happening.
