       It's just basically a pay-for-votes political platform. Look at the top subs. No-one is interested unless you're attacking Hilary Clinton, and then you can have 5,000 votes, courtesy of special interest groups.

       It genuinely has reached the stage where literally everything the public is involved in has been corrupted by money. I'm sick of having to put up with the way reality and truth are distorted by those with money. I'm beginning to think we are almost like a disease, because even those who care stop once someone pays them.

       Personally, I think that money is an amazing tool and, like guns, can either be used properly or improperly. As I said, I haven't bought Reddit upvotes and I don't intend to. It's not a viable option for helping my clients and I think the money is better spent elsewhere.

       It's an illusion, pal. Money works like addiction to cigarettes. You have a bunch of cool shit to do, but then someone says you can't enjoy it properly unless you have money. Like cigarette addiction, it takes while it simultaneously provides you with the illusion that you are getting something in return, be that a nicotine hit or a nice meal. Thing is, you didn't always need nicotine to feel good, and you didn't always need money to have a nice meal.

       Pretty sure my mom used money for McDonald's and Dairy Queen back in the day. And I've never gotten free food for nothing in return.

       If you're saying waaaaaaaaaay back when people hunted on their front lawns for vermin to shoot and cook, then okay, but they had to give up something of value (crops, wool, etc) to get something they wanted in return (bullets, oil for lamps, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Money just replaced what you had to give up to get something.

       What I meant is that money is a self-imposed condition of feeding ourselves. It is not our natural condition to starve because we don't have enough of something someone else has ordered is mandatory for eating. It doesn't matter whether it has been the case for one or a thousand generations: it isn't natural. It is in fact a self-imposed prison. We placed an unnecessary, arbitrary condition onto our own survival.

       But we've always had to give up something to get something else. Food was never freely distributed without us having to do anything to get it. Unless you're speaking about Eden or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as self-imposed prisons, look to our cell phones, day-to-day routines that everyone else is dependent on and, last but not least, Reddit.

       Not money. You received the toils of your labour. Now you receive a small percentage of the toils of your labour, given back to you by the person who pockets the rest. It's called a wage and you are expected to be grateful for it.

       I'd argue that outside of rare circumstances, you get paid what you think you're worth. If the job doesn't pay enough, don't take it and then complain about the wage.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least in the US, you can start your own biz for (next to) nothing, offer superior products/services and command the salary/hourly wage you think you're worth.

       Lol. Look bro, I don't want to offend, but you seem persistent and in my experience there is little point arguing with someone who has been inculcated into a flawed or irrational belief system. There are certain objective realities which your subjective viewpoint causes you to reject since they are inconsistent with your belief structure. Unfortunately, it leads to people using rather stupid, emotionally-driven rhetoric with no basis in truth. Saying that people get paid what they think they are worth is one such example of this, since clearly any hungry man or woman is not going to allow themselves to starve because they have an ego and think they are worth a million dollars. That's simply absurd and contrary to the most fundamental rules of human psychology. People have to work or they cannot live. Hence, they work for what they can get from the people prepared to pay them to do it. The X Factor and similar talent shows are stuffed to the rafters with talentless idiots who think they are the next Justin Bieber. Since these people all have jobs at McDonalds and Walmart I am going to safely conclude that debunks your theory that salary is equal to ego.

       In real life, sure. But the internet was not always like that. Once upon a time you were allowed to express an opinion without it being silenced or censored. The difference is simple, I think. Initially, everybody's opinion was equal. Now, opinions are not so equal.

       Nope. Just  a paid propagandist. Clearly you can't stand being called that, which only shows that you know it is far from a noble profession. As you well know (or should do), marketing is full of psychological manipulation methods designed to "brainwash" the consumers of that marketing. These techniques were actually developed by psychologists specifically to mislead.

       Woefully misinformed? You get paid to create websites for corporations - you call it
       <em>
        internet marketing

       . That is advertising. You even admit to using social media to do it, and mention you "hate it", so you know it is not very ethical but you do it anyway.

       What? Of course it's advertising. It's not
       <em>
        all that encompasses advertising

       though.

       I don't tell people to tell anyone anything. See, you do not even understand what word-of-mouth is - all you know are the propaganda definitions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Word-of-mouth is when a satisfied customer recommends your business to someone else without any prompting from you. You're talking about the fake word-of-mouth propagandists try to generate using social media etc.

       No, you're just being stupid. (In fact if I could be bothered, I'd even tell you the propaganda technique you are using right now).

       I don't know when a customer is talking to someone else. I'm not the NSA, or corporations using tracking cookies to digitally follow their customers around.

       When a customer tells me his friend said he should come to me, that's the first I know about it. Are you expecting me to tell him his friend is a liar and my services aren't as good as he's been told?

       I don't know.   It's pretty ridiculous that anyone puts any 'value' in reddit votes anyway.  Who cares?   Why does it matter what posts receive which kinds of votes?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why dies it matter what "the group"  thinks about a topic?   Why does it matter if the measuring stick here on reddit is accurate?
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reasons I can think one would care are:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) You want votes to accurately curate the posts that show up in a sub.   OK,  but do we even know what the algorithm behind reddit even is?   Beyond finding things interesting to you that keep you reading, what does it matter?  If things get messed with and content no longer seems relevant, then quit reading and move on.   Seems simple enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) You look to group think to help form your opinions and any perception of monkeying around with votes hampers your ability to correctly discern group thought relative to a given post   This frustrates and angers you. Fair enough.   Again,  quit reading reddit and move on.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) You believe these things matter and actually influence people in tangible ways. It frustrates and angers you to see public opinion played with in this manner.   Again,  quit reading reddit and move on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know,  I guess I have just never embraced the validity of Internet voting as being relevant to anything.   It's like when people get upset over forged autographs on celebrity pictures.   Who cares?   Why put any value into a signature at all?   Perhaps you are the one with unreasonable expectations.

       Today/yesterday's #1
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       post was an anti-Hillary post.  It has 5300+ upvotes.  It was submitted by a poster who
       <em>
        does not submit to
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy

       .  Most of the comments in the thread are by non-
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       regular posters.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next closest items on the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       front page don't have anywhere near 5300+ upvotes.  Not even half of 5300.
       <em>
        Not even 10% of 5300.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       What explains one
       <em>
        non-conspiracy
       </em>
       anti-Hillary post getting TEN TIMES the number of upvotes of the nearest next vote count?
      </p>
      <p>
       This happens multiple times per week.  Last Monday there was a
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/426gew/watch_angela_merkel_you_have_killed_germany_16/?ref=search_posts">
        <em>
         non-conspiracy
        </em>
        anti-Merkel post
       </a>
       that had 1200 votes.  The next closest
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       post had 230.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are single-occurance posts per day that meteorically rise to the top with ten times the upvotes of any other post.  Conspicuous &amp; contrived.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews, immigrants, hoax crisis actors, anti-Hillary, gun confiscation, flat earth.  There's a political agenda &amp; a spam agenda.

       In the interest of accuracy, I would point out that the OP of the first-referenced post in the comment to which you are replying actually IS a prolific poster to this sub. Over 3/4 of his submission and comment history is in this sub. The whole thing still stinks to high heaven, but inacurrate reporting of facts is why we're all here, isn't it? Let's not fall victim to the same errors we are fighting.

       There also seems to be a handful (or two) of users that seem to have almost every one one of their posts with 1000+ points and are always cycling their content through the first 5 pages of /all and even my own front page.....their content even shows up on my front page and I'm not even subscribed to the sub they're posting to. Some users for example are /iBleeedorange, noerdy, slimjones123, chazdoge, gallowboob (of course), yannireddit123, Lobo2ffs, 1voice1life, loopdeloops, among a few others. I also noticed that there are a lot of recent accounts with "123" at the end of their user names, maybe there's something there, too, I don tknow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their posts are always usually shit, stupid shit that can easily take a high position with points, over-saturating anything else that may have substance for something REAL or important. I report a lot of these user's posts as spam because that's...kind of exactly what they're doing, spamming posts all over the place and (like I said earlier) they are leaking into my front page without me subscribing to the sub they're posted in. My account was recently suspended because I was "abusing the report function." I tried to appeal it and didn't hear a thing back from anyone, so fuck it, I guess.

       It's gotten to the point where I'm almost convinced that they are being paid to post this stupid, useless, over-posted and reposted content to keep the regular frequenter distracted.....or something.

       I noticed that CANT_TRUST_HILLARY poster was constantly on the front page. Only found something regarding that on r/conspiracy. So sick of seeing Bernie, Bernie, Bernie. I don't like either. Just annoying how controlled and bought the front page is.

        There also seems to be a handful (or two) of users that seem to have almost every one one of their posts with 1000+ points and are always cycling their content through the first 5 pages of /all and even my own front page.....their content even shows up on my front page and I'm not even subscribed to the sub they're posting to. Some users for example are /iBleeedorange, noerdy, slimjones123, chazdoge, gallowboob (of course), yannireddit123, Lobo2ffs, 1voice1life, loopdeloops, among a few others. I also noticed that there are a lot of recent accounts with "123" at the end of their user names, maybe there's something there, too, I don tknow.

       Thanks for this. It is right that these accounts should be exposed. Unfortunately, since accounts are so easy to open and dump when necessary, I'm unsure how much impact it will have. It's the force behind these accounts which needs to be tackled.

        My account was recently suspended because I was "abusing the report function." I tried to appeal it and didn't hear a thing back from anyone, so fuck it, I guess.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I think this is evidence of an actual conspiracy because I have had surprisingly similar experiences on other sites. The IMDb boards are a good example. I couldn't open a thread on those boards, about anything. Every time I tried it would accumulate so many abuse reports that it would be wiped. People on that site -- in fact I'm going to say Zionist Jews, because that is who they were -- were able to have any post or thread they liked wiped, for any arbitrary reason they liked. Most of the time it was just because they didn't like me and wanted to gleefully show off how much power they had.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, after several years of posting there and having at least eighty or ninety percent of my content wiped, I started opening alternative accounts just to get a voice. That went OK for a while, until whoever was trolling me began to identify them, and then these accounts were all eventually shut down. It must have been someone in admin who was doing it, because they'd close every account but always leave me with my main account, and then troll the fuck out of me every time I tried to use it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure you can guess what happened when finally, after probably about four years or so of just taking this shit on the chin, I started reporting the accounts I had identified as definite trolls and abusers. Account banned within 48 hours of me making my first report.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's farcical. These people have complete impunity from the rules.

       Nice deflection from the topic.  The topic is: over-the-top brigading of 5,000 votes.  The top posts on
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       only reach 5,000 votes a few times per week.  The top posts on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       one year ago rarely cracked 1500-2000 votes.

       You've only got 10 minutes left with me before I go offline for the night.  Better make the next urgent itchy off-topic pitch really a big one.  Can't find enough about Hillary in my comment history?  So itchy.

       I didn't look in your comment history because you are an antagonistic asshole and it would be exhausting to read.  So why don't you go fuck yourself and look at my post history where I spelled that Bitch's name wrong several times.  You need to show some respect on here and actually have a discussion instead of needlessly aggravating people.

       That's why I just don't bother anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't get involved in hot-button or controversial topics anymore, what's the point? You're not gonna "open any eyes" or wake anybody up. Trust me, in this day and age anybody who is actually smart enough to understand alternative news sources is already aware of them.

       I don't feel like losing my account to a shadowban or getting vote-brigaded either, all over some dumb argument online.

      <p>
       These days, I just thoughtfully read the articles and sometimes even the comments and I just use Reddit for what it is at heart: a fun link sharing site, light-hearted amusement. Stuff that entertains me is fine to participate on, but for anything that actually makes me
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       , I just silently lurk, vote and then move on.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are still great conversations to be had here outside of the topics that piss people off.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        tl;dr: It's not that Reddit is getting stupider, it's just that the smart people comment less on anything of substance.

       Nobody wants that, which is how specialist interest groups get away with controlling the popularity of threads. They have complete immunity to cheat the vote count and can create such a volume of abuse reports that only the most neutral of mods will not feel like singling you out as a target for a ban.

       I'm not sure we are that small at all. Consider that in the last British election for example, more people didn't vote at all than voted for the winning party. But even if our views are a minority, then you could easily have said the same about Einstein in his heyday. Having a minority view usually means one of two things: either you're more stupid than average or you're less stupid than average.

       That's actually a surprisingly profound question. When I was very young, I was led to expect integrity, justice and a basic form of fairness. Boy, was I disappointed. It's funny how we lie to our kids.

       Well, somebody is upvoting the living shit out of anything anti-Hilary. It is possible that it could be Sanders shills, but tbh until I see something solid to the contrary I'm just going to presume it's the hard right, batshit GOP pushers. They are confirmed cunts, whereas Sanders is not.

       No, it's been that way for a while. And look at what those brilliant asshole Fine Bros have done. I'm sure this gimmick has driven traffic tho their site ten fold because all the knuckleheads on Reddit fall for the 'get your pitchforks' and pile on their own videos, only adding the frenzy which the Fin's probably wanted.

       In the interest of accuracy, I would point out that the OP of the first-referenced post in the comment to which you are replying actually IS a prolific poster to this sub. Over 3/4 of his submission and comment history is in this sub. The whole thing still stinks to high heaven, but inacurrate reporting of facts is why we're all here, isn't it? Let's not fall victim to the same errors we are fighting.
