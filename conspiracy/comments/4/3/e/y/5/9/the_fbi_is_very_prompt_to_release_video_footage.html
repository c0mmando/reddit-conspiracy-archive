       As much as I'd like to blame the landlord the media is actually at fault. They are supposed to be the professionals who know how these situations work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of all types of employment out there, wouldn't you expect reporters to be well versed about how they should behave at a crime scene?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think there are reporters out there that behave in a manner seen on television, where they willingly sneak into crime scenes to steal evidence for an exclusive lead? Even then, that's not what we saw there.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we did see was intentional destruction of a crime scene by the media. There's no way those people didn't know what they were doing at the time. The confusion was false and misleading.

       I'm not blaming anyone, I'm just calling out the guy I replied to for making a disingenuous accusation that would mislead people who had not read about the circumstances of the situation.

       I agree that it is unprofessional to report from the home of suspects (innocent until proven guilty, right?).

       The house had already been searched by law enforcement, if the investigation wasn't finished they wouldn't have been able to enter. I don't see how they destroyed anything.

       The investigation wasn't finished the FBI was technically  in custody of the house when the landlord let them.

       The difference being that there should be tons of footage between all the cruisers and officers present during the apprehension and fatal wounding of suspects in the San Bernardino incident, but there's nothing. It's as if evidence is being withheld, or police were told to turn their dash cams off (which should be illegal). How are you having trouble grasping this?

       Sandy Hook,   San Bernardino,   Boston,   were media spectacles designed in part to lower the standard for news.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are getting used to watching a presentation that raises more questions than it answers while at the same time,  our "media heroes" set an example of uncritically consuming and dishing out this drivel.    What really happened is almost secondary to how it was handled and presented.    And yet,   what really happened was a manufactured event,   which does make it even more toxic to consume as a passive tv spectator.    Brain numbingly destructive to critical thought unless challenged,   and if challenged,   and only challenged by a minority,   then the national myth grows and  dissent  becomes increasingly painful.
      </p>
      <p>
       We live in an information age,   and this is how they are conditioning us regarding information,   to be sloppy consumers,   overwhelmed,   and docile.
      </p>
      <p>
       The last thing they want is a population that is wise to what is actually happening.    If that were the case,   as citizens we would see the obvious path,   and not accept being fleeced at every level.    We are expected to settle for shoddy government,   shoddy news,  shoddy politicians.     Even the consumer products that are remarkably reliable have fatal design features that waste our time and energy for the sake of control and profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It takes no small effort or amount of thought to craft these policies as they have been crafted.    And watch what happens to any good ideas in regards to improving public education or policing.    Only when corporate interests can make a profit at the change are we going to see new ideas implemented,   and they are usually geared towards an ever greyer and dismal quality of life for the majority.    The effect is remarkably Soviet no matter the consumer glitter that may be applied.

       CCTV and dashcams don't require preparation, they record whether something is happening or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Inland Regional Center has loads of surveillance cams and there were several law enforcement vehicles involved in the pursuit and shootout, which likely means dash and/or body cams. One of the cops said they were shooting out his windshield as he followed, that would be some riveting footage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention CCTV from Enterprise, where Farook allegedly rented the SUV and the Magnum gun range where he and his wife (in a burqa) allegedly ran 'run and guns' in preparation for the attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media, despite pilfering the suspects' home, has only ever published three pictures of the suspects alive. Two were driver's license photos (CA DMV has since said they won't release those anymore) and one is from OHare airport in 2014. A picture of them holding weapons would enforce the narrative far more effectively, yet none have been shown.
      </p>
      <p>
       No witnesses have identified the shooters either. No wonder the media stopped interviewing them.

       The whole thing was an ambush so the FBI/OSP had a chopper in position ready to chase, hence the footage of the high speed escape attempt. I would like to see them release the entirety of the footage instead of joining the high speed "chase" in progress.
      </p>
      <p>
       I love how the media initially portrayed this as a "traffic stop", like he was just pulled over for speeding and something happened and he got shot.

       It was awfully strange how perfect the FBI footage aligned with Victoria Smith's recorded statement too.. I'd like to hear some audio instead of strictly video.

       Thanks. Just a heads up, it's Victoria Sharp, not Smith.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Sharp confirmed that the passengers never drew weapons and attempted to get out of their vehicles before federal agents fired “at least 120 shots altogether” at the vehicle carrying her party.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This should be easy to confirm. Has anybody posted pictures of the vehicle?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Finicum was walking with his hands in the air, daring federal agents, “Just shoot me! Just shoot me” – at which point the agents shot him dead. The witness testimony indicates that his hands were still in the air.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       On the video, he moves his arms down and into his jacket or down to his stomach. It is not clear at which point he was first shot, either before or after reaching down.
      </p>
      <p>
       She also changes her story, first claiming they shot him 3 times on the ground, then later claiming at least 6 times on the ground. She also says all of them were sticking their hands out of the windows, but no arms or hands can be

        seen
       </a>
       . She also says there were 40 vehicles and snipers in the trees. "20 lasers" on her when she was getting out of the car. She also admits that he was yelling "Just shoot me!".

       Yea.. Watch the video. There's bullets going through the front windshield after Lavoy is on the ground. Pay attention to his body and you will see lasers pointed at his head while he is on the ground..
      </p>
      <p>
       If the audio further proved how much Lavoy "deserved" this, I guarantee you it would have been released.. Think about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason they released this video was supposedly to "stop speculation" but all it really did was produce more unanswered questions.. If the audio proved their narrative as correct, you would have heard it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where's the body cams? Where's the dash cams? If this was a traffic stop, why was there already drones flying over head along with snipers in the woods..
      </p>
      <p>
       One of those sniper guys is the one who shot Lavoy.. He ran up behind Lavoy and shot him right in the back with a rifle.. Why was it necessary to kill him without trying to arrest him? He clearly got out of the car with his hands up.. So what happened/what was said between him getting out and the first shot fired?
      </p>

       The audio would tell you......

       Do you have a link and the time where I'll see that?

      <p>
       I don't think this feed has any useful audio. Was it a drone or a chopper? None of the vehicles are pointing at the shooting so dashcam would not help. I don't think they're wearing body cams. The guy on the left does not have a rifle. He shoots with a handgun, so he's definitely not a sniper.

       I think if we had audio we might hear that they opened fire the second they got a clear shot, while his hands were still up. And they used him "trying to hit the LEO with his truck" (when LEO clearly jumps towards the vehicle) as their excuse.

       I think we would find out that Lavoy got spooked during the stop because an officer fired at Ryan Payne when he stuck his head out the window to say there was women in the car.. I also think we would hear the 100+ gunshots that Victoria mentioned in her statement. I am not choosing sides on this, so there's no bias on my behalf, but I just don't feel there was enough information to draw a good conclusion..
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if you watch the video closely.. A sniper-type officer runs out from behind the bushes (I would call that an ambush scenario, but I'm not choosing sides) and shoots him in the back.. That's what killed him, in my opinion..
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever Lavoy was shouting when he got out of the car is being specifically withheld and I'd like to know why.

       I have no dog in this fight as far as what the "militia" was doing either but this entire story has been twisted into an excuse to attack a certain group of people from the beginning by the media (especially the online media). The first story I ever saw posted on this was basically "Right wing terrorists take over federal building to use as a base to attack the government". The headline was obvious bullshit but people believed it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone watches this and doesn't see a plotted execution of an "enemy of the state" (possibly to teach others of a similar mindset a lesson about fucking with the government) then their political bias is getting in the way.

       Dude, haven't you realized that in this particular case, the bs media actually ended up completely doing their jobs? People can literally watch a man get murdered with their own eyes, and still not even question if it's right or wrong.. I never chose a "team" when it comes to that whole situation, but I was very involved due to it being so close to home, so I watched every single thing unfold and I can honestly say that man didn't deserve to die.. But they really tricked the majority this time.

       Yea, this is directly from the FBI's YouTube channel.. Before you watch it, you should listen to Victoria Smith's statement (she was inside the car when all of this happened) and also compare it to McDonnell's statement (that is clearly BS after watching the video [you find out his statement can't possibly be valid due to him being ENTIRELY too far away to even be able to see/hear what he claims he saw])
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, this will be my last post here.. There is clearly an agenda being pushed by biased people, for whatever reason.

       It does not say anything. One event is not related to the other event. Implying the events and actions surrounding event A has any bearing on the handling of event B is a flaw in logic

       What is so different between that event and the San Bernardino event, according to your flawless logic?

       2nd edit - Anyone else remember Chris Dorner shopping for SCUBA gear?

       Dorner buying Oxygen was front page news but Farook renting the alleged getaway car or stocking up on ammo are apparently unimportant details.

       3rd edit - Here's some dashcam video of Dorner's ambush on two Riverside, CA LEOs.

       I'd never seen the one where Donner kills the officer on video....interesting. They show what will push an agenda. What they don't show apparently some people are okay with whatever the news screams at them. Remember all the footage from Columbine?

       It says that different police departments have different policies on how they distribute video footage.

       To suggest anything else is a fallacy.
