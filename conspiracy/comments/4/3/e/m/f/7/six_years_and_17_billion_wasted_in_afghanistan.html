       Hmm...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        John Sopko, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), told members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that U.S. Embassy officials in Kabul informed his team “out of the blue” that it would have to reduce its staff by 40 percent over the next year.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's from
       <a href="http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/08/State-Dept-Trying-Muzzle-Afghanistan-Watchdog">
        May 2015
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "SIGAR is an independent Inspector General and this is an issue of independence,” Sopko said in an email to The Fiscal Times. “Just like we don't let the banks decide the number of banking regulators, the State Department, who we investigate, shouldn't determine our staffing at the Embassy.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Why did the State Department reduce oversight in Afghanistan?
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder if perhaps
       <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6450a3.htm?s_cid=mm6450a3_w">
        this
       </a>
       is related?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Since 2000, the rate of deaths from drug overdoses has increased 137%, including a 200% increase in the rate of overdose deaths involving opioids (opioid pain relievers and heroin).
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They'll likely tell you that most of that Heroin is coming from Mexico, but Mexico only produces about 2% of the world's supply... All of
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       supply would not cover the US domestic Heroin market, meaning that most of the US
       <strong>
        is not
       </strong>
       getting heroin produced in Mexico. It
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       be coming into the country from there, but it certainly isn't being produced there.
      </p>
      <p>
       So where do the poppies grow, and what of the logistics to get it from there to here?
      </p>
      <p>
       Air America? Mena?
      </p>
      <p>
       Heroin is all over America
       <em>
        right now
       </em>
       , to an extent that few would probably believe. It has to be coming from somewhere, and the sheer amount means that someone is turning their heads to let it happen.

       I'm really starting to feel like perhaps heroin is an unsung heroine of the American economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The logistics really boggle my mind though... either the DEA is abysmally shitty in its efforts of heroin interdiction (and the NSA offers zero support, even though I'm fairly certain the Patriot Act codifies such inter-agency communication), or someone is letting this happen, and they are making
       <em>
        boat-loads
       </em>
       of money.
      </p>
      <p>
       For any who are further interested in the implications or numbers behind this "heroin thing", I'd recommend reading these two:

       its a grey or black economy, off the tax books but economic activity even tho illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       could Washington have decided that an illegal economy is better than no economy.

      <p>
       then there the profit motive, lots and lots of LEOs and local crooks make millions from drug sales here in the US. not just by selling but through bribes and assistance.

       So glad someone else is thinking what I'm thinking. We already knew about ol Ollie North bringing cocaine, so it seems weird that just a decade after we get into long middle eastern conflicts, the heroin epidemic builds.

       What did you get for Christmas these last six years?
      </p>
      <p>
       The U.S. government was nice enough to gift our loyal friends the Afghans $17 billion of your tax money, and, in the true spirit of giving, asked nothing in return for itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       What that means in actual dollars and nonsense is that the U.S. government
       <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/six-years-17-billion-wasted-174400281.html">
        wasted $17 billion in taxpayer money
       </a>
       in Afghanistan on various projects that never made it off the ground or were doomed to fail because of incompetence or lack of maintenance, according to a new report.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/afghan#afg-article">
        ProPublica
       </a>
       looked at over 200 audits conducted by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) over the last six years and tallied up the costs for the wide range of failed efforts to reach the $17 billion price tag. This greatest hits study only scratched the surface of the estimated $110 billion spent to rebuild the country (the U.S. spent some $47 billion in rebuilding Iraq, and how’d that work out?)
      </p>
      <p>
       The new study touches on only the most egregious examples of waste, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         $8 million to end Afghanistan’s drug trade, which is flourishing today as never before;
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         $2 billion for roads that the Afghan government is unlikely to maintain due to lack of funds and security concerns;
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         $1 billion for unrealized criminal justice reform efforts;
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         $936 million for aircraft that can’t be maintained;
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         $486 million for cargo planes that can’t fly;
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         $470 million on the Afghan Police;
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         $43 million for a gas station that doesn’t work.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The timing of the report couldn’t be better. The chief of the watchdog office is slated to appear before a Senate Armed Services Committee subpanel shortly after lawmakers return from their extended holiday break.
      </p>
      <p>
       That January 20 hearing was originally set to scrutinize only the work of the Pentagon’s Task Force for Business and Stability Operations, which spent $700-$800 million (no one knows the exact amount) on economic redevelopment in Afghanistan, as well as $150 million on villas and private security for the group’s staffers. The agenda will now likely expand to a whole-of-government waste review.

       It wastes the taxpayers' money, but the war's sponsors make it all back on the heroin produced in the country. Currently about 90% of the world's supply comes from the country. It's everywhere and the source is protected by US troops.

       We turned tax dollars into heroin and opiate based medicine(still heroin) for the rich to profit from and feed the masses these highly addictive, dependency creating drug.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before the war, when the Taliban was in power, it was illegal to grow opiates. Now almost all our opium is grown there.
