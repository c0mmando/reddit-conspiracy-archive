       You guys might be interested in checking out this conversation I had a few days ago:
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/42mhrh/first_monkeys_with_autism_created_in_china_they/czbgrpk">
        https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/42mhrh/first_monkeys_with_autism_created_in_china_they/czbgrpk
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people in that thread "corrected" the conversation as much as they could, but my comment must have stung!
      </p>
      <p>
       It is important to note that "autism" is a very fuzzily-defined "disease," which has no blood test or anything required for diagnosis. This is similar to many psychiatric "illnesses." The most powerful lie is one that holds some truth. It is clear that some psychiatric "illnesses" exist, however, this has been exaggerated to an absurd degree to sell as many pills to the population as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do vaccines cause autism and what exactly is autism? I believe autism is simply a word to describe a lot of people who share similar symptoms. It is a behavioral categorization and we don't actually know if the cause of the behavioral difference is the same for all people, or if the difference/damage to the brain is similar for all of these people who were diagnosed.
      </p>
      <p>
       If something can cause some kind of inflammation/damage to the brain at an early age, then it can change the brain, which alters behavior, which can cause doctors to "diagnose" the person with "autism." Yes, vaccines can cause autism!

       That is what I expected. Nothing but baseless accusations to hopefully prevent most people from taking the information in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try to google how autism is diagnosed, or any psychiatric illness for that matter.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Diagnosing autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be difficult, since there is no medical test, like a blood test, to diagnose the disorders. Doctors look at the child's behavior and development to make a diagnosis. ASD can sometimes be detected at 18 months or younger.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       My brother went to 2 different doctors and they gave him a different diagnosis. One said autism and one said ADHD. How is this possible? Because there is no magic blood test for the diagnosis. It's just the best estimate from a doctor, and doctor's opinions can vary. You have a few sessions with them and depending on what you say, the doctor will "diagnose" you with what he thinks you have.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we got the diagnosis for autism, the doctor made it seem like it was like he came back positive for HIV or something. Then we got a second opinion, but didn't tell that doctor what the other doctor said and he claimed it was ADHD. I'd bet if we got a 3rd opinion, they'd say something else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we just think my brother is a bit quirky, that's all. He's very intelligent and doesn't need to be put on medication. He has
       <strong>
        no problem
       </strong>
       paying attention to interesting things. He loves to read books on biology. He gets bored when he is forced to memorize the birthdays of all presidents, and to be honest, if you aren't bored doing that, YOU have an illness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do some people have brain damage? Yes. Do some people have specific damage that causes specific behavior that a doctor would consider "probably autism?" Yes. Does every person diagnosed with a psychiatric illness actually have an "illness?" Of course not.

       That accusation is quite correct. You claim it is said to be a disease but that no blood test can identify it.
      </p>

       Because no one has ever said it is a disease so your rebuttal is a classic strawman.

       I would not expect a person like you, who has a wife in the field, to agree with me. That would require that you accept that your wife's work may be based on a percentage of lies. It's better to just believe in the fairytale that psychiatry is a hard science, when in reality, doctors do lie for profits and diagnosis is not as clear cut as the advertising claims.

       I didn't ever say that diagnosis was always spot on. It's not. It's that way with all medical fields though. I recently had a minor surgery to repair a sinus problem. Took three different doctors before I found one that actually found the real issue. Is that somehow proof that people should ignore medical doctors too?

       Notice I did not tell people to totally ignore psychiatrists. If you are very lucky, you might actually find one that isn't brainwashed or simply lying to put your children on pills. I am here to alert everyone to a major problem in psychiatry, not claiming psychiatry is 100 percent bogus and should be ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said earlier, the most powerful lie is one surrounded by truths.

       Did any doctor try to get to the root cause of your sinus issue before suggesting operation? 
I had sinus issues for years, did my own research and then went to a naturopath. Found out I was allergic to dairy. Allopathic doctors should only be used for emergencies like broken bones or heart attacks.

       You are playing word games. You are also incorrect.
       <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/in-practice/200807/dear-abby-is-autism-mental-illness">
        Some people actually do call autism "mental illness."
       </a>
       It seems that parents are avoiding shame by not considering autism an "illness." So call it a "disorder" if you like, I really don't care.
      </p>
      <p>
       From mayoclinic:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Mental illness refers to a wide range of mental health conditions —
        <strong>
         disorders
        </strong>
        that affect your mood, thinking and behavior. Examples of mental illness include depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders and addictive behaviors.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many people have mental health concerns from time to time. But a mental health concern becomes a mental illness when ongoing signs and symptoms cause frequent stress and affect your ability to function.
        <strong>
         [This is really fucking vague for obvious reasons]
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        A mental illness can make you miserable and can cause problems in your daily life, such as at school or work or in relationships. In most cases, symptoms can be managed with a combination of medications and talk therapy (psychotherapy).
       </p>

       I find this issue with my language choice hilarious and not worth any further discussion. This is distracting from my argument. Is that all you guys have? Logical fallacies and a minor definition issue?

       No, I'm not. It is not a mental illness or a disease. And it is wrong to categorise people with it that way.

       Your quote for mental illness does not describe autism.

       The logical fallacy here is to posit something that is not true and then find a flaw in your unreasoning to prove it wrong.

       What is autism?

        ASD stands for Autism Spectrum
        <strong>
         Disorder

        and can sometimes be referred to as Autistic Spectrum Disorder. In this text Autism and ASD mean the same. ASDs are
        <strong>
         any developmental disabilities that have been caused by a brain abnormality. A person with an ASD typically has difficulty with social and communication skills.

       <p>
        a disorder of structure or function in a human, animal, or plant, especially one that produces specific signs or symptoms or that affects a specific location and is not simply a direct result of physical injury.
"bacterial meningitis is a rare disease"

       People with "autism" are frequently given PILLS as a treatment. How is that not a treatment for disease?

       I tell this story to demonstrate that vaccines aren't harmless. Some may do more damage than good.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1992, my oldest son (J) had a bad reaction to a DPT vaccination; he was 2 at the time. He had had the vaccine before, no problems. This time, his arm swelled and turned red immediately in the doctor's office. The nurse  gave him some Benadryl, and sent us on our way.
      </p>
      <p>
       J was fussy the rest of that day and night. I was pregnant with twins at the time, and my husband took J downstairs to sleep with him on the couch, so I could get some sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
       At around 7am, my husband felt J moving around and realized that J was seizing, his lips were blue, and he had vomit on the front of his pjs.
      </p>
      <p>
       He ran upstairs with him, and I wake up to my husband screaming, "He's dead! He's dead! He's dead!" I look at J, and think he's choking to death - I grabbed his little cheeks, pried his mouth open, and did a finger sweep. Then I performed the Heimlich maneuver, and he was still not breathing. Husband grabbed him again, and ran downstairs. He laid J on the floor, and I began CPR, while husband called 911.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the time the EMTs got to our house, I had resuscitated J. Off we went to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with a febrile seizure, even though he never ran a fever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thereafter for about 10 years, J would seize every time he got sick - whether he ran a fever or not. His pediatrician and neurologist attributed J's seizures as a result of his bad reaction to the DPT, along with the time he was without oxygen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually, we learned that other children got very sick, and some may have died as a result of that batch of DPT vaccine. The CDC and NIH got involved, and took that entire lot of vaccine out of circulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       J's personality changed somewhat after the initial event. We have often wondered just how much brain damage was done during that time he was without oxygen.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TL;DR
       </strong>
       My 2 yr old son had really bad reaction to a DPT vaccine, and stopped breathing. I had to resuscitate him; he had seizures for years afterwards, every time he got sick. The vaccine lot was bad, and removed from circulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       PS - Parents, learn how to save your kid's life. I learned how to do the Heimlich and CPR a week before this happened to my son. If I hadn't had this training, he would have died.

       You have 1 discredited paper written by a man who was taking money from a law suit suing drug companies and didnt report this conflict and who used inappropriate techniques on the children studied and some of whom did not in fact have autism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vs every other paper that says there is no link.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vs the inability to understand that the reason why autism diagnosis have increased is because the criteria has been changed. With DSM IV a whole bunch of different disorders were grouped together as asbergers, autism, and pervasive developmental delay not otherwise specified. Along with other conditions that have not previously been categorised. And its happened again with the new DSM, the three have been rolled into just autism spectrum disorder. tl;dr When you widen the goal posts more are going to get through!
      </p>
      <p>
       Vs the rather strange accusations that paediatricians wilfully seek to harm children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vs the claim that its about money when in fact vaccines are not profitable for the drug companies. Things you use once aren't profitable, things you use again and again like pain killers and anti-depressants and heart medication are profitable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vs claims that autism can be cured with diet and chairopractics and crystals and so on.
