    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think Cruz cheated. He just threw everything he had into winning Iowa. Pushing the evangelical angle, and even lying saying Carson was dropping out to steal his votes. Despite all that he still only beat Trump by one delegate.  The real cheating was Rubio. There is no way this guy got a real surge of support. No one cares about Rubio except his Silicon Valley masters that want him elected so they can replace all their workers with H1B&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, Cruz didn&#39;t really cheat but this really reveals who he is as a candidate.  A lot of his supporters claim to be pro-liberty, he&#39;s the tea-party golden boy but look how willing he was to abuse voter records.  They may be publicly available but there is no denying that this was an abuse and a breach of voter&#39;s privacy.  All of this from Ted &quot;I love Liberty&quot; Cruz, fuck off.  The Rubio situation however, is pretty scary.  There were absolutely no indicators that he would surge in Iowa and certainly none that he would finish Iowa in the best shape of his campaign.  It&#39;s all about those H1B workers.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That &quot;disinformation campaign&quot; charge is bullshit. The real story is a misunderstanding of Carson going home but not calling it quits. My first thought was that Carson was quitting too. </p>

<p>But, wow! That Cruz campaign is kicking ass with that mailer! Good for them! Definitely pushed the boundaries... but in a good way... in my opinion.</p>

<p>That Hillary shenanigans is unforgivable. There&#39;s even video of fraudulent vote counting, but democrats really don&#39;t care. If they were informed, they wouldn&#39;t be democrats to begin with.</p>
