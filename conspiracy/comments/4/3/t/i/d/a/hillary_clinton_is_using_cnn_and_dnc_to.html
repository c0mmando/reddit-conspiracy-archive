       It's 11:46 PM PST and watching CNN when it hits me that CNN is straight propaganda for HRC and is pulling the wool over our eyes. Check out
       <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/CNN/status/694399540250681344">
        this tweet from CNN Politics
       </a>
       where it has just a gif of Bernie but the link takes you to an article where the FIRST thing you see is a video of Ted Cruz with his 1st place speech. This is to plant the image of seeing a male winning the Iowa Caucus in everyone's mind so it doesn't cause as much of a stir when they "report" the Breaking News that Bernie actually won Iowa.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people will return to Twitter after the Cruz video ends not knowing that the actual article is hidden off the screen requiring you to swipe down a little ways to even find it. The article highlights parts of Bernie's speech portraying it as a "moral" win and giving HRC the underdog role. This is to get everyone used to the idea that she lost Iowa and is playing from behind.
      </p>
      <p>
       For more CNN fuckery, go back to their
       <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/CNNPolitics/tweets">
        CNN Politics Twitter account.
       </a>
       Notice how they have NO tweets regarding the fact that the Democratic race is NOT over and has JUST ENOUGH delegates remaining to move Bernie into the winner's seat. The rage turd will finally hit the fan when you realize that CNN Politics RETWEETED
       <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/CNN/status/694399540250681344">
        this deceptive tweet.
       </a>
       The RETWEET served two purposes: 1) to spread this fuckery across Twitter not only once when it was posted, but TWICE when they retweeted it; and 2) it's a big middle finger to everyone not on the HRC hype train.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now it's 12:24 AM and CNN just broke some big news. They just announced that HRC is leading 49.9% to Bernie 49.5% with just ONE county left which just so happens to be one of the largest counties, Polk County, that could bump Bernie into the winner's seat. This is where the DNC comes into play.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNC is dragging out the results because they KNOW Bernie is the winner. They found a way to release the truth but to HRC's benefit so it doesn't give him even more momentum. They plan to say HRC won to get people thinking about her as a winner while simultaneously portraying her as an underdog. CNN is even pointing it out in jokes such as "it's a tight race for the Democrats just like how we planned it. Lol". I predict they will break the news that Bernie won Iowa during the middle of the night when their viewership is at its lowest.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR - DNC is purposely releasing caucus results in a fashion that shows HRC as the winner when Bernie is the actual winner in an attempt to slow down Bernie's historic campaign. CNN is doing it's part by using the media to spread it's fuckery and keywords/images to swing voters from MOM's supporters, Bernie's bandwagoners, and the undecided group. HRC is flexing her CNN and DNC dick muscles.

        NPR sent this tweet
       </a>
       based on misinformation the DNC just released to make everyone think HRC won because everyone knows that the initial declaration of the winner will always more grand than the second declaration of the winner via correction. This is because the first announcement is pure excitement and joy while the second reaction is ridden with mixed emotions. It also paints the first winner (who is now the runner up) as a victim rather than as a loser l, thus acquiring sympathy votes.
       <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EvegBo4TUdQ">
        Here is a great example of this phenomena.

       CNN is owned by Time Warner who just happens to be one of Clintons largest donors. They have a vested interest in her signing on to TPP.
