       The collective chance of this is 1.5625%. If the tied precincts had been equally divided, Sanders would have won by 1 delegate. Combine this with the apparent fraud in precinct 43, and you have one very suspicious Iowa caucus.

       Folks, the "determination" a coin toss produces is if the party calling "heads" or "tails" was correct. Under #Rule28, that'd mean a "loss."

       Also, Dem Party is terrified of Sanders because chances are he will not win as he strongly leans socialist - meaning Republican slam dunk. Its like the RNC being terrified of Trump cuz while they both have very strong loyal supporters, they're viewpoints turn the "independents" off. So I would not be surprised at all of DNC is rigging this shit to ensure a win for Dems - Hillary vs. Cruz is a slam dunk for Hillary.

       I'm always amazed at people who are just willing to make up anything and go around saying it to anyone who will listen. It gives you no qualms claiming Microsoft is actively stealing the election, even though you don't have even a little tiny grain of evidence? It's enough for you to just say "MICROSOFT BAD!" and accuse them of stuff you made up?

       Any sources for that? What's your best, most convincing evidence to back up your claim? I suspect you have very, very little, and I'll bet it's all focused on Democrats supposedly stealing elections.

       It goes back further with Bush stealing Florida. Or making sure blacks couldn't vote. Or dead people voting. So mainly Republicans, sorry for getting your righteous dick hard.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you're missing the point in your rush to be on a team. Both sides are fucking you and shitting all over your future. It doesn't matter who ever gets elected they will never deliver the promises they make. Presidents dont have true power, they're fenced circus animals performing a show.

       Yeah, I've seen that video many times. But thanks. If you watch it, you'll notice he says he was asked to create a program to steal an election. He doesn't say it was ever used in a real election. And while it is very easy to believe that programs like it have been used to steal elections, there is precious little actual evidence of it. The cases where we do have evidence almost all point to Republican voter fraud - like what has happened in Wisconsin in recent years, and the current case in Nebraska.
      </p>
      <p>
       But saying that all elections are an illusion and that it has "been proven" that "the last few elections" were stolen is simply unsupported by evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Proven" is one of those words that actually has a definition. But the claim that "there's been proven election fraud in last few elections," and "The system beyond rigged. The entire notion of electing a leader is just to give the plebs an illusion that their voice matters." is simply false. If there was truly proof of these claims, you would be able to show it to people.

        From another comment elsewhere that illustrates, with links, what I am speaking of:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Considering that Obama publicly downplayed the incident,
        <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/obama-learned-hillary-clinton-email-news-article-1.2141378">
         lied that he learned of her 'private server' from the news

         actually emailed her 18 times
        </a>
        and is withholding these emails from release...  I'd say it's a 'vast left wing' conspiracy that entails too many powerful players for a fair indictment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Do I believe it's a evil and nefarious conspiracy?  Not really...  I just believe the Clintons got greedy and wanted to create a scenario where they could accept huge sums of money from foreign governments and circumvent conflict of interest laws by conducting "State Business" on private servers...  Remember, they made millions, follow the money.

       I can't really think of any way of picking the winner in a situation like that that would be worse than blind luck. Hell, I'd even support a foot race between a representative picked from each side if the only alternative is a coin flip.

       Agreed. Seems more reasonable to allow the surrounding areas to break the tie. Such as, whoever has the majority in neighbouring areas, gets it. Or evenly split, or something. But you are right that just about any alternative is better than a coin toss. It would be laughable if it were not for the fact it really happened.

       Who is "they," exactly? The coin toss has been in the rules for many decades. The citizens of Iowa who came up with it are long dead. Are you suggesting that long dead citizens of Iowa are insulting you? Literally making fun of you?

       The reality is worse than you may imagine.  Nevada is also a caucus state.  My poor naive cousin, having moved there and of voting age, insisted that "voting is a privilege you can't ignore!"  "My dear cousin, it's not a VOTE, it's a CAUCUS."

       I trade futures contracts and the odds are only 1 in a trillion if you subscribe to the 'random walk down wallstreet' form of economics.  Traders use technical analysis as a basis for trades and as long as you are good at it - you can be very successful.

       As a Canadian trying to follow and understand the American political system, how is a coin toss part of your politics at all?!?! I don't understand why this is even part of your system? Like what is being decided that's going to a coin toss instead of a democratic, open vote? Vote tied? Re-vote?? Or is this to do with who gets to deliver a speech first or something?

       These coin tosses were at certain precincts where Hillary and Bernie tied. These coin tosses decided county delegates, not state delegates. Even if Bernie had won every coin toss he would have still lost by a slim margin.

       A precinct is often just a thousand or two people. How many of those are willing to spend their entire evening just to go to the caucus and vote? How many couples with small children are going to send both parents? A dozen or fewer people actually showing up for some precincts is not unusual. Dead-even ties are common.

       These are all good reasons to stop using this antiquated system in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is a shame, because as we get more reliant on technology to handle elections and recognize that electronic vote tampering is possible and has happened in the past, it seems like caucusing is a more trustworthy option. But unless they're going to hold it during the day, make it a state work holiday, and offer day care services in the lobby, people are going to want to leave early or skip it entirely.

       Actually, if Bernie won 3 of those 6 coin tosses he would have gotten the lead. Hillary winning 6 out of 6 coin tosses is very strange. That's a 1.6% probability that happened there.

       Most of us Americans are trying to figure this out as well. I think in the voting for President this November, they remove the chance ridden coin toss for something more reasonable. In the event of a tie in the Presidential election it goes to Rock, Paper, Scissors.

       It's more of a combination of state and federal, depending on what is being discussed. Voting laws exist at all levels, but the Federal government can choose to have the final say in most cases.

       No, the caucuses show the party who has more support, and then they

       use that info to nominate the candidate with the most popularity. Basically, it has no concrete meaning.

       Not at all. The each party is independent of the American people, and makes its own decisions. It's technically possible that a candidate who gets 0% of votes in a primary can get the nomination.

       Though it has happened "in Canadian politics", do note that the link you've shared was for a Parliamentary seat. 1 of hundreds. This was NOT selecting who would be at the helm of the Federal Leadership.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it does say right in the screen-cap for the video in that article "Other Provinces rely on a judicial recount or a by-election". As it should be. PEI is the smallest Province in our country, 140k citizens. That's all I've got :) Can't defend those guys any better. Shouldn't be using a coin toss.

       Well, the PM is decided by which party has the most seats in parliament.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, this was not selecting who the president is. These coin tosses were selecting individual county delegates. Not one out of hundreds, but 6 (in this case) out of 11,000.
      </p>
      <p>
       The net effect of those six coin tosses is nil on the number of delegates to the National Convention (which is what acutally matters). This is less like the PEI seat being decided by a coin toss and more like a single PEI resident deciding whom to vote for on a coin toss.

       Then you do not understand the concept of political theater. The whole point of political theater is that it is
       <em>
        scripted
       </em>
       which means the outcome has already been determined and the theatrics are all about ending at the predetermined outcome.

       Thanks. I don't really know it well but it's becoming more interesting to me. So based on your statement, I gather that was the intent. But how accurately does it actually carry out to the end result? I'd imagining there are still uncontrolled variables while make the outcome difficult to fully control.

       That's very bleak if true. I'd have thought that just by discussing, finding, and spreading the truth here and elsewhere that we still have some influence of the events and in extension the world. Otherwise, why do we even bother to have this sub and other places?

       Sorry, that's not how it works. You made the claim; the burden of proof is on you. Just like if I said your mom was secretly negotiating the surrender of France to the Martians. I don't get to toss that out there and then ask you for evidence to the contrary.

       Why are we doing coin tosses to decide who wins?  This is so screwed.  At least do something that makes a little more sense like most balanced demographic of voter, years of experience, age of candidate, money raised, time spent in Iowa, time spent in that precinct, ask them trivia questions about Iowa, candidate with best voting record, constitution quiz, percent of taxes paid that should have been paid, amount of income donated to charity....

       It's ridiculous but at the same time it doesn't really matter. What matters is how the delegates vote at the national convention. The photo finish outcome is what it is and the coin toss is unlikely to have any impact on how the delegates vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't a general election it's a party exercise governed by party rules and since it's not binding anyways the volunteers probably said "fuck it, flip a coin" rather than do additional recounts because they wanted to go home.

       Because most of those people were paid as staff in Hillary's campaign. Bribery. You really think Hillary Clinton won 6 out of 6 coin tosses?  Pah-lease. If that were actually true, we'd have seen the footage of the coin tosses all over CNN and Faux News.

       You literally just made that up. The coin toss goes back decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it your well considered opinion that hillary bribed Iowa residents decades ago all to lay the groundwork for last night? So she could have a 50/50 chance of winning a coin toss?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if the coin toss was a brand new thing started just this year (which it's not), and even if the coin toss was suggested by Hillary's team (which it wasn't), how exactly would Hillary have been assured of winning random coin tosses?

        Why are we doing coin tosses to decide who wins? This is so screwed. At least do something that makes a little more sense like most balanced demographic of voter, years of experience, age of candidate, money raised, time spent in Iowa, time spent in that precinct, ask them trivia questions about Iowa, candidate with best voting record, constitution quiz, percent of taxes paid that should have been paid, amount of income donated to charity....
I could even make a case that you pick the tallest person or even arm wrestle versus a coin toss. This isn't a football game, we are trying to select someone to run for President.

       None of these make sense. The idea of a coin toss is that it's random.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, it's not up to you; it's up to the people of Iowa. They decided they wanted to use a coin toss to settle ties, and so that's what they do. You don't have to like it, but you do have to respect their right to govern themselves without interference from outsiders and enemies.

       but bernie "captains" were the ones who called it in the air for several of the flips... how could they possibly "load" the coin to land one way or the other. It is scary how blinded you all are that you can construe something that is so obviously (fortuitous) chance, as an elaborate scheme to win.

       But you need to consider the prior distributions to get probabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       The prior is subjective, but I'm going to say there's a 1% chance that the Clinton campaign
       <em>
        rigged the coin tosses
       </em>
       . This means that the more likely explanation for 6 successful coin tosses is just chance.

       1.5% chances of happening makes it entirely believable that it was only luck. Especially since if it was rigged you'd think they'd at least have lost one so people wouldn't whine about it.

       You dont even need a double sided coin for this to work. Old magician's trick, flip a coin if its the desired side you want - hold it out in your hand.  If its not the desired side of the coin you want, (you see the coin briefly and you do this very quickly) swat the coin down on the back of your hand.  You can get the side you want 100% of the time --- or use a weighted coin

       1) We don't know how many coin flips occurred and how they broke down. Apparently the officially reported ones went more for Sanders than Clinton, but not all coin flips were reported (because they didn't need to be).
       <a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2016/02/02/iowa-caucus-coin-flip-count-unknown/79708740/">
        See the article from the Des Moines Register
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Each coin flip did not determine a full delegate. They were for county delegates, not the state delegates that the reported results are based on. Each flip moved a small fraction of a state delegate, not a whole one. So Bernie winning 2 more flips would not have given him the win.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Coin flips (or other random methods such as drawing straws) are used all the time to break ties. There was a tie for county commissioner in Cook County, MN last year that was determined randomly. It happens. It is more common in small elections. Caucuses are in essence thousands of small elections. You could also blame precinct lines. If precincts were changed just slightly you could change the outcome by a lot more than a coin flip. So don't get caught up on the randomness of the coin flip.

       If she won 6/6 of the coin tosses, wonder why my friend in the Quad Cities claims she witnessed a coin toss go in favor of Sanders at her precinct? This whole process seems fishy, but it's not the national election so I'm not gonna lose sleep over it but shit we really need to modernize some things relating to elections. Coin tosses? That's the best we can come up with lol

       On the Iowa Caucus Snapchat story, there's a video of a coin flip and I'm fairly sure they call it for Bernie.. So how is it possible she could have won all 6 when there's proof she didn't?

       Any statistician will tell you that a truly random distribution is exactly that; random. So six in a row for Hillary doesn't surprise me.

       Was it actually 6 coin tosses? I was under the impression that it was one tied precinct worth 6 delegates that was decided on a coin toss. I've no love for Hillary, just want to make sure we've got it straight. Expect an edit confirming/correcting soon.

       Technically the chance of winning 6/6 is the same as her losing all 6, or splitting fairly, or any other variation of wins and losses over 6 tosses.
      </p>
      <p>
       The outcomes of a 6 coin toss will always be 1/64 -&gt; 1.5625%. HHHHHH vs HHHTTT vs TTTTTT is the same likelihood.

      <p>
       But it makes for a nice statement, like

       Actually, while the chances of all heads or all tails is exactly the same, the chances of HHHTTT is
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       higher if the order of tosses doesn't matter (which it doesn't). There is only one way to get HHHHHH, but there are 20 (6 choose 3) ways to get 3 H and 3 T. So that's an overall chance of 20/64 = 31.25% to have them evenly split. And slightly lower chances of 24.4375% for each of the outcomes where you have 2 of 1 and 4 of the other.

       HHHHHHH is the same as HHHTTT if it is order you are looking at the probability of. So writing it as you have is misleading if you are interested in the probability of 6 heads vs 3 heads and 3 tails. Given that HTHTHT is just as valid for example.

       You'd be absolutely right if the winner was decided by betting on 3H and 3T of any order, over 6H in one go.  But the coin toss wasn't a single event with 6 coins where you had to guess all six disordered faces in one hit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The coin toss was 6 seperate events, where you had a 50/50 chance each time. Each single time rendered one winner with a 50% chance - Which leads to 1/64.

       Just that you got a bit mixed up with the premise of heads and tails appearing multiple times in a disordered coin toss - Whilst correct, doesn't apply to these kinds of coin tosses.

       1/64 for all six being H or T.  While there is a 1/64 for each possible outcome, there are way more chances for it to be 50/50 of each one than there are chances for all six to be one.  So, in fact, there is only a 1/32 chance of have each one be the same outcome, but a 31/32 chance of having an outcome that is NOT all heads or all tails.  That was the point.  While each outcome is 1/64, the outcome being all heads or all tails rather than even a single flip being different, is much greater.  There is a much greater chance of having a combination of 3 H and 3T than all H or all T.
      </p>
      <p>
       With six flips, there is a 20/64 chance of having 3 H and 3 T.  15/64 chance of 4 of one and 2 of the other.  6/64 chance of 1 outcome and 5 of the other outcome.  She literally just hit the lottery with the least likely outcome of 6 coin flips possible.

       If you need help working through this, here is a good site that explains it AND has a calculator to help figure out odds.

       If you think this is the same, you didn't read it.  You are wrong and its all proven above and on every theoretical probability site you can find.  We aren't comparing HHHHHH with one other individual result of HHHTTT as there are multiple other 50/50 outcome possibilities that increase the probability of 50/50 above 1/64th.  If you are going to ignore it, then fine.  Doesn't make you any less wrong.  The fact that you are the only one that doesn't see it is...amusing.

       You can still count the 6 separate events as consecutive. The probability still remains 1.563% for all heads / all tails and 31.25% for 3 heads 3 tails.

       It was all very clearly explained to you by multiple people.

      <p>
       This statement of yours is unjustifiable:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Technically the chance of winning 6/6 is the same as her losing all 6, or splitting fairly, or any other variation of wins and losses over 6 tosses.
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       If you honestly think that you are correct, you should go back and question every single one of the opinions you hold, because they're probably just wrong.

       Yeah, but you have 20 outcomes that give you 50% (3 heads 3 tails), 15 where you have 2 tails 4 heads, 15 where it's 4 tails 2 heads, 6 each for 1 head 5 tails / 1 tail 5 heads, and 1 each for all tails all heads.

       What do you think you just made a counterpoint to? No shit the odds of her losing all six would be the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       But she didn't lose all six, and they didn't split evenly, or any other particular outcome that has the same odds of happening.

       Her winning all six was statistically very unlikely. That's the whole point. I know you pride yourself on lazy contrarianism, but this was a particularly lame effort.
