       Lol...not antisemetic....but the the the Jews.  Ha-ha these people are really starting to make me laugh. I'm Jewish and I can tell you that all the real observant Jews ( not the fake secular oh my dad is Jewish Jews) missed out on this gravy train y'all keep complaining about. I went to retard public school like all the rest of you and even got brainwashed further by going to a public university. I only found clarity by searching for truth and purpose in life...not by blaming the heretical nonobservant jews that taught me incorrectly my whole life.
      </p>

       Take responsibility and if you have a problem with the system then deal with it. Stop bitching or blaming a group of very diverse people, most of which have nothing to do with the banks. If you don't like the situation, change it. Don't blame you problems on innocent people.

       the problem is that you're giving Jews a pass when they are basically fleecing the entire American nation everyone's life savings is becoming inflated because the Jews committed financial terrorism and convince the American public to bail them out or they would tank the economy that is a crime the Jews will have to pay for Thievery is unacceptable
      </p>
      <p>
       but go on and explain to us why we should give you the pass after they get oldest bailout money and yes the banks are owned by Jews that is not anti semetic it's a fact

       It is not a fact.  Also making a statement like that is jew hate. Every time that hear about a person dying of heart disease because they ate too much McDonolds, I don't blame Christians, even though Christians  own those crappy fast food chains (also taco bell and chikfila or w/e). My point is it has nothing to do with a persons religious identity.
      </p>
      <p>
       the other MAIN POINT is the banking cartels ARE NOT JEWS.  Lots of people think Rothschilds are jewish.  Surprise, they aren't look into the lineage.  Even the original rothschild wasn't a practicing jew, his family completely intermarried. A person is only jewish if there mother is.  They are not jewish.  Here are the banking cartels, and rockerfeller, morgan, rothschild, ARE NOT JEWSH:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Few Warburg might still be jewish, at least some, most are not anymore, though they aren't practicing jews and dont have jewish ideals.  Essentially One could just as easily blame christians or atheists or whatever these fucked up people are...it doesnt fix the situation though does it?
      </p>
      <p>
       If they were jewish, they wouldn't have systematically tried to wipe out their own people:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The mess me are in sucks.  But lets focus on the actual problem at hand, which isn't jews.  It's corrupt bankers and politicians protecting them.  Some are jews, some a christians...all are fake.  Don't be a hater, attack the problem, don't blame a group.

       problem is you are denying the fact of the matter these banks are owned by Jews that's a fact you can't get around it and there's no research that is going to show you otherwise when you look at who these owners are of these banks that got a majority of the bailout money its jews

       the problem is you are not listening to what I am saying. I'm saying these are people whether they are jews or native americans or pastafarians.  Start a petition to have them jailed.  Don't start the petition with, lets put these jews in jail...cuz that is hateful towards an ancient religion that is also a very diverse culture.  start it with lets put these corrupt bankers in jail.  jeez

       are you trying to say that the bailout was a good thing in my mind it was financial terrorism bail us out or we tank the economy

       and since when does the government get to decide who stays in business oh that's right when it happens to be Jewish bankers who gambled and lost and now we are bailing them out that is insane

       The situation that led to the bailout was bad. Whether or not it should have been done is debatable. Saying it had anything to do with the religion of the bankers is ridiculous. There are plenty of Christians, Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists who are greedy and selfish enough to cause financial disasters. The problem is with humans, not a particular religion.

        top 25 recipients of federal bailout money.
       </a>
       Together these account for 88% of the bailout money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of these are publicly-traded (or were at the time). Which of them count as "banks owned by jews"?

       Ok, I'm calling you on this one. Let's just take General Motors. More than
       <a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/gm/institutional-holdings">
        three-quarters of GM shares
       </a>
       are held by institutional investors. They're listed on the page linked above. Please show me how Jews have a controlling interest (51%) of shares in GM.
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise, I'll be forced to presume this is actually anti-Semitic garbage with no basis in fact. Should be very easy, because you claimed "I have done the research".

       the purpose of me not doing your research is so that you can't just claim my research is false if you have to do your own research well then it will be tougher for you to proclaim that your own sources are false like I said just look up who these owners are and the majority of the bailout money went to banks that are owned by Jews this is a fact it's not anti Semitic

       the problem is that you are not even allowed to say that they are Jews think about that for a second you can say the word banker but if you say something true like hey it's a Jewish banker you were labeled as an anti-semitic but what you are stating is a fact

       Yes,  the bailouts after the crisis were a great way to make a wealth transfer to the Zionist bankers. This proves again that there is a controlled demolition of the American economy and that eventually Israel will be coming the new ruling state in the world , this is their agenda.

       I'm not sure if you're anti-Semitic, but it's pretty clear you are mentally ill. Your obsession with the Jewish people is both sad and frightening. You have no facts, only your version of reality. There are probably some mental health subreddits you should check out.

       Nah he ain't mentally ill, he's just in the process of coming to terms with the sick society we live in, give him some time and he will just accept things are this way and we cannot change it on a subreddit.
And by the way, he's right and there is a lot of material that cover his statement so no, by no means a "version of reality".

       No. He's mentally ill and probably a racist who has decided to blame his own insecurities and failures on a historically disliked minority group. In fact a lot of you guys seem like you've probably got a long history of all kinds of failures in life and you take it out on others.

       Meh dude, i'm pretty sure that a lot of people here have some kind of mental struggle that led them to see there was a rabbit hole. Happy people rarely cross the topic or get interested.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, his statement is well known to be true and wether he's mentally ill or not is not knowable from his post and, mainly, doesn't mean shit in this context. 
When a guy say something you don't like and your only response is "he's mentally ill" "he had a bad life" etc, you come off pretty pathetic and in denial in your own special way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your thoughts are your thoughts only and you can think what you want, just don't expect the whole world to comply while you go on a emotional rant about some piece of facts this sub regulars know well to be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       This surely is a low-effort low-value post ( OP i mean ), with a simple thought. OP Status doesn't concern me, only the information ( i actually open this kind of topics just to check the comments ). If you are here to judge people and not thoughts ( or even better, facts like this one ), i have little doubt who needs to check himself the most.
      </p>
      <p>
       And lastly, i remember you happy, healthy people don't spend their time on r/conspiracy to blow rants on what they themselves define as "mentally ill, full of failures - people".
      </p>
      <p>
       So... yeah. In your effort to disprove OP you basically confirmed the last part of his sentence ( the only one debatable, as first thing presented is fact ).
      </p>
      <p>
       And i don't see what's racist about pointing out politically relevant facts.

       He didn't point out any facts. The entities are for the most part publicly traded companies. He can try and spin it how he wants. It's as much a "fact" that Jews have been used as scape goats for centuries. So yeah, he's exhibiting signs of paranoia, delusions and general blame shifting that is about as original, unique or based in reality as the belief in Santa Claus. But by all means go right ahead and keep proving my point.
