<ul>
<li>Reposts often have the exact same title as when they were previously posted, character for character</li>
<li>Accounts that submit reposts frequently never comment</li>
<li>Few accounts repost only a few times. Virtually all either don&#39;t repost or repost constantly.</li>
<li>Reposts are proven-popular content, if reposts aren&#39;t downvoted just for being reposts then it&#39;s the obvious solution to making the front page contain more popular content</li>
<li>Reposts aren&#39;t downvoted just for being reposts. People often don&#39;t even notice. Even when the comments section calls the post out, it&#39;s still massively upvoted. Given a sufficient delay, reddit tolerates reposts.</li>
<li>Reposts are explicitly allowed. Community feedback has never been sought on the matter, despite reposts in the past having a reputation much worse even than they do today.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>With all the censorship and vote rigging going, since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron&#39;s</a> demise, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chairmanpao">Chairman Pao</a> incident and the merger with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Publications">Advanced Publications</a>, you might as well watch Fox News or CNN. They have turned Reddit into just another corporate owned mass media outlet, including targeted censoring and a Political Correctness agenda. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>They openly and systematically remove news stories unfavorable to the Corporate Elite and the US Government from r/Politics, r/News, r/Worldnews, r/politics and r/Economy. These pages has been reduced to a mere shadow of their former self, scrubbed clean of any content that could challenge the current USA hegemony and their henchmen. </p></li>
<li><p>They openly and systematically remove news stories unfavorable to the Intelligence Community, the War on Terror, the Official 9-11 Story, the Corporate Elite and all the Corrupt Politicians from r/conspiracy. It speaks volume to their desperation, they spend all their might trying to keep their carefully constructed illusion of reality together, while new holes appear and old ones reappearing every 10 minutes.  </p></li>
<li><p>They have turned r/Ama, r/Technology and r/Science into shoddy and irrelevant advertising platforms, censoring anything that could stir controversy or intrigues in the above 90 IQ segment. Now they are just attempting to sell you celebrity hype and business friendly stories. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Reddit has become just another shoddy Corporate Owned Mass Media platform, full of deception and lies, with noting to offer but lowbrow entertainment and fear mongering. </p>

<p>There also seems to be a handful (or two) of users that seem to have almost every one one of their posts with 1000+ points and are always cycling their content through the first 5 pages of /all and even my own front page.....their content even shows up on my front page and I&#39;m not even subscribed to the sub they&#39;re posting to. Some users for example are /iBleeedorange, noerdy, slimjones123, chazdoge, gallowboob (of course), yannireddit123, Lobo2ffs, 1voice1life, loopdeloops, among a few others. I also noticed that there are a lot of recent accounts with &quot;123&quot; at the end of their user names, maybe there&#39;s something there, too, I don tknow.</p>

<p>Their posts are always usually shit, stupid shit that can easily take a high position with points, over-saturating anything else that may have substance for something REAL or important. I report a lot of these user&#39;s posts as spam because that&#39;s...kind of exactly what they&#39;re doing, spamming posts all over the place and (like I said earlier) they are leaking into my front page without me subscribing to the sub they&#39;re posted in. My account was recently suspended because I was &quot;abusing the report function.&quot; I tried to appeal it and didn&#39;t hear a thing back from anyone, so fuck it, I guess.</p>

<p>It&#39;s gotten to the point where I&#39;m almost convinced that they are being paid to post this stupid, useless, over-posted and reposted content to keep the regular frequenter distracted.....or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reposts will happen, and third party account sellers will capitalize on the karma farming. Reddit certainly allows this, but the company certainly isn&#39;t in control of every facet of this site. </p>

<p>I&#39;d be more worried about the bot tech mimicking posts, or the markov chain ai development going on in subreddit simulation.my own theory is that they are trying to generate a believable democratic experience with bots acting as controlled opposition in a sense. Just a theory, but if they contain the users in a pseudo free environment and limit users to see other users posts, they could create a fake reality to prevent people from organizing in an organic fashion. I&#39;ve seen this firsthand with facebook when certain topics and links get filtered, and it&#39;s of my opinion that the internet is being brought towards a point where they can contain us into groups. </p>

<p>It&#39;s what i would do if i wanted to prevent dissent. And i&#39;m certain i&#39;m not the only fucker to think of comparmentalizing and dividing internet users into small cliques to prevent movements from occuring naturally.</p>

<p>Edit: a turing passablr ai system is on the way, probably 1-4 years off. It only has to be convincing enough and for it to be a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; for it to work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re giving the state of AI too much credit. Markov chains are more of a hack than anything, there&#39;s no way to polish them into something that doesn&#39;t sound like nonsense. And true general-purpose AI, the kind that is necessary to create a bot that is genuinely indistinguishable from a human, remains a holy grail that nobody even knows how to start working on. Any time estimate you hear is complete speculation based on the logic &quot;well we&#39;re discovering lots of things in AI, I bet we&#39;ll find this too!&quot;. You don&#39;t hear time estimates on general AI from the people actually in the field.</p>

<p>Then again, what is improving steadily is specialized AIs and techniques to hack your way to a mostly-solution. eg Google, which isn&#39;t sentient, but sure as hell seems to know what you&#39;re talking about (usually). And this field is something that would receive attention from the top AI companies. So, I&#39;ll call your post <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>-worthy.</p>
