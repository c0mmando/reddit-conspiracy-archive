<p>Derogatory, generalizing opinion that is totally meaningless as it applies to a small cross section of the user base.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I made one of those lists myself about <a href="/r/GMOMyths">/r/GMOMyths</a> to point out their blatant propaganda/brigading, but I never called for readers to stalk or brigade them in return, I didn&#39;t up-vote my own thread, it didn&#39;t get a lot of votes, I didn&#39;t cross post, but I did refer to various parts of the list often when dealing with those liars to point out past behavior they might try to deny. Which is quite different than what TMOR is doing by making a list that helps inform their users where to direct their propaganda and harassment. You can share lists of users, it just depends how you do it and why, and also how the mods of said sub are feeling that day. Sometimes it&#39;s better NOT to delete those lists because the user may return with twice as many plans as he had before, this time probably some black hat ones. It&#39;s not really a big deal unless it gets a lot of exposure anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/r/TopMindsOfReddit">/r/TopMindsOfReddit</a> is the major hasbara brigade attacking <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. <a href="/r/isrconspiracyracist">/r/isrconspiracyracist</a> never really took off, as it&#39;s just too obviously biased, but <a href="/u/duckvimes_">/u/duckvimes_</a> is a mod on both.</p>

<p>Then, check out <a href="/u/LovelyLeah">/u/LovelyLeah</a>, another Israeli hasbara account that is also a mod at <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a>.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no real hiding it, they are pretty open about it. It&#39;s a semi-professional hasbara campaign to brigade reddit and to attack critics of Israel.</p>

<p>Culturally, they are similar to the <a href="/r/ShitRedditSays">/r/ShitRedditSays</a> &quot;progressive&quot; brigaders, except they also attack any &quot;left wing&quot; criticism of Israel.</p>

<p>In their case, you literally have people sitting in front of computers in Tel Aviv copy and pasting talking points and trolling people. That, and of course, <a href="/r/isrconspiracyracist">/r/isrconspiracyracist</a> has a bunch of bots to downvote people.</p>

<p>I hear they get paid about $15 an hour, it&#39;s essentially a student job.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just read the comments on <a href="/r/TopMindsOfReddit">/r/TopMindsOfReddit</a> about my post. </p>

<p>Once you notice the pattern, it&#39;s all very obvious. Suggest they get paid, and the &quot;joke&quot; is &quot;what, we get paid?&quot; </p>

<p>I suggested $15 an hour, which is what I was paid as a student to do similar things. So, their &quot;joke&quot; is &quot;what, he wishes he was getting paid that much!&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s called &quot;agree and amplify&quot; - suggest someone is hasbara, and they say &quot;yeah I&#39;m totally getting paid by Secret Jew Gold!&quot;</p>

<p>The reality is, of course, much more simple, and much more sad. The online hasbara campaign was disclosed over a decade ago and it was never really &quot;hidden.&quot;</p>

<p>At the end of the day, you have a bunch of very sad and very paranoid people who were brought up in a cult where they were constantly told everyone hated them due to &quot;jealousy.&quot;</p>

<p>This makes them extremely paranoid and a lot of the bluster is over-compensation for that.</p>

<p>I suggest watching the Israeli film &quot;Defamation&quot; which shows how these poor kids are brainwashed from childhood. You take normal kids and indoctrinate them until they become over-sensitive, paranoid neurotics constantly lashing out at &quot;the world.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s sad more than anything.</p>

<p>Sure, someone like <a href="/u/duckvimes_">/u/duckvimes_</a> is more calculated than paranoid, but it all comes from the same place.</p>

<p>Once you understand the pattern and their motivation, you will likely develop some sympathy. Get told all your life that you are the &quot;master race&quot; then realize that so many other groups are naturally more beautiful and have achieved more success honestly. It leads to hostility and envy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>explain how all this shit came to be then. you think all of a sudden a surge of ppl from this sub downvoted me and everyone else that responded to that guy, even initially he was so downvoted and we were all upvoted? and on top of that they did so without downvoting the post? subreddits have a different upvote/downvote registration system than comments. also, look at the guy&#39;s profile. he didnt post anything about on another sub. either he used an alt to post on another sub to back him up, or he downvote brigaded me himself. based on the language he used, and the reasons he brought up, and the facts that he ignored, it&#39;s pretty obvious he had an agenda.<br/>
there&#39;s evidence that israel does this for not only sites like reddit, but also youtube, wikipedia, twitter, facebook, and news sites with comments sections. you can look that up yourself to find proof.<br/>
this is solid proof that this shit goes on and why it goes on, and by who.<br/>
israeli mission has always been to deceive and lie, otherwise their existence is literally a contradiction to every single country on the planet. when saddam became expansionist, the whole world hated him, and he got fucked by the US. now look at netanyahu and the standing ovation he got in front of the senate.<br/>
another fact that&#39;ll make you question reality of the situation: the US did nothing over the USS liberty incident.<br/>
that&#39;s not even all of it. look at israel&#39;s history and it&#39;s literally black with filth. </p>
