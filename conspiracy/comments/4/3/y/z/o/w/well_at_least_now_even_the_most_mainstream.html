    <div class="md"><p>You are confused. Discrediting evidence is not the same as having the burden of proof placed on the accused. </p>

<p>In your scenario, whether it is planted or not, there is evidence of child pornography. At that point the accused can defend himself by casting doubt onto whatever evidence is held against him. This is discrediting evidence. </p>

<p>However, in my scenario, I am just accusing someone of child molestation with 0 evidence, and asking for my theory to instead be disproven by the accused. This is placing the burden of proof on the accused. </p>

<p>When it comes to voting, these people are making unsubstantiated claims with 0 evidence, and then asking for their claim to be disproven. What I&#39;m saying is provide some evidence first and then ask people to try and discredit that evidence.</p>

<p>Yeah, that&#39;s not how it works. I&#39;m not the one making the assertion; the burden of proof is not on me. The burden of proof is on the person saying &quot;it&#39;s all rigged,&quot; &quot;Hillary and Cruz were preselected,&quot; and &quot;votes don&#39;t count.&quot;</p>

<p>Those are claims that require evidence. And what you have told me is that you don&#39;t have evidence and can&#39;t prove what you believe. Which brings me to my next question:  why do you believe stuff you can&#39;t prove? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As an Iowan who actually voted in the caucus, you have no idea what the demographics and the type of advertising and events happen here.  Imagine every day being filled with nonstop political ads everywhere you look from every imaginable candidate.  There are small towns, 99 counties.  Ted Cruz literally visited every single county, that&#39;s how he won.  People got to meet him in person on a mass scale and that solidified their votes.  Sanders was really only popular in the college areas like Ames, Iowa city, cedar falls, etc Hillary had the bumpkin woman vote.  I voted for Rand.  </p>

He came to ours in Ankeny, but was there literally at the last possible moment before the vote. We were already way behind schedule as well because of the huge numbers of people that showed up.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure he swayed some voters with his speech. That dude was fucking pumped and is an excellent orator when he&#39;s in front of a crowd of people.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s speaker on the other hand literally talked about herself the entire time. Said maybe two sentences in the three minutes she had the mic about Trump. It was a complete shitshow and everyone knew it. There was a lot of anti-Trump sentiment in the crowd as well. People know he&#39;s a blowhard and while he&#39;s done a good job of getting some issues to the forefront, there is a solid chunk of Republicans that do not want him as President either. Probably even moreso since he made those statements about working with Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, etc.</p>

Except where in some instances people were tweeting that carson was going to drop and that people should caucus for cruz in order for their votes to matter, and that there are reports in some precints of people walking up to the microphone and saying the same thing. Rubio is where i think rigged votes came from. Rubio received millions from microsoft, and now that microsoft is counting the votes he mysteriously gets twice the percent he was polling around (11% to 23%ish) and everyone just thinks thats peachy keen?</p>

<p>Another, also from 5 years ago:</p>

<p>It&#39;s been on going for a couple of decades now, and unless the fat slobs wake up and use their guns while they still can to put a stop to it, we&#39;ll see the same story happen during the next elections.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said this in another sub but I&#39;ll also paste it here because it is relevant:</p>

<p>We have a system that is rigged at every step of the game. If you aren&#39;t from one of the 2 major parties you aren&#39;t allowed in the debates so nobody will ever hear about your ideas and you will stand no chance. If you don&#39;t have a ton of money you don&#39;t stand a chance so the only way you can spread your message to raise money is thru media exposure... if you don&#39;t get positive coverage or don&#39;t get large donations from Super PACs and corporations you are screwed. If you are a rare politician that actually gets a real grass roots movement behind you where millions of individuals are willing to give their hard-earned money to support you, chances are those people will also show up to caucus for you/vote for you in the primaries... well, how can we slow you down now? We gotta make sure that the establishment candidate &quot;wins&quot; the primaries. If, somehow, a non-establishment candidate manages to win the primaries they have to get thru the national convention and get the official nomination of their party (who could very well say that it would be a detriment to the party to nominate this individual because they are unelectable and they can refuse to elect them). Then, if somehow the candidate makes it past that hurdle they have to compete with the electoral college voting system so even if a majority of Americans want this person to be President, it doesn&#39;t matter if they don&#39;t win the &quot;right&quot; states. So basically it is damn near impossible for a guy like a Ron Paul or Dennis Kucinich or Ralph Nader or Bernie Sanders to win a presidential election. If people think elections aren&#39;t a false choice then I dunno what they&#39;ve been paying attention to. Hope and Change Obama had the same top donor as Mitt Romney. Goldman Sachs wasn&#39;t hedging their bets for no reason... they were securing a win no matter which candidate took office. </p>

<p>Nope. Rubio/Hillary, Cruz is not really liked by the establishment either. Rubio is there next choice since Bush is just horrible. Even though he came in third, Rubio still did good getting only 2 fewer delegates and scoring a lot higher than his polls predicted. With all of the candidates in the race its impossible for anyone to get the absolute majority, so all Rubio has to do is keep getting in 2nd or 3rd because all of the delegates for Bush/Christie/Kasich/Cruz/Paul and maybe Carson will vote for him at the convention when they eventually drop out, stopping Trump</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rubio would be great for them but Cruz already fell in line and people still look at him like he&#39;s an outsider so they can do their &quot;I&#39;m mad at the establishment&quot; vote for Cruz.  It really is as easy as checking the candidate&#39;s donor list.  Is Goldman Sachs a top 5 contributor to you?  If yes, you aren&#39;t representing actual people.  Goldman Sachs is like #4 for Cruz.  Compare that with a guy like Bernie who only gets money from individuals and workers unions.  Who is actually trying to represent the people?  But when I say this to people they act like I&#39;m telling them that aliens landed.   </p>
