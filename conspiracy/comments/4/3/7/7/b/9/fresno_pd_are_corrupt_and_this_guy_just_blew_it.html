<p>Detailed go over, including all the twitter tracking and videos that have since been taken down for an odd reason

<ol>
<li><p>Lang had been watched by a van that was a poor cover job. The van was parked a couple blocks away for weekS and he had home surveillance catch it a few times.</p></li>
<li><p>Try and find that business on Google, Yelp, Yellowpages, etc. It didnt exist until VERY recently. On Yelp it has 3 reviews all from 1/25/2016-1/28/2016 from shady accounts that have only reviewed things one time. CHECK THOSE ACCOUNT PROFILES AND START UNRAVELING THAT THREAD </p></li>
<li><p>The address 1907 E Acacia Ave Fresno-93726 that&#39;s listed for the business&#39;s address on Yelp, if you look up on Google Maps is just a home on a street. Yes, many businesses operate out of the home, but this one was particularly odd....</p></li>
<li><p>I may have dropped this but then....The phone number... You call it and the message clicks (as in transferring between lines or recording) then doesnt disclose the mailbox owner or have a voicemail set up. Then it simply, hangs up. Now tell me... If you ran a business.... Would this be how you set up your phone to get/keep clients?</p></li>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, there are good cops out there, but it&#39;s the other 9 out of 10 that are giving them bad names.</p>

<p>We need citizens to be in charge of police internal affairs.  Or some sort of civilian or militia group to police the police.  And be able to recommend charges and disciplinary actions.   Enough is enough.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s time to figure something out, and their body and dash cams isn&#39;t going to cut it when they can turn them off or the footage turns up &quot;missing&quot;. </p>

<p>When they don&#39;t have that, this is exactly what you get.  </p>

<p>There attitude is, what are you going to do? </p>

<p>Call the police on us? </p>

<p>And what are they going to do about it?  </p>

<p>Nothing. But maybe arrest you or worse.  It&#39;s like a twisted reakl life version of that South Park episode.  &quot;He&#39;s coming right for us!&quot;</p>

<p>So they are used to fucking people over with no fear at all of getting in trouble for it.  It&#39;s probably a fucking game for them and they sit back an laugh about how bad they fuck us.  </p>

<p>Have competitions on who can do the worst.  It&#39;s sick but probably a lot of their mindsets.</p>

<p>That is the situation.  I don&#39;t like it.  We the people need to change it.  Or lay down and like it.  </p>

<p>We have been doing that for way to long and it&#39;s time to at least start charging for it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is because you know who investigates cops?  The internal affairs of the same police department.   The cops.</p>

<p>If you have never issued a formal complaint against police officers, try it some time, see how receptive internal affairs is to you. </p>

<p>And if you do, don&#39;t have any warrants, any brake lights out on your car, and don&#39;t J-walk across a parking lot.  </p>

<p>Because believe me, when you do complain, if you didn&#39;t have their attention before, you have it now.</p>

<p>&quot;If you ever want to get fucked, the police will supply the PRICK every time.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The whole good cop/bad cop question can be disposed of much more decisively. We need not enumerate what proportion of cops appears to be good or listen to someone&#39;s anecdote about his Uncle Charlie, an allegedly good cop. We need only consider the following: (1) a cop&#39;s job is to enforce the laws, all of them; (2) many of the laws are manifestly unjust, and some are even cruel and wicked; (3) therefore every cop has agreed to act as an enforcer for laws that are manifestly unjust or even cruel and wicked. There are no good cops.&quot; - Dr Robert Higgs</p>

<p>The unions won&#39;t go for this rightfully so. Cause for one average Joe doesn&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be a cop. Hell you likely have no idea of the job and pitfalls. </p>

<p>Maybe you do and if so I am sorry for the assumption. Empathy is something no one has for officers. Everyone just wants to blame the officer cause its easier. </p>

<p>I agree there are bad cops (never met one) but its stupid to say there isn&#39;t. This guy got a ticket and lost his mind. Says he had his plate scanned and was pulled over and from that lost his marriage. </p>

<p>Something isn&#39;t adding up. He blames everyone but himself for his actions. Obviously he broke some law right? Well you don&#39;t pay for you tag, or got parking tickets then pay them. Guess what police won&#39;t fuck with you then.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.odmp.org/officer/903-deputy-sheriff-john-bananola">This is what happens to good cops.</a></p>

<p>The other cops serving the warrant were bad cops.  Bananola was going to blow the whistle on their corruption, so they set him up, didn&#39;t knock, made sure he went in first.  If the suspect didn&#39;t get him, they would have in the crossfire.  </p>

<p>So not only did he lose his life, but the <a href="http://www.justice4brian.com/">person who they served the warrant on</a> got totally fucked and is sitting for life in prison over what should have been weed charges. Weed that is now legal in Washington state.</p>

<p>The fact you don&#39;t see bad cops or hear about them is the same reason the reasons you don&#39;t hear about all the organized crime that goes on.  They don&#39;t talk about it.  The ones that do or they think will are dead.  </p>

<p>You are naive to think otherwise.</p>

<p>Unfair. You can realize this and come to terms that chances are you won&#39;t win in life so you make the best with what you got. That&#39;s how I made it. </p>

<p>Shit in here now looks like a news sub with current articles and 9/11 shit. Seriously what if anything is gonna change?</p>

<p>Everyone wants to focus on the here and now but that isn&#39;t what the Establishment is doing. They are focusing on our children because within a few decades we will be gone and then they can control our children cause the groundwork is already done thru schools</p>

<p>There are programs in schools for K thru 3 called obey right away. It&#39;s where police come in and get kids to chant this mantra. My son is asking me why Obama is so great. He is 6 years old and they are pushing political ideas on him. </p>

<p>It&#39;s integrated into the lessons. They recite this shit and are not tought reasoning skills just memorization. </p>

<p>I gave up caring for everyone else. I educate my own son cause its a full time job. </p>

OK, the mini van across the street with the expensive camera is definitely strange.  Everything else?  Complete non-events.  I&#39;m not saying the guy was crazy.  I&#39;m not saying he wasn&#39;t murdered.  I think he was.  But those videos are proof of nothing.  The carpet cleaning van?  I&#39;m not seeing anything unusual.  Very disappointed.
