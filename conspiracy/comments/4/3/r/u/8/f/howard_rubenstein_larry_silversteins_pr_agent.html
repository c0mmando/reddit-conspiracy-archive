<p>Howard Rubinstein apparently told the whole story on the Charlie Rose show. The history commons article cites this now-defunct link: <a href="http://www.charlierose.com/shows/2004/07/15/2/a-conversation-about-public-relations-with-howard-rubinstein">http://www.charlierose.com/shows/2004/07/15/2/a-conversation-about-public-relations-with-howard-rubinstein</a></p>

<p>Searching for &quot;Howard Rubenstein&quot; on Charlie Rose&#39;s website will yield no results:  <a href="http://www.charlierose.com/search">http://www.charlierose.com/search</a></p>

<p>I wonder if Rubenstein himself requested the video to be removed. Wouldn&#39;t want those pesky conspiracy theorists using his story like they show videos of the many times Larry Silverstein has retold the dermatologist story. A smart move for a PR agent.</p>

<p>Can anybody find the original video?</p>

<p>EDIT: Someone on <a href="http://killtown.911review.org/oddities/2001.html">this site</a> posted a transcript.</p>

<p>HOWARD RUBENSTEIN: That&#39;s right. But the story angle there hooks -- develops something else that I&#39;m involved with. I represent Larry Silverstein, who owns the lease -- long term lease hold for the World Trade Center. And I have an interesting story about that. I&#39;ve represented him for 35 years.</p>

<p>CHARLIE ROSE: I have an interesting story about that too. But go ahead.</p>

<p>HOWARD RUBENSTEIN: I represent him for 35 years. The Monday before the Tuesday, I get a call from John O&#39;Neill, former head of terrorism for the FBI, who went to work for Larry. He said, why don&#39;t you come down on 9/11, come to a breakfast meeting at 8:00, where we&#39;ll talk about what we&#39;re doing to prevent terror attacks. So I said, OK. And he said, bring your staff, two people. I said that&#39;s fine, because we were then representing the World Trade Center. Then I thought about it on Monday, and I called him, I said, I have a staff meeting on Tuesday, do you mind if I don&#39;t go? He said, no, send somebody. I said, but that somebody is also at my staff meeting. He said come at 9:00 instead of 8:00. So I&#39;m sitting in my staff meeting, and my secretary runs in and said the World Trade Center just got hit, and you were supposed to be there. Everyone at that breakfast meeting died, including John O&#39;Neill.&quot; - Charlie Rose (07/15/04)</p>

<p>Also, there was a meeting called of all the Able Danger investigators at the... Pentagon... scheduled for..... 9am. The guy who called the meeting didn&#39;t show but phoned in his part. The AD investigators all died.</p>

<p>Fishy.</p>
