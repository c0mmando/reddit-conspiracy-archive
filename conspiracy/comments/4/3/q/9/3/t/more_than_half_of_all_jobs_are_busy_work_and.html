It starts in school where kids are taught to do busy work all day, every day. Kids are subjected to meaningless tasks through their whole childhood. School is for babysitting to make sure kids don&#39;t get into anything too curious or thought provoking.</p>

<p>Then it continues into adulthood where people must resort to degrading work just so they can put a roof over their head and food in their stomach.
What choice do they have but to take that desk job where you stare at a computer monitor all day and shuffle papers around? </p>

<p>As long as people don&#39;t stop to think about their life and question their purpose. Keep busy. gotta keep busy.
Good job everyone. We are really going places.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It starts at an early age, and has for a long time. </p>

<p>6 basic functions of school 
1) The adjustive or adaptive function. 
Schools are to establish fixed habits of reaction to authority. This, of course, precludes critical judgment completely. It also pretty much destroys the idea that useful or interesting material should be taught, because you can&#39;t test for reflexive obedience until you know whether you can make kids learn, and do, foolish and boring things.</p>

<p>2) The integrating function. 
This might well be called &quot;the conformity function,&quot; because its intention is to make children as alike as possible. People who conform are predictable, and this is of great use to those who wish to harness and manipulate a large labor force.</p>

<p>3) The diagnostic and directive function. 
School is meant to determine each student&#39;s proper social role. This is done by logging evidence mathematically and anecdotally on cumulative records. As in &quot;your permanent record.&quot; Yes, you do have one.</p>

<p>4) The differentiating function. 
Once their social role has been &quot;diagnosed,&quot; children are to be sorted by role and trained only so far as their destination in the social machine merits - and not one step further. So much for making kids their personal best.</p>

<p>5) The selective function. 
This refers not to human choice at all but to Darwin&#39;s theory of natural selection as applied to what he called &quot;the favored races.&quot; In short, the idea is to help things along by consciously attempting to improve the breeding stock. Schools are meant to tag the unfit - with poor grades, remedial placement, and other punishments - clearly enough that their peers will accept them as inferior and effectively bar them from the reproductive sweepstakes. That&#39;s what all those little humiliations from first grade onward were intended to do: wash the dirt down the drain.</p>

<p>6) The propaedeutic function. 
The societal system implied by these rules will require an elite group of caretakers. To that end, a small fraction of the kids will quietly be taught how to manage this continuing project, how to watch over and control a population deliberately dumbed down and declawed in order that government might proceed unchallenged and corporations might never want for obedient labor.</p>

<p>This is based off Alexander Inglis&#39;s 1918 book, Principles of Secondary Education printed as a Harvard Professor. I pulled a summary from here and John Taylor Gatto:
<a href="Http://theinnovativeeducator.blogspot.com/2013/02/6-principals-of-secondary-education.html?m=1">Http://theinnovativeeducator.blogspot.com/2013/02/6-principals-of-secondary-education.html?m=1</a></p>

<p>Indoctrination is just one facet of the matrix that binds us to the State corpus. Our neoliberal economic &quot;development&quot;, the rigged monetary system, it&#39;s all linked together.</p>

<p>Who must resort to degrading work? What makes work degrading?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What choice do they have but to take that desk job where you stare at a computer monitor all day and shuffle papers around?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alternatively, in my job in which I stare at a computer monitor much of the day but rarely shuffle paper around because, you know, computer...</p>

<p>I get to help my clients find ways to better serve their customers. Some of that includes the ability to predict the best course of treatment to help people recover from injuries as swiftly and as permanently as possible.</p>

<p>But even if it weren&#39;t for that last bit, I <em>still</em> get to help people have a better day at work. I don&#39;t think of that as degrading. It&#39;s pretty cool, actually.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As long as people don&#39;t stop to think about their life and question their purpose.</p>

<p>I think about my life all the time. I stopped questioning my purpose after I discovered what it was: Whatever the fuck I want it to be. Or, if you want to get all Buddhist up in here, happiness.</p>

<p>More irrational bullshit.</p>

<p>I sell my time. Slaves are purchased like cattle and dogs.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve done that quite often. It&#39;s called &quot;Paid Time Off&quot;. The company I am interviewing at tomorrow has a very liberal policy - they don&#39;t count those unplanned days off. Of course, they trust you to be a responsible adult and not abuse it. Seems rational because if I go there, they and I would be entering into an agreement whereby I deliver value to them in return for some of their money.</p>

<p>That&#39;s, like, the opposite of slavery.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>More idiocy.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t do what the boss tells me if it were illegal. Fortunately, I have a boss with scruples.</p>

<p>If the boss told me to do something irrational, I would question him. The difference between my situation and slavery is that A) I would actually do that and B) It would result in a discussion rather than 20 lashes with a whip.</p>

<p>If the boss tells me to do too much stuff that I find distasteful, I go find another job. Unlike the slave who... takes it, I guess? Or tries to run away, taking the chance of getting caught and losing half a foot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t immediately discount what your hear just because it doesn&#39;t match your current beliefs.  Yelling &quot;irrational bullshit!&quot; and &quot;idiocy!&quot;, isn&#39;t conducive to opening your mind to new perspectives. Take time to think about things deeply.</p>

<p>Either you are in control of your life completely, or you are not. If someone is telling you what to do and you obey them then you are in servitude. 
That is the definition of a job or career.</p>

<p>Do you have the liberty to determine your course of action everyday and every moment of your life?
If work a job then you have to answer no. You obey others. They have dominion over you.
You can delude yourself all you want. It doesn&#39;t change the truth. </p>

<p>There are components to servitude beyond the physical, which you seem to only focus on. The physical aspect is the least important.</p>

<p>When they control your mind and spirit then you have truly lost.
They can harm and abuse your physical form, but they can never take your mental and spiritual essence, unless YOU surrender it willingly. Be careful out there.</p>
