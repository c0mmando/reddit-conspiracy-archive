       Just had to rant about TYT, who claims to be most watched watched media online. I find it ridiculous that they claim to be alternative media when in fact they are as mainstream as it gets. They always try to break the story down and let Cenk tell you exactly what you need to think. There are no real debates or discussions, only telling you what u need to think. Don't even get me started about John Iadarola, and his lame commentary...

       Extreme propaganda/dis-info being labeled as "Independent news".
      </p>
      <p>
       They vilify anyone with a narrative that's not sanctioned by the goverment. I personally think they are either "civilian shills" or have there agenda guided by a unknown benefactor.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are also super racist.

       Not really, many minority are very happy with the results of the Democratic party. The only people that don't like what the TYT's are saying are in fact Republican. Don't matter if they don't claim it, they are literally saying it by saying they don't agree with the ideas of the Liberals.

       Controlled opposition from the left. They know what they are and I presume they've made their peace with it. I like them better than the right wing version, they seem to have their hearts in the right place, but they're not going to change the world by a long shot.

       I would disagree. They are garbage imo. I especially dont like them because they claim to be "alternative" and so people think they are "in the know" by watching them, but in reality they are so mainstream. Plus John Iadarola is such a turd with no reasonable input lol

       I would only be able to tell you who Cenk and Anna are. Don't know the others by name.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think people consider them alternative for legitimate reasons. They swear and speak a language normal people do. They show a left wing bias. This is completely alien and alternative for mainstream media who are central or right leaning.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not perfect but its nice to get another perspective other than the dross we're exposed to on TV and papers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would also challenge you to back up your claim that TYT is as or more mainstream than the legitimately recognised mainstream.

       Fine. Well for starters you will never see them go into anything legitimate about the federal reserve and how its at the root cause of our problems. They never talk about all the moeny printing and how that is manufacturing economies. Dont ever hear them go hard after the cia and its massive corruption. They never talk about Soros and his crazy funding of progressive groups (probably theirs if I had to guess). Though this particular Oregon standoff was mostly like hijacked with intelligence implants, tyt failed to put into context the importance of standing up to the federal gov't as it constantly oversteps. They are always race baiting, they never go deeper into mass shootings, they never talk hard about israel, they never talk about any of these elites, they never touch vaccines, and honestly i could go on and on. They are no better. Yeah they give u a cookie here and there but in reality, they are limted hangout and any real free thinker can see they are nothing special and just as much a part of the establishment as any other outlet. Controlled opposition

       You want real change yet dont give a shit about the federal reserve... sounds like you have no idea how change is going to actually come. You want to keep feeding from the tit of rich oligarchs or you want to break the camels back and take control of your communities? You will always be a slave to the bank while the federal reserve, federal gov't, and cia run amok.

       Well if u ever want real equality and justice then you would care about the federal reserve. They enslave minorities through their money machines that are the central banks more then any other thing. So bitch at my so called white privilege all you want, but the fact of the matter is that you will never see justice for all races until you cut the noose of central banking from the system

       The whole system revolves around money and the policy of money and where capital goes all revolves around the federal reserve. Something you might want to pay attention to. But thats the least of the worries with TYT

       That's because money is the idea, but people like the TYT and other liberal projects help push outside the norm. Showing that the current monetary system is old fashioned and useless. Most of the people here want to fix this system, while liberals push to abolish it completely and start a new one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's see, do I want to help preserve a system that has treated the Majority of minorities piss poor to the point that even if they had "paper" in their monetary system it still wasn't "good" enough?
      </p>

       Fuck that. New System, New Rules. I know many minorities who feel the same way.

       Some people here want to fix but I would argue many dont want to fix it and instead want to create a new one. I for one, want to build a new system, so i dont see you logic in not abolishing the fed? It is a massive hurdle towards creating a new system so why not scrap it?

       That's what I am saying, you are worried about something that is already in the process of happening. Meanwhile, people are worried about things like being treated like humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       TYT help push that narrative, so why attack it? They may not have a huge presence, but their small alternative presence only exist to say the things that minorities say to themselves all the time.

       So many things wrong with that statement it's mind boggling let alone blatantly bigoted. It's also a little weird you find yourself to be the spokesperson for all men of color and generalize they all think the same thing you do.

Republican.
