The establishment does not like him because he will hurt many corrupt big businesses.  He will hurt big pharmaceutical when he decriminalizes cannabis.  He will hurt big defense contractors when he cuts the military spending.  He will hurt congressmen when he enacts term limits.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sanders did support Paul&#39;s Audit the Fed bill and vote against fast tracking the TPP so there is some common ground. </p>

<p>I believe both are the only two candidates from the major parties who care about the country and identify the same major issues. </p>

<p>The difference lies in the solution which Sanders believes is to use government for the benefit of the people and Rand believes a limited government will allow people better opportunity to create their own prosperity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sort of. Bernie&#39;s campaign wants to use a fraction of big banker&#39;s money to get free education, but it&#39;s dirty money so if he was really opposed to it he would just want to make it illegal, but I don&#39;t know which is more beneficial. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are some publications that are trying very hard to convince people that Trump is the threat to the establishment. That&#39;s all BullShit. The proof is simple. If Trump was the real threat, he would be ignored by the MSM. They would carry on as if he doesn&#39;t exist because they are actually AFRAID of him.</p>

<p>The MSM is telling us who the actual threat is in the way they behave toward Rand Paul. They are behaving as if he doesn&#39;t exist, the anti-Paul bots have infested social media with slandering attacks against him. </p>

<p>Rand Paul is the man whose policy is the most AMERICAN of them all. Sanders seems ok. But he&#39;s pro Israel and that means more war in the Middle East. </p>

<p>Rand Paul is anti-War...a man of peace is not welcomed by the corporate war machine and the global banking institutions.</p>

<p>We know who the real threat to corruption is because the MSM will not utter his name.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to admit the brilliance of the establishment on this one. Put forward a big mouthed actor Billionaire but hide the fact he is part of the elites by pretending to be afraid of him. They have pumped up a billionaire so much that anti-establishment types are voting for him. That is damn impressive. Their skills to manipulate never cease to amaze me.</p>
