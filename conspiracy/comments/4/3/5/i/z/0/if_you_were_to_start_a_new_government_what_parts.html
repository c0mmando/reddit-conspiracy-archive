<p>i would only keep the military branch and communication/intelligence. reform them. then same thing for other part like transport, agriculture, health. </p>

<p>would seize all the money and gold in the country and divide it equally to the population. issued in gold and silver coins. </p>

<p>everyone would have new rights like rights to have a roof, food, water. farmer would be given free fertile lands. </p>

<p>oil and electricity would be nationalized for none profit. same as bank</p>

<p>would have programs to exchange oil cars for electric or other source of more-clean energy. </p>

<p>would force corporations to have the same not for profit business plan. everyone would have equal salary except for jobs people dont want to get would be paid more. </p>

<p>people would slowly understand what working is and get an income. </p>

<p>would ban gmo foods and pesticides insecticides.  all organic society. </p>

<p>voting would be done only to vote new laws in effect. no polititians needed. would use open source blockchain tech system for society to vote everyday if needed around the country. 
to become responsible of governement seat. candidates would have to do tests in order to select the best people in the different fields to cover. would no longer be a advertisement and popularity contest. </p>

<p>the country would slowly become very rich and research and developpment could finaly return the way it always should have been. to fix fucking problems and not for profit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But would we still get Bertrand and Lewis with such a regulation in place? There is still some beauty in the imagination of any individual, even if they are inundated with delusions. Banning religious expression might destroy art in ways we can&#39;t imagine.</p>

<p>It would be better to have no state sanctioned religion, even making it impossible, then allow religious practice to exist entirely outside of the state. Now, when someone starts &quot;Killing in the name of...&quot; people still have to go to the courts, but at least we would be less oppressive than de facto religious bans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you want the constitution and all the amendments? Or just some of the amendments? </p>

<p>I think having small-scale money is a good idea too. Currency monopolies are how institutions like the Federal Reserve take control of governments, by becoming the sole issuer of money and thus of debt and thus control everything indebted to it. I am unsure if gold and silver are necessary, but anything that is backed by something that grows at a controlled rate (like gold or bitcoin) instead of controlled by the fed&#39;s whims, would be a good thing. I can&#39;t help but post this quote because I agree with you so much: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered...I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies... The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Basically, but I&#39;d have to go through all of them and say what I&#39;d take out. for example:</p>

<p>Remove this:</p>

<p>16th amendment - Permits Congress to levy an income tax without apportioning it among the states or basing it on the United States Census.</p>

<p>Alter this: </p>

<p>13th amendment - Abolishes slavery, and involuntary servitude, <del>except as punishment for a crime</del></p>

<p>Also, for the currency, each state would have it&#39;s owned backed by gold and silver, but convertible to  allow state-to-state transactions. I like the idea of bitcoin, but if anything happens to the grid/internet, bitcoin is basically worthless.</p>

<p>I could go more into detail, but that would be a long ass post, and I don&#39;t have the time to do that right now, lol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree completely, especially with that 13th amendment change. That&#39;s critical because the prison system is basically like slavery, and over 1% of Americans are in it at this very moment. There is like an incentive to imprison as many people as possible to use as cheap labor. </p>

<p>So laws aside, are there any functional bodies or organizations that you would keep? Like would you have the FBI or police at all, or just local watches sort of thing? I think I&#39;d probably go with the local watches. I think the more local things are, the more changeable they are to meet the needs of people in various communities, and they less it concentrates power to attract power-hungry psychopaths. Sounds like a win-win to me. </p>

<p>Would you make any attempt at regulating industry? I think I would, but I would be super careful to create barriers that prevent regulatory capture, like making the revolving door between industry and regulation illegal, like it is in most other countries. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d really have to think about what Federal bodies that I would keep. But, as you&#39;ve said, I&#39;d tried to keep as much as possible at the state/local level. Smaller federal government, the better. Off the top of my head, I wouldn&#39;t have on a federal level, the EPA, BLM, Education system (just three examples). For policing, Sheriffs are a very good example of this. They are elected by the community.</p>

<p>For regulatory. I&#39;d abolish lobbyist and probably set a clause where a politician has a waiting period in order to go into an industry that may conflict with their position while in office, and vice versa. Kind of like a non-compete (usually a min of 2 years, in the private sector). I think this would get rid of a lot of the revolving door.  I also think something like Glass–Steagall should be implemented on banks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed on all points. Except I feel uneasy about the wait period on the revolving door, I think it should just be fully illegal, but maybe that hinders more then helps. It&#39;s tricky, but we agree obviously industry and regulation need more separation then they have. </p>

<p>What else... Do you also think state governments should also be less powerful than they currently are? I do, as long as it&#39;s done evenly with reducing power of federal government. </p>

<p>What do you think about the idea of an unconditional basic income? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I mean you could make it illegal, but crooks always find a way around it. </p>

<p>For states, I think some powers should be reigned back, and put into municipal authority. So yeah, I agree with reigning in the state along with the federal. Like we&#39;ve said, the more local, the better. </p>

<p>For basic income, idk, that&#39;s a tough one. I&#39;d have to really think about it. What I can say is, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Permanent_Fund">I think what Alaska does with giving money back to it&#39;s residents based on their oil exports, is the direction I&#39;d go</a>. So, things like that I&#39;m for. Giving money back, based on the states natural resources. Because, they belong to the people who reside there, so they should benefit financially from them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That makes sense. I think if there could be some sort of locally-funded unconditional basic income, that&#39;d be great. But perhaps that may be one of the few things that is worth doing on a federal level, but the downside is the large pool of money that would create would be a hotbed of corruption. It&#39;s a tough one for sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, anything that large/separated/centralized would definitely create the very same problems with corruption we have now. Think about this way. A state gives paybacks from their resources. You can freely move to any state, so each state is competing for people to reside. It&#39;s a win-win for everyone. </p>

<p>You claimed that 3d printers would not be able to load the schematics, a software problem that has already been defeated. You pointed to the technology in scanners that would be circumvented, which was actually useful.</p>

<p>call for censorship</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s a world of difference between censorship and self-censorship, also known as self-control. That you can’t comprehend the topic at hand is evidence that you wouldn’t understand this, however. What right do you have, save to ask questions, in participating in an argument about a topic you have exhibited you don’t comprehend? Particularly as <em>though</em> you do? I’m as much for knowledge being gained as I am for knowing you don’t know things.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which are proven facts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If they were, you would’ve provided evidence for them. 3D printers cannot transmute elements (chemical), nor can they assemble disparate elements (not chemical), nor will such technology be affordable to the individual for decades, if ever. Thus, tariffs will be returning, the globalist “free trade” scam will come crashing down, and this will benefit everyone in every country, despite your delusions.</p>

<p>A claim that you brought up for no reason, whatsoever. It was not required for either of my statements, but it&#39;s a strawman you bring up to reinforce the illusion that you are having a discussion.</p>

<p>The tariffs won&#39;t self assemble their own requisite documentation.</p>

<p>See, it&#39;s just like that. Nonsense that doesn&#39;t contribute to the discussion.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The software protection has been identified and removed in various versions of firmware for current 3d printers. Printers that haven&#39;t been built may still be susceptible to the method for removing that particular portion of the software.</p>

<p>When did I state anything about <strong>printing money</strong>? You are the one that keeps bringing that up, another of your strawmen to stop discussion. I only stated that the software for identifying money when scanned can be bypassed. Scanning != printing, but you already knew that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tough question. I would have an agency for collecting taxes from the public (definitely needed), but it would be very small and nothing like the current IRS. I would not have income tax or many of the other taxes. I believe the original idea was taxation on import, exports, tariffs, etc etc. I don&#39;t believe people should have work/income taxed, but taxed on goods they buy and sell. Just my thought, but I&#39;d have smarter people than I am helping with these things. I&#39;m by no means an expert and this would definitely need collaboration. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>hahahah all good -  i won&#39;t hold your feet to the fire on anything you say ;)  just curious...</p>

<p>... and yes, sounds good.  except, do you think that (taxes on imports) would generate enough revenue?  w/o a (very) well financed military, it&#39;s fairly reasonable to assume that another country would invade, right?  </p>

<p>edit/ps.  i am not (at all) a fan of the &quot;military establishment&quot; --just being realistic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I mean if you aren&#39;t off pissing people off, why would they invade? I like the mentality of the founders, friendly/trade with all, ally with none. Much like Switzerland&#39;s policy. A strong army is important, but a bloated army is a burden. Better off not making enemies.</p>

<p>Why does America invade other countries?  Generally not because they are pissing-off America....</p>

<p>... though I suppose it depends on how you define &quot;not pissing off&quot;:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If by not pissing-off you mean &quot;Gleefully allowing another country to simply walk in, overthrow you and take your oil.&quot; (for starters) -- then yea, that&#39;s a tough sell.</p></li>
<li><p>If by not pissing-off you mean, not invading other countries just to overthrow their leaders and take their oil. (for starters) wow... all I can say is that you would have my vote, but... yea... probably a tougher sell than you might think.</p></li>
</ol>

    <div class="md"><p>I just thought that maybe I should include the water system as well, that generally works fairly well, except for this whole fiasco in Flint. The thing is, it should be extremely easy to get people to fix that or be fired, and now there are so many layers of bureaucracy that it&#39;s impossible for anyone with power to actually be held accountable in any real way, so the problem just lingers and gets worse. That&#39;s why a small simple transparent government would be better, so the people could control it more easily. </p>
