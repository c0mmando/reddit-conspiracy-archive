       The sub these days is nothing but politics, but it wasn't always this way.  There were all sorts of valuable discussions ranging from ancient religions to, well, you name it.  What are some topics you find interesting which do not get enough love in this sub?
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps we can get some good discussions going or help each other find "appropriate" subs for such discourse.

       I've been looking at loot at 2 &amp;3 lately, and I think you can make a strong case that physics has been in a sort of lockdown since about 1950.   As someone trained in the subject (not bragging, just saying that i'm not entirely amateur in this area), I'm not surprised that anyone who self identifies as a physicst/scientist is likely to be incredulous at first, but there's  lots to make one wonder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point of fact:  no piece of technology currently in the open market relies on anything more fundamental than what was known in ~1945.  there are devices which use local advances in knowledge, but none which require a different/deeper understanding of E&amp;M.  No quark/gluon based technology in all this time.  You only need that 1950s understanding even now to understand a nuclear device
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems not entirely coincidental that the colliders/beamlines built were useful for the development of beam weapons at one point.  It seems they learned as much as they wanted though, thus the canceling of the SSC.    That CERN is still going suggests either that groups in the EU are still hoping to refine beam control tech, or are making an honest effort to chase the standard model further into fruitlessness.

       I guess i'm still slightly sceptical of a "clean breakaway" model in that I don't think they've really broken away entirely, significant people still live among us even if there are space fleets.....  I guess it depends how deeply integrated the financial elite are in this...  Hard to put anything past em...

       I agree with Putinlovescats.  I would add to that psychotronics conspiracies...well not so much a conspiracy as provable fact that electronic weapons do exist and persist.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that russia had been using a hetereodyne regenerating scalar weapon to induce a 10hz signal out of interference from our electrical grid ('russian woodpecker' shortwave spectrum signal), ie : a psychotronic weapon prior to the meltdown at chernobyl...and that this has not been discussed by the mainstream media, that we haven't been told the real reason behind Chernobyl or Haarp; and the fact that it's been allegedly restarted (another duga radar tower has been active in the last few yrs)... is evidence that states are not at war with each other any more...they are engaged in coopetition to wage war against the global citizen, partly to control society / population, partly as a mass scale human experiment to see what would happen; and partly to justify outrageous tax spending on defense to build more 'human experiments' that make money and wreck people's connection to truths and freedoms.

       Hey! I'm with you on that one. Want to know what I think? Relativity is wrong, and it's holding everyone back.  It was a neat trick to answer the apparent null result of the Michelson-Morley experiment, but what people need to look at is the old Lorentz's Ether Theory - which is mathematically equivalent to Relativity but has further physical implications that can be investigated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now whether that's true or not, it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       weird that physicists aren't trying to break out of this "lockdown".  Maybe the established paradigm is too strong.

       I don't disagree.   I'm not sure if the paradigm is strong, but everyone trained in the field is innoculated against such ideas in a serious way.  Like, it's taken years for me to open up to some of the ideas they dismiss outright without consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you note is a good example:   Modern physics has no dispute regarding the electromagnetic field.  If you ask any physics person if E and B fields pervade all of space they will typically respond very quickly that they do.   If you ask them to distinguish between an "Electromagnetic field pervading all of space" and the "ether", they'll probably tell you that the ether was disproven without realizing that it's basically the same idea.     DAmmit!
      </p>
      <p>
       My personal fight has been less against relativity (though I think you're right to doubt its 'perfection') and more about the standard model.  I think relativity can be modified to include a more dynamic mass term, but you have to know how to explain mass first.   That's locked down in the SM, as quarks do not explain the origins of mass and charge, but kick the can further down the road.

       I know. It bothers me that people talk about EM fields like they're actually "things". Looking back at the idea's conception, I feel like they were meant to be conceptual, mathematical models to describe what was going on. (Ether, anyone?) But when ether was "disproved", EM fields stuck around like disembodied heads. And now they exist as hallowed ghosts. Just trust us, they're there.

       Of course there is a "thing" that we can describe as an EM field. I'm trying to say that this description has become an explanation in itself. If you ask what exactly is an EM field, people say it's there because the "laws of physics" say it should be there. This stops any further investigation or questioning.

       Have you read Joseph P Farrell's

       He has a knack for physics and talks A LOT about ether, etc. I think it was him who said that Lockheed Skunkworks director Ben Rich was referring to the Lorentz equations when he said: “We now have the technology to take ET home. No, it won’t take someone’s lifetime to do it. There is an error in the equations. We know what it is. We now have the capability to travel to the stars. First, you have to understand that we will not get to the stars using chemical propulsion. Second, we have to devise a new propulsion technology. What we have to do is find out where Einstein went wrong."  Or you know what, maybe it was the general relativity equations. Anyway, you'd probably like Farrell's stuff. He also brings this theory of physics to talk about the pyramids as a death star type weapon...

       Thanks for the book lead :) I'll check it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly think Einstein was the biggest charlatan ever. If you really look at his fundamental logic for both Special Relativity and the photoelectric effect, they're both subtle but glorified tautologies.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for a problem with General Relatively, I have a sneaking suspicion that it's because Einstein made time equivalent with the spatial dimensions. This results in 4-dimensional mathematics - which
       <em>
        in form
       </em>
       is correct. However, in my hopelessly unqualified opinion, what I think is happening is that space is actually of 4 spatial dimensions, and time is something independent of that. The "real" equations should look very similar, but the implications are very different.

       to note -- this is just around the exact time flat earther's think the dome sky was discovered -- and then project fish bowl, cold war excuse to try to blast the sky -  and nasa - and the  effort to fully convince everybody idea of outer space is what we were told and nothing else.

       Wow, I didn't know there was a timeline for a "dome sky" discovery. I never put much credence in the flat earth theory, but blasting the sky with a nuke is too intriguing an idea to dismiss outright. I need to read into this more.

       You think they exploited all that in 3 years?  Sounds unrealistic to me, I think they're still trying at some level.
      </p>
      <p>
       The connection seems to be that the UFO concerns, creation of the deep state, and diversion of scientific inquiry seem to happen over the same window of 1947-1953.

       I don't think that's a required jump, though I don't rule out terrestrial UFOs as a phenomenon.  I think the ET hypothesis fills in a lot of historical and genetic weirdness unexplained to this point.  (Look over the DNA and characteristics of the platapus and tell me that wasn't a hilarious genetic experiment dropped off to 'the zoo'.  Half joke, half serious)
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think i've yet seen any evidence that say, T.T. Brown's work or something similar, was fruitfully exploited until post 1947.    The Nazis were trying, and may even have gotten farther than the US on that front prior to surrender, but I think there's a lot of disinfo out there on the nazi front.  Maybe an artifact of the history channel's obsessions?

       To me it seems that physics derailed itself in the earlier half of last century and it has just been slightly guided to prevent it from correcting.  Interesting comment on SSC/CERN.

       I think Copenhagen was generally a bad idea.  I don't think science should accept paradoxes as answers.  I think Bohr's atom wasn't helpful &amp; after we discovered the electron, we tried to explain too much with it.  Somehow the advances in the first half of last century seem to have been etched in stone, when I think we could really benefit from some new perspectives into the nature of E/M &amp; light.  I also hated taking chemistry, so if someone could come up with a new model that made more intuitive sense, I'd be all for that.

       Been there before actually, but haven't been sure what to do with it.    Most of those folks, and this is not meant as dismissive as it may sound, seem to be caught up in the sheer beauty of mathematics.  I don't think they're wrong.  I think math likely contains the closest things you'll find to plato's forms and likely hold the universe up at a fundamental level.   Maybe with smarter math we could really break through to deeper understandings (Look up Charles Muses work if you want to trip face on mathematics)
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think that vortex math solves many problems unfortunately, mostly because nobody ever uses it to solve any problems.  that vortices and toroids are intrinsically important to how the universe operates and that they have utility in certain contexts (like antenna arrays and whatnot) I don't question.  I just don't think that their insights are very useful.....

       Great post, thank you very much for that. While I kinda knew all that, the way you presented the information gave me a few rabbit holes to go down tonight.

       <li>
        <p>
         Nixon made a deal with OPEC to force all purchase of oil in only USD and -since then- every effort to trade oil for other currencies or even to have currencies not under control of the FED/World-Bank/IMF/International-Bank-of-Settlements has been met first with sanctions and then assassination and excuses for war.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The NSA blackmails everyone at every level of government on behalf of (a) the big banks and (b) the Israelli government.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The CIA and others use their thuggery (since that's what they know best) to create money by keeping drugs illegal to support foreign wars to keep the world "safe" for US corporate exploitation.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         We rent the money supply from the Rothschild and Rockefeller families, et. al. at interest.

       1 in more details:
      </h1>
      <p>
       Kissinger was the one who did the job.   Bretton woods stoped working in 1971 and the USD was basically in a no man's land until 1973 when they came up with the PETRODOLLAR monetary system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically king faisal of KSA threatened an oil boycott due to the Israeli war and it worked, barrel went from $3 to $12 and the USD was at rock bottom.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then Kissinger flew to Riyadh and told Faisal that this 300% increase was peanuts and that he could earn much more, if , he sold his oil for only USD and conviced other OPEC members to do the same . Faisal accepted and the petrodollar monetary system was born.
      </p>
      <p>
       The implication being that since everyone needs oil ( and large amount of it ) therefore everyone needs to have large stocks of USD and since everyone uses USD in the world the FED can print and print and print ( without ending like Zimbabwe)  .
      </p>
      <p>
       Now for the esoteric part :
      </p>
      <p>
       In a famous hadith concerning the end Times the prophet Muhamad said that " the river Euphrates would uncover a mountain of gold " .
      </p>
      <p>
       This " mountain of gold " is a symbol for the biggest reserve in oil which are located there ( Iraq, Kuwait,  north east of KSA , south west Iran)  .
      </p>
      <p>
       And in the same hadith it is said that " people would fight over that gold and that 99 out of every one hundred  will die ".  Convential warfare doesn't kill 99/100 therefore this has to be nuclear war .

       This video opened my eyes to a whole set of issues that I had never heard about or considered in a serious way. I'm still not sure what to make of it. Some of it is extremely compelling. It's also interesting to think how it relates to occult rituals, sacrifices/abuse and making contact with demonic beings. But there's also a lot of science here. I posted it a couple days ago:

       I watched 46 before 45, but either would be fine. I'm also just over half way through their book
       <em>
        Dangerous Imagination, Silent Assimilation
       </em>
       . The first half was all about social engineering and organizations such as The Frankfurt School and the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations, along with history on the Prussian education system and way more. It looks like the second half gets deep into geo-engineering, Morgellon's, and Black Goo.

       Seriously awesome stuff and a lot of the material is esoteric in nature and overlaps a bunch with Mark Passio's material on
       <a href="http://www.whatonearthishappening.com">
        whatonearthishappening.com
       </a>
       ...because it's real esoteric information.

       Things like the media being conglomeratized and the AP being like a huge portion of the news, just being copied verbatim.

       Planned obsolescence is definitely true. I'm studying product design and we're even taught that planned obsolescence is a good thing -- you get to sell more of your products that way, and ensures a constant income. Not sure how to feel about that tbh

       That user always had very interesting, well researched, and fun conspiracy posts, their post history and subreddit are totally fitting for this post.  Another favorite topic they covered was research into man-made "airships" dating back to the 1900s, some truly crazy, awesome accounts, which also ties into breakaway civilizations.

       One of the most fascinating theories I've heard in a long time is the "electric universe theory."
      </p>
      <p>
       It provides some fascinating context for some other conspiracies like:
      </p>
      <p>
       Saturn worship
  Goddess worship
  Unity of ancient symbols
  Heliocentrism vs. Geocentrism
  Tesla and free energy
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a link to a good starting point on the theory.

       There's a lot of support for this idea, I'd only add that it's actually an electro-magnetic universe - donno why those guys leave that off, really.

       I know Immanuel Velikovsky was one of the first to really touch on this stuff... Are there any big names currently carrying a torch for this theory and/or any interesting books on it I should be checking out?

       Yes, I've gone through that link - the author doesn't understand anything about radiation, and does lots of handwaving and very little actual research to back up any of his claims. 5 minutes of research and I was able to debunk his claims regarding the Van Allen belts, and a quick look to a few other sources debunked his claims regarding the moon rover. If that's your "evidence" that the moon landings didn't happen, I'm not impressed.

       Ah yes, the typical 'move along, nothing to see here' dismissal. The only upsetting thing about it is that it is likely to convince 99.9% of the people who might happen to read this little exchange. And that's exactly what they'll do: move along and without bothering to take a moment to look for themselves -- which is a good thing because if they did they would realize it was faked. I mean, it's obvious. If you stop to take a look.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's ironic that you (wrongly) accuse
       <em>
        him
       </em>
       of hand waving, when your entire post is just one big hand wave. Pray tell, what exactly doesn't he understand about radiation? What exactly did you find "in 5 minutes" that debunks his claims about the Van Allen belts and dangerous radiation?  What sources did you find that debunked his claims about the moon rover? And which of his claims about the rover did they debunk -- all of them or only some of them? Please share with the rest of us so we may be enlightened.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then of course you imply that those are the only two pieces of evidence that he offers, when in fact he offers
       <em>
        tons
       </em>
       of evidence, much of it from NASA scientists themselves. What is your evidence, besides hand waving about two things you 'easily' found in a few minutes? And what about the mountain of evidence that you completely ignore?

       is a very detailed analysis of the radiation the astronauts would have actually been exposed to - nothing near fatal, or even out of the ordinary for someone who works on a nuclear reactor.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as far as the rover,
       <a href="http://www.popsci.com/blog-network/vintage-space/lunar-rover-designing-and-unpacking-car-moon">
        here
       </a>
       is more information about that, including links to official NASA documentation on how it was fit into the lunar lander.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's only "obvious" that it was faked to those who can think of nothing else. Every time you try to create "proof" that it was faked, it's usually debunked in short order.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: And the majority of his evidence is him saying the equivalent of "Nothing that looks like this lander could
       <em>
        ever
       </em>
       have worked", without providing detailed reasoning as to
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       it would never have worked or proof that it was as flimsy as he claimed.
      </p>
      <p>
       And besides the photos, what info from NASA scientists themselves does he actually use to prove that things were faked? As I said before, I found nothing in his 13 page diatribe that was remotely compelling on a scientific level.

       As far as I can tell, debunkers such as yourself have canned responses for only a fraction of the evidence that the landings were hoaxed, and the rest of it you dismiss as 'not remotely compelling.' The rules of competitive debate (such as practiced in high schools and colleges) as that you have to counter each argument in order to win the debate (and you have to rebut the argument itself, not a straw-man version of it). You can't simply say it isn't compelling because "science." You must rebut each point. For example, I have never seen any attempt to discuss how the astronauts dealt with the problem of moon dust getting back into the lander and then the command module.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the radiation analysis you linked to, it is far from undisputed:
       <a href="https://youtu.be/sYzkmHaZJI8?t=488">
        https://youtu.be/sYzkmHaZJI8?t=488
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       After watching that rebuttal video, we can understand better why this NASA engineer recently said the radiation problem of passing quickly through the Van Allen belts (twice) was a problem they still had to solve:
       <br/>
       <a href="https://youtu.be/51DED8dcNkA?t=250">
        https://youtu.be/51DED8dcNkA?t=250
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the lunar rover, there was a lot more to McGowan's argument than how it fit into the lander. For example, many of the components of the lander had to be fitted on after it was opened up. Where were those components stored and how were the astronauts able to do so with their bulky spacesuits that limited their manual dexterity considerably.
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence from NASA scientists I referred to was mostly the more recent statements (like the one link to above) from NASA discussing the difficulties of going back to moon, for example this from Wagging the Moondoggie, a statement about spacesuits (from an article on space.com):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In one of the articles, we find Michael Wargo, identified as the “chief lunar scientist for Exploration Systems at NASA Headquarters,” contemplating a return trip to the Moon: “’None of our spacesuits that we currently have would be appropriate for that extreme an environment,’ [says Wargo]. Any materials built for Earth-like temperatures won’t work on the moon. ‘They don’t bend anymore, they fracture, and they fracture brittle-y, and so everything gets extremely brittle at those temperatures.’” (“Water Discovery Fuels Hope to Colonize the Moon,” November 13, 2009)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And finally, returning to my first point about disingenuous and partial responses from debunkers. There has really been no serious attempt to counter the massive and irrefutable evidence of photographic anomalies. Just to take one debunking site as an example.
       <a href="http://www.moonlandinghoax.org/5.html">
        Here is a supposed debunking from moonlandinghoax.org about the evidence of photographic anomalies.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Compare the picture they have both to
       <a href="http://www.davesweb.cnchost.com/Apollo5.html">
        the pictures supplied by McGowan in his moondoggie series
       </a>
       and to the careful scientific analysis in this video, and it's plain to see that it is in fact the debunkers such as yourself who are simply not credible.

       FWIW, this is one of David Icke's pet theories too.

       Also, there are similar theories about Mars' moon, Phobos, being artificial as well that I find pretty intriguing

       I hypothesize that fluoride not only makes many people fat, dumb and docile, but that the  powerful know that and deliberately keep fluoride in water so few people will have the energy or ability to rebel.
      </p>
      <p>
       And possibly that they know that fetal ultrasound damages babies all over the world, thus making it less likely they will grow up and be able to rebel.

       Since the early 1900's scientific progress and understanding has been obstructed. The course of development has been directed on a specific path.
Up to this day technology has advanced, but the knowledge of what is there is not even half of the whole. 
Go back and study the science and experiments from the mid 1800's up to early 1900's. 
And find the sporadic islands of discovery that pop up over the last century, which are quickly squashed.
Most scientists who call themselves as such should be ashamed. Take in without thought, regurgitate, repeat.
      </p>
      <p>
       The collective consciousness is not ready yet. 
There are higher order beings up there that are directing the course of humanity's development.

       That's because science progresses in paradigm shifts and not in small steps as the system would have you believe. Inside a particular paradigm, there is little discoveries to be made (but vast technological improvements), you just recursively visit the corners of the current paradigm, and so fundamental science stagnates, the name of the game is to write the paper that reinforces the current paradigm, but doesn't necessarily extends it, certainly does not challenge it, it's essentially a contest of who can learn the current paradigm by heart best, as you put it. Then at some point some genius comes along and presents a dramatically different model that goes beyond the current paradigm. That's when the fight starts, the elite of the current paradigm is not in it to get schooled, but they will lose rather quickly if the new model is valid, or else they will have to start believing in magic before long as the new tech deploys. Once the new paradigm settles in, rinse repeat! The hierarchical institutions settle, and we make little progress until the next genius comes along, can take centuries.

       Tech is a lot more advanced than we've been led to believe. There has already been significant improvements in A.I. such that almost every policy decision is governed by a system making complex strategic calculations and predicting the most statistically likely outcomes of each decision so that the future can almost be engineered. We've discovered the process for living forever, but it's only available to a select few that have enacted something along the lines of a 100+ year plan using the above mentioned A.I. by which society and the world can be prepared for this technology. Psychically active individuals have been provided with a powerful classified nootropic drug that enhances these abilities to actual consistent and controllable manifestation giving them powerful abilities useful to the elite immortals including suggestion bordering on mind control, mind reading, precognition, etc. Breeding programs further enhance these and will continue to enhance them. Identification of these traits in the general population results in a life time of monitoring for either recruitment into the program or suppression. All of this in conjunction with the fact that extraterrestrial civilizations have been discovered and contacted, but our world does not qualify for open communication with them until the above mentioned 100+ year plan is completed. Slowly a script is being played out to get us there.

       I get why Freemasons in the Catholic church fall into conspiracy territory, but can you explain what is so conspiracy oriented about Tridentine mass? I read through it, and noticed that there was a shift in rites between the 50's and 70's with Cardinal Ratzinger being interested in the traditional stuff, but couldn't find a conspiracy. I'm not Catholic, so I was pretty confused the whole time and don't understand the deal with the rites at all.

       Communists, with the help of some Freemasons -- these two groups don't normally work together, but similar to the CIA and Mafia did in the case of JFK, did in this case due to common goals -- worked hard the entirety of the 20th century to destroy the Church. Their chief results have been the twin abuses: liturgical abuse (offering the Mass incorrectly) and sex abuse (90% of which was homosexual pederasty between priests and teen boys).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Communists saw the Catholic Church as the chief barrier to world domination. They infiltrated the Church as documented in

       Liturgical abuse, that is the Novus Ordo Mass of 1970 as it is commonly practiced, has wreaked havoc in terms of attendance and closed parishes.

       The only growth in the Catholic Church today is in the Tridentine Mass (aka the Traditional Latin Mass).
       <a href="http://fssp.org/en/chiffres.htm">
        http://fssp.org/en/chiffres.htm
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Most bishops to this day, however, are hostile to the Tridentine Mass for one or more of several reasons: they themselves are one of the homosexuals put in place by the Communists (or groomed by them and the homosexual seminaries they started) and wish to reject everything traditional including both the Traditional Latin Mass and traditional Church teaching against homosexual activity; they must cater to a church population that has grown accustomed to the Novus Ordo Mass as it is commonly practiced and are afraid of changing anything lest donations be lost; they are embarrassed that they themselves do not know how to say the Traditional Latin Mass and do not want to be shown up; they are freemasons carrying on the 20th century work of Church destruction. There are cities begging for an FSSP parish -- where the whole parish, architecture, culture, everything is oriented toward the Tridentine Mass -- but most bishops refuse to invite them.
      </p>
      <p>
       A good percentage -- larger than of the general population -- of Catholics who regularly attend a Tridentine Mass are conspiracy theorists.

       World governments are suppressing evidence that Puma Punku, a site in Bolivia, was built by aliens over 12,000 years ago and then suffered great damage due to a cataclysmic flood. I guess this interests me because I always wonder what lines of reasoning people use to invent such claims. I mean, that's the real mystery.

       We have two metabolism, one to accumulate, and one to burn. The inception of the standard american diet after the war, exported everywhere in the financial empire, ensured we could never use our burning metabolism. They did this because the accumulative metabolism comes with cravings and irregular energy, while the burning metabolism comes with satiety and very consistent energy level, in terms of consumption, growth and beautiful charts on high tech screens, the former is much more interesting. Down the road, because we are not meant to accumulate all life long, big pharma catches more profits from our abused bodies. As a result, a place like
       <a href="/r/keto">
        /r/keto
       </a>
       is just as problematic as
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       because it leads people right into the burning metabolism (you should see some the results they post! amazing stuff!), except they can't fight data, ideas, concepts, sure, all day long, but data, kinda hard. They are launching international medias campaigns against it, watch them associate fat some more with all the drama in the world (don't drink butter coffee, don't eat meat, don't eat cheese, blablablawoufwouf)
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr: if you replace the carbs with healthy fats in your diet, you become a superhuman

       people presenting themselves as politicians, jounrnalists, major CEO's - anybody in power be it cultural or financial -- who are really literally faking their identities - and they are often actors or people "acting" -- and sometimes they play more than one role. and sometimes - often -- they literally use theatrical disguises such as fake teeth, prosthetics etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       it sounds like some scooby do goofiness - but I think it's really occurring , and often. this way the -- whoever they are -- who hold the financial power -- let us see a day dream of free market -- free public discourse, etc -- but really these people are all staying within very specific boundaries and are only play acting at battling it out -- if the people behind the scenes say jump they will always jump.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think flat earth theory is legitimate, with excellent arguments -- and very worthy of respect.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think questioning dinosaurs, satellites, atom bomb, all outer space travel - is a legitimate pursuit. ( I think they are all fake)
      </p>
      <p>
       i VERY much wonder how whoever is doing all this gets people to participate so dutifully. I can imagine they use threats, bribes, promise of the rewards of being an insider -- what have you - -but I just don't understand why nobody cracks. MKULTRA and mind control seems both a possible true explanation and a possible red herring explanation. since there is SO MUCH MKULTRA symbolism in fashion and music -- I can't figure why they don't want to keep it more of a secret if it's real. but maybe it's the only thing they have to express themselves about - and art depicting anything else might lead to too much free thought on part of audience, ---- so I do not know the answer but I wonder if MKULTRA is real or if it's a real conspiracy to make us think it's real that they can control people through this method. same goes for the whole satanic elite thing. I sometimes wonder if that also is a red herring - and the abundance of clues are there intentionally placed to mislead. but again - it could be real and they just don't fear getting caught -- I do not know. but these questions interest me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really want to know WHY this is all being done, the fake politicians, the psyche breaking symbolism in fashion and art, the continually staged news events, -- sure money. but after a while doesn't it get tiresome to write fake news all the time? wouldn't you just say -- ah let's retire to the emerald outskirts of antarctica and leave the suckers to fend for themselves without all our efforting to keep them confused.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don;t know, but those are the things I think about and I wish I could find more people to openly discuss this stuff with

       It's going to be nothing but politics for a while now, considering the hype over the US election.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would love to see more politics from other countries. I'm not from the US, but I do find some of the discussion interesting, and I refuse to believe that USA and Israel are the only corrupt countries out there.

       I think Copenhagen was generally a bad idea.  I don't think science should accept paradoxes as answers.  I think Bohr's atom wasn't helpful &amp; after we discovered the electron, we tried to explain too much with it.  Somehow the advances in the first half of last century seem to have been etched in stone, when I think we could really benefit from some new perspectives into the nature of E/M &amp; light.  I also hated taking chemistry, so if someone could come up with a new model that made more intuitive sense, I'd be all for that.
