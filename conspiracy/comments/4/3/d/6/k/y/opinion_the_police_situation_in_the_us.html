        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So we&#39;re seeing a lot of posts of police brutality lately. I don&#39;t post here, at all, but I lurk. I&#39;m of the thought process that these police violence videos are doing harm. What do I mean by this? </p>

<p>Let&#39;s take a look into my thinking here. If you were a governing body with a militaristic police force and you were worried about a citizen uprising what would you do? Would you hide evidence that your main system of dealing with your populous is terrifying and may kill you on sight if you even slightly move out of the defined path for you? Obviously not. You would flaunt it. Maybe hide it under the guise we are seeing now, but you wouldn&#39;t want it to  be a secret. </p>

<p>Our government in the United States wants you to be scared of the people they put in charge of your &quot;safety&quot;. So they have been showing us their cruelty and capabilities. Nothing media related is accidental. It is all constructed with an agenda in mind. This is a reality of modern society and one must always remember this. It is not paranoid to look past what is being spoon fed to you on the news and facebook. Nothing you see by ANYONE is in your interest. It IS, however, in the interest of the party in question. Always. This is a basic idea that works everywhere, but for some reason falls apart when one thinks of news outlets.</p>

<p>The police ARE SCARY, but we are being pushed into believing they are more powerful than they are. This is to push us into the dirt. Do not FEAR the police. Everything you see about them today, and possibly from now on, is PROPAGANDA.</p>

<p>They want a federalised police force so they disseminate info at all levels to create the situation where people don&#39;t trust their local pd and since they&#39;re all victims of Stockholm syndrome, will turn to big brother to do something about it and voila there&#39;s now a federalised police force.

<p>am I crazy or do we not already have MULTIPLE federal police forces:</p>

<p>FBI, DEA, ATF, DHS, SS and probably a bunch more I am forgetting.  What evidence is there that local police forces will be dissolved and replaced with a exponentially larger FBI down to the local level?  I just don&#39;t see that happening?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am from Europe, Denmark specifically, and I have been watching the situation for an extended period of time. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Most of us have properly seen our fair share of videos showing US Police Officers brutality assaulting and sometimes killing US citizens. It is a daily occurrence, adding up to almost 1000 murdered citizens and 10000&#39;s of assaulted/raped/robbed/Wrongfully imprisoned victims, every single year.</p></li>
<li><p>In the current system of affairs only a very very small minority of Police Officers get punished for their crimes. There seems to be a complete lag of <em>Accountability, Due Process of Law</em> and <em>The Rule of Law.</em> Evidence disappear, witnesses disappear, witnesses dying in suspicious accidents, Police Officers blatantly lying under oath, Police Officers placing false evidence at the crime scene and a completely rigged and useless Grand Jury system.</p></li>
<li><p>There has also been a growing trend of militarizing the police with military grade equipment and military style training. The result has been a growing body count. </p></li>
<li><p>The <em>War on Drugs</em> has not made things better. Illegal and unlawful searches without a warrant. Painful, unsafe and dangerous restraint methods. Shoot first and ask later policies. Widespread and aggressive confiscations of property and cash. Military style SWAT police units. An endless circle of violence and counter violence.</p></li>
<li><p>Every single day in the USA almost 200 people are getting hurt, commit suicide or get shot and killed by firearms. That makes being a Police Officer somewhat dangerous. Therefore I fully understand if the death rate, in the USA, would be somewhat higher, compared to Europe, when the Police Officers interact with normal Citizens. BUT if you look at the statistics and data available the death rate is 20.000-30.000% higher than in the UK, Germany, Benelux and Scandinavia. It is simply grotesquely absurd and beyond good reason.</p></li>
<li><p>This system is excessively COSTLY.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This is not a health system nor does it foster any confidence in the Police or individual Police Officers. It does not make the USA a safer or a better country. It brutalizes the population and created a circle of ever increasing violence and counter violence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. I think, from another European&#39;s perspective, the problem is as much about a serious lack of trust by the police in the public and vice versa, as long as there being a strong possibility in any encounter that both sides will be equipped with deadly weapons. This just doesn&#39;t happen in Europe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your point about the job of police being more dangerous in the US is a large cause of the higher civilian death rates. US citizens are well armed with guns and this provides criminals with easy access to guns. A simple home burglary provides a gun. The police need to deal with all these armed citizens and armed criminals everyday. Even simple interactions can lead to deaths as soon as a gun is involved. Even the strong possibility of a gun has police understandably nervous...enough to make more mistakes.</p>

<p>I understand police are being used as an instrument to enforce government policies...and those controlling the government are evil. However a lot of problems with the police stem from US society and it strong gun culture.  Feel free to disagree</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I kinda agree but not completely. The reason you have so many criminals armed is because of the Drug War.  Individuals are operating in an environment where they can&#39;t call the police if they are wronged, yet they need some form of protection. Also, you have a situation where if you are caught selling drugs your life is even further ruined. So you have a situation where if you are caught committing a certain non-violent crime, you spend a large number of years in prison and when you get out your past prevents you from getting a decent paying job. So you are relegated to poverty or returning to your life of crime. Getting a distribution charge is akin to a life sentence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since after the Civil War there have been plenty of instances of police heavy handedness against the population.</p>

<p>In other words,   the social system or customs of the US,   from kindergarten forward,  have socialized us for dealing with authority in a certain way,   from the angle of the citizen,   to dealing with confrontations from the angle of those in uniform.    Even if you look at who is attracted in the first place to be a cop or a soldier,   and the way they are trained,    indoctrinated,   and the esprit de corps (often very sick) that is in these groups.</p>

<p>Here is another way to look at it,   the mental health and suicide rates of returning soldiers or of police officers.</p>

<p>Each country has its own history and its own myths.    The US version is not that apparent to most of the people who live hear.    They live within it like a religious believer lives within their church.    It would take a lot of deprogramming or councelling for most people who live here to get any real perspective on their assumptions and belief systems,  and especially to enlighten them to <strong>the lies they believe about their country</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For one, some of what the media reports is done so grudgingly to try to maintain credibility. Once an unfavorable story goes viral on the internet, the MSM is obligated to stop ignoring it. The Fast and Furious scandal is a prime example. </p>

<p>Having said that, I also firmly believe that everything that comes out of your teevee does so for a reason. Therefore, I agree that many of the police brutality/confiscation stories are getting national attention to scare and desensitize the public to the police state. I believe Snowden was a deliberately staged event designed to discourage any attempt at organized resistance, too. Half the cameras at Walmart are decoys for the same reason.</p>

<p>Another extremely powerful control mechanism that rarely gets mentioned is that any criminal charge can lead to financial devastation. If you are a middle class citizen with a job and a family, you are terrified because any interaction with the authorities can be escalated into a life destroying incident. Anything from getting smart with a traffic cop to posting the wrong thing on Facebook can lead to financial devastation. </p>

<p>Fear leads to one of two things: You learn to either love or hate the thing you fear. As the camps split into the resisters and the bootlickers, the lower classes become further divided, further benefiting the wealthy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is what&#39;s going on. Majority of the population is angry. They are angry at each other, jobs, or whatever. Police are the ones to show up in a 911 call to handle it. </p>

<p>Essentially they are the nations baby sitters. For too long people in the USA have been coddled and lead to believe that sucking from the tit of society is OK. For an example look at how many college graduates move back in at home. </p>

<p>Parents reenforce this too cause they had it rough and their parents were &quot;tough love&quot; so they vowed not to be like that. Well grow up and take responsibility. Maybe you will end up on the street. Hell I did for some time. </p>

<p>Took showers at a truck stop and kept my clothes in a locker. I didn&#39;t blame anyone even myself. I found a way. Pulled up my boot straps and kept my job. Showed up to work and just made my situation better. </p>

<p>My father NEVER let me come back. Well thing is that everyone now was told they were a special snowflake. Blah blah. So they expect that shit. Well a cop isn&#39;t gonna act nice. His position is dominance. They are not your friend so why if they are called should they be nice?</p>

<p>99% of the time you don&#39;t realize the nature of the call they received before they got to the location and beat the shit out of someone. Should they rush in with guns drawn? Sure cause guess what it&#39;s you vs them. Don&#39;t be a fuck up and you won&#39;t catch a bullet. </p>

<p>Downvote me if you want, but guess what I won&#39;t be the one with my dick in the dirt cause I won&#39;t poke the bear. I see no reason. That whole well it can happen to you one day is bullshit. It won&#39;t cause I dont walk around with a chip on my shoulder.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have to respect the person just their position. </p>

<p>Also don&#39;t fear police. I fear citizens because they are stupid. Claiming what&#39;s just and right. Lol that&#39;s why you are not a police officer huh? Cause you know better? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People fear police because they fear citizens. Police are citizen and most importantly, they are also people. People have emotions, biases and all sorts of shit. Police fear citizens for the same exact reasons. The difference is Police are armed and rarely prosecuted for their misdeeds. This us vs them mentality is mainly the problem. When its Us vs Them, you can easily rationalize brutal behaviors. You can view threats that aren&#39;t there or even over exaggerate threats.  Also this US vs them(lets call it tribalism) makes it easy to have others of your group cover up for your misdeeds. This tribalism creates a mindset perfect for war. In fact, this mindset is promoted into our military because it is one needed to survive in war. It is probably not the best mindset for dealing with the general public at home. </p>
