       Absolutely. Will we have computers? Of course. The accessible portion of the web will be limited to entertainment, games (diversions) and state filtered news. Take a look at the example of Soviet Russia or Berlin in the 40's. Especially in Germany, the newsreel footage makes it look like a party. And it probably was. They're good about letting you party while they're destroying your way of life, so you don't notice. There were probably several news outlets, all running the same stories from the same sources. There will be an increase in the decriminalization of recreational drugs and more sports, particularly of the bloodletting sort, which will all serve to keep us entertained and diverted, while TPTB find new wars, whether of the combative or the social kind (climate change) on which to spend the trillions they steal from us. You can read the last few chapters of The Creature From Jekyll Island to get a better idea of where this is all headed. It's a bit dated as to specifics, but the framework is true and right.

       Yes. Also responsible for the titillating view we have of Freud's theories.  In reality the whole anal fixation/kids angle is only a small part of his theories, it is just something that he came up with to sell his uncle's books in America.

       Well by removing urself from the state of nature u bascially give up ur ability to dispense justice. So u are letting society and the rule of law act on your behalf, and in part whatever legislative body u live under. But when the legislative fails to ensure the rights we were promised by entering into a society the whole relationship falls apart. Like you were saying tho individuals join society in order to preserve themselves and their property. Without that it would be impossible to progress into civilization.

       Maybe if you were born a thousand years ago. All the good land has been taken by dumb fucking humans who keep breeding like it's their job. Not many people realize that if they don't stop fucking, we will overpopulate the globe. And now you are pointing the finger at our current society for not being 'completely free'. No fucking shit sherlock. Blame your ancestors, but it won't do you any good. Cry more about not having any land to move to to call your own. Those days have been long gone and it has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with dumb fucking-people.

       A part of me is rather frightened by this eventual reality,  but another part of me is optimistic about it.  If you think about all the times throughout history that humanity has united in the face of adverse events,  even extreme events like the great depression,  when millions upon millions of people lost their jobs,  and any way to financially support themselves (mostly all without government assistance btw), people adapted.  I really feel that humanity can only unite fully once the carrot has been removed from the stick.

       They believe a fascist police state is necessary to save the planet from us, but not from themselves; for them it is to be a great voluptuous parkland to be deflowered at their leisure. They have instituted the religions of money and war to bring it about; to remain human is to struggle against the gods of this age. Annihilation is the destiny of the useless eaters, whose existence was only ever an evil made necessary by the evolutionary process of the illuminated 1% that has any real right to exist at all.

       There are not enough greenhouses to feed the world. I would say that &lt;99% of agriculture is outdoors, and therefore seeds can blow onto your farm and then Monsanto can sue-and they have.

       The privatization of the commons.
      </p>
      <p>
       For centuries in Europe, people could take what they needed and support themselves off the land until the advent of industrialization, at which point resources were privatized and exploited for the sole gain of the elite, with the added benefit being that they could control their growing populations by denying them access to means of self-sustainability.
      </p>
      <p>
       This desire to control production and resources is why the elite want to move towards a cashless society.

       Even under the feudal system people still had far more free time, kept a greater percentage of the fruits of their labor, and had more guaranteed rights and access to resources than they do now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, a greater percentage of resources, time, and labor is controlled by a much smaller number of people.

       This is untrue. The people at the bottom, the serfs, led horrible lives. They were slaves. At the top of the feudalism pyramid everything was owned and controlled by a select few. It's the same system now, just less obvious.

       Maybe for some, but most serfs only had to give a small percentage of their harvest to their lords and the majority still had unfettered access to the commons.

        The labouring man will take his rest long in the morning; a good piece of the day is spent afore he come at his work; then he must have his breakfast, though he have not earned it at his accustomed hour, or else there is grudging and murmuring; when the clock smiteth, he will cast down his burden in the midway, and whatsoever he is in hand with, he will leave it as it is, though many times it is marred afore he come again; he may not lose his meat, what danger soever the work is in. At noon he must have his sleeping time, then his bever in the afternoon, which spendeth a great part of the day; and when his hour cometh at night, at the first stroke of the clock he casteth down his tools, leaveth his work, in what need or case soever the work standeth.

       You should read more about the feudal system. Serfs grew their own food on tiny plots, compared to the plots they grew for their lord/household who owned the land.
      </p>
      <p>
       But does the percentage of what they gave even matter in this conversation? Serfs did not own any of the land themselves. They were literal slaves. Some were called free, but they were indeed slaves. And people still are slaves and this is what really matters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I see your edit of citations. However this wont change my pov. The feudal system was an unfair system, which allowed for a small amount of individuals at the top to receive the benefits. That system did not allow for them to be free. The system is still like this.

       The concept of ownership is irrelevant here, the Charter of The Forests in the Magna Carta, guaranteed that free men had access to the Commons.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        At a time when the royal forests were the most important potential source of fuel for cooking, heating and industries such as charcoal burning, and such hotly defended rights as pannage (pasture for their pigs), estover (collecting firewood), agistment (grazing), or turbary (cutting of turf for fuel), this charter was almost unique in providing a degree of economic protection for free men, who also used the forest to forage for food and to graze their animals.

       I'd say its the same old scam - you are forced to give most of the fruits of your work to a more powerful force, with the implicit threat of coercion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back in the day it was the lord and his knight thugs, now its the government and their police thugs. Have things changed? Not that much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately it doesn't matter whether we are making more of less then in the good old days, whether we enjoy modern conveniences such as heat or life in a shitty hut and sleep with the pigs to make it few long winter nights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, now, as in the past, the average man is getting screwed out of the proceeds of his labor by a bunch of elite do nothings with groups of armed thugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you want to know a little dirty secret? A great deal of those constituting this new ruling class, are literally the same people that were this old ruling class.
      </p>
      <p>
       New names for the same old tired scam. It's not worth arguing over which is more exploitative... they are both exploitative as fuck and are really the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially, you have to understand that government is really just a mafia style protection racket, undertaken on a big scale. This is why government's go to such great length to attack and weaken organized crime - it is quite literally infringing on their territory.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that is why government's create and fund standing armies... to fight against rival protection rackets for territory. Totally fucked up.

       Note for the few that choose to continually change the topic: this post is not about advocating for feudalism but a comparison of feudalism against the system of governance we have today.

      <p>
       Better forms of governance can be had once such have been hashed out, but such is neither feudalism nor what we pass off as democracy today.

       If you're making that line of argument you should just be arguing for a return to living in tribal pre-agricultural societies then: that is where people have the most free time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hunter gatherers have the most leisure time of all peoples, no need to bring this privatization bollocks in.

       The gap between today and feudalism isn't half as large as that one.

       Exactly, they live in a completely un-privatized society so they are completely free.... by your own metric.

       Sigh. I didn't bring it up first and no strawman. You did by stating "for centuries..." and implying things were fine until industrialization. Things didn't turn sour with industrialization. Things were bad before then and that is all I am trying to show people. I don't want people to read your comment and think things were dandy up until industrialization.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not even trying to argue with you. If I say "you win" will you stop? People should just know that things were bad before industrialization! And just because serfs had what, more "vacation" time than us, does it mean they had better lives? They really didn't.

       We are arguing different points. When I mentioned serfdom you started arguing about the lives that serfs led while I wanted to try and point out that things were bad before industrialization. I am not going to change my mind. So we are pretty much done here.

       You suggest that because you have no response at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Telling your opponent to just read a book or go think isn't debating - it is in fact giving up because you don't have anything relevant to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's the truth, you didn't have anything relevant to say so you just made up an insult :D

      </p>
      <h1>
       Where White Man Went Wrong
      </h1>
      <p>
       Indian Chief "Two Eagles" was asked by a white U.S. government official,
       <em>
        'You have observed the white man for 90 years. You've seen his progress, and the damage he's done.'
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Chief nodded in agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
       The official continued,
       <em>
        "Considering all these events, in your opinion where did the white man go wrong?"
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Chief stared at the government official then replied,
       <em>
        "When white man find land, Indians running it, no taxes, no debt, plenty buffalo, plenty beaver, clean water, women did all the work, Medicine man free. Indian man spend all day hunting and fishing; all night having sex."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the Chief leaned back and smiled,
       <em>
        "Only white man dumb enough to think he could improve a system like that."
       </em>
      </p>
      <h1>
       Capitalism
      </h1>
      <p>
       An American investment banker was at the pier of a small coastal Mexican village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked.  Inside the small boat were several large yellowfin tuna.  The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Mexican replied,
       <em>
        "only a little while."
       </em>
       The American then asked
       <em>
        "Why don’t you stay out longer and catch more fish?"
       </em>
       The Mexican said he had enough to support his family’s immediate needs. The American then asked,
       <em>
        “But what do you do with the rest of your time?”
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Mexican fisherman said,
       <em>
        “I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take siestas with my wife, Maria, stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine, and play guitar with my amigos.  I have a full and busy life.”
       </em>
       The American scoffed,
       <em>
        “I am a Harvard MBA and could help you. You should spend more time fishing and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. With the proceeds from the bigger boat, you could buy several boats, eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor, eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing, and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City, then LA and eventually New York City, where you will run your expanding enterprise.”
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Mexican fisherman asked,
       <em>
        “But, how long will this all take?”
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       To which the American replied,
       <em>
        “15 – 20 years.”
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        “But what then?”
       </em>
       Asked the Mexican.
      </p>
      <p>
       The American laughed and said,
       <em>
        “That’s the best part.  When the time is right you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich, you would make millions!”
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        “Millions – then what?”
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       The American said,
       <em>
        “Then you would retire.  Move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take siestas with your wife, stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos.”

       hey dude, if you want to live without money just go walk into the woods. theres plenty of space in the world where if you dont want to be found nobody will find you. you are free to live without money there.
      </p>
      <p>
       but im sure thats not what you had in mind. you are living in a civilization that requires money to operate. in exchange for that living you are required to make money aka produce something of value for the civilization

       I've seriously thought about. But it's a little more complicated then just wandering off into the woods. 
From the day we are born we are raised in a society built on money. We are trained to depend on the system of money. It's a trap. How do we get out?
Very few know how to survive anymore outside of "civilization".
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of us were not taught how to live off the land. I don't know how to do it or even where to go.  And they won't allow it.
They don't want us to get out of this system.

       Well, the entire system is on the verge of collapse. the need for human labor is coming to an end quicker than anyone imaged.
China last year built its first fully automated factory and factories for years (just yt how a coca cola factory works.. there's like 15 or 20 employees, if that.

       The wealthy cannot save things bc all they do is hoard more money they can ever use. Even if they make 100k times what an average worker does, they do not but 100k cars or pairs of jeans.
      </p>

       What will happen then is what I wonder. The point of critical mass. 
Fresh water is disappearing. The oceans are expected to have more plastic in them by 2050 than fish.

      <p>
       Maybe its bc I watched Star Trek as a child or bc I have a good imagination but I can easily envision much better world with no money, and no scarcity. Where human labor and creative efforts instead of competing, work together. Compete against the physics. the problem at hand. We can do so much better than the horror we have created for ourselves on earth. That much is certain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine you had the power to make the world in any form you wished and when people woke the following morning it would be as if they were born into that world. The direction we're headed in now seem right out of a science fiction nightmare.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing is certain; things will get much worse before, if, they get better. I once spoke to an older aunt of mine about this briefly and she said, 'we'll go back to sticks and stones before that happens.'

       if you are serious, save up a bunch of money and dedicate the next 3 years of your life learning how to do it. theres also off grid communities that would let you stay with them in exchange for manual labor

      <p>
       It is really "domestication" not civilization. I was raised to be able to care for myself without depending on a "society" to provide for me.  It was a long education, but never once in all my 36 years have I ever worried about becoming homeless. I know should that happen, I would be one of the most comfortable homeless people squatting in the wild.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first step in becoming self-sufficient is to invest time and energy on learning skills.  Don't watch tv or Netflix, instead learn how to sew, or read up on your medicinal herb-lore, or wood working skills, or really any skill that could enhance your life should you need to rely on it. Next you will have to invest money (yes, money will be needed initially) in
       <strong>
        quality
       </strong>
       tools. The more basic the better. Invest in some hand tools for gardening, knives for butchering game, a set of chisels for wood working, and so on. Basically, just prepare yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have lived in a rural area most of my life and there were times when I was younger that I longed for a city existence.  A very wise old man told me " a country boy can go to the city and learn all he needs to
       <em>
        survive
       </em>
       in a week. A city boy goes to the country and it will take him a lifetime to learn all the things needed to survive."  ;-)
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is, if you wish to be truly free then you will have to take time to empower yourself with skills and applicable knowledge.  Things can be taken from you, skills and knowledge are yours forever after gaining them.

       The cage is illusory. It is also easily avoided by simply empowering yourself with skills and applicable knowledge.  After that it becomes a conscious choice to interact with society or not.  Free yourself. ;-)

       The cage isn't illusory and there's more than one of them. There are the immediate demands of our sustenance and well-being (many places dont even have water; more than 10k babies below the age of 5 die daily just from this)
      </p>
      <p>
       And there's the cage of the neo-feudalism we call capitalism. An ethically indefensible system of indentured servitude designed to transfer money from the poor to the wealthy. 91% of all financial gains in the US in the past 5 years have gone to the top 1% wage earners.  It is a system bent ever greater control and exploitation by a minuscule minority with unlimited resources, over the rest of us. Soon we will have cashless societies and ever lessening diversity and freedom in every sphere imaginable/
      </p>
      <p>
       We are not talking about that minuscule minority who would live completely off the grid in a shack in the woods (gotta love how Thoreau did it, with weekly visits to a tavern), but the masses.

       My solution works for them as well. Empower them with skills and knowledge.  This isn't done anymore. I have met people my age who have never even cooked a single meal for themselves (which boggles my mind!). Skills and knowledge can never be taken from you once you gain them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take my house? Well, I know how to build one. I will just build another. Put up insurmountable bureaucratic bs in my way keeping me from progressing? Looks like I just became an outlaw.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part of the illusion of the cage is our acceptance of it. The other part is that we are made dependent. Why learn to defend oneself when the police can be called? Why learn to cook when one can just go to a restaurant? Why learn to build/make it myself when I can just pay to have the finished product?
      </p>
      <p>
       People no longer have the choice in many places because they are never given the tools (said skills and knowledge) that allow them such a choice.  We need that back, otherwise we are no better than livestock.

       Despite the fact that I agree with everything you're saying.  It  doesnt address the problem for the masses as most people (me included I would probably starve in the woods.. -though I do have a number of books that teach one how to survive in the woods,  I get food delivered to my door daily. So as you say the more dependent we become on technology the less self-sufficient we are..
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually people, in some trans-humanist nightmare, may end up like a parasite on the technology, so completely dependent upon it, we cannot survive without it. We already see this with people and their cars.. When relatives of mine who live in middle America (the longest walk they usually take is from thei house to their car to wherever they are going then back to the car) vistit me in NYC,, im astonished at their inability to walk even a mile. They tire so quickly..whereas in NY,, I dont use a car,,we move around a lot on foot, lots of subway steps, etc.. so it's small thing, but it's one example of the potentially for far worse scenario of human dependence on technology.

       Were I in your position (facing the prospect of starving in the woods should TSHTF) I would take those books, get out of the city now, and start practicing and trying everything in those books to see how it works.  Once I felt confident enough in what I know, I would start dragging friends out and start teaching them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was raised very unconventionally. My dad believed it was his duty as a father to teach me all the skills he could that would assist in my survival. If there was something I needed to learn that he didn't know, he would find a teacher and we would both learn it. He also wanted me to learn how to do all those skills with as little "technology" as possible. I learned compass and orienteering, snaring and trapping, building shelter using only a knife, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       This approach to being raised taught me that skills are more important than things and to this day I put time and energy into expanding my skill-sets.  I quote Robert Heinlein:" A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, design a building, conn a ship, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve an equation, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal,fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects."
      </p>
      <p>
       The masses will change depending on the circumstances and environment, but you shouldn't worry about them until you have shored up yourself. How can you help anyone when you aren't prepared to even help yourself? Once that is done you can start expanding out to your community both micro, then macro.

      <p>
       Should you have any questions for me, please feel free to ask. I will answer them to the best of my knowledge. I wish you the best, May You Never Know Thirst! :-)

       Awesome post! Thank you.. I really wish I had the balls to do that but Im gonna work on it. Spend a week living off thee land. Of course money is always the problem.  Living in NYC is so stifling,,, it sometimes feel like I'm drowning,,, slowly drowning,, bc we are so far removed from nature. When I go out into the woods, or the ocean,, the feeling is really overwhelming.. I love sitting quietly (meditating) in nature, it's indescribable. Its always been that way, probably bc I was raised in NY and have always lived here. tx again for the reminder that indeed many of our cages are illusory,, like the one that keeps my grounded here is rooted in fear.

       You are most certainly welcome! :-)

       I can only imagine how stressful it must be to live in NYC! I tried living in Portland, Or. for a while (a large city but nowhere near as big as NYC) and it almost drove me insane.  And indeed, money always seems to be the barrier.  But I will tell you that with every skill you learn and every tool acquired, that barrier becomes less daunting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will say this last thing; fear is a feeling. You feel hot. You feel cold. You feel hungry. You feel afraid. Feelings should be acknowledged but should never control you.  Fear has no root unless you allow it one. ;-)

       This worries me greatly when I think about the general population. People are too dependent on each other for the most basic things. People take so many things for granted and expect the necessities to always be there when they need them.
What if suddenly our infrastructure collapsed, and people couldn't go the grocery store for food? In only a couple weeks time it would be chaos.

       If it really worries you, then you should start expanding and refining your skill sets now. One reason is, in such a chaotic situation, you become valuable not because of what you have but instead because of what you can do. The next reason is that you can teach others these skills, thus strengthening the community you choose to be in or happen to be in.  Skills and knowledge are power. Start by empowering yourself. ;-)

       Do you think this "decentralized currency" will help anything? It's exactly what they want to happen. Instead of control of your physical cash &amp; bank accounts they have the control and will be able to turn that internet off at any given time if you don't comply with whatever they're pushing at that time.

         It's more than a decentralized currency. It's a system for distributing more than just a ledger. It's a framework for building a distributed "computer" consisting of "smart contracts" which is a buzzword for verifiable execution of distributed applications. You could build a different currency on top of it.

         It is exactly what they want to happen. Ethereum is controlled by a private foundation. Could be George Soros, tomorrow, who knows. Either way, it provides a singular point of control and liability.

       That's not the point of OP. Technically OP is correct. Even if you buy land to homestead, you do not actually own the land. The State could take it from you. Especially if you don't pay property tax, which you need cash/money for. So OP is correct.

       Also Emminent domain, but you can tie them up in court for a long time.  You can also stage for a toxic carrier to crash into your property, thereby condemning it, or bribe an official to find nuclear waste on your property too.  There are some other backcountry shittricks you can pull to railroad government projects, you just have to make sure it's never 'your fault' or the EPA will fine you to clean it up.  It's best if one branch of gov screws up your property for another branch of gov.

       And it's only getting worse/harder for homesteading. I believe in AZ they were going after homesteaders. They are going after people trying to live "off the grid". And then you got the shit going on with the BLM and ranchers. The government is out of control.

       BLM ranchers are a bunch bitch ass entitled scum fucks using BLM land without paying the measly fees (we still have laws in this country) but want to benefit monetarily from grazing... by selling milk or meat from their large amounts of cattle,  not like a few hundred. Maybe if the cattle is on BLM I get to slaughter a cow and keep it for free,  or milk it since I pay taxes too, hence the land is mine as well.

       The idea that land can be payed for and owned is the very problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you buy land then you are buying it from someone who has already taken claim over it. 
You don't "own" anything. You can use things, but that's it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you agree to buy something then you have succumbed to the system of money and ownership.

       Not succumbed, but instead agreed to interact with. I honestly think that money itself and/or the system of it isn't the problem, but instead the problem is individuals abusing said thing and system for their own gain at the expense of the rest of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have tried to figure out a better system than what money provides and I am having trouble finding an alternative that still allows the existence of a global community. We need to figure out how to check irresponsible, self-serving profiteers and keep them from abusing money and the system around it. That is a continual fight as well. There is no one-time solution for checking corruption.

       Even under the feudal system people still had far more free time, kept a greater percentage of the fruits of their labor, and had more guaranteed rights and access to resources than they do now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, a greater percentage of resources, time, and labor is controlled by a much smaller number of people.

       Awesome post! Thank you.. I really wish I had the balls to do that but Im gonna work on it. Spend a week living off thee land. Of course money is always the problem.  Living in NYC is so stifling,,, it sometimes feel like I'm drowning,,, slowly drowning,, bc we are so far removed from nature. When I go out into the woods, or the ocean,, the feeling is really overwhelming.. I love sitting quietly (meditating) in nature, it's indescribable. Its always been that way, probably bc I was raised in NY and have always lived here. tx again for the reminder that indeed many of our cages are illusory,, like the one that keeps my grounded here is rooted in fear.
