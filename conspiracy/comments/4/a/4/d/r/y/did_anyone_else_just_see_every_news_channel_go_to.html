       Yeah I tell my kids the same thing. But there is one small problem, and that is these people who have been doing advertising for so long that they have many little "tricks" to talk to your subconscious even when you aren't paying attention. Darren Brown is a wizard and has shown multiple times that normal everyday people can be hypnotized if you use the right words.

       It's not about the analysis though, it's about showing that you need to question things instead of mindlessly accepting.

       What's so bad about asking family these questions anyway? You're not exactly interrupting anything important, a conversation has a lot more value.

       The only issue is the tendency for people to assume you think of yourself as smarter or above them. If you can frame your questions and statements being careful to make it clear you are sincere, they should be fine discussing things like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had this problem for a few years until i kinda figured it out. It's almost like you are in a different culture. Just be aware of how you are perceived.

       You're not leaving them well-prepared to distinguish those lies when they are later bombarded with them in life when you can't protect what they're exposed to. Willful ignorance and non-participation is not a defense from deception. Awareness and being well-informed is.

       Yeah on Fox when Trump was starting to say to them that the tpp would specifically ruin that state, the reporter butted in the middle of it and sort of took it away from the spotlight. They then brought in Rubio on the phone to talk about it, perfect timing.

       Trump is a real estate mogul, he can't easily relocate his assets. So it may be that the US economy is more important to his personal fortune than it is for financiers who support the TPP and profit from international capital flows.

       He has never been that big for money if you read his book, he just liked the thrill/game of business. Politics is another game for him and the one he wants to win this time is making America great again. He'd make more money if he didn't run, and he gave politicians money for favors because businesses need to do that to do that to be successful. The establishment hates him and is panicking doing anything to make sure he won't win, hillary is not a fan and running against him is not something she'd like to do. He has brought up bills sexual history and won't hesitate to bring up her other stuff and has threatened to do it.

       Any evidence? Legitimately curious but just claims don't seem to make sense.
He has money, and pretty much everyone else with money dislikes what he is doing. He is vocalizing how much the media lies, is saying he is going to publish the 9/11 documents, and is not afraid of exposing every dirty truth against anyone who attacks him. 
If their controlling him it's not very well, or in doing so they are destroying every other method of control. His personality is also extremely prideful and dominant and I don't see him sacrificing his ego for... something? He has money so I don't really see what would motivate him.

       Man I am with you and my hopes lie with this man. I have no evidence and that is why I asked you about it in the first place, to get more info if I could.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me , the only reason I am afraid a bit is because the MEDIA overdoes it with the TRUMP bashing. I am Greek and this summer we had a referendum as to whether we should keep following EU austerity measures or not. The media was clearly and obviously trying to push a YES. So much... that people actually started realizing how fucking rotten these channels are and a lot went to the NO side. Eventually "NO" won with a good number but in the next day the prime minister said YES anyway...
       <br/>
       But on to the subject , that incident made me think if it is possible that the methods of moving public opinion are so sophisticated that these fuckers push people so much and evidently that in the end they drive them to the other direction. Or I just overestimate how smart "these people" are.
      </p>
      <p>
       So this is my sole argument , or the classic divide and conquer method where they control all discourse. Hope I didn't spit out too much shit.

       A good way to look at it is to look at people who manipulate people more openly. George Soros is generally good for that since its open and recent. He is another globalist and is responsible for inflaming and funding black lives matter, fergessun riots, and moveon which was responsible for the recent trump protest. His MO seems to be to get people emotional an excited to divide people, however those groups are generally just making people more against the ideas he is promoting. The protest and attack on trump will do nothing but boost him, and soros openly hates him and has put huge money into stuff that goes against trump so he'd effectively be wasting money. So either he is just wasting money and he wants trump to win and is creating an extreme opposite to make people support him (though everything he has done in life indicates the opposite), he wants the left authoritarian to win but has poor foresight for his actions, or he just doesn't have as much control as he'd like. People under them are likely making decisions and spending money as well which is where the conflict might seem to reasonably arise. Not sure but it is a weird situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       There will always be subordinates making power plays and people trying to earn money for themselves. Fox news recently just did a bit of an expose on george soros so is he just set up to get peoples attention away from what is needed? If so how would they profit off people who want to shrink government and fight against globalism?
Or is there just another person high up but not at the top that has enough power to play things in a different direction.

       It could be because he is a Patriot. When the twin towers fell he was visibly pissed off, and wanted them to rebuilt taller. When he travels around the world, and sees other countries airports bigger, and better than ours it also annoys him. Patriots are a dying breed in this country but Trump is an old man. So who knows.
