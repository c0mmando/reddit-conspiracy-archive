<p>I&#39;m a conspiracy theorist, believing just about everything but flat earth. I&#39;m also a <del>SJW</del>, a person fighting for social equality.  <em>(After discussion I have realized it was a mistake to use this abbreviation because it casts the work of good people in a negative light. Much the way &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; is used in a negative connotation, SJW has a negative connotation.)</em> Vegan. Pro-gun. Anti-violence. Pro-choice. Agnostic. <strong>(Edit)</strong> Anthropogenic Global Warming theory. More I&#39;m sure that I can&#39;t think of to mention at the moment.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll admit I appear on the surface as a bit of a contradiction. There are so many situational variables and intersectionalities in what we believe though. I really think we can unify, multiply and revolutionize the world. If we can sit down and calmly discuss our differences until we find our intersections of beliefs as a whole we can all win.</p>

<p>So where do you stand? List the first 5 or so that come to mind.</p>

<p>Bullshit. Objective truth exists, regardless of if you believe it does and regardless of your feelings on the matter. Compromise is the idiot’s way out. Not coward’s, not sheep’s, not freeman’s–IDIOT’S. The idiot believes that there is a compromise to any or every issue. There isn’t. </p>

<p>There is Truth and there are lies. That’s it. Either accept truth or you don’t matter. That’s a third person generic ‘you’, not <em>you</em> you (unless it applies). Truth will ALWAYS out. Always. That’s why conspiracies can’t stay so forever, and that’s why fakes can always be known.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is also ludicrous. There’s no truth to an exceptionally large number of theories. You don’t believe in Flat Earth, so <em>why</em>?</p>

<p>So you base your beliefs on factual information. This one, at least. So why would you believe in the others, most of which have no such thing? Why do you believe in SJWism when it’s a self-defeating, cognitively dissonant, demonstrably false ideology? Why are you a vegan when reality proves that it is nutritionally deficient? Why are you pro-choice when it’s murder?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. Just criticize my beliefs with out putting any of yours on the table. Nice talking to you. 
<strong>Edit: adding more out of boredom</strong> 
SJW is not a self-defeating ideology, racism and other -isms are very real. In fact racism the largest provable conspiracy of all, SJW is part of proving the conspiracy. Veaganism isn&#39;t nutritionally deficient, lots of body builders are vegan. I defiantly feel healthier and get sick less. Abortion may be murder I can accept that. But I&#39;ll leave that decision to the woman who&#39;s going to be caring for a theoretical child to decide if the child will have a good life or not.</p>

<p>I guess this means you&#39;re a flat earther, white supremacist, who loves to eat steak, and belives they own women&#39;s bodies. Feel free to correct me I&#39;m just assuming based on your criticism of my beliefs.</p>

<p>My definition is something like all Peace, Wisdom and Love.  No Hate, War, Violence, Greed, etc.  And yes, none of the latter would exist, but the former is less important to exist in totality amongst all individuals, since I might still consider a utopic environment if some small percentage are simply apathetically neutral, and do no harm. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a realist, and live with nature. I also know history.</p>

<p>Not sure I understand your last bit, but all I can say is, how does one achieve peace, love, and wisdom, when they are subjective to one&#39;s self? My love, peace, wisdom, may not be the same as yours. Also, violence, greed, war is a part of nature. Live in nature for sometime, and you will see. When looking at a predator like a wolf, are you going to speak kind words? Or, are you going to eliminate it, before it eliminates you? </p>

<p>Figured out what you&#39;re saying I understand incorrectly. <strong>Intersectionality:</strong> is a concept often used in critical theories to describe the ways in which oppressive institutions (racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, xenophobia, classism, etc.) are interconnected and cannot be examined separately from one another..</p>

<p>Also, in every experience I had in public discussions while doing OWS stuff anyone who had something to share was allowed to speak. It wasn&#39;t about race, it was about knowing something about what was being discussed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Critical theory came out of the Frankfort School.  The members infiltrated the highest eschelons of academia to brainwash gullible young kids such as yourself.  It&#39;s not about equal rights, it&#39;s about molding the mobs into a giant blob rather than individuals; it seeks to create the underclass for the ruling class.  And now we&#39;ve just come full circle to my very initial comment.  I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve thought any of this through; you just are doing what you&#39;ve been taught to do in university, which you&#39;re very likely still in.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, fact. Right, could be true; except people have been steadily getting more social equality as time goes on. Making blobs, there&#39;s always been an underclass for the ruling class that&#39;s how hierarchy works. So in a few sentences you think you have proven that &quot;SJWs are useful idiots in undermining the West and lead toward a one world government.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not simply parroting what I learned at university. I&#39;m using an effective strategy that helps reasonable people to discuss problems they have to help work towards a collective solution, because were all fighting against the same power structure.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll ask again. What are you (have you done) doing to correct the problem?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anyone could convince you otherwise so I&#39;m really not going to bother.  If you want more, then you have to meet me halfway by admitting at least some of the problems with the theory.  You have to be honest.</p>

<p>And what problem are you talking about?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem of government oppression of course.</p>

<p>I think you have a gross misunderstanding about what social justice is, and those who fight for it.</p>

<p>&quot;SJW&quot; is used as a way to degrade a community. (I only used the term because it&#39;s a convenient abbreviation, I regret doing this now in the OP.) Much the way &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; is used to degrade people who question the power structure. Just as the case with any group there are of course &quot;useful idiots.&quot; That does not mean anyone who shares similar beliefs is an unthinking fool.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t see any glaring problems with social justice work. Honest. You say it&#39;s leading to a one world government. I could understand how you think that because once there aren&#39;t ethnic, ability or gender divides, what&#39;s to stop people from forming a single world government? This is a reasnable question to ask for the long term. The government created by social justice work this could be beneficial however because it would have been formed by the people. Much the way the constitutional governments were in the beginning of the US&#39;s history. I personally don&#39;t think it would stay that way for long, just like real freedom didn&#39;t last for the US.</p>

<p>I also wouldn&#39;t support any world government, I&#39;m sure few other SJWs would either. Collections of power are inherently dangerous, no one knows this better than &#39;minorities.&#39; But all of that is a long way off. In practice &#39;minorites&#39; are still largely disenfranchised socially, politically and economically. Thus the increase in public action by SJWs. Governments simply are not facilitating the necessary social remediation. They are too busy consolidating military and economic power to be concerned with social ills. Thus the increase in public action by SJWs.</p>

<p>TPP and the like are the things you need to be worrying about creating a world governments. Those wold be nefarious at the outset.</p>

<p>Intersectionality admits the differences honestly so we are aware of the source of the problem, it&#39;s not creating the divides. Those divides existed long before SJWs came into the picture.</p>
