    <div class="md"><p>See this is why this sub annoys me. You have all these theories and what it comes down to is that you believe this shit over the accepted consensus due to your intuition and feelings. That&#39;s no way to form opinions. It&#39;s not like I&#39;m some sheep who follows the &quot;general opinion&quot; either - I love the work of Chomsky, Zimmerman etc, because they have facts and sources and make sense. They don&#39;t just say &quot;the elite does this&quot; &quot;the elite is planning this&quot; &quot;you&#39;r being poisoned by fluoride and I know this because it feels right&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>A Clinton or a Bush would be ideal at this point,  they are already house trained,   know how high to jump and when.</p>

<p>Of course we assume you mean the US,   who would be the next &quot;front man&quot;?  In other words,  its just another plantation.   These guys are already global.    They already transcend any particular nation state.    They already have a global presence.  These guys don&#39;t need passports to get on and off their private jets at their private terminals.    That&#39;s for us peons.</p>

<p>And if the right guy isn&#39;t picked or set up by the supreme court or election fraud,  money can be made with regime change anywhere.    Those with the means have shown they are  perfectly willing to use any means necessary to stay in control.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pick a side and cheer loudly.  Get swept up in the excitement!  Expose the corruption of one candidate or another!  This time the populist candidate I have chosen is different!</p>

<p>Anyone you are hearing about in the mainstream media is just an actor playing his or her role in the show.  A key to controlling the masses is providing the appearance of adversarial conflict.  The science of controlling the masses is fairly well refined at this point.  They know to field a range of &quot;choices&quot; to prop up the illusion.</p>

<p>Sometimes the curtain gets pulled back though.  When it does, don&#39;t forget it and go back to believing in the illusion.  Like when you see the range of politicians that all use Beacon Global Strategies to advise them, these guys: <a href="http://bgsdc.com/team/jeremy-b-bash/">http://bgsdc.com/team/jeremy-b-bash/</a>   Or when Clinton openly tells you that the CFR tells her what to do: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba9wxl1Dmas">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba9wxl1Dmas</a></p>

<p>The surface politics is just a show.  A big, expensive distraction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you explain to me why lung cancer from tobacco is common knowledge? The tobacco industry was one of the most profitable industries IN THE WORLD, before being so heavily taxed it was reaping even more enormous profits than it is now. 60% of the population smoked, they were making enormous enormous amounts of money, and yet even with that crazy amount of money and thus influence and power, we still found out about lung cancer. Why is this? How do you expect people to believe all these conspiracy theories about fundamental facts about the reality of our society when a group as powerful &amp; insanely rich as Big Tobacco couldn&#39;t suppress a simple fact like that? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is your argument against &#39;conspiracy theories&#39; in general?  </p>

<p>Tobacco enjoyed a long life with a perception as a beneficial product despite knowledge of its effects long before those restrictions came in.  It was given as part of soldiers rations.  We can look at a number of other products that are at various stages of going through this process.  For example: lead paint, asbestos, glyphosate, fluoridated water, vaccines.  Consider for a moment how you feel about each of those products.  At one point lead paint was considered safe.  Parents were blamed for poorly behaving children who were acting out due to lead poisoning.  The key thing to take from this is that the generally perceived public perception for these things changed over time.  Therefore at some point the perception must have been wrong because the product had the same hazards through the process of public perception changing.</p>

<p>At this point we are awash in a sea of glyphosate.  It has been a huge experiment.  But it has just come out recently that the EPA knew in 1981 that there was a link between glyphosate and cancer: <a href="http://www.theecologist.org/blogs_and_comments/Blogs/2915559/monsanto_and_epa_knew_of_glyphosate_cancer_link_in_1981.html">http://www.theecologist.org/blogs_and_comments/Blogs/2915559/monsanto_and_epa_knew_of_glyphosate_cancer_link_in_1981.html</a>  How many years of mass exposure to that garbage?  How slowly are we withdrawing from it?</p>

<p>The problem with classing a set of ideas as &#39;conspiracy theories&#39; and then seeing those ideas as false is that the ideas themselves never need be examined.  All that is necessary is to apply the label.  But who gets to apply it?  There is a huge issue with deciding that the mainstream perception on everything is correct: mainstream opinion is manufacturable.  To see this we don&#39;t have to consult any conspiracy source, plenty of people in &#39;legitimate&#39; positions write books on the techniques of creating public opinions.  A good place to start if you are interested is &#39;Propaganda&#39; by Edward Bernays: <a href="http://www.whale.to/b/bernays.pdf">http://www.whale.to/b/bernays.pdf</a>  Bernays worked in the Administration of Woodrow Wilson during WW1 directing propaganda to get the American population interested in fighting.  He lays things out plainly for us:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country.</p>

<p>We are governed, our minds molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The thing is that it is not an either or proposition.  Most of alternative news and prominent conspiracy personalities are controlled opposition.  They mix truth with lies for various manipulative purposes.  For a person who realizes that CNN is selling them lies, but then sees Alex Jones ranting about nonsense, there is a good chance that they will return to CNN.  But Alex Jones is just the most obvious example of controlled opposition.  </p>

<p>It is psychologically uncomfortable to not be sure, to exist in a state of uncertainty about major things that make up our picture of the world.  The mainstream version provides a foundation to believe in, with social reward mechanisms for doing so, but every once in a while you will see something that you know is not right.  Pay attention to the mental gymnastics you do in order to preserve your world view when that happens.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>See this is why this sub annoys me. You have all these theories and what it comes down to is that you believe this shit over the accepted consensus due to your intuition and feelings. That&#39;s no way to form opinions. It&#39;s not like I&#39;m some sheep who follows the &quot;general opinion&quot; either - I love the work of Chomsky, Zimmerman etc, because they have facts and sources and make sense. They don&#39;t just say &quot;the elite does this&quot; &quot;the elite is planning this&quot; &quot;you&#39;r being poisoned by fluoride and I know this because it feels right&quot;. You know what I mean? </p>
