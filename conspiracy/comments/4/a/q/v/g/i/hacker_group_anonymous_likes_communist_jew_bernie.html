       Gutted the audit the FED (The Central Bank) bill (Ron Paul's bill), supports Zionist Jewish Supremacy in Israel (lied about not knowing what Zionism was), and lived on a Kibbutz in Israel? That the Jew we are talking about? If so, I don't really think he needs to visit AIPAC to show his loyalty. Plus why would another Jew need to ass kiss other Jews. Goyim ass kiss.

       He's a Washington insider (career politician). He's knows where the bread a butter comes from. He's all hot air. Bark, no bite. I'm not for anyone. This whole thing is a kabuki theatre. I just feel the need to bring honesty into all this. I feel obligated to my fellow country men/women.

       Facts are welcome and appreciated, but ultimately as the only 'vote' that would matter is a country-wide strike and total withdrawal of taxes allied to a truly massive Washington protest a la Brasil until a viable third party unallied to the bankers/MIC is in power it's probably of little import to your countrymen. Just vote for the puppet who says what you want to hear, as usual, that'll definitely fix things this time.

       Yeah, mate. I'm not sure what the answer is. All I know is that it's not Bernie or Trump (or any politician for that matter). Not sure how it all plays out. I'm just trying to bring reason/honesty/truth into the discussion for those who may have their heads 1/2 in the sand (in the US). I understand your lack of knowledge because I know you're a red coat ;)

       Tea with a good slug of whiskey maybe, beer works for me too though :) I don't think anyone is entirely free of the machinations of The City, those who fix the markets run the markets after all. Russia and China are probably going to end their shit eventually though if you ask me.

       Jacks, when you attack other peoples' claims and insert your own without providing any links/evidence for either, do you think you look intelligent? Why not post a link to an article where Ron Paul said that? I'm not doubting it exists, I am just asking you to back up your own claims with evidence when you attack other people's

       I am also speaking generally, though. You are so quick to attack people and often don't back up your claims or attacks on the claims of others with actual evidence, preferring personal insults. That seems to be a common theme by regulars here towards natural conspiracy skeptics.

      <p>
       My post was not purposely misleading or dishonest and I didn't tell any lies or commit slander. Talk about overstating things. I read your comment thread in here with the British guy and it was all about belittling him, without backing up your thoughts or attacking his with any real evidence.

       Interesting question, but it's not relevant to the fact that Bernie Sanders is a reliable Zionist/pro-AIPAC vote and that Sanders has spent his entire, decades long career as a Washington insider funneling the tax money of working class Americans to the rather wealthy Zionist entity.
      </p>

       No wonder Sanders wants to raise taxes - that way, he can send even
       <em>

       of American's tax money to the foreign state of Israel.

       Trump and Clinton are both just as bad as Sanders when it comes to the Israel lobby - yes, that is correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sanders has proven - by his record - that he has zero interest in taking on the Israel lobby, nor doing anything substantive for the working class. Sure, he wants to raise taxes - so he can send more money to Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sanders and Clinton are both for disenfranchising the working class with mass immigration of cheap labor. At least Trump is against that. Plus, Trump and Sanders are far better than Clinton on trade deals.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Sanders' bad qualities far outweigh his good qualities (the few that there are) and it's all irrelevant because he isn't going to win, he's going to drop out and endorse Hillary, because that is the kind of conventional, political shill that Bernie Sanders actually is.

       He doesn't appear to be on great terms with the Netenyahu camp to me and described the recent Gaza atrocities as 'overreacting' which is about as close to a criticism as I'd expect from an American politician of
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       background.
       <br/>
       I actually wonder if he's been given the nod to hang on rather than drop out as the FBI are eroding Hillary's trust level slowly but surely and just might get something to stick to the teflon bitch. I still think Trump would probably win ultimately though as he's the one saying what most people really want to hear.

       you might want to check again, because "Anonymous" isn't some consistent group with a unified ideology, it's a stupid label that many people use for a bunch of stupid videos and publicity stunts.

       Its sickening that we finally get a real person to run. A genuine, honest, human being who's been talking about the disenfranchised WORKING CLASS, for 30 years.. And you people try to slander him with "COMMUNIST" and "JEW". Communism was the antithesis of the corrupt system you people claim to be against, and yeah the Zionist regime of Israel is a serious problem for humanity, but Bernie Sanders has absolutely zero connection to any of the evils you speak of.

       Like I said before, socialism =/= communism. I am well informed on both, thanks. Kind of like how every Jewish person isn't automatically a Zionist, and not every tragedy is a false flag. And not every black protester is a terrorist.

       Are you high? Socialism is the stepping stone to communism (that's its purpose!). Read Marx. But you wont, you'll just listen to the professor and your edgy college mates. Enjoy your frap. Educate yourself. I encourage responsible drinking and weed smoking, but don't let it retard you....

       Yeah I do, but you don't appear to. You keep equivocating and are unwilling to say that socialism and communism are the same thing. Yeah it's a step towards that just like weed is a step towards heroin. Most people that dabble in weed won't die of a heroin overdose alone in their apartment.

       My original comment was that socialism =/= communism, a basic concept to most people. You seemed to disagree pretty strongly but never denied the truth of my original comment - every post was some combo of strong disagreement+equivocation+personal insult+qualification of your point (socialism leads to communism so it's the same thing!)

       You are repeatedly trying to assert a point that we don't disagree on as if it contradicts what I originally said. I'm not the one being dense.

       I view Socialism as the step to Communism about the same way as I view marijuana as the step to heroin. The statement has some merit especially ideologically, but in reality rarely leads to the feared outcome, and is primarily used now as a rhetorical device. No one would say marijuana is heroin, and people shouldn't interchange socialist and communist, it is misleading.

       If you have a gold standard you limit your economy to the value of all the gold in the world. Or the price of gold varies soo vastly that we cant produce electronics or power systems with consistent or even even feasible cost.

       Bernie calls himself a "Socialist," he praised the Communist regime in Cuba, the Communist regime in Nicaragua (the Bernie Bros call themselves "Sandernistas") and he honeymooned in the Soviet Union.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bernie Sanders calls HIMSELF a "Jew" and said his identification was important to him. He has also spent his entire decades long career as a Washington insider funneling the tax money of working class Americans to the apartheid regime of Jew bigotry in Zionist-occupied Palestine and has a virtually 100% pro-Israel voting record.
      </p>
      <p>
       So - what are you complaining about? "Communist Jew" is an accurate description of Bernie Sanders.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A genuine, honest, human being who's been talking about the disenfranchised WORKING CLASS, for 30 years.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       He's NOT honest, he's NOT genuine, and all he has done is TALK - at least when it comes to working class Americans.
      </p>
      <p>
       When it comes to wealthy foreign Israelis, Sanders has actually delivered for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is sickening is you trying to purposefully deceive people about Bernie Sanders.

       He went against Israel more then any other politician you are a liar. Praising a leaders policies, HONEYMOONING SOMEWHERE, and having supporters call make a funny name out of a old freedom fighting group is somehow evil and a secret tell for how he is bad? You clowns are really messed up in the head. It's sad, even the "awake" types just can't figure it out... You just don't get it.. Idk if it's that you haven't been in the street, or in a poor area, or in a workplace, or generally experienced life.. So you sit home and act conspiratorial and fuck yourself over by attacking the only Jew who isn't owned by Israel? And you STILL don't know what communism is? WTF?? The Cold War propaganda STILL HAS YOU BRAINWASHED HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE. M O R O N forreal.   Show me anywhere, literally anywhere, one second of footage that shows Bernie as a stooge for the eiite, or special interests, or any controlling entity.. PLEASE.   Otherwise FOH because your ruining this for all of us.  You are the type who would have called OCCUPY WALL ST communist If a real revolution would have taken place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone wants revolution.. When movements spring up, when a honest leader comes around, you commit counter revolutionary acts. If you were Cuban you would have fled and been a wannabe capitalist.

       What is communism? Feeding your family?  Affordable education? Being healthy? WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU DEVILS WANT. HOLY FUCK I WANT TO JUST BREAK DOWN IN TEARS WHEN I SEE PEOPLE LIKE YOU. DONT YOU GET IT????! WE AEE DYING IN THIS ECONOMIC WARZONE. CHILDREN ARE BEING RIPPED APART OVERSEAS. WE ARE FUCKING STARVING. PLEASE GOD PLEASE WAKE UP AND HELP YOUR GODDAMN COMMUNITY PLEASE.
      </p>
      <p>
       WE CANT DO IT WITHOUT YOU. YOU CANT BE ADVERSARIAL TO ALL POSITIVE CHANGE IN THE SOCIAL ORDER. ITS THE POOR VS THE RICH. YOU ARE WORKING FOR THE RICH.. HOW CAN YOU BE SO MORALLY BANKRUPT AND BRAINWASHED BY ANTI FREEDOM PROPAGANDA. IF YOU WORK 40 HOURS YOU DESERVE A BASIC STANDARD OF LIVING PLEASE DONT TAKE THAT AWAY FROM THE KIDS IN THE STREET WHO ARE FIGHTING THE HI TECH RIOT COPS THAT YOU ACT AS AN AGENT FOR.

       There, you see how stupid your comment really was? If I were you, I'd delete it, to spare yourself any further embarrassment.
