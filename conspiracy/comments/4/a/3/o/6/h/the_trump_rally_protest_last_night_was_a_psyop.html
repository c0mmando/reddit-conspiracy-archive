        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">865</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-03-12 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Love_And_Light33.html">Love_And_Light33</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A “Planned Event” happened last night, when thousands of Chicagoans covertly organized to disrupt a Donald Trump rally hosted on the UIC campus. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTEbEEwoJg">Video link with police scanner audio, for those who missed it.</a> (1:12:00 is when someone tells the crowd the rally has been postponed and the action starts).</p>

<p>Incidentally, I was a couple miles away in the Loop, for reasons completely unrelated to Trump. I wasn&#39;t close enough to witness the event, so this isn&#39;t really relevant to my analysis, but the news immediately caught everyone&#39;s attention and dominated our discussion into the early hours of the morning. It seemed to catch attention nationwide with similar speed.</p>

<p>Before I comment on why this is a psychological operation executed by the deep state, it&#39;s important to see how each mainstream news channel presented the event in a different way to polarize their viewers. </p>

<p>Fox News&#39; footage was pretty “Fair and Balanced”, in that <a href="http://video.foxnews.com/v/4797793851001/we-stopped-trump-protesters-declare-victory/?intcmp=hpbt1#sp=show-clips">they showed the footage of protesters physically and verbally assaulting people</a>. I don&#39;t know how much of the protest was actually aggressive, but whats relevant is what the people watching on their TVs at home see and think. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s some<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Nw405j2hOQ"> protesters interrupting a Fox interview with a Trump supporter.</a></p>

<p>As an important side note, see how they link MoveOn.org to being involved in the organization of the protest...</p>

<p>MoveOn.org&#39;s “Executive Director of Political Action” <a href="http://front.moveon.org/moveon-trumps-hate-filled-rhetoric-on-notice-after-tonights-event/#.VuQHQh8SxNw">responded to the protests with an aggressive statement that read</a>, in part:</p>

<p>“To all of those who took to the streets of Chicago, we say thank you for standing up and saying enough is enough. To Donald Trump, and the GOP, we say, welcome to the general election. Trump and those who peddle hate and incite violence have no place in our politics and most certainly do not belong in the White House.”</p>

<p>Interestingly, this 29 year old “Executive Director” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilyasheyman">has a linkdin showing that he worked</a> as a “Senior Account Exectutive” at Watershed Company in 2006, at the age of 23.. Edit: I need to research this point more before coming to a conclusion on it</p>

<p>Back to the mainstream media... </p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/11/politics/donald-trump-chicago-protests/index.html#">CNN showed milder parts of the protests for much of their broadcast</a>. It seemed that Don Lemon was trying to justify the actions of the protesters as a response to Trump related intolerance.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/gop-candidates-accuse-donald-trump-encouraging-violence-rallies">MSNBC&#39;s main page has much less mention of the protests and focuses on a headline titled</a>: “GOP candidates accuse Donald Trump of Encouraging Violence”</p>

<p>This is such a small unimportant part of the event to focus on, it is surreal to think that a portion of the population have no actual idea of what happened other than that it must be Trumps fault somehow. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Fox News viewers are in fits over flag stomping, violence against cops, etc...</p>

<p>This vast difference in information consumption and feedback between certain groups in this country has already become dangerous, as last night showed, and it will soon become explosive. The hate between Bernie/Clinton supporters and Trump supporters, and vice versa, is radicalizing both sides. </p>

<p>Social media is a good way to see this unfold, where the content is unfiltered. Read through <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a>. The top post is a police officer with a bloodied face from a protester. Evidence of protesters alternating between “Bernie!” chants and “Fuck Trump” chants. Its totally understandable that a Trump supporter is going to feel justified in attending their next rally armed and prepared to scuffle as protests against their rallies spread and grow.</p>

<p>On the other side, the anger and hate towards Trump in Chicago is organic. The Chicago Police Department have been staging executions in the streets, most recently with the Laquan McDonald murder (another PSYOP) which is still very fresh here in this city. They cull the population through incarceration, permanently damaging communities. But they are being duped into taking this legitimate anger out on Trump.</p>

<p>The protests, on the other hand, were not organic. It has been standard operating procedure of the CIA and FBI to plant assets in leading counterculture movements since their inception, so they&#39;ve had lots of practice to prepare. This time, they are using MoveOn.org (likely not alone, but the only confirmed link I&#39;ve come across) as a means of organizing, funding and promoting aggressive protests that are bound to turn violent and backfire on any liberal cause.</p>

<p>There are two candidates in the election who would oppose the TPP, a corporate coup disguised as a free trade bill, who have pledged to get money out of elections, who would help break down the two party system, and expose establishment secrets. These two candidates are, of course, Trump and Bernie, and the powers that be have successfully tricked their followers into hating each other instead of working together to investigate the covert network of psychopaths that comprise the deep state. </p>

<p>Its one big game of distraction and subversion, and its working.</p>

<p>The chosen candidate is Hillary Clinton, and she is nearly a lock for the nomination. It is possible I&#39;ll eat my words as there are always 5 backup plans in place in case things go awry for the deep state, but this PSYOP is designed radicalize the opposition so she looks fresh and clean for the general. It is also setting the stage for potential assassinations. After a few violent protests, the American public would easily swallow the idea of a radical leftist assassinating Trump or a neo-nazi assassinating Sanders. Of course, it was the deep state that would have done it, but they always plan ahead to cover their tracks. </p>

<p>Last nights protest is The Powers That Be making a move and setting the stage. Shit is about to hit the fan. They need to act within the next couple months or these anti-establishment sentiments will reach critical mass. They will have to use every trick in the book: school shootings, false flag terror, market meltdown, international crises, etc to pull off their plan. And in order to do so, they need to keep the citizens distracted by fighting each other, especially those who are waking up to the corruption of the establishment and could wake up to deeper understandings in the near future.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t fall for it!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And if you watch the news, this is going to actually help Trump - all Fox was saying last night was &quot;Trump is great, Trump is good, poor, poooooor Mr. Trump having to deal with protests! They&#39;re so violent! Look, that sign has the F-word on it! Gasp! The thugs!&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, MSNBC went the other way, highlighting Trump&#39;s daily goading of his supporters into violence, and CNN took the middle path.</p>

<p>Playbook.</p>

<p>The goal is to get Trump galvanized among the Fox-watchers, who can be cantankerous, and may vote for Trump out of spite and the constant diet of pap propaganda they&#39;re being fed...thereby making Trump the nominee - who will be easily trounced by Clinton (if he doesn&#39;t bail out first after winning the nomination, as it&#39;s not really crazy conspiracy theory to believe Clinton &amp; Trump had this cooked up from the get-go. Trump only entered the fray, after all, after a phonecall from his good buddy Bill, remember?).</p>

<p>Wake up, Republicans...and vote in the primaries for whoever makes sense to push out that coward (and Liberal, do your homework, y&#39;all) Trump, for fuck&#39;s sake, unless you want President Clinton in the White House!</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>An edit for education and for those who may not believe me:</strong> Do you know <em>why</em> Reddit has been flooded with users who claim to be Trump fans but are actually more likely to be Hillary operatives? </p>

<p><a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/poll-bernie-sanders-better-than-hillary-clinton-against-donald-trump">This is why.</a>. Double-digit lead for Hillary over Trump, much higher than any other matchup. For those who may want to dig into the data further, <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html">here&#39;s a list of multiple poll matchups</a>.</p>

<p><em>(And check the Kasich-Clinton matchup for the reason we&#39;re finally starting to see attacks on that guy.)</em></p>

All of the other candidates are part of the usual crop and will keep the fleecing operation running for as long as possible.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll make it to the Presidency, I&#39;m fully convinced (more and more each day, last night really cemented it) that he&#39;s a Clinton plant. The goal is to get him to the Primary in one piece, then all the stuff the media&#39;s been ignoring will be pulled full-force to create an &quot;inevitable&quot; Clinton Presidency.</p>

<p>One of the reasons I&#39;m so vocal here is because I see a way out of it, but we&#39;re nearing the finish line on an out. The way out of it is to ensure that neither Clinton nor Trump win their primaries. And that can only happen if people shake the cobwebs out of their heads and educate themselves about what&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>Then ask yourself, what is more likely?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never saw this. The media cartel just ignored Bernie, period, from the start. And whenever they couldn&#39;t ignore him - ie, he won states on the same day as Clinton, or he was in a debate with her - she always got the headlines for winning, regardless of reality.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see using Trump as a distraction because the only people who recognize Bernie&#39;s legitimacy are those who already also recognize big media&#39;s extreme corruption.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But they already distract you from real news with any number of bullshit time sinks on MSM. They don&#39;t need a presidential candidate to do it. Trump, to them, is just free ratings money, because unlike most of the banal shit they pitch to the ignorant as real news he actually gets people watching because hes so bombastic.</p>

<p>Like I said, Clinton is in the pocket of the ownership class that owns MSM, so of course they hate Bernie. But they do their best work when they ignore reality and as Trump has demonstrated amongst the Republicans the best propaganda is to not talk about your problem (Bernie) at all. The opposite is true with Trump, where any news is good news for his appeal to hatred.</p>

<p>The powers that be <em>want</em> you to think Hillary has a better shot at beating Trump because...

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s another conspiratorial aspect that just occurred to me - all of the other Republican nominees claimed during debates and otherwise to back Trump should he win the nomination...</p>

<p>...but after last night, both Rubio and Kasich are backing off:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/6e62fbd2d1f2495fb7d3d5abcde1bc93">Rubio said it was &quot;getting harder every day&quot; to keep his word. Kasich said the &quot;toxic environment&quot; Trump is creating &quot;makes it very, extremely difficult&quot; to support him.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it serves another purpose, to allow the Republican establishment to reasonably extricate themselves from the circus.</p>

<p>I dunno what&#39;s true or what&#39;s not, what&#39;s a plot and what isn&#39;t, and what&#39;s just a convenient out, but it&#39;s interesting to look at who all benefits.</p>

<p>Look, I can&#39;t tell you who to vote for, for one thing, I&#39;m not quite sure myself besides NOT Trump, NOT Clinton - but my friend, you really have educate yourself on this guy. It&#39;s a quick Google away - all the information in the world at your fingertips...and I guarantee you, so much dirt it&#39;ll make your head spin. I mean, there&#39;s a story every day about some fucked up thing he&#39;s done, the media brings it up, laughs, and moves on...they want to make it through the primaries with all the wonderful revenue the Trump Circus brings in, they can&#39;t get enough of him and they oh-so-want him to win the primary - and if he makes the Primary, they&#39;ll pull it out and look at it all to ensure their girl wins the day.</p>

<p>Please do your homework, this guy is going to make big fools of everyone by the time he&#39;s through. I know I don&#39;t want to be one of &#39;em.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really equatable - Romney vs. Obama in debate was fairly tame (basically, &quot;I&#39;ll blow people up.&quot; &quot;Well, I&#39;ll blow MORE people up.&quot; &quot;I&#39;ll surveill people.&quot; &quot;Oh yeah? I&#39;ll surveill MORE people.&quot;). As a bystander, I couldn&#39;t really tell the difference between their policies in the debate, so I voted third party. I wonder how many are like me, and that&#39;s why Romney lost.</p>

<p>Right about now, Romney&#39;s looking pretty good to a lot of people. :/ Hell, four more years of Dronebama looks good compared to Hitlery or Dump. I&#39;ve kind of wondered if that was the plan all along, a dark horse at the last minute, Biden looks like a genius next to Trump and non-corrupt compared to Clinton (he is corrupt and a dufus, but comparatively, he&#39;s looking better). Then Romney, damn, let&#39;s just coronate the man, he looks fiiiiiiiine compared to all of them. But I dunno, I feel like they&#39;ve been trial ballooning him and it&#39;s not going well <em>at all.</em> The GOP deserves this, even if the American people don&#39;t, they should have sucked it up and rallied around a reasonable candidate, even if he or she  wasn&#39;t fully-owned, the second it became apparent that their boy Bush wasn&#39;t going to fly.</p>

<p>You watch this stuff long enough and it becomes obvious that our political powerplayers care more for their own pockets than the state of the country. It&#39;s demoralizing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You raise a good point. Especially when viewing the whole &quot;Obama-care&quot; fiasco. It&#39;s interesting to note that &quot;Obama-Care&quot; was based off of policy Romney implemented during his time in office. </p>

<p>Call it opinion but I just felt that it was blatantly apparent that Romney was the &quot;Money&quot; candidate and that&#39;s really why he failed. He wasn&#39;t able to hide his backers like Obama was. </p>

<p>There&#39;s scuttlebutt going around that the Koch family is preparing a major strike against Trump in the form of Romney making a comeback. As I&#39;ve stated previously, I would rather keep the status quo than have someone like Trump in office. Fuck, I&#39;d rather vote for Romney that see Trump take the White House. The guy is a fucking maniac and a terrible business man. </p>

<p>As far as what you said about the candidates caring more for their pocketbooks than their own country, yeah, well, welcome to past 20 years of American politics, my friend. It&#39;s really shitty, but America isn&#39;t a country, it&#39;s a business. A business of war, prison and pharmaceutical drugs. Call me jaded but I don&#39;t blame them. I see it for what it is. Hillary may be a war criminal but she knows how to handle the leaders of other countries. She can deal with geopolitics. Sanders is good with the domestic issues but I worry about how he&#39;ll deal with Israel and western Europe. Rubio, I can say I&#39;m not too educated on. Bush I&#39;d have confidence in because of his family connections and Kasich seems like a very bland Libertarian candidate so there&#39;s not much more to say on that. </p>

No again, there&#39;s too much American credit and credit card debit based in that country, they wouldn&#39;t dare kill their cash cow. China won&#39;t be a threat for at least another 10 years.

She represents herself and the aims of her buddies, cronies, and donors, nothing more and demonstrably nothing less. I have not seen that the aims of these &quot;powers&quot; align to benefit the people of the United States or the rest of the world.</p>

<p>In real life, though, the people I know voting Bernie would never vote for Clinton. The people I know who <em>would</em> vote for Clinton voted for her in the primaries. I was kind of disappointed, there were people I was sure would vote Bernie and instead went Clinton because party-line.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dunno, people really, really, really hate Clinton. Like, to the point of not voting. Unfortunately, I think that&#39;s what the Clinton campaign counts on, which is why they keep pushing that &quot;Sanders has no chance because delegates&quot; trope in the media (even right-wing media, as we had family ask about it - they just assumed Hillary was winning because the media coverage said so, and all they follow are right-wing sources) - which is false, she had the superdelegates at the outset in 2008, too. They pledge, but that doesn&#39;t mean they stay loyal to that pledge should the popular vote go the other way, witness Obama. Thinking about it, maybe that&#39;s why Trump as opponent. Hillary does well in primaries when people stay home. But she&#39;s got way more votes than Trump now, even with her low turnout - but if they feel she&#39;s in jeopardy, they play up the &quot;Oh no, not Trump!&quot; to get people out to vote for her as the anti-Trump...my lord, what weaving.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The “Bernie or Bust” movement would counter this assumption, and recent polls say that over a third of Berniecrats would not support Clinton in the general election.  People that are drawn to Bernie are not standard Democrats, and many of his supporters dislike Clinton for the same reasons that Republicans and Independents dislike her.  If he is just “sheep dogging” younger voters, it’s backfiring big time, since he can still win this thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it ironic that the Left is framing Trump as an &quot;inciter of violence&quot; when the reality is: It&#39;s not Trump supporters disrupting Democratic rallies; it&#39;s Democratic operatives disrupting Trump events.</p>

<p>So Trump is supposed to passively let it happen, right?</p>

<p>When two brutes assaulted a female Trump supporter and Trump egged the audience on as these people were ejected, that was &quot;Trump inciting violence,&quot; right?</p>

<p>He was just supposed to allow his supporters to be assaulted and not let the police take the provocateurs away.</p>

<p>What we&#39;re watching is hypocrisy on a monumental level. Progressives are claiming the right to adopt brownshirt tactics and disrupt Trump events (even while Trump supporters DO NOT do anything comparable to Democratic rallies).</p>

<p>So you have the predator masquerading as the victim.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, boo-hoo! Trump allowed the police to take away two thugs who assaulted a female Trump supporter . . . he&#39;s just supposed to passively let it happen. Like Bernie did when the Black Lives Matter activists bullied him off the stage. WE&#39;RE supposed to get to bully people. Not anyone else. And who cares if we&#39;re doing it to him, and he&#39;s not doing it at our rallies! We&#39;re the victim here!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re missing most of the picture here. If you watch the tapes, in fact, it&#39;s the supporters cowardly attacking protesters (some of whom not even protesting, just committing the sin of being Black at a Trump rally, which is insanity, utter insanity).</p>

<p>I find it interesting that you don&#39;t mention that Trump&#39;s own campaign manager assaulted a reporter. Trump hasn&#39;t done shit about that except basically claim she&#39;s a lying, crazy bitch (while cowardly avoiding confronting the male witness, naturally - because like all bullies, he&#39;s a coward, and it&#39;s easy for him to attack women but he&#39;s too chicken shit to go after men - when he has to do that, he sics someone else on them).</p>

<p>It must be hard to contort so much to defend this coward. He has no honor, he has no integrity, he is not a man, and he for shit ain&#39;t a conservative. Wake up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I&#39;m terrified of a Clinton presidency.</p>

<p>Trump is the ticket to a Clinton presidency. </p>

<p>He&#39;ll never make President, he&#39;s a grade-A moron, I actually feel kind of sorry for him. If he ever dd get there, which he likely has no intention of doing, otherwise he wouldn&#39;t also be selling steaks and wine and timeshares while campaigning, hello military coup. But if he wins the primary, hello President Clinton.</p>

<p>[Edit: And I think I have a right to have some emotion when I see a bunch of astroturfers probably paid by Hillary infesting the sub with playbook propaganda to ensure Trump wins the Republican primary. I don&#39;t want to have to move to Mexico, thank you very much, I like it here. If Clinton becomes President, it&#39;s only a matter of time.]</p>

Bill won the 1992 election from Bush because of Ross Perot, who stole about 19% of the votes, letting Clinton win with less than 50%.  I believe Trump is basically Ross Perot 2.0.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d step back and look at the facts:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Trump entered the race &quot;after a phone call with Bill Clinton.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Trump and the Clintons are close friends.</p></li>
<li><p>Trump continues to use his rallies and speeches as advertising platforms for his products.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>He loves to win and hates to lose, so he wants to win something - the Primary, I&#39;m sure. Clinton will ensure that he&#39;s compensated quite handsomely. Also, he will probably ensure it, as dollars to donuts he&#39;s got good dirt on Bill based on the Epstein-Lolita Express connection.</p>

<p>It kills me how many people here, on a conspiracy theory subreddit, take everything the media feeds them at face value.</p>

<p>There&#39;s checkers and chess being played. It looks like checkers, but it&#39;s so that we don&#39;t see the chess.</p>

<p>(Note,although he is winning the Primary he also doesn&#39;t have the votes on basic numbers for the General - I wish people who think he has a real chance would actually look at the real vote numbers out there in the primary, which predict which side might win in the General.)</p>

<p>We shouldn&#39;t fall for it.</p>

<p>__</p>

<p>And edit for those kids playing at home, just a note to pay attention to Reddit and comments to see if you see this, too:</p>

<p>If you say something anti-Trump, you&#39;ll eventually get a downvote or two. If you say something anti-Trump and anti-Hillary, you get a few more - immediately. Specifically, anything referring to Trump being a Clinton trojan horse gets double-downvoted to -1 almost immediately. It&#39;s so transparent, but kind of hilarious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump&#39;s campaign manager did NOT assault a reporter. A secret service agent pulled her back, and she misidentified him as the campaign manager, because the two had close-cropped hair-cuts and were in suits.</p>

<p>Breitbart (the news source that employed the reporter) just admitted that she was mistaken and walked back the story: <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/03/11/trump-presser-ben-terris-misidentified/">http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/03/11/trump-presser-ben-terris-misidentified/</a></p>

<p>So there you have it: narrative debunked.</p>

<p>So now that that talking-point is in the garbage, what are we left with?</p>

<p>We&#39;re left with two irrefutable facts: 1) Trump supporters are NOT outside of Bernie or Hillary campaigns, trying to intimidate people walking in. And 2) Trump supporters do NOT pepper Hillary&#39;s crowds to disrupt her events. That would be &quot;Black Lives Matter&quot; and &quot;Move-On.org,&quot; two George Soros-funded front groups.</p>

<p>Only one side here is acting like brownshirts. And hint: It isn&#39;t Trump supporters.</p>

<p>(Give me a call back when massive crowds of Trump supporters are outside a Hillary event. When that happens, then you&#39;ll have a leg to stand on.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that&#39;s the article that Breitbart&#39;s spokesman resigned over, he said it&#39;s a lie. And it&#39;s the most pretzelly bullshit I ever read. Good job, slaves and tools, making yourselves look like fools for such cowardly weaklings like Trump and Lewandowski AKA Clinton, that&#39;s going to be rich when they realize Trump played them for Clinton, egad.</p>

<p>The video was released after that smear job by Breitbart (shame on them for lacking balls to defend their own reporters) that shows Lewandowski reached for her. And Terris confirms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wrong! Breitbart JUST posted a retraction [that I linked to], saying &quot;The Scrum: Video Suggests that WAPO Reporter Ben Terris Misindetifies Lewandowski in Fields Incident&quot;.</p>

<p>Go to the website and scroll down the task bar on the right side of the screen.</p>

<p>You will see that exact headline.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s campaign manager Lewandowski was on the wrong side to have touched the girl. He was separated from her by several people. You know who was <em>right</em> next to her? The secret service agent.</p>

<p>Breitbart concluded that the footage [and still photos] demonstrate that the reporter misidentified Lewandowski based on the fact that he and the secret service agent both had suits and close-cropped hair. Trump&#39;s campaign manager was NOT physically in a position to do what the reporter claimed--though the secret service agent <em>was</em>.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a direct quote from their retraction: <em>&quot;Given the similarity in appearance between Lewandowski and the security official, and given the fact that Lewandowski was walking on the other side of Trump from where Fields was at the time, the possibility of mistaken identity cannot be ruled out. Indeed, given Lewandowski’s adamant denials, it is the likeliest explanation.&quot;</em></p>

<p>So drop the debunked &quot;Trump&#39;s evil henchmen&quot; narrative.</p>

<p>It&#39;s over.</p>

<p>You lose.</p>

<p>Now make up some other propaganda talking-points. Because this one is dead. The magazine that broke the story just retracted it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s debunked because I gave you a link to Breitbart retracting it. I gave you the headline, and I gave you a direct quote.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t ask you to &quot;take my word for it&quot;. I gave you sources and citations.</p>

<p>Now go click the link I gave you to Breitbart and read the retraction they gave.</p>

<p>Breitbart concluded that Lewandowski was misidentified.</p>

<p>THEY concluded that. Not I.</p>

<p>Since you clearly missed it the first time, here&#39;s how they ended the article: &quot;Given the similarity in appearance between Lewandowski and the security official, and given the fact that Lewandowski was walking on the other side of Trump from where Fields was at the time, the possibility of mistaken identity cannot be ruled out. Indeed, given Lewandowski’s adamant denials, it is the likeliest explanation.&quot; </p>

<ul>
<li>Footnote: For the last nail in the coffin, see video directly contradicting the &quot;He-threw-me-down&quot; narrative, decisively ending what can now definitively be called a hoax: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NoMPxomjiw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NoMPxomjiw</a> Not only should the &quot;journalists&quot; be fired for this; they should be sued for libel in open court for attempting to character assassinate Mr. Lewandowski to advance a political agenda. They manufactured a fake story. That should not be tolerated, or go without consequences.</li>

<p>An article so full of bullshit that their own spokesman quit over it.</p>

<p>Just because Megyn Kelly obeyed her masters and moved the segment to 3AM doesn&#39;t mean the story&#39;s dead. Just because the media is too in-the-bag for Clinton to ask Trump about the charges filed in Jupiter against Lewandowski doesn&#39;t mean the story&#39;s dead. It <em>will</em> be revived if Trump wins the Primary, all this stuff the media is ignoring right now will go front-and-center to ensure Clinton wins.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, me too. I&#39;ve been getting a bit pissy around here because there&#39;s so much of it...</p>

<p>So, first of all, remember when he flipped out on Megyn Kelly? I don&#39;t think it was because of her question about his treatment of women - right before he flipped out, she asked, &quot;Mr. Trump, for how long have you been a Republican?&quot; and he flipped out, totally avoiding the question.</p>

<p>If you read his words, it&#39;s funny, you may not be able to tell the difference between him and Sanders - in fact, a few weeks ago, some talking head read some words and asked what he thought of them, he thought they were <em>his</em> words and assented as to how great they were...but they were Sanders&#39;</p>

<p>There&#39;s this: <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/08/bill-clinton-called-donald-trump-before-presidential-run-2016">http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/08/bill-clinton-called-donald-trump-before-presidential-run-2016</a></p>

<p>Plus, we know they&#39;re friends. There&#39;s also the fact that Trump&#39;s still shilling his steaks and his resort. </p>

<p>Also, the media won&#39;t shut up about him. They won&#39;t ask him any hard questions, even during the debates. They just giggle and shake their heads, &quot;Ohhh, that Trump!&quot; And we know media&#39;s in the bag for Clinton.</p>

<p>For me, this is the serious tell - he&#39;s on the news more than Clinton, 24-7, non-stop Trump in our faces. Remember what they did to Ron Paul? Yeah, no, they&#39;re not doing it here. Why?</p>

<p>The craziest thing about this entire election is that we have progressives pushing a neocon (Hillary) and conservatives pushing a liberal (Trump). Everything&#39;s upside down and it&#39;s like everyone&#39;s on drugs or something. I guess, actually, they are, but damn, it&#39;s really wearing me down to watch it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They could stop him easily by asking him a hard question once in awhile. Or not giving him airtime.</p>

<p>I usually don&#39;t watch cable news or TV in general, but turned it on last night to see how each network covered it.</p>

<p>Every network had a Trump call-in, it was ridiculous. I don&#39;t think the media wants to stop Trump, they want to ride the ratings straight into the general election, where they are pretty sure their girl Hills will prevail. Watch Trump engage with a female in a debate capacity and you will see what a ratings-yielding trainwreck will happen. Even if Trump decides he now really, really wants to win - he&#39;s a cooked goose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both she and Terris (the witness) were pretty pissed, as was Fields&#39; boyfriend, which caused her to get shit because he posted about it on Twitter.</p>

<p>The other thing is Trump&#39;s reaction, and Lewandowski&#39;s reaction. Instead of, &quot;We don&#39;t think that happened, we&#39;ll investigate,&quot; they immediately started trashing her and digging through her past, feeding dirt and rumor and innuendo to writers who&#39;d sink low enough to publish (like Chuck Johnson). Basically threatening her vs. trying to smooth it all over.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a <em>strange</em> reaction and not the reaction you&#39;d expect from a campaign that really wanted to win (or a campaign that was guiltless in the incident - this is Dershowitz-level ethics-free defense). The wise thing to do would be to say you&#39;ll investigate, you don&#39;t think it happened, and you&#39;re sorry if she was hurt in some scuffle that you haven&#39;t yet looked into, and then the public forgets about it.</p>

<p>But what they did here was go on a PR onslaught about how this female reporter is fucking crazy (while ignoring the Washington Post journalist, who is male, altogether).</p>

<p>It&#39;s very fucked up, it&#39;s not the behavior of a campaign that will make it through to the Presidency, they&#39;re barely holding it together before the Primaries are through...</p>

<p>I find it interesting that you don&#39;t mention that Trump&#39;s own campaign manager assaulted a reporter</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except it didn&#39;t happen.  Breitbart themselves came out and said yesterday after reviewing video footage of the incident (which has been peculiarly missing despite hundreds of cameras) that they now believe it was a security guard who resembles Lewandowski, and that it was a case of mistaken identity. <a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/03/11/470080552/what-we-know-breitbart-reporter-and-trump-altercation">Source</a></p>

<p>The narrative of Trump violence was already being propagated before that incident,  and the incident was just used to further that narrative. </p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting to see you now toeing the same false corporate media narrative.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>because like all bullies, he&#39;s a coward, and it&#39;s easy for him to attack women but he&#39;s too chicken shit to go after men </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wait,  let&#39;s just say the Breitbart story was indeed true,  and it was Trump&#39;s campaign manager, how can say that it was Trump himself who attacked this woman?  Is Donald Trump personally responsible for the actions of other people now?  If so,  why isn&#39;t Bernie Sanders responsible for his supporters doing what they did in Chicago last night?  Seems like a double standard you&#39;re using here. </p>

<p>Bingo. It was Bernie Sanders supporters causing the ruckus last night,  but the media immediately blamed it all on Trump. </p>

<p>I noticed the night of the debate that all the usual suspects,  Washington Post,  NYT, CNN, Fox News, Slate, Yahoo, almost every single mainstream media outlet was running the whole violence at Trump rallies narrative, nearly at the same time. </p>

<p>I think OP is exactly right,  this was a planned PYSOP from the beginning, and the corrupt mainstream media laid the ground work for it in the days leading up to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Students (not Bernie supporters) from that college planned and executed this protest, they didn’t want Trump hosting an event on their campus and there was plenty of online planning in the days prior to the event.  Whether or not there was outside influence is up for argument or speculation, but this wasn’t any kind of Bernie supporter plan.  When Trump visited Burlington VT, Bernie people were excited to protest and disrupt his rally and showed up in masse without any incidents of violence or arrest.  This situation in Chicago may have been brought to a head by other forces, but it’s part of the narrative to inject “Bernie” into the situation, it helps both Trump and Clinton. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Harassed out of the stadium&quot;?</p>

<p>You mean when the POLICE [not Trump] ejected Democratic operatives who hide in the stands and then start yelling to disrupt the events?</p>

<p>These aren&#39;t people, listening politely. These are provocateurs in there with malice aforethought, strategically coordinating to interrupt the events.</p>

<p>If Trump supporters did that crap at Hillary events, yes: I absolutely would want Security to hustle them out, because the provocateurs would be trying to take away her right to free speech.</p>

<p>But the fact is: Trump supporters are NOT acting as provocateurs at Hillary rallies.</p>

<p>This is completely (and unambiguously) one-sided.</p>

<p>This behavior is coming from the Hard Left. So Hard Left that they&#39;re disrupting even Bernie Sanders events. These are Saul Alinksi &quot;Rules for Radicals&quot; tactics.</p>

<p>As I said: When you can document Trump supporters rushing up on a stage to shut down Bernie, or show me Trump supporters disrupting Hillary events, you&#39;ll have a leg to stand on.</p>

<p>But as the facts remain, all the militant brownshirt tactics are coming from the left. And America is watching. They can see very plainly who is disrupting who&#39;s events.</p>

As you can see, she was not doing anything, didn&#39;t shove back or yell. Care to explain that?</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m not trying to be argumentative or anything, but I do think that Trump supporters are very toxic and dangerous. I don&#39;t think trump is racist. He&#39;s probably a little sexist, but for the most part, I don&#39;t think he really identifies with traditional conservative republican views. I think he&#39;s pretending to wave this &quot;Make America Great Again&quot; banner to please the predominantly white men of the &quot;conservative&quot; parts of America. Unfortunately, his supporters have more internalized racism/sexism/homophobia than Hill and Bernie supporters, so this could explain why there is so much violence at Trump rallies in comparison to Bernie and Hillary&#39;s. I think your statement is definitely accurate, and I totally think that Trump is only running so Hillary has a chance of becoming president, but a really HUGE and terrifying truth about Trump supporters is that if there are people that shoot up black churches, or go to a KKK rally, or sexually assault/harass women, they will most likely be at a Trump rally. Trump doesn&#39;t necessarily preach hate speech, but his followers interpret what he says to be that way. </p>

<p>I&#39;m super curious about his insistence that he&#39;ll cover people&#39;s legal fees if they&#39;re charged or sued by their victims (especially that man who punched the guy walking up the steps last week) - will he really do it?

Trump is a narcissist, and everything he does is directed at the goal of furthering his own interests.

<p>Since we&#39;re talking about Chicago, let&#39;s also remember that&#39;s Obama&#39;s old stomping grounds. Rahm, along with Hillary, was part of the Obama administration before he became Mayor of Chicago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But  Hillary and Trump are two sides of the same coin. And the establishment doesn&#39;t gives a fuck who wins. Two willing puppets. Bread and fucking Circus for the sheep! And when the show tunes are done in November the puppet masters will have quietly reveal that they wanted a republican Cruz/ Rubio presidency after all, which  they fully control too. Americans will stupidly  breath in relief that they got something new, did not get Trump or Hillary. It&#39;s like tricking kids into choosing what you already chose for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you insofar as it doesn&#39;t matter who wins to the establishment.</p>

<p>But if there is a difference between the two, it&#39;s this... Hillary doesn&#39;t really inspire anyone. Yes, a bunch of people will vote for her because she&#39;s a woman. But this is more of a novelty thing than any charismatic quality possessed by Clinton.</p>

<p>Trump is a whole different matter. He has a boatload of charisma. Trump might not appeal to everyone. But he does appeal to a lot of people. What&#39;s more, Trump supporters seem to be a lot more inspired than Hillary supporters.</p>

<p>I wonder just how far Trump could go in 4 or 8 years, if he ever got elected. Just look at how far  Bush Jr. was able to get people to go after 9/11. Torture, assassinations, give up privacy right etc. W seemed to be able to inspire a lot of people into accepting some pretty dark stuff.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s this charisma factor that Trump has (and Hillary doesn&#39;t) that concerns some people. A strong-willed, charismatic leader who has his own ideas about how things could be done... that&#39;s someone who might prove to be difficult to control. </p>

<p>Seeing what happened at the Chicago protest...all of it - same girl had photos leaked of her and was on the camera multiple times.</p>

<p>With one fell swoop, the Streissand effect AND the persecution complex were triggered by Team Red by the Chicago protest event, and now Fox has plausible deniability to &quot;like&quot; him and support him. It all only strengthened the astroturfing.</p>

<p>He is astroturf for the establishment.</p>

<p>And before anyone asks &quot;why is he a part of the establishment!?&quot; Because literally everything he stands for is what the establishment stands for. Don&#39;t listen to the bullshit ANYONE says when they&#39;re running for president - Hillary panders too, why do people not believe hers but somehow think Trump is honest as a nun? Look at his actions.</p>

<p>In fact though, even what he&#39;s said is Obama 2.0/Bush3.0 - he said he will expand the NSA and renew the Patriot Act. He literally is establishment, and there is a massive propaganda campaign - down to the 4chan level - to make people think it&#39;s organic.</p>

<p>ROFL, do some research into his financials. Dude is a liar, it&#39;s why he doesn&#39;t release his tax returns and is in a 500k/annum tax bracket last year. Fundamentally, he&#39;s a shitty investment. His greatest asset is an intangible brand that is only as valuable as his image. I&#39;m not expecting you have done any research into this and to merely be on the band wagon because Trump (TM) sounds like a big deal to the people of fly over country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole thing was a fucking setup. Lifelong Chicagoan and UIC alum here. </p>

<p>The Bernie Sanders campaign had nothing to do with &quot;organizing&quot; protesters to this event. In fact, I was just in their office on Thursday, and they were asking everyone to please phonebank/canvass as an alternative to the Trump Rally, as it is currently crunch time to get out the vote. They have way more to be concerned about than Trump. </p>

<p>Anyone who knows anything about protests in Chicago (I&#39;ve attended many over the years) can tell you that if the conditions are right, dozens and dozens of different organizations and factions will spring up. There were people there from numerous ethnic communities, student groups, anti-war groups, GLBT groups, feminist groups, BLM, church orgs, etc. It is absolutely outrageous to claim that BLM or the Sanders campaign are solely responsible for the behavior of protesters. The fact of the matter is bad eggs will show up to EVERY big protest. It&#39;s just the nature of the event. 99.9% of the attendees can be peaceful, but there are always a few who try to stir the pot. I don&#39;t even necessarily disagree with their tactics, but I&#39;m pointing out the truth here. A few people holding Sanders signs does not a coordinated effort make. </p>

<p>Half my Facebook friend list attended the protest last night, and came home beaming with pride over our city and how peaceful they found the protest. So clearly there is a gap in the narrative here. Clearly many people attended, protested, had their voices heard and then returned home without issue. There were seven arrests last night at the venue. That&#39;s nothing compared to the number of obnoxious, baseball-cap wearing, hedge fund managing bros from the &#39;burbs who will be hauled in for drunken tomfoolery this St. Patrick&#39;s Day weekend (the parade is today). Keep that in mind, too--CPD can&#39;t have been in good spirits dealing with this rally on top of their already unusually high workload this weekend. This date was carefully chosen. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve got a city with inflamed racial and political tensions, and radicalized (I don&#39;t mean that in a bad way) black youth groups who have been out protesting and organizing all winter. An urban university with an astoundingly diverse student body--I don&#39;t have stats handy but I&#39;m fairly certain UIC ranks among the most diverse in the nation. White students are actually a minority. There are longstanding, well-established social and racial justice groups organizing on campus, and a huge Muslim student body as well. Tons of immigrants and international students. This is not your average state school. It&#39;s incredibly diverse, incredibly left/progressive-leaning, and incredibly hostile to viewpoints like Trump&#39;s. </p>

<p>On top of that, Chicago is not some Republican stronghold. The Trump campaign has been relatively inactive here. We overwhelmingly vote Democrat and are openly antagonistic to conservative viewpoints. He knew he would attract a ton of vitriol. </p>

<p>So who set it up? Trump or Hillary? There may be no way to know. They both want to discredit Sanders for different reasons. Hillary is terrified that she&#39;ll lose Chicago&#39;s vote. Sanders is surging in popularity here; the city is buzzing with excitement over the idea of electing a truly left-of-center candidate who is honest and advocates for the working class. Her connection to corrupt mayor Rahm Emanuel is too strong, and Chicagoans are aware of it. After Sanders condemned Rahm at his rally last night, she&#39;s probably quaking in her boots. I think both Trump and Hillary can benefit from discrediting Sanders and BLM activists in one fell swoop, so maybe they struck a deal. You scratch my back, I&#39;ll scratch yours sort of thing. We all know Trump has a good relationship with the Clintons anyway. </p>

<p>I fully realize how crazy this all sounds, and that&#39;s fine. I don&#39;t disagree. But this whole thing was just too perfect. I can&#39;t shake off the feeling that something isn&#39;t right. The media had all of their scripts ready to go. And make no mistake, I don&#39;t think Trump or Clinton even had to do much to ignite this tinderbox. I think the announcement of the rally was enough, and the groups that exist here organized organically. No need for government plants or anything of the like. The hate for Trump here is very, very real. </p>

<p>EDIT: I&#39;m becoming increasingly concerned about race relations in the city today. Weather is nice and there are droves of people out partying for St. Patrick&#39;s Day...they&#39;re chanting USA! USA! Which could be nothing, but that&#39;s a little weird to be chanting on a holiday dedicated to <em>Irish</em> heritage. I&#39;m worried that with news of the canceled Trump rally and the inevitably of BLM protesters interrupting the parade, fights will break out. Racial slurs will be hurled. I really hope I&#39;m wrong. But if further clashes do erupt, I would say Trump, whether he deliberately planned to not show up to his own rally or not, is indirectly responsible. He&#39;s fostering a climate of racism and intolerance, and using the city of Chicago as a pawn in his political posturing. Fuck Trump. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your post was great. What is even worse though is Trump is gaining popularity more now because of what happened last night. Viewers of MSM only saw that the protesters were &quot;violent&quot; and did not let Trump have his &quot;1st Amendment Rights.&quot; People are using that to support Trump now and to denounce Bernie because they think he actively supported this! It truly is a game and I feel like Clinton and Trump are trying to oust Bernie so Trump can hand over the win to Clinton.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will say that here in Chicago most of us know better. As soon as the media started claiming violence I knew they were exaggerating. I think everyone knows someone who went to the protest (it was HUGE), and there were not many reports of rioting and violence. My own parents went! Do you really think I&#39;d let my parents go somewhere where actual rioting was likely to break out? </p>

<p>There&#39;s a massive crowd of intoxicated, green-clad <em>white</em> youth outside my window right now getting off the Metra to start their festivities. They&#39;ll tear the city up this weekend, littering, pissing and fucking and vomiting outside, breaking windows, raping and assaulting. And most of them aren&#39;t even fucking from here, they&#39;ve come here from the suburbs. The police scanner in Wrigleyville (a big bar neighborhood) tonight will be a source of endless entertainment. But will that even be a blip on the news? Of course not. But a black kid is terrified of some racist demagogue getting elected and acts out...now that&#39;s footage we can use. </p>

Thats why Trump is going to make a new policy where News media is NOT allowed to make up lies or any of that bullshit anymore. And whats funny is, every news station is scared and they are twisting his words, AGAIN, like USUAL, making it seem like hes gonna take away our free speech. Making lies etc... is basically slandering, which they dont get i trouble for. And this election reminds me so much of the government in V for Vendetta.... It really feels like its coming to that. And I truly believe more violent protests will happen, and the &quot;Elite&quot; will have him killed, and just blame it on a protest gone wrong. I swear on my life I would rather sacrifice myself than allow him to die before he gets to change this fucked up corrupted government/Nation..... Hillary owned by Wallstreet, Bernie will make us broke as shit and make me pay even more $$$ to broke ass college bums so they can get paid by us, to get trashed all the time for free. (You dont even know.... Everysingle person I have met who has gotten a grant etc... has blown their money on shit notbing to do with school. My friend got a 2k grant... He bought a fuckin 1000$ TV and both us Xboxones.... I didnt dven know where it came from at the time, but then find out it was a grant and felt truly disgusted.... But hell no, this aint the first of it.... Everysingle person I met has spent their grant on alcohol, drugs (addy+coke+mids), TVs, gaming comps, etc.... And guess what, the government dont give 2shits they never look into it. And dont even get me started on welfare.... Round my city you pay 50-60$ you can get a 200$+ EBT card that gets refilled (I think monthly or weekly cant remember) and thry go buy some fuckin dope and coke with it, bangin up the citizens $$ in their goddamn veins... This is why liberals sicken tffff outta me. Always giving way &quot;free&quot; shit to gain the broke azz citizens and minorities, which is aka OUR money being used to buy votes...</p>

The example is from Canada (I think--been a while since I watched it), whose laws much more closely resemble the UK&#39;s. Libel and slander laws were created by the landed aristocracy to be used against commoners who spoke out against them. In such cases, a defendant is considered guilty until they can prove themselves innocent. </p>

<p>If such slander laws were enacted based on the English system, they would absolutely be used to stifle speech.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying the media is not twisting Trump&#39;s words</p>

<p>That said you are probably correct in your theory that this location was chosen for the rally on purpose to create a violent event. I don&#39;t think by Trump though just because it&#39;s far too risky. If people had died the media would have hammered it on for months.

    <div class="md"><p>The largest portion of people who are nationalistic and fetish-worship our flag are Caucasians. National pride goes hand in hand with white pride - it&#39;s almost the same thing in many cases. Seeing white nationalistic people in a community that is typically full of minorities is merely an observation - astute and well placed. It&#39;s sort of like seeing clouds growing on the horizon and wondering if they&#39;ll form into a storm or not. Now I know you&#39;ll disagree with me and throw out your usual Fox News platitudes about leftists and liberals and communists and IDGAF. Though one thing that amuses me is these Fox News white pride.. I&#39;m sorry, American Pride people is that they&#39;ll always say liberals this, leftists that! Much like Christians accuse atheists of many perspectives not actually held. My points are 1, without being a liberal, and being told what liberals think by other republicans has left you all very confused and diluted with a completely made up conception of what the average commie liberal thinks and does. And secondly, I don&#39;t know any liberals who have the same type of narrative against any other groups, republicans, Muslims or anyone else. We liberal types pretty much stay away from group labels. The inherent xenophobia in your viewpoint is expressed in your language that is plain to see to everyone else, except to you and yours. This is why liberals don&#39;t listen to you - you&#39;re not operating in reality. Just a life pro tip for you I guess.</p>

<p>Then you have black people call you racist murder because some criminal got killed trying to fight a cop. That&#39;s where the racial tension comes from between blacks and whites right now. </p>

<p>Any honest hard working white person can tell that blacks have had ever opportunity in the world and have done nothing with it. 
Two, the reason blacks have to deal with police more is because they commit more crimes. 
Three, whites have to work hard to get where there at its not a privilege it&#39;s earned. Now go earn yours and stop whining. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is part of the establishment, yet his supporters see him as the antidote, rightly or wrongly. He admits he&#39;s donated to Clinton, and has a good reason for it: he donated so he could get favors. No other Republican, nor most Democrats besides Sanders, will admit this is how campaign finance works. Trumps supporters think he will work to fix this. </p>

<p>The status quo is literally the way things stand, though in this context, I mean whatever a particular supporter sees as wrong with the system which they want changed. For Trump supporters, it could be political correctness, scary Muslims, blacks and Mexicans taking their jobs, or whatever else. For Sanders supporters, it&#39;s wealth and income inequality, unaffordable healthcare, college tuition, etc. Neither Trump nor Sanders supporters trust the more mainstream candidates to actually change any of this; they think those candidates will more or less perpetuate the negative aspects of the status quo, while maybe making incremental changes they might want. Both supporters want real change, and think their chosen candidate is the only one who can achieve it. </p>

<p>See the first paragraph, but here your conflating who Trump is with how his supporters see him. If nothing else, the man is a talented manipulator and spin-master. </p>

<hr/>

<p>I&#39;m not making the argument that Trump and Sanders are similar--they&#39;re quite divergent--but that many of the same impulses and inclinations drive supporters of each to their respective candidates. They know the system is messed up, and know that none of the anointed candidates will fix it, and therefore are choosing to back what they see as &quot;outsider&quot; candidates, whether or not they truly are &quot;outsiders&quot;. </p>

<p>As to Trump being a liar, part of me thinks people know he&#39;s lying, but are so sick of the typical politician-style lying that they would prefer the candidate who&#39;s obviously lying to the one who everyone can pretend is not lying. If Clinton gets elected, she&#39;ll break most of her promises and sell out to the highest bidder, but there&#39;ll likely not be enough impetus to do anything about it. If Trump gets elected, the lies will be so egregious, and just plain bad lies, that it will show everyone how bad the electoral system has become.

Trump will be hugely unpopular, a Democrat will run using the establishment machine, win in a landslide, and then we&#39;re back to where we were. I have no idea what the Republican party on the whole will do next but to an extent I kind of feel like Trump is a perfect storm and there will never be someone else just like him to replace him, to a certain extent I feel that the modus operandi of the GOP will be more or less back to the new pre-Trump normal once he has either lost or served his term.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, the movement to fix the system is growing strongly and quickly no matter what happens. It&#39;s been 8 years since the last open Democratic election which is a long time, but the massive anti-establishment movement hasn&#39;t really swung into gear until maybe the last 3 years or so. People have simply started to reach a breaking point with how broken the system is. I really doubt there won&#39;t be any impetus to change anything if Clinton wins, I mean what you are literally saying is that people will want change more because of Trump because he will be so horrible, but not after Clinton because she won&#39;t be nearly as bad for the average American. She is campaigning on a continuation of the Obama legacy though, and if Clinton&#39;s presidency won&#39;t be enough to demand change then why is there so much support for change brewing after Obama? Honestly Obama is no great hero if you are strongly left-leaning but he has had a lot of accomplishments as far as presidents go and I can&#39;t realistically see him as beneath the top third of presidents in terms of &quot;ranking&quot;, so if he hasn&#39;t been a ludicrous horror show like Trump would be then according to what you are saying there shouldn&#39;t be that much impetus for change. I think the impetus is already there, it just might take more than one election cycle for the majority of people to get on board for it. That will happen regardless of who wins (unless Sanders actually wins and can make some of the changes the anti-establishment movement wants). </p>

<p>If Clinton wins and she is a corporatist centrist who makes a shitload of compromises and concessions with the right and keeps warmongering while making a few meaningful progressive changes then the change movement should keep growing strongly like it is already. I&#39;m not personally willing to pay the price of President Trump because <em>maybe</em> it will speed that up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with pretty much everything you&#39;ve said here. I was more trying to answer your question of why people support him than espousing my own views, though I do partially share them. </p>

<p>In some respects, I see Trump as a man who sees himself as virtuous, or wants to be the type of man that he others will see as virtuous. I think he tears others down so much because he is insecure, and wants others to think more highly of him than those around him. A bully acts like he does because on some level he doesn&#39;t see himself as worthy, because he doesn&#39;t like some or most parts of himself. As egotistical as he clearly is, I don&#39;t think nearly as cold-hearted as Clinton or W, or even Obama for that matter. I think those three would do anything necessary for power, while his motives seem to be different. </p>

<p>I think he does want to make America great again, if only to prove to himself and the world that he is worthy or deserving. I don&#39;t think he has a clue how to actually do that, and I think on some level he know that he doesn&#39;t. He&#39;s been able to bluff his way through life, and through this primary, and so far he&#39;s been lucky. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a huge risk, I grant you that, but it may come down to 4 years being too long to wait. The rate at which power is accumulating, and the huge risk of the stock market crashing, or TPTB making their ultimate power grab, make me think we might not have that much time. I&#39;m as of yet undecided.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been very cautious about Trump. I don&#39;t care much for Sanders, However, I believe fair is fair and I do prefer him over Mrs. Clinton and if he wins the nomination and Presidency then I would go on with an open mind. Alot of people have been saying that Trump is a decoy to assist Clinton in gaining the election because he and the Clintons are old friends.</p>

<p>Again I have been very cautious about Mr. Trump but I may add that I saw it as the conspiracy train going runaway on this one.</p>

<p>Then.........I read this incident and the aftermath and all kinds of bells and whistles went off when I read where &quot;Bernie&quot; as &quot;Mr. Trump&quot; as he refers to him as and himself as &quot;Mr. Trump&quot; as he says Bernie calls him, starting at each other. Sanders is suddenly calling Trump a pathological liar and Trump is calling Bernie a communist and its Trump&#39;s people and Sanders&#39; people at each other. This all being commented on CNN &amp; FOX saying that their people are very divisive.</p>

<p>The comment sections were reading that these two will only divide the country. And now I am wondering if through this if I am seeing Mr. Trumps role rising from the smoke. That being that he will get nastier with Sanders and Soros and Clintons plants in the Sanders crowd and Trump the Master Plant will have Clinton chiming in as the peacemaker to counter her warmonger image and thus have the country sick of the divisive mudslinging looking to her as the real answer. Exhaust us with the violence having us long for peace.</p>

<p>I agree with the OP on this. </p>

<p>Edit:up until now Sanders has ran a clean campaign, what changed. because some protesters in the Old Politically dirty but powerful city of Chicago is Rahms and Obamas for now.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe Sanders was behind it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obama, and the Democrats in general have done far worse in that regard. Not to mention it still amazes me that people buy the Trump racist narrative. It literally makes no sense. So far he hasn&#39;t said one bad thing about any race. He has called illegal immigrants criminals. And he has called for temp ban on Muslim immigration. Since Mexican is a nationality, and Islam is a religion neither makes him a racist. He is Nationalist, and probably has a little Islamophobia. But not racist.</p>

<p>Every single person in this sub needs to wake up to this right the fuck now. Listen, this is how they take away our right to protest. This is <em>interrupting</em>, not protesting. Protesting is not going to someone&#39;s speech or presentation and interrupting them in the middle of it. </p>

<p>Was Kanye West a protester when he said, &quot;I&#39;ma let you finish but..&quot;? Is that what you think protesting is? Protesters are going to have the same rep as Kanye West everybody. Anyone who goes to a rally and does this is giving a bad name to protesting and you&#39;ll soon have Trump supporters being anti-protest. </p>

<p>If you want to protest, what you do is you start YOUR OWN rally. You don&#39;t go and hijack someone else.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Sorry to hone in on just one part of your post, but this is not interesting at all. A title like &quot;senior account executive&quot; might sound good on a resume, but in reality it almost certainly means that he was the primary point of contact for a few of Watershed&#39;s clients, and handled the scheduling and paperwork to ensure they got the proper services performed on time. It would not be a challenging position for a responsible and organized 23 year old. I would also guess that people with even a little drive and competence could advance far in an organization like moveon. </p>

<p>Also what about watershed&#39;s services do you think lends itself to &quot;financing black budget projects?&quot; I&#39;m familiar with much of what they do, and these activities would easily be auditable. </p>

They expect most of us to choose the shit that seems least awful, or maybe even find the artisan wraps to be tasty, and understand that many of those who see it all for what it is will simply stop looking for genuinely nourishing food. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what the answer is, and I&#39;m suspicious of anyone who claims with certainty that they do, but I do know if we give up, they win. If you&#39;re at that point, I won&#39;t judge you and probably can&#39;t talk you out of it over the internet. Yet I would ask you to consider what it is that you once thought was worth fighting for--really meditate on it, and see if it is still worth it.

The rich will always win until there is a system reset that can only happen if,we, as the little guys rise up in a revolution and overthrow the system which will ultimately lead back to the same situation of corruption again, it&#39;s human nature. Like you, I believe the answers are warped, every politician is out for the betterment of their financial backers, some not as obvious as others, and I don&#39;t believe anyone is out to help the people in the middle, I&#39;m not poor, I&#39;m not rich, I&#39;m in the middle and from experience it has always been &quot;take from the middle to strengthen the lower, and take from the lower to help the top&quot;. I have not given up but maybe I need to browse r/cats for a while and get some motivation. This race is a complete circus and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen something this nuts, Bernie seems to be the only one with some sanity, I may not agree with all his policies, but I&#39;m so jaded that I firmly believe he has a hidden agenda  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s really funny, I&#39;ve found, is that they will never deny NOT being Clinton supporters masquerading as Trump supporters, they just throw insults and capital letters and call you a shill, like a total &quot;I know you are, but what am I&quot; kind of deal. I don&#39;t get it, but it&#39;s funny as hell - if you&#39;re pretending to be a Trump fan on the Internet and are actually pro-Clinton - why <em>not</em> lie and say you&#39;re not a Clinton supporter instead of changing the subject?

    <div class="md"><p>They seem to clam up whenever I&#39;ve called it out. Then the down votes to try to prevent killing the lies with light. It&#39;s a bunch of misdirection and nonsense. Every year time gets wasted in congress, where they already barely spend time working, on bullshit retreads of nonsense laws that are either blatantly anti everyone that&#39;s not mega wealthy or otherwise  only important because that&#39;s what we&#39;re fed. A couple of months ago Biden reported on the in fighting and factionalization among cancer researchers and how it&#39;s basically trench warfare between groups of researchers clinging to old ideas and quackifying any new ones. Where is that discussion in the race? Why are things like amygdalin shouted down as false and nutty when you find tons of forums where it helped people that were developing cancer? You only hear about the people already in advanced stages and already weakened from traditional treatments trying it and dying because nothing could have helped them at that point? Why do any attempts to begin a discussion about how the climate is in fact changing but it may not be solely caused by carbon emissions shouted down as &quot;climate change denial&quot;? No one&#39;s saying that the climate isn&#39;t changing or that we shouldn&#39;t take better care of the planet and reduce carbon emissions, but only focusing on carbon could be harmful if some of the climate change is the result of things out our control relating to the precession of the equinoxes and the movement of the solar system through the milky way and the milky way through the large cosmos? Anyone else notice that after years of defunding NASA suddenly they got way more important shortly after all new discoveries were made about polar auroras on other planets, atmosphere on Pluto and other general climate change on other planets that can&#39;t have been caused by carbon? Could it be that we are only just seeing this stuff because it wasn&#39;t there before? Could it be that the carbon thing is being focused on because it&#39;s a good way to prevent other developing nations, or China, from rising to power by preventing them from going through the same cheap coal driven industrial revolution that the existing superpowers enjoyed? And why do you only hear about carbon when methane is a way more problematic greenhouse gas that spews forth out of every single sewage treatment plant? And why is global warming theain thing that you hear about when really we should be worried about the next ice age occurring...the current interglacial period is the longest in history and the warmth is what&#39;s keeping it that way.</p>

<p>But no no no.... Gay marriage and abortion...let&#39;s everyone focus on these things that SHOULD only affect the people in those situations, and treat them like if gay people want to get married they&#39;re going to walk into your house and turn tour children or that god is going to flood the nation. Lets shame women making the toughest decisions of their lives and then offer no support based on some procedural technicality after the child is born.</p>

<p>&quot;There are two candidates in the election who would oppose the TPP, a corporate coup disguised as a free trade bill, who have pledged to get money out of elections, who would help break down the two party system, and expose establishment secrets. These two candidates are, of course, Trump and Bernie, and the powers that be have successfully tricked their followers into hating each other instead of working together to investigate the covert network of psychopaths that comprise the deep state.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>With all due respect, I think that you are misinformed on this issue. This protest is in response to the rising animosity and incited violence at Donald Trump rallies as of the past 2 weeks. Trump is using the same tactics that Benito Mussolini used, I strongly encourage you to look this us in detail. </p>

<p>Here is a video compilation of Trump inciting physical violence against political protesters. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/escalating-aggression-marks-trump-s-rhetoric-642743363967">http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/escalating-aggression-marks-trump-s-rhetoric-642743363967</a></p>

<p>When you have a presidential candidate, that uses fascist tactics of inciting violence against other Americans to appear &quot;strong&quot;. You are going to get wildly varied, chaotic and sometimes violent protests in response. </p>

<p>Which is EXACTLY what Trump is trying to do.  </p>

<p>There are two candidates in the election who would oppose the TPP... These two candidates are, of course, Trump and Bernie, and the powers that be have successfully tricked their followers into hating each other instead of working together....</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is exactly right. Whatever the differences between Trump and Bernie, both candidates run their campaigns as insurgencies against established Party and security state authorities. The Democratic and Republican Parties can keep their lock on power only so long as they divide right from left. Cleaving any possibility of unity on a populist front in opposition to Party corruption.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what happened in Chicago. But it is certain that security state tactics using agent provocateurs to incite riots are common. And have been such since the protests of the 1960s, and before that the union movement of the early 20th century. </p>

<p>When citizens organize themselves, elites get very worried. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Trump is doing a pretty good job of encouraging violence without getting help from the deep state.  He stands up there yelling, &quot;Get &#39;im outta here!&quot; while the crowd roars and carries on, pushing and shoving fellow humans.  Then he makes comments how &quot;they/them&quot; were better behaved in the past because the consequences were different, basically saying blacks should be lynched if whites want the good ole days back.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what the deep state has planned, and I don&#39;t know anymore who the &quot;establishment&quot; is.  All I know is that America should be a meritocracy, and you can&#39;t do that by encouraging racism and other separatist sentiments.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In keeping with the necessity to organize around things we agree on rather than disagree on, I&#39;m quoting the paragraph I think you got spot on. Let&#39;s build off this truth rather than insinuate moveon is a psyop without evidence.</p>

<p>So there&#39;s video footage being played for the conservative networks showing anti-Trump protesters causing violence, and Trump canceled the rally for concerns from this violence. CNN chose not to focus on the violence, and you&#39;re calling that deliberate, but perhaps there simply wasn&#39;t as much violence as Fox News is reporting that there was. Chicago police never told Trump to cancel his event. He did this on purpose, he set up a rally in Chicago expecting protesters to show up so he could create a wash and make the opposition look violent. Whether psyop implants were there to assist in this propaganda, I&#39;m not sure, but I don&#39;t think that psyops are necessary for every protest to turn violent, a lot of people just let group-think rage get the best of them.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure Trump knows the extent to which he is <em>allowed</em> to hold the wealth and power he does.

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry I&#39;m going to call Bullshit. </p>

<p>Trump is a xenophobe, a racist, and a serial liar. He talks about nothing and panders to the lowest common denominator. I can respect a lot of other candidates views and understand their perspective. Trump is simply a conman. The world is falling for it. </p>

<p>Not everything is a conspiracy. People are fed up with the premise of a President Trump. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve been given shit choices for president, turned against each other when we&#39;re each others&#39; only hope, and subverted into begging for a militarized police force to protect us from a self-sponsored (likely false) enemy. Most people don&#39;t realize this isn&#39;t an election... they&#39;ve been rigged and swayed - democratic choice has been perverted by mass control.</p>

<p>If we don&#39;t see this illusion of freedom for what it is now our only choice will be to fight for ourselves. We are in very, very dangerous times, folks.</p>

<p>How is this anything other than <em>good</em> for Trump?  Sure, he missed one rally, but people at rallies are already converts for the most part - and they&#39;re going to be more likely to support him simply because they want to push back against the cancelled rally!</p>

<p>If this was anything other than it looks like - a bunch of protests - then wouldn&#39;t you assume that the Trump campaign organized it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>U dont think that cops killing people causes racial tension?  U dont think they kill white people?  Or spanish??  U dont think what is bieng shown to us by the news is to creat tension? I wasnt talking about the movements I was talking about how its reported. Ohh I dont get it cuz im white I have never been treated diffrently by any one or have had bad experiences with police... I live in a ghetto where I am fucked with by the police on the regular because im white. All my front teeth are broken because I was beat the shit out of by the police and ended up hospitalized for six days and told to take it easy for a few days after I got out. Been jumped multiple times and robbed because im white.  You think I have white pride? I love how every one that is Caucasian is white to you. Germans, Swedes, french and Europeans are all just white right? U think its white pride that made the movement happen!? Its fucking cops killing people and them having nothing happen to them. Dont look at normal people like its thier fault or have anything to do with it. Its the people who run the government or people with money. My white pride has me taking any job I can get so I have hope I can become not homeless.. I gotta lotta pride. Idk what Im talking about im just irritated. The kkk thing is totally fucked up (truml right) then hillary has crimes to so what is one to do vote for the lesser of evils like we have been doing? </p>

<p>No where did I say this, in fact I said quite the opposite, I mentioned the history of white supremacy in America. </p>

<p>You realize when I say black I am speaking of the entire dark gene pool world wide correct? Blacks, Latinos, Indians all included.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You want to make the world problems all about you, that&#39;s the problem. When the system is working for you, you want to highlight something. When the system isn&#39;t working for an entire gene pool, it doesn&#39;t seem to matter. Contradiction at it&#39;s finest.</p>

<p>Sir, you cannot live in the ghetto, every poor white person I know is on the same page as me. Again, this is why I said that we are enemies yet brothers at the same time. It is not you yourself that is ending the world, it&#39;s your power structure. Your power structure has been infiltrated by evil people that wish to do you harm and end the black race. Thus putting both black and white at arms.</p>

<p>The perspective of black racism is to show you, you are no better than blacks. You were given a societal position over blacks by the overlords in history and that is what has kept us at war ever since. While you might not be as open about it, when Trump says the things he says, he is literally putting America on the brink of Civil war. </p>

<p>Wake up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really. It was just the left-wingers being left-wingers.</p>

<h1>BlackLivesMatter - the racist anti-white hate group funded by George Soros, did what they always do.</h1>

<p>The Bernie Bros - a bunch of pathetic young white boys thought they could be &quot;cool&quot; by posing as &quot;revolutionaries&quot; and riding the dicks of the Black men in #BLM, thought it was ok to attack ordinary Americans as &quot;racist&quot; simply because they were white people voting for Celebrity Apprentice Donald Trump (a liberal New York Democrat associated with Bill Clinton.)</p>

<p>&quot;Progressives&quot; thought they could signal their righteousness by looking down their nose at working class white people - who they call &quot;racist&quot; - and suck up to wealthy immigrants and foreigners - as long as they are not American, white, or Christian.</p>

<p>Bonus Political Correctness points if they were Muslims, Jews, or Gays - even better if they were Muslim Trans-Genders!</p>

<p>The pathetic &quot;Social Justice Warriors&quot; of course - being too weak and cowardly to engage in violence themselves - merely cheered on the Lumpenproles in #BLM as THEY engaged in violence.</p>

<p>Then they went home and got online to gloat about how they had denied &quot;racist white people&quot; their freedom of speech.</p>

<p>Well - what did anyone expect? Bernie Sander IS, after all, a COMMUNIST, and this is what COMMUNISTS do, until they actually take power and start their mass murders.</p>

<p>&quot;Nazis?&quot; - LOL - the Communists murdered FAR more people than the Nazis ever had a chance too.</p>

<p>BERNIE! BERNIE!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen some pretty ridiculous things on this subreddit but this takes the cake:</p>

<p>*&quot;Interestingly, this 29 year old “Executive Director” has a linkdin showing that he worked as a “Senior Account Exectutive” at Watershed Company in 2006, at the age of 23.</p>

<p>The Watershed Company seems like it would be an intelligence agencies wet dream front organization for financing black budget projects, doesn&#39;t it? This is not a coincidence...&quot;*</p>

<p>Ilya, the head of MoveOn, is an activist that has been working for legit organizations for years and even ran for Congress. He&#39;s not a spy. And the Watershed Co. is &quot;an intelligence agency&#39;s wet dream?&quot; This is the most laughable shit I&#39;ve ever seen. I&#39;ve known Ilya since he was 20 and he is a true progressive. TRUMP is the reason for the violence at his rallies. It starts with him (I can&#39;t believe it, but I even agree with Cruz on this).</p>

<p><em>&quot;The chosen candidate is Hillary Clinton, and she is nearly a lock for the nomination&quot;</em></p>

<p>So why do the people leading this &quot;PSYOP&quot; support Bernie? Bc that&#39;s who Ilya supports. Before Bernie, he and MoveOn were trying to get Warren to run...anyone but Clinton. </p>

<p>Look, there&#39;s a lot of shit we don&#39;t know about the political machine in this country, and we do have to be skeptical about what we are force-fed by the media. But if you believe this, then...well, I don&#39;t even know. I feel bad for you for wasting your energy on crap as laughable as this. Seriously. But Ilya will get a kick out of him being called a spy (especially bc his family is from Russia). I did, so thanks for that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I highly suspect Trump doesn&#39;t have more money (or more access to capital) than the Clintons. </p>

<p>He qualified for a tax break last year available to people who make $500k or less. If he&#39;s got $10B net worth, he should be making more than that in interest and dividends. However, most of the net worth he claims is apparently in the &quot;intangible&quot; value of his &quot;brand.&quot; Which after this abortion of an electoral process, should be quite valuable, talk about worldwide brand recognition...but that&#39;s not cash nor capital. It&#39;s an intangible asset only worth what he can get leasing it out... (Also, if he was that wealthy, why stoop to all the reality TV?)</p>

<p>There&#39;s probably a reason he won&#39;t release his tax returns, and it ain&#39;t due to audits.</p>

<p>tl;dr: He isn&#39;t as wealthy as he claims, and he is controllable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could be wrong, but my impression was that since most of his assets are in the form of stock in his companies/other companies, he would only pay the capital gains taxes if he sells shares which have gone up in value. I think you&#39;d have to actually look at what he takes home as salary, and whether the shares he owns actually pay dividends. If he has it structured such that all or most of his wealth is in the form of Trump company stocks, which would probably be the best way to amass wealth, he might not make that much money personally each year. Or I could just be wrong. </p>

<p>All that said, I wouldn&#39;t doubt if his assets were considerably less than he claims. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good point, forgot about that. Also, he likely counts almost all his personal spending as deductible business spending (which would explain the auditing). And retirement dividends and interest don&#39;t count as they happen. Just did some digging and it looks like he allots over $3 Billion to <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2015/06/16/donald_trump_financial_statement_he_says_his_name_alone_is_worth_3_billion.html">the value of his brand</a>. I was thinking that he might not want to release his redacted tax returns due to the embarrassment of putting so much worth to his branding, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case, since he and his people have been straightforward about that. Kind of interesting.</p>

<p>redacted tax returns </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not sure what you mean by redacted, do you mean nonredacted?</p>

<p>Either way, yeah, it is pretty interesting. I do remember it coming out that he placed a $3B valuation on his brand, though I think he&#39;d be able to spin that as &quot;Of course my name is worth $3B, I run tremendous companies and people pay me just to put my name on a building. That&#39;s the value of being a great businessman and dealmaker. It&#39;s true; it&#39;s true.&quot; I don&#39;t remember if it was you or someone else on this thread, but this presidential run likely doubled the value of that brand. </p>

<p>One other possibility might be that if he does pay such little tax but does have about the amount of wealth he claims, it could hurt his image among the working poor and lower-middle-class. &quot;Trump is worth $10B and only pays $250K in taxes!?&quot; Also makes it harder for him to advocate lower taxes for the super-wealthy. </p>

<p>I think there&#39;s definitely a core of Trump supporters who quite literally would vote for him no matter what, just as there is a similar core of Clinton supporters who would do the same, though I do surmise Clinton&#39;s is larger. </p>

<p>For as long as I&#39;ve bee cognizant of such things, most people do seem to vote for the lesser of two evils, though I suspect if this election ends up Trump v. Clinton, there will be more people than ever voting for one simply because of how much they cannot even conceive of the other winning. I can&#39;t imagine what effect it will have on the collective American psyche when one of them, each loathed by half the country, becomes president. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>:) Upvote!</p>

<p>My point is that neither distinction of liberal nor conservative holds a monopoly of claiming freedom of speech while denying others that same freedom, nor do all liberals nor all conservatives believe the same things.</p>

<p>How am I to have freedom of speech without the freedom to downvote speech I do not find helpful to the conversation? Am I not free to use the features of this medium?</p>

<p>How have I censored you?  Is your speech no longer visible? Is it any less visible than had I instead chosen to upvote every other comment in this thread except for yours?</p>

<p>And why do you suppose I am a liberal?</p>

<p>That campus is right by all the little ethnic enclave neighborhoods.  There was already controversy that they had let Trump rent their hall.  The school stated that they couldn&#39;t prevent Trump&#39;s free speech, but they couldn&#39;t prevent the students&#39; free speech either. So the school told students to come and protest if they didn&#39;t agree.  The students organized a protest. 10,000 + people RSVPed that they would be attending the protest.</p>

<p>The reality is - Trump has shown to be so offensive that the local populous rode his ass out of town on a rail!  Expect this everywhere he goes! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you insofar as it doesn&#39;t matter who wins to the establishment.</p>

<p>But if there is a difference between the two, it&#39;s this... Hillary doesn&#39;t really inspire anyone. Yes, a bunch of people will vote for her because she&#39;s a woman. But this is more of a novelty thing than any charismatic quality possessed by Clinton.</p>

<p>Trump is a whole different matter. He has a boatload of charisma. Trump might not appeal to everyone. But he does appeal to a lot of people. What&#39;s more, Trump supporters seem to be a lot more inspired than Hillary supporters.</p>

<p>I wonder just how far Trump could go in 4 or 8 years, if he ever got elected. Just look at how far  Bush Jr. was able to get people to go after 9/11. Torture, assassinations, give up privacy right etc. W seemed to be able to inspire a lot of people into accepting some pretty dark stuff.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s this charisma factor that Trump has (and Hillary doesn&#39;t) that concerns some people. A strong-willed, charismatic leader who has his own ideas about how things could be done... that&#39;s someone who might prove to be difficult to control. </p>

One reason I could never support them, I could never align myself with that sort of disrespect and disregard to national security (some written about how it was used against him by the Israelis before it went public, as they had audio tapes).</p>

<p>ROFL, do some research into his financials. Dude is a liar, it&#39;s why he doesn&#39;t release his tax returns and is in a 500k/annum tax bracket last year. Fundamentally, he&#39;s a shitty investment. His greatest asset is an intangible brand that is only as valuable as his image. I&#39;m not expecting you have done any research into this and to merely be on the band wagon because Trump (TM) sounds like a big deal to the people of fly over country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say they couldn&#39;t, in fact, I think it&#39;s a good sign to see a political juggernaut like MoveOn flip their bit like that. I was surprised, though, as I don&#39;t follow them closely and just assumed they were still Clintonbots because they were <em>staunchly</em> pro-Clinton back in the day - which is why I said, &quot;That&#39;s interesting&quot; - because it&#39;s genuinely interesting. And kind of cool, I guess. No need to get snippy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All the stuff the media has been ignoring? Are you serious? You don&#39;t think if they had dirt on Trump they would have used it by now? They were so desperate they tried to use eminent domain against him even though every other politician running like the Bush&#39;s/Clintons have also used it. The reason they can&#39;t stand Trump is because he is an outsider that refused donations, and doesn&#39;t have much if any dirt on him. So they can&#39;t control him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, that&#39;s the gist of it. And to the extent it&#39;s true, it&#39;s a fair point. You&#39;d almost be a fool as a businessman not to buy politicians when it&#39;s de facto legal, the cost-benefit is so high, and all your competition are doing it. </p>

<p>As to Trump being a liar, part of me thinks people know he&#39;s lying, but are so sick of the typical politician-style lying that they would prefer the candidate who&#39;s obviously lying to the one who everyone can pretend is not lying. If Clinton gets elected, she&#39;ll break most of her promises and sell out to the highest bidder, but there&#39;ll likely not be enough impetus to do anything about it. If Trump gets elected, the lies will be so egregious, and just plain bad lies, that it will show everyone how bad the electoral system has become. President Trump may just be the straw that breaks the camel&#39;s back. He may be just the jolt we need to actually address the greatest problems of our day. </p>
