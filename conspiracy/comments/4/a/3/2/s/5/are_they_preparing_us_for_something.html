       Looking at some of the most popular movies over the last 5-10 years I can't help but wonder if we are being prepared for a uncertain future.
      </p>
      <p>
       The core elements I see are:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Destruction of the planet
       </strong>
       Movies like 2012, San Andreas, The Day after tomorrow, The 100 etc. are all playing of this. They might be on to something, and trying to makes us used to the tought of a total destruction of the planet as we know it.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Survival on earth
       </strong>
       Through entertainment we are being tought how to survive after this event (survivor man, bear grills, alone, the hunger games, the maze runner, the martian, The 100)
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Living in Space
       </strong>
       The 100, Elysium, Wall-E
      </p>
      <p>
       It is worth noticing that The 100 touches all these subjects, and that often only the young are the ones surviving on earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure if I'm connecting dots that doesn't have anything to do with each other, or if I'm on to something.

       I used to think the same thing, except it was back in the days of the original X-Files. A lot of shit was about aliens back then. Yet no alien invasion didn't happen. As far as I know. There are certain themes that become popular and everybody jumps on the bandwagon to make a buck of it. Catastrophic movies, alien movies, vampires, zombies, space, etc. it's all been done for as long as movies existed and it will be done in the future too.

       Lol we get It, you like the 100. I'll admit guilty pleasure, you know, I come for the lesbian smooching and I stay for the bold plot moving coincidences!

       I would think so.
      </p>
      <p>
       I watched
       <a href="https://youtu.be/-Qa9IU1Z6ic">
        https://youtu.be/-Qa9IU1Z6ic
       </a>
       this video where the commentator breaks down a couple frames from Justin Biebers - Where Are U Now.  The frames are moving so so fast that you miss most of the pictures.  A lot are vulgar and feature death in one way or another.  Lot's of anti-Christ symbolism and some more in your face pictures.  It also has secret society symbols strewn through out.
      </p>
      <p>
       A particular thing he mentioned was this one frame where at the top it said "2013 was a test, 2014 was practice."
      </p>
      <p>
       He finishes analyzing the music video and then he begins to talk about two another things.  I bring this up because it has to do with Children.
      </p>
      <p>
       He talks about these Murals in the Denver, Colorado airport if I recall correct.  There was 1 of a Samurai/robot/nazi looking guy killing a white dove and parents crying.  The next photo showed dead animals and a torn up world.  Then the next showed Children under a rainbow, in a new world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I found it interesting because on the World Economic magazine 2015 the Pan Piper is clearly on the front cover.  The piper lures children away.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also talks about Aliens too but my paraphrasing isn't doing it justice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if you want to see how truly ridiculous and repulsive the "art" that the pop industry is putting out, read about blonde superfreak stole my brain by Miley Cyrus.  It's a video but there is no music.  It's like David Lynch mixed with (what I could only imagine) mkultra programming.
      </p>

       Edit; completed the post.

       That Denver airport thing...the whole place is a giant masonic center, I've seen the masonic dedication stone that is situated there.

       Bieber's video (which I've only just seen, the one linked in your post), Bieber is likely a 'monarch' (mind control victim) and he is used to seed/promote the Illuminati's agenda. That video seems to be the same Illuminati 'nose thumbing' at the masses...4th wall tactics to show us their nefarious activities and plans.

       Oh I know about Mind Control.  I do.  It's really really sad to think that many of today's modern pop stars are slaves.  Showing videos of being all tortured or covered in blood for money and the masses love it.  Maybe confused, or perhaps dressed in a way I'm sure that any loving parent would be so sad to see.  It's weird to think of slaves dangled in front of us for money and we do not give a damn.
      </p>

       I mostly brought this video up, with the video I posted because it touches on the subjects you wanted to discuss.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you watched The Sleep Room?  I watched it last night...amazing.  Rotten Tomatoes gives it 100%.  It's a bit long, but it talks about some MKultra experiments that happened in Canada.  I think if you want to spread the word that's the video to show.  Then if you want to go deep into all areas of mind control from Bluebird, paperclip, artichoke, mkultra and so on, check out

       put it together.  The links (especially the wanttoknow links) and videos are very well formatted, important and full of information that is accessible to the general public.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, thanks for touching on the airport thing.  Last time I was at the Calgary Airport (4 years ish ago). They had all there posters up along the hallway that made me feel very uncomfortable.  It all sort of hinted to a new technology age.  Some resembled chip/bank card implants.  I wish I could remember better the exact premise but Airports are a weird place to be if you look at the art they pick.

       Actually, the Where Are U Now music video was a public thing. People came in and they each got one frame of the video to color on. And, people being people, there were bound to be some odd drawings.

       He means this...the details that come out of the corporate entertainment industry (the BS about random fans doing all this), might just be for 'useless eaters' ears only. The industry lies (geddit), in fact the industry itself IS a giant lie...there is no test to judge the veracity of any of their claims.  Never has been, never will be.

       What I am saying is, that the entertainment industry LIES. Listen...it is not complicated. Useless eaters, like you and me...are told things on a need to know basis.

      <p>
       Yes...they had folk come in and do drawings yada, yada...where did they source the folk from...goddamn masonic and OTO lodges?  Therefore, it is clear that the 'fluffy kids do drawings' is really just a front, a front for the real agenda that is buried within and behind it.

       I don't understand what YOU are saying. Yes the event and frames obviously took place. Did they edit and arrange them in a random fashion and it just so happens that they chose a pretty good portion of Illuminati symbolism? No, and if my point isn't clear to you now then we disagree.

       What I mean is its true that a bunch of fans did create the drawings but then the producers chose to arrange the bits and pieces of those drawings take a look at the link if you didn't already.

       Like I get that.  But that would mean a lot of his fans are fans of death and very so dislike Christianity.  If you go to the video and press play and stop throughout it with the sound off you'll see things.  Again, even if it was only his fans, someone had to put together all the pictures and decided that someone writing "George Bush did 911" and "Kill the poor" "hand jobs for God". "Love the Devil back" and other gore filled pictures needed to be there.  Not that ALL of the pictures were gross, but enough of them were not uplifting.  They were moving so fast too that it's bound to get into the subconscious (of children) through subliminal messages.  So I mean, yeah, I bet a lot of fans put their art out there but someone had to do the final orchestration of the video.  They decided to get right into it.  You could even point out the fact that they were just being Edgy and Attention grabbing.  Even if that was the only factor, why is being Edgy so popular? We all know that Mass Media is pushed upon us from most of the same people.  They have the final word, and they pick...edgy?  Filled with violence and sex? What's the purpose to that? I mean, I feel like, there's more too it then just the fans.  Plus, in the video I posted he brought up and interesting thing.  If you have a PC open your note pad.  Hold Alt, then on the number pad punch in 666.  You get the U symbol that's thrown all throughout his video.  So, I mean, even if not Bieber, and even if not his fans, someone went through a lot of work to ensure some pretty vile things got shot right into the cornea of people who watched it

       I really don't think you know what you're talking about. The song is produced by Skrillex and Diplo, who go as JACK Ü. The reason the ü shows up so much is because that's their thing. it's their logo.
      </p>
      <p>
       And about all the edgy weird shit? If you look at the other stuff skrill's done, he's big into weird edgy vaporwave style A E S T H E T I C sort of stuff. It's like his whole label's thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't believe me, check out some of the other stuff from his label. You'll notice it's all pretty edgy. FFS there's a song called
       <strong>
        <em>
         666!
        </em>
       </strong>
       .

       I wouldn't say I have it all wrong.  I was just saying what the gentlemen in the video was saying, not trying to go off in a tangent.  Also, that U shows up other places, like the cover of Just Dance.  It also really fits the theme of the music video.  I was talking to my brother and he said it could be the program to get that letter to look like that as keyboards don't come with it naturally.  Yes, I know being Edgy is the thing (and had been for a while).  What I am saying is, why?  I mean it's gotten to the point where things aren't edgy anymore and now main stream.  The problem with that is becoming desensitized, and needing more to find feeling.  I do realize that people listen to metal/hard hip hop/grind core.  I'm aware that violence has been a part of society from the beginning.  I am also aware that it is reaching a high and in a lot of media.  So, I wasn't trying to say it is not a thing, I am saying that it is obscenely present in many aspects of life.  In areas where we almost don't have the option to say "no" unless we want to be a shut in.  Being edgy is no longer a niche and is being produced to the masses.  So what, is the new edgy going to be video drome?  Because as a society we just accept.  We talk about what and when and who.  Rarely why or how.  I think it's important.  Even if I am wrong in some areas of my post, I don't think it deserves a "You have it all wrong.". We are here to converse ideas and opinions and not just shut the other person down because their conclusions or theories don't line up with yours.  I am willing to admit fault in my thinking through decent conversation and the presentation of facts, thoughts, ideas, and information.  I am not willing to be shot down for sharing thoughts.  So yes, skrillex is edgy.  Why is being edgy popular?

       I'm sorry if I came off a little intense. You know how it is when you talk about something you're passionate about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do agree with you though. About edgy being a recurring theme of pop art. It's odd how many people are willing to be very very edgy, and that people are totally desensitized to it. I definitely know some people irl who are edgy just for the sake of it.

       I do get it too.  I can't say I never felt passionate about things that weren't 100% uplifting.  Like, I used to Love Avenged Sevenfold ( back in 2009/2010).  Then I started to get nightmares and thought I was insane, so I toned it down. I also really liked Alesana at the same time.  So, I mean, no bodies perfect and innocent all the time, or will always pick the most joyous or movies/songs/games/words.  I just think it's sad that it is everywhere these days.  For instance, and I do know we talked about this already, the Justin Bieber music video.  Yes, it may have went quite smoothly with Skrills style.  Keeping true to yourself is important.  That being said, the frames were moving so fast!  You can barely see most of them.  There are still little kids and young adults who enjoy Justin Bieber though.  The music video sounds like a really cool idea, so you watch it.  Or you love any of those Artists and so you watch it.  It goes into what I'm saying about (in it's own way) removing choice from people's day to day lives.  It was done under the subliminal that you might not even realize how gross some slides truly are.  So you don't think, not to watch it.  However, subliminal messages have strong effect on people, and when we can't transfer the information to our conscious brain, we can't discern it and instead take it as is. I think it's important to exercise the free will, and the choice to use that or even want to use that is on a decline.

       Not just in pop art are things Edgy.  If you can read about Death in the fashion industry, I highly recommend.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are interested you can read some things yourself about marketing, the start of consumerism, and subliminal messages.  All truly interesting topics.  Sort of sad when you see how it's all played through our emotions instead of genuinely building an opinion based of the products use in the consumer's life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for the reply, btw.  I'm glad we can still be civil.  I also hope not to sound judgmental about what you enjoy either.  Just another way to look at things.

       Corporate brainwashing...all these consumer 'tards think that the choices they're making are their own...what films to watch, what music to listen to etc etc. It is all designed for them, it is in the corporate entertainment world, at least (peer pressure does the rest). It is an illusion of choice...but in reality it's Hobson's choice.

       The military-industrial complex isn't tired of it, and they're drumming up more wars. And some idiots buy in to it. If everyone were tired of war, it would stop. It frustrates me how engineered wars are, and how the dupe millions of people in to supporting these wars for billionaires.

       On a related note I want all young people to know that the fifties and sixties were not overrun with racist womanizing anti-gay white males. I have seen at least two sci-fi series now that depict this -- Agent Carter and Legends of Tomorrow. I have stopped watching both b/c their depictions are so far out of line with reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, TV is getting hard to watch b/c it almost seems like every show is telling us that if you aren't a minority, gay or at least in a mixed-race relationship, then you are a bad person.

       Watching the Trump thing last night and I'm thinking who the hell was screening the crowd. If you ask me, he should be watching his back a little better. There is a potential powder keg there. He gets taken out and it's middle class white vs minorities in the streets while  the PTB sit back and sip their tea.

       They are creating a distraction so they can make their getaway easier now that they are almost finished with stripping this continents wealth.

       Like most farmers, they know you have to let fields go fallow so that they may recover their ability to grow crops.

       If you are awake, you can sorta feel that there are some big changes in store for humans in the near future (next 50~ years). I do not know what they will be, but you can guess that some of things talked about on this sub and futurology will come down the tube. People are trying to understand and predict what will happen. The movies are just people trying to make a buck off of people's fears.

       No, before movies there were books, and there is plenty of science fiction, fantasy, futuristic, etc. Plus these are the popular topics these days, so people incorporate them into films, for fame, status and profit. Are there movies with intent to spread propaganda, you betcha, military, political, but you can't take every movie released and try to connect dots that don't exist.

       I mean go ahead and be paranoid if that's what you want, you asked a question and I gave you an answer. You can see when it all happened, the Alien craze, science fiction, I understand that 6 companies control everything, but since 6 companies didn't control the free thinking authors of the many books written about all subjects you mentioned, I'd say that it's pretty clear its just human progression of thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, the truth isn't paranoid delusions of a grand master plan, but it is somewhere in the middle, yes there is control, yes there is censorship, yes a lot of it is propaganda filled, but films are made by people, there isn't anyone there to make sure that some agenda plays out, you're just making entertainment. But you know, if that's how you want to think the world works, that's probably what they want you to think, that they have THAT much control over things, they don't, it's an illusion, and you're imagining the prison bars on your own.
