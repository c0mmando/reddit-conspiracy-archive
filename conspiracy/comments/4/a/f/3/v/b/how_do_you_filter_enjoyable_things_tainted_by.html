       I think we all enjoy movies, TV shows, technology etc. But a lot of it is controlled or produced by Zionists and their minions. So many movies and TV shows which are considered good have either Jewish writers, producers, actors, or directors. I really liked Seinfeld, Groucho Marx, and Woody Allen before I became aware. Now it's hard to watch these personas who at first glance seemed to be brilliant, but are in actuality devoted to evil. Not to mention movies and technology (like Intel and IBM, which Isreal produces a lot of parts for them).
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you overcome these conflicting feelings? Should I just simply ban entertainment associated with Zionists?

       Home movies, high school plays, your own puppet booth? Forget it, they own it up to and including the books the movies are based on. Just be discerning: if in the first little while, your shit detector goes off, hit eject, turn it off. I do it all the time. My wife hates it because she gets sucked in. When I point out what a dismal piece of crap, the implications, the perverse, depressing, twisted, agenda riddled, pile of cat puke hairball it is, she gets mad. Later she wonders why she feels mopey, under the weather, melancholy. I escape to the garage, a hobby and am trying a gentler more scholastic approach with her.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is Hollywood is not even trying anymore. The have zero respect for the audience, actually I'd call it scorn tinged with a passive aggressive malevolence. These days the movies are dismal!
      </p>
      <p>
       I dare you to watch an old Gunsmoke episode. In one hour I feel like I've seen a very well produced movie with actual stories and no creepy stuff.

       But what about past legends - especially the ones I mentioned? Seinfeld, Groucho Marx or even Allen were undeniably brilliant and they were before the current era of affairs. Do you believe they should be forgotten and ignored as well?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I have to be frank here - I watched the first season of Nathan For You. Nathan Fielder is the host so you can probably understand who (or what) he is. Either way, the show is a very clever critique of capitalism and blind faith that I can't help myself but find it both very humorous and insightful. But you see, I am faced with this inner conflict - how should I feel about it knowing who the creator is?
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW, Gunsmoke came into existence only because William S. Paley  - a half Jew, requested it. Also he was the president of CBS until 1959, so he was responsible for approving the Gunsmoke TV series...

       Yes and yes. The nascent Zionists were happy to have a home, loved America or, at least, were appreciative of not being tattooed and slaughtered. The post war era was a time of new beginnings. The mild anti-semitism of most americans was "they're cheap" or at worst, they'll cheat you. But, at the time we had a stereotype of EVERY ethnicity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I love the work of those you mention, genius uniquely suited to story telling and entertainment. Now there's the Vampire Squid and a dark malevolence in everything. It's like the positive, charming ones we grew up with are tired of their toys, or they're NOT thrilled to be here, they certainly feel their power, and you know what is said about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm afraid it's generational and we're hosted now by a generation that does "just enough" and no more. Is it more insular and hating out there? It doesn't have to be. Why the constant corrupting influence. That wasn't the case before. Gunsmoke, StarTrek, morality tales with a message. Now, robotic haunted man defuses a bomb and doesn't particularly care whether it goes off or not.

       Do you believe it was some sort of a process of domesticating the Americans to accept the 'outsiders' as their own and eventually stab the foster nation in the back?

       But see, William S. Paley was the one who initiated the creation of Gunsmoke, and the original Star Trek series was produced by Fred Feiberger, while Oscar Katz was the one who was pushing Star Trek to be produced. We should also not forget Rick Berman and Micahel Piller who served as writers and producers later on... What are your thoughts on that?

       Domestication? No. This isn't Babylon, Egypt, or Rome. These people are no longer SLAVES. They don't have to consider themselves fostered. Do you think a 4th generation Italian wastes time wondering if he's part of the national experiment or that he belongs? Nope. Furthermore, there is no resentment for ancient slights. My statement about it being generational is akin to the the process where by, say, the child of the depression works his ass off to get his kids in college and professional positions, those kids have children who WILL NOT work as hard as either. Perhaps uniquely the Jews are able to hold on to their bailiwicks, unlike a typical white who will blow it all and run away. Now that the, not hard working 4th generation has the property, they aren't working enough to appear to deserve the mantle of the penultimate purveyors of entertainment and media. They're just phoning it in! That's why it stinks. Your last paragraph will receive no argument. I appreciate all their contributions.

       Not sure they're Jewish, though I do see Stone's mom was Jewish. Even more interesting to me that they're from Littleton, CO, where the Columbine shooting took place. If you listen to Jay Parker, the former Satanist who allegedly grew up in a subservient lower level bloodline family, towns that end in "ton" are often controlled and/or dominated by Satanic families.
