    <div class="md"><p>I applaud you Chappie, nicely done and well-timed. People have to realise that the Divide and Conquer strategy, deployed by agents of the self-dubbed &quot;elite&quot;, is one of their most successful weapons used against us. It&#39;s nothing more than a rather effective psychological operation put out as bait to be taken by the weak, the easily manipulated. Once we all see it for what it is, it will cease to be an effective tool in their arsenal and it will dry up and blow away. Until then, gullible people with misplaced rage will pathologically continue fighting one another over inane, differences and assumed superiorities. We fight one another, whilst our collective enemies use this to distract our focus and fortify their war against us, laughing all the while at our stupidity. </p>

<p>We&#39;re getting played people and it&#39;s time to wake the fuck up and get our shit together. These differences will seem trivial once we realise we&#39;re all getting screwed from the top down by predator scum who look down on ALL of us the same, and treat us all like their livestock.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Making more than you need is a matter of perspective.
Who determines how much is too much? You? A group of politically elected bureaucrats? Bernie Sanders?
Should everyone live in a sort of grey shared misery as long as one person is not at the same level?
To be sure, there is inequity in the world. There always has been and there always will be. 
Consider this. People are motivated by many things including money. Some people are creative and as a result of their creativity in combination with the motivation of money, they build something that makes them insanely wealthy. Then they keep developing things that people like and buy which makes them wealthier. I would put Steve Jobs in that group. 
Do you think for one minute that if there wasn&#39;t an insane amount of compensation for himself and his employees he could have hired the incredible talent that built Apple computers? Do you think random people off the street could have done the same thing?
People are worth whatever other people are willing to pay them. </p>

<p>The notion that we are all somehow equal and should all have equal incomes is both idealistic and childish. At least in the US, you have the ability to pursue your dreams. It happens every day. Some succeed some fail. But it&#39;s possible and a lot of people come from nothing and become wealthy. </p>

<p>The communist/socialist ideal of the proletariat being equal and all receiving equal incomes has proven to fail every time. Just look at the Soviet Union. In that world, You will always have intelligent and creative people who won&#39;t participate because there is no reward, and you will always have freeloaders who love the system because they don&#39;t have to do anything and can still be provided for. Then you have the rest of the population that lives a grey existence of monotony because they are just getting by. </p>

<p>Nice way to live huh?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“When you call yourself an Indian or a Muslim or a Christian or a European, or anything else, you are being violent. Do you see why it is violent? Because you are separating yourself from the rest of mankind. When you separate yourself by belief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds violence. So a man who is seeking to understand violence does not belong to any country, to any religion, to any political party or partial system; he is concerned with the total understanding of mankind.” -  Jiddu Krishnamurti</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you think there are enough opportunities for upward mobility for everyone to escape poverty? You literally think that because you got lucky and your hard work paid off, everyone is capable of doing well for themselves? You don&#39;t think people can work hard and remain poor?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think I am &quot;lucky&quot; I don&#39;t think anyone is. I think that you choose to make it or you don&#39;t. Work isn&#39;t hard it&#39;s just something you have to do. Like it or not that&#39;s the way it is. </p>

<p>Of course I don&#39;t think there are enough opportunities to go around, but on that same argument that isn&#39;t part of the whole equation because many won&#39;t work to get it.</p>

<p>They expect it to be given to them. For those that are willing to go for it sure there is enough. </p>

<p>I also believe that those who you say are working hard and are still poor are by choice. You don&#39;t have to kill yourself to make it in this world. They settle for what&#39;s handed to them. I seen it time and time again stay with a company for two decades and think they give a fuck about you? Lol</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t anyone that cares about you more then you. So keep that mindset. Selfless acts of being that worker bee are so stupid. You have to adapt and overcome or you will fail. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>just for posterity&#39;s sake, I assume you are a male. Second nationality and age? </p>

<p>Not trying to &quot;out&quot; you just want to paint a better picture. If you think these things, like Gender, age, and race have nothing to do with yous ability to pull one up by their boots straps, you might want to research some of the more common experiences, and not basis your opinion off of one experience.</p>

<p>I had a similar discussion with my roommates about how most companies don&#39;t observe any holidays and place it upon the worker to pick and choose when they want off. They&#39;ve been lucky enough that they&#39;ve  had vacation and holidays every job they&#39;ve ahd(crazy sounding right). They for the life of them could not wrap their heads around the fact that there is nothing that forces a company to give you any time off. Then tried to say that it&#39;s because of the government that they get days off.(governement employees don&#39;t work, so we don&#39;t have to either) If you did not know there is no law that requires any business to grant specific days off. These are benefits to working where ever you work.</p>

<p>So as &quot;easy&quot; as it may have been for you and your situation, it does not mean its is equally as easy for others? Like I&#39;m a tall person, so for me touching the ceiling is easy, high shelves are my friend. All these experiences are easy for me, for no active reason. I don&#39;t have to put extra effort into being tall, I&#39;m already tall. So while you were strong-willed and determined in the face of sleeping on the sidewalk being tormented by passersby others won&#39;t have the same reaction or even the same mental tools to cope with such an experience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am male</p>

<p>37</p>

<p>Native American</p>

<p>Was beat thru my birth to around 17 years old. Put into a hospital 2 times when I was a toddler and had to learn to walk and talk again. </p>

<p>Been homeless before cause my father told me to stand on my feet like a man. Did that for 2 years but still had a job. Wouldn&#39;t take a hand out for shit cause I didn&#39;t earn it.</p>

<p>Currently making 87k a year have a wife and son. Own everything save the house that we rent cause I don&#39;t want that kinda debt right now with uncertian return.</p>

<p>Been at my job for 5 years but served in the Navy for 7 at one time. </p>

<p>My views are my own I realize that. Also don&#39;t feel people try hard enough. I know when I didn&#39;t then I got bad or no results. When I applied myself it always worked for the better.</p>

<p>Many people feel they should be Pat on the head and given a glass of milk before bed cause I feel it&#39;s parents fault for raising such a inept person. </p>

<p>World is hard it&#39;s going to be. You get thrown a lemon you make orange juice so everyone can say how the fuck did you do that. It&#39;s what I have always done once I realized it&#39;s the way it is. </p>

<p>Nothing and no one will change it cause it can&#39;t. The way of humanity will falter. People don&#39;t want to contribute then they should be left to die. Progression of the species is more important then you, me, or anyone else. </p>

<p>Someday I have a feeling this is what it will come to. Cause people with my mindset are the ones that run this world. So do it or don&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we&#39;re sitting here on reddit with a computer using the internet, we already have plenty big enough a piece.  There are people who have never even seen the internet before or touched a computer.  We are among the lucky ones and we should realize and appreciate that.  How much is enough?  Taking from others is just bringing more misery into the world than already exists for the sake of our own ego and selfishness.  I would rather work together with others and try to create something better for us all.  Maybe it&#39;s a pipe dream but whether it is or not I have no interest in selfishly taking from others and giving to myself.  I already have enough.</p>

<p>Let me ask you this: if you could take $100,000 from a person but you had to see the consequences of this with your own eyes, if you had to see this person every day starving in the street outside your window, groveling for change in their own filth, and eventually just dying in the gutter... would you still take the money?</p>

<p>Just like my sons school asked me to buy shit for the entire grade I told them no.</p>

<p>Just because I make 5x the annual income of 80% of resistants doesn&#39;t mean I am there to make sure their children have what mine does. It&#39;s detrimental to their knowledge that sometimes your best just isn&#39;t good enough.</p>

<p>If their parents cared they would strive to make their good better and their better the mother fucking best.</p>

<p>Word for word I said that at the PTA.</p>

<p>People may not like it but thruout my life if I failed at something I did it again to fail better till I succeeded. </p>

<p>I dont think I asked you how to use google, I asked <em>your</em> opinion on the subject, but its ok if you want to hide behind wiki links and attack me with sarcastic nonsense. </p>

<p>Yes, lots of people died on these revolutions, but it doesnt argue against the ideology, it just shows that it takes lots of effort and blood to dismantle the current system, in which a <em>huge</em> number of people die everyday because of money-digging imperialism. But of course you dont care about innocents in Africa and the Middle East being target of US blood spillings for money, you are a &quot;hard worker&quot; and thats why you &quot;live well&quot; under capitalism. Capitalism works only by granting a decent living for a few in the expense of the exploration of the majorty, and thats something economic develpoment is <em>never</em> going to change, no matter how much they try to convince you of that. Now, I could get into modern day work-slavery, but I guess you would dismiss that too as &quot;not being an issue&quot;.</p>

<p>From the last link (which i didnt have the time to read completely yet)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Free market] therefore provide the environment that can best inspire people to develop practical solutions to economic and social challenges </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thats my problem with it. Which people? The poor with no access to education? Third-world industrial countries factory workers? <em>No</em>. You need capital to create business, so thats out of the poor&#39;s reach. Also, businesses dont change the life of the poor because the profit from economic growth is channeled to the burgeoise. When the article says it does improve poverty, its because outsourced production makes life better in rich countries while developing and poor ones are left in chaos. I know that well, since im from Brazil. </p>

<p>Im not trying to say socialism is the perfect alternative, but capitalism is perfect at masking its own wrong doings and brainwashing people into thinking its the <em>only</em> alternative, so much that people dismiss socialism/communism without even doing research. Thats what im sick of. Sorry again for the wall of text, but I prefer doing that rather than linking isolated sources which dont show the real picture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Capitalism has historically done more to lift all people out of poverty than socialism and communism has. A common modern comparison was when Boris Yeltsin visited a Houston super market and exclaimed how crazy it was to have all these different types of foods all stocked. More jarring to him was that the super market didn&#39;t have lines going out the door for the basics. </p>

<p>What this (and many other examples) seems to signify is that when you give people more freedom compared to a centrally planned economy: people are happier, able to do jobs they love, can reinvest back in the community, and are able to raise a family, amongst many other things. </p>

<p>Some socialists and communists may take issue with the label &quot;Centrally Planned&quot; but as all real-world examples have shown, both socialism and communism end up with a powerful central government, and powerful central governments, no matter what type of economy the actual country has, seem to be predispositioned to violence and ineptitude. A latest example of this would be Venezuela.</p>

<p>Lastly, if you take a look at Thailand. It isn&#39;t turning socialist or communist or anything, but they do have a military junta in command of the country and economy. Prior to the coup, Thailand was on pace to be a South Asian economic powerhouse. Since the military has seized control of certain aspects of the country, and violently halted freedoms that the Thai people enjoyed just a few years ago the economy has been trending downward, as well as the value of the Baht. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a major misunderstanding about what &quot;socialism&quot; and &quot;capitalism&quot; really are. Marx originally referred to Socialism as an intermediary state between capitalism and communism. Marx called for workers to own the implements of capitalism. In some models of socialism, this equates to worker representation on the boards of the corporations in which they are employed. In Germany, around half of the board positions are inhabited by workers. This is a proven model which motivates workers while at the same time leads to better working conditions and higher productivity.</p>

<p>Capitalism is a very generic term and generally means private ownership of the implements of capitalism. You can have both a socialist system and a capitalist system in the same legal system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your seeming defense of socialism is misguided. The problem with socialism and the reason it fails is that the state owns, or in pseudo socialist systems, controls the means of production. It is a sad irony that the younger generation in America recognizes the crony capitalistic corruption of the state yet believes empowering the state even more will improve things. Any system that empowers the state over the individual&#39;s right of free exchange is not only doomed to failure but makes slaves of the people in the process. </p>

<p>The fact that the under 30&#39;s do not understand the basic inherent value of capitalism versus any state coerced economic system is an incitement of the public school system. All one needs is common sense and the ability to reason to know these truths but since those things are no longer being taught we will likely end up as subjects of a tyrannical central authority that supposedly knows best how to take care of us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may be reading things into my comment. Socialism isn&#39;t a single system, nor is capitalism. There are different models of socialism, just as there are different models of capitalism. Does that make any sense?</p>

<p>Capitalism and socialism are generic terms. In general, capitalism refers to private ownership of production/industry/etc... whereas socialism is an intermediary state between capitalism and communism. There are also different models of communism, believe it or not -- some are wildly different from others. This is political science 101.</p>

<p>In the German model (which is capitalistic and socialistic), corporate boards are staffed with 50% workers. In the US model (which is capitalistic and socialistic), some workers are paid stock options as a bonus, which means they own part of the system of production.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I think there is a very coordinated effort to divide and conquer movements, and society as a whole. Once people are separated, they are easier to control. Groupthink sets in, Stockholm Syndrome takes over, and anyone who has an opposing viewpoint is silenced by the smaller, limited group that is left. It&#39;s the fall of every major social movement.</p>

<p>I have most recently noticed this with Black Lives Matter. I was involved in early protests. There were many marches in many cities, all around the country. It was a very vibrant, active, and diverse group.  For example, although I am white, I am very sympathetic to the cause. If we do not stop police from murdering people in the street, and additionally obstructing justice when they need to be held accountable, it won&#39;t be long until they start murdering many more people, of all races. Additionally, the hyper-militarization of the police is a frightening trend. Currently it disproportionately harms minority communities, but it will soon harm us all.</p>

<p>After a while, the group started to splinter in multiple different directions. I think a Soros-funded group called &quot;Freedom Arts Society&quot; infiltrated the group. They started showing up to any and all protests, with what was apparently the sole purpose of making a protest look like a protest. They carried the same signs to all of them, which were all about labor rights. Black Lives Matter? Labor rights signs. Immigration reform? Labor rights signs. Syrian refugee rally? Labor rights signs. It was an odd choice, particularly for SJWs that are so militant about staying on message with movement groups.</p>

<p>The BLM leadership split off into several different and smaller leadership groups. They all had related names and missions, but none were particularly focused on BLM anymore.</p>

<p>A core group of BLM leaders kept the BLM chapter going. However they made the group a &quot;cultural safe space.&quot; I am split on my decision about that - while I&#39;m disappointed I can&#39;t join and participate, and I also see a huge irony in discriminating an entire race to discuss racial discrimination, I understand their analogy to battered women&#39;s groups not allowing men. They feel like it is necessary for them to heal.</p>

<p>But I did notice - after the group split in many different directions, you didn&#39;t see BLM protests anymore. Nobody was in the streets anymore. They were all going in separate directions, working on separate issues, and not working on the primary cause anymore. It&#39;s the largest real life example I&#39;ve seen of divide and conquer so far.</p>

Humans got past cannibalism. Civil rights was tomfoolery to many. Space flight was tomfoolery to many. The defeat of the British empire was tomfoolery to many. You do realize that the list is very very long about things that were considered impossible and tomfoolery that later became reality. You can&#39;t be so naive to think otherwise. Humans can get past war if all the poopy heads could wrap their minuscule brains around the fact that things can get better. </p>

<p>Some people just enjoy watching the world burn. Some work to extinguish the flames. Personally I will grab a water bucket. Others will spew complete nonsense that fires are unquenchable and just watch. Unbelievable as it may seem some actually start destructive fires.</p>

Yet, as we progress technologically, there is a feeling and a hope of improving our own nature, of rising from savagery.  </p>

<p>Out of all the crap we teach our kids, I don&#39;t think instilling values of tolerance, inclusion and conflict resolution are so bad. Forcing inclusion or exclusion, yes that&#39;s wrong (for example no matter how much my parents tried, I never got along with my brother) but as I said kids will feed off societal values for what&#39;s right and what&#39;s wrong and I doubt you think India&#39;s established caste system is the pinnacle of human achievement. Is it better for the child to be taught to establish a pecking order and treat others better or worse based on it? Well most people say high school sucked just for that reason. Or would it be better to teach a child to get what they want in life but try not to step on anyone else&#39;s toes on their journey or simply don&#39;t be a dick and don&#39;t let anyone be a dick to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this post. Seems like every time I&#39;m in a discussion about sexism or racism, I hear people immediately target the opposition&#39;s most extreme members(eg. &quot;Fucking feminazi&#39;s are all fat ugly man haters&quot; or &quot;Men are all disgusting pigs, and I can&#39;t feel safe if there&#39;s one nearby&quot;). Yeah, these are genuine issues, but by focusing on the worst of humankind and letting personal bias rule you, you are hurting and even reversing the process. I really do think humankind is slowly evolving to a point of harmony. Give it a few more generations, we&#39;ll get there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a few things I notice right away with this whole situation. It seems like this new generation has had it good as far as race relations for the past 8 years. This current generation was in middle school when Obama was elected now they are in their 20&#39;s and voters, activist. </p>

<p>Now, us older generation who has actually seen race related issues looks at this like its low on the scale of what we went through.</p>

<p>BUT it is similarly early familiar. It seems to be a push for communism ideology, mentality. This generation has never known the sticks and stones words do not hurt me concept. Everyone needs a safe space and protection against bullying, bullying words are punishable by harm and death according to this generation.</p>

<p>We have seen this before, Syria, Egypt, Occupy, Anonymous, Apple fan boys, everyone at this point is a pawn.</p>

<p>If you speak your mind you are a raciest, if you associate with someone that has raciest mentality then you are also a raciest. This is literally the best way to divide a nation, a group. By self control. Notice how you must really think before speaking your mind these past few months.</p>

<p>There is a game being played and all are on the same side. You have to choose which elite it will be, history shows us that they all are friends.</p>

<p>I love the casual bigotry against white people - and ONLY white people - that spews from the lips of the left.</p>

<p>You would never say &quot;there are a lot of scared racist black people that Al Sharpton caters to.&quot;</p>

<p>You&#39;d never say &quot;there are a lot of scared racist Latinos that La Raza caters too.&quot;</p>

<p>The left always and only attacks white people as &quot;racist.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why wouldn&#39;t I say that? There&#39;s plenty of racist black people who Al Sharpton especially caters too. I actually got beaten up by a few of them when I lived in Wisconsin. There&#39;s also plenty of racist Latinos. Don&#39;t know who La Raza is, but if he&#39;s catering than he&#39;s catering. </p>

<p>And it wasn&#39;t casual or inclusive of all white people. Just a like a fucking Right-winger to take my statement out of context. I said Trump knows there are scared racist white people who he&#39;s catering too. Which is true. I didn&#39;t say &quot;whites are the only racist people&quot;. Just like Al Sharpton caters to scared racist black people. </p>

<p>What a fucking joke. I thought I actually said something that was untrue until I realized you&#39;re just being an idiot. </p>

<p>Because objective truth exists, regardless of what people want to lie to themselves. Moral relativism is the psychological cause of all modern degeneracy. Some viewpoints are wrong, period, end of story. I refuse to compromise my beliefs–based in fact–to accommodate them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s only being intellectually honest to distinguish beliefs into two categories. One category is scientific beliefs, like the acceleration of gravity being 9.8 m/s on earth. I agree wholeheartedly that this belief is not relative, because it is a strictly defined value.
The other category is where I think we disagree, and it&#39;s beliefs about the value of things. Think, for example, of your opinion on abortion. You may believe it&#39;s great (or you may not), but either way there&#39;s bound to be someone who disagrees with you. Neither of you are wrong in any objective way. No equation in physics can ever give a strict valuation of abortion, or demonstrate why it&#39;s great or not great. It&#39;s a value judgment. Neither the person who believes abortion is great nor the one who thinks it&#39;s not great is &quot;wrong&quot; in any objective sense, and their beliefs are true for each of them. Wouldn&#39;t that constitute a relative truth? What&#39;s true for one (i.e. &quot;abortion is great&quot;) is not true for the other.</p>

<p>Now I agree these two categories are fundamentally different and shouldn&#39;t be lumped together or talked about as though they&#39;re the same thing. Do we agree on this point?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think what you&#39;re describing has anything to do with moral relativism, I think that term describes this type of statement: &quot;What about Hitler&#39;s reign was really wrong? Under his leadership Germany actually came back from their depression and had a great economy, some would say that it was the best era for Germany, who decides what is good and what isn&#39;t? To some, Hitler&#39;s reign was the best time for Germany, and to flat out call that time period a failure simply is wrong because while some suffered, many other prospered. Can you really subjectively say that there was anything wrong with his reign?&quot; Oh god I realize how stupid that example was, forgive me for resorting to another Hitler discussion, but basically I think moral relativism has nothing really to do with what you&#39;re proposing, just that people relate based on common goals rather than opposing ideas on solutions. That we don&#39;t succumb to the hegelian dialectic that the elite impose on us, and break down the illusion.</p>

The Muslims and blacks are led around by their noses by the Jews, who are orchestrating the attack on the white race. Unless whites unite, our race will be gone in a century or two. We  have the power to save it and restore its strength, but it will require courage and conviction in the rightness of our cause. All our enemies have to use against us are lies. Once you recognize this, you have freed your mind. Western civilization is white Christian civilization, and if it is to survive, white Christians must survive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>just for posterity&#39;s sake, I assume you are a male. Second nationality and age? </p>

<p>Not trying to &quot;out&quot; you just want to paint a better picture. If you think these things, like Gender, age, and race have nothing to do with yous ability to pull one up by their boots straps, you might want to research some of the more common experiences, and not basis your opinion off of one experience.</p>

<p>I had a similar discussion with my roommates about how most companies don&#39;t observe any holidays and place it upon the worker to pick and choose when they want off. They&#39;ve been lucky enough that they&#39;ve  had vacation and holidays every job they&#39;ve ahd(crazy sounding right). They for the life of them could not wrap their heads around the fact that there is nothing that forces a company to give you any time off. Then tried to say that it&#39;s because of the government that they get days off.(governement employees don&#39;t work, so we don&#39;t have to either) If you did not know there is no law that requires any business to grant specific days off. These are benefits to working where ever you work.</p>

<p>So as &quot;easy&quot; as it may have been for you and your situation, it does not mean its is equally as easy for others? Like I&#39;m a tall person, so for me touching the ceiling is easy, high shelves are my friend. All these experiences are easy for me, for no active reason. I don&#39;t have to put extra effort into being tall, I&#39;m already tall. So while you were strong-willed and determined in the face of sleeping on the sidewalk being tormented by passersby others won&#39;t have the same reaction or even the same mental tools to cope with such an experience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may be reading things into my comment. Socialism isn&#39;t a single system, nor is capitalism. There are different models of socialism, just as there are different models of capitalism. Does that make any sense?</p>

<p>Capitalism and socialism are generic terms. In general, capitalism refers to private ownership of production/industry/etc... whereas socialism is an intermediary state between capitalism and communism. There are also different models of communism, believe it or not -- some are wildly different from others. This is political science 101.</p>

<p>In the German model (which is capitalistic and socialistic), corporate boards are staffed with 50% workers. In the US model (which is capitalistic and socialistic), some workers are paid stock options as a bonus, which means they own part of the system of production.</p>
