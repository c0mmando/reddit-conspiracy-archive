       "Just as Trump and his supporters have the right to assemble and speak, his opponents likewise have the right to peaceably protest.  They do not have the right to overrun Trump’s rallies, nor to silence opposition.  This is an important point.  The rights we enjoy in this nation are not enjoyed the world over.  We have the opportunity to speak and debate and engage in the free flow of ideas.  This is the very foundation of the civil society.  The first step toward tyranny is to remove that ability."
      </p>
      <p>
       "This ideology says, “If I don’t like what you have to say, it’s perfectly justifiable to shut you down.”  Of what else is such an ideology capable?  History gives us the answer, and it’s deeply troubling.  To be sure, it’s a long road from point A to point Z, but for those to whom the end justifies the means, it’s a smooth, straight road."

       It's OK to act violent in this manner when you're protesting "conservatives" or the "right".

       I've noticed some of the most violent and intolerant people are the ones claiming to be liberal and tolerant.  It's a shame.

       You're asking a sub full of progressive liberals of their own actions are justified?  Good luck with that.  They claim to be open minded and impartial, but they're just as bad if not worse than those on their "other side".  Too blind to see it, or they do but don't care.  They're authoritarian fascists, but believe themselves to be on the "right side"; they're the "good guys" and everyone with a different opinion is evil.  They will stick their heads in the sand or run away rather than entertain any cognitive dissonance.  Pathetic, really.

       are the one who said that a group of protesters violated Trump's right to assemble.  If you can't answer those questions, then you should probably rethink your statement or maybe find a different source for the right to assemble.

       Again, you need to describe where the right of assembly comes from, whose rights it protects, and who it protects those rights from.

      <p>
       You haven't established that anyone's rights were actually violated. When you do, I'll be willing to carry the discussion further.
