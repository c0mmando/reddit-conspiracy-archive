    <div class="md"><p>Most people dismiss conspiracy theorists as paranoid, the opposite of rational. The truth is, I read conspiracies as a critical thinking exercise. I entertain thoughts and evaluate evidence with no regard for whether the context makes me feel good or bad. Once you are &quot;woke&quot;, you understand that divide and conquer tribalism is the reason we have a left/right paradigm, but it does not reflect who we really are.</p>

<p>Sometimes I feel like I have my feet in both worlds, the left and the right. I don&#39;t want to live in a world of one or the other. A lot of these bullshit issues in the media are there just to distract us from what&#39;s really going on. </p>

<p>There&#39;s an uproar of identity politics and reactionary politics right now that is dividing us, and that&#39;s what they want. PC culture and the backlash blinds us to REAL diversity, not of surface-level stuff but DEEP diversity. We all have our own unique experiences. You can be gay and believe in gun rights. You can be Jewish not support Israel. You can be a Wall Street tycoon and support campaign finance reform.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The original two parties in this country were the Democratic-Republican party and the Federalist party. </p>

<p>The Federalist party represented centralized power acquisition of more land into the union. It&#39;s more or less the &quot;new world order&quot; type of mentality that so many people here are against. It was very unpopular, having only one or two presidents get elected before the party was abolished. It never really went away as a mentality, just as an official party.</p>

<p>The Democratic-Republican Party, more or less, evolved into the Democratic and Republican parties we have today, with lots of changing of hands, and the Whig Party being one of the two parties for a while.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d argue RT <em>is</em> propaganda, but no more so than CNN, MSNBC, FOX, etc. RT is fairly valuable in covering the faults of US governments and corporations that US MSM doesn&#39;t cover, but there&#39;s a benefit in this for Russia, and that&#39;s why they cover these stories. </p>

<p>Syria and Ukraine, I likely agree with you. They seem to be playing defense to US/NATO&#39;s aggression. Russia is the only one in Syria under the permission and request of Syria&#39;s only government which can be said to be legitimate. </p>

<p>I will grant you that there does seem to still be an anti-Russian bias here. Part of it&#39;s a holdover from decades of anti-Soviet propaganda, though some of it stems from a theory that on a higher level of the 3D chessboard, Russia and the West are working in concert, and their apparent hostility and disagreements are part of a theater to further their greater interests. </p>

<p>I think RT is actually the exact definition of propaganda, just like Voice of America,  BBC, NPR, FARS, and the China Daily are.  These are all &quot;news&quot; agencies which are directly funded and run by the government&#39;s of these country&#39;s.   </p>

<p>Any government run news agency is by definition a propaganda outlet,  no?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You took a position supporting the effect of the ban on propaganda relating to homosexuality, i was speaking about the effects that presents in a population that saw that ban get passed. It&#39;s like what happened during the canadian elections when dog whistle politics where at play over a stupid fucking veil. We saw an increase in violence towards minorities when it was brought up into the public discourse and viewed as an acceptable position that a veil should not be allowed during citizenship ceremonies. With russia&#39;s ban on homosexual propaganda, it brought forward the latent dislike of homosexuals into the public discourse. A lot of attacks have occured. </p>

<p>Merely pointing that out to since you seem so keen on supporting russia&#39;s position. My reading comprehension isn&#39;t at question here, perhaps you should do a little more research yourself before applauding the &quot;think of the children&quot; propaganda that has violent consequences.</p>

<p>Demanding sources when lgbt crimes are obfuscated by regular crime stats, there are no distinctions which is how russia gets away with the murders and beatings. The lack of ngo&#39;s in russia make stats hard to come by. You are an american however, so i&#39;ll take your word on russian life as worthless, much like how you&#39;ve proved it through our conversation. </p>

<p>The human rights commisioner stepped down recently in russia for many reasons without comment, but sources say she got sick of defending the lack of ngo&#39;s and terrible conditions after the nassive outcry she received from many in the lgbt community. </p>

<p>I know my facts, i&#39;m done arguing with idiots tonight. Russia has a severe problem with crimes commited against it&#39;s lgbt population, my point has been that the amendment ramped up those crimes. That&#39;s a fact regardless of how many no u lols you throw out at people.</p>

<p>Thanks for demonstrating yourself a fool on this subject, as i said before, i&#39;ll be sure to take it into consideration when i see your posts in the future.</p>

That&#39;s terrible, think of all the gay kids who think that what they are is some kind of terrible perversion because every adult role model they could identify with gets jailed.

Russia&#39;s ban on homosexual &quot;propoganda&quot; has limited and or ruined the lives of many of it&#39;s own citizens, this is not in the spirit of freedom which I thought we stood for here.</p>

I don&#39;t care so much about how technically the law isn&#39;t against all gay people no matter what (if what you say is true and I was misinformed as to how liberal they are using the term &quot;propaganda&quot;), I care that its being used to destroy the lives of innocent people and also as encouragement towards the already extremely homophobic attitudes that can surface and put innocent people at the risk of a beating by a crowd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But none of what you are saying is the case in Russia. Sure, there is prejudice, there was in the US too during the 70&#39;s. You are implying that Russians as a group are persecuting gays. That is not the case. Some bigots may be, but it&#39;s not state sanctioned as you are implying. It&#39;s bigots. Russia is a highly orthodox country, it is no surprise you will get that reaction, same with the US. But there is no law banning gays in Russia. The law is actually about pedophilia, and propaganda to the youth.  It&#39;s a different culture (and smarter/more valued in my opinion), and if you are foreign to it (which appears so), you&#39;d think something differently. That is not the case, that is West propaganda against Russia!</p>

Do you disagree? Whether or not one thinks that it is okay to be gay, I think its NOT okay to limit peoples freedom of speech. NO ONE can convince you into turning gay, so the idea that the gays even need propaganda seems absurd. I understand that Russia is much more traditional in its view s on morality and tends to side with the church, but I believe that laws shouldn&#39;t be based on religions or peoples general dislike of a certain group. By the way I am pro anit-pedophilia laws but one must recognize that laws protecting children have been used to prosecute gay peoplr for crimes they never committed throughout 19th+20th century america and Europe, all while ordained priests were raping little boys, so excuse me for being suspicious of the church&#39;s values.</p>

There was NO capitalism or money, USSR had it, there was NO elite or ruling class, USSR had it, there was no secret police, USSR had it. The core principals of Marxist communism were not upheld properly or effectively during the majority of the USSR, if at all. It seems to me like you&#39;ve been brainwashed by the extreme anti communist pro capitalist propaganda that america is flooded with. The USSR went down a bad road, that doesn&#39;t mean that the fundamental values inspiring it were faulty, just the execution. Capitalism isn&#39;t inherently bad, but a lot of bad people are exploiting it and turning america into a corporate run monster. There is better ways to run both, but I think socialism would be a good way to go now that we live in a society of such overwhelming abundance, unlike the brutal early 1900 Russia that the USSR was born into. How about you try and read some communist or socialist leaning philosophers and tell me if you think that the USSR was an accurate reflection of there beliefs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know...I don&#39;t find much of value coming from the leftists here, or anywhere.  </p>

<p>I do share a few traits that our society tends to consider &#39;leftist&#39; but really isn&#39;t; like legalizing drugs.  I think all drugs should be legal.  Most people think that is a liberal position to take, but I don&#39;t see anything liberal about it.  I see it as an individual&#39;s right to consume whatever they wish.</p>

<p>Or gay marriage.  I don&#39;t believe that government should issue marriage licenses to begin with.  Marriages should be a religious ceremony, end of story.  And if some gays can find a priest or whatever to marry them, then good for them, I really don&#39;t care what people do in the bedroom.  So basically not a leftist position at all, it is more like I just don&#39;t care to tell others how to live their life.</p>

<p>Leftists take everything that is good and right and appropriate it for their own ends, in order that they may disguise their true nature.  The party of slavery and the KKK and segregation, the Democrats, now portray themselves as the white knights of tolerance and humanity....but every so often the mask slips and you catch a glimpse of tentacles and fangs seething beneath.....  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not a Democrat, but this just seems disingenuous. The Republicans&#39; southern strategy was a plan to win the presidency by appealing to the KKK and segregationists in the South, thus winning those states and an electoral win. The members and sympathizers of the KKK who voted for the Democrats in the first half of the 20th century voted for the Republicans in the second half. The RNC has admitted as much.</p>

<p>Ask yourself a question.</p>

<p>Why is it that White people who actually live next to Black people - like in the South - are always the ones that are &quot;racist?&quot;</p>

<p>But White people who live in all-White states, like say, Vermont, or Oregon, always talk about how &quot;anti-racist&quot; they are?</p>

<p>Why is it that when the Democrats appeal to Black voters in the South, that is &quot;anti-racist,&quot; but when Republicans appeal to the White voters in the South, that is &quot;racist?&quot;</p>

<p>You really only use that term &quot;racist&quot; to mean &quot;white people who live near black people&quot; don&#39;t you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, I&#39;m not even using the term &quot;racist&quot; here.

<p>Throughout the first half of the 20th century, the KKK and advocates of segregation voted Democrat; after &#39;64, that block largely voted Republican. This is born out by the facts, and we don&#39;t need to use terms like &quot;racist&quot; which are vague and divisive to make that point. </p>

<p>Maybe Democrats trying to appeal to southern black voters <em>is</em> &quot;racist.&quot; I think you could make a pretty good case for that. I think you could make an even stronger case that both parties use race to divide groups of people that have much more in common with each other than they do with those running the country. </p>

<p>For that to make sense, these people would have already been &quot;united&quot; and then &quot;divided&quot; by the political parties, but that doesn&#39;t seem to be the case.</p>

<p>The only problem with that theory is that by the time White southerners started voting GOP, segregation was long dead. No one in the GOP has ever suggested bringing back racial segregation.</p>

<p>So, unless you assume that most White people in the South are secretly segregationists, or white Southerners must be collectively punished for the &quot;sins&quot; of their ancestors, the argument just doesn&#39;t work.</p>

<p>Legally enforced segregation, yes. But de facto segregation still exists, and even more so in the &#39;60s and &#39;70s in the form of redlining, housing segregation, white flight.

<p>I see. So people have the right to associate with whomever they wish - but ONLY white people get called &quot;racist&quot; when they do so.</p>

<p>Even though no Republicans have ever suggested bringing back segregation, when white Southerners started voting for Republicans, that was <em>really</em> because they had &quot;segregationist sympathies.&quot;</p>

<p>By whom? I&#39;ve not called anyone a racist here, and plenty of white people call blacks or asians racist for only associating with their own race. Do I think its racist to only want to live and associate with people of your own race? No, I don&#39;t, because in and of itself that&#39;s not discriminatory. Do I think whites get called racist for doing the same things other races do, who do not get called racist in the general culture? Yes, I do. I think you&#39;re arguing against a position you think I hold rather than trying to actually understand my position. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, I think you have the causality flipped. I think the Republicans started targeting whites who wanted to only associate with other whites as a political strategy, and they&#39;ve basically <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/13/AR2005071302342.html">admitted as much</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;By the &#39;70s and into the &#39;80s and &#39;90s, the Democratic Party solidified its gains in the African American community, and we Republicans did not effectively reach out,&quot; [RNC Chair] Mehlman says in his prepared text. &quot;Some Republicans gave up on winning the African American vote, looking the other way or trying to benefit politically from racial polarization. I am here today as the Republican chairman to tell you we were wrong.&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>What is very obvious is that no matter what, white people get demonized somehow, someway.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, I would agree to that to an extent. I think this supports my earlier argument that TPTB are using a <em>divide et impera</em> strategy to keep the populace from uniting over their commonalities. It&#39;s the same strategy that produces both white guilt on the left and white resentment on the right. There&#39;s a kernel of truth in each, yet the effect of both is that whites and blacks both lose, and TPTB win. </p>

<p>This is ridiculous.  </p>

<p>You honestly think that KKK and neo nazi&#39;s are representative of Trump&#39;s supporters....</p>

<p>You think that Trump&#39;s supporters are racist because the media says so?  I mean, obviously you haven&#39;t spent more than a few seconds judging Trump based on what your lefty Canadian media tells you to think, you can&#39;t have given him a chance, and looked into what he is about and why so many people are supporting him.... </p>

<p>The people at Trump rallies are mainly just conservative middle class people, good people who work hard and love their kids and God and their country, and they are sick of being called racist and having their jobs shipped overseas.</p>

<p>The left has gone too far, smearing normal, good people, and Trump is just the blowback, these people feel that no one else will listen to them.  Even though Trump is a wealthy liberal New Yorker, he at least respects these people enough to not call them racists like the media and the left does.</p>

<p>I mean, I don&#39;t even care about Trump one bit, but even someone as disinterested in this election as I am, can see the obvious mental slavery going on here.</p>

That was why I brought it up, why you think that refers to all trump supporters, I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve watched his speeches and seen the republican debates, he has the attitude of a spoiled rich bully who trash talks and won&#39;t let his opponent have a word in otherwise. He does not seem wise or kind, these are values I think are important in government (you may disagree). Also his anti Muslim remarks have been unacceptable, its like when people in the middle east burn american flags, but exactly mirrored. Its the product of seeing the other as a single entity that deserves all of the hate, the opposite if a nuanced understanding of the situation. Canadians are literally scared of trump being elected, we are worried he may lash out and hurt those around him (including countries and his own citizens).

<p>What? Do you have any proof of this?</p>

<p>How many people do you think are in this supposed &quot;KKK?&quot;</p>

<p>Who is attending the trump rallies? KKK members and neo Nazis.</p>

<p>Oh ... my ... god.</p>

<p>Trump is one of the most popular celebrities in America. He currently leads the race for one of the major American political parties. His rallies are attended by broad swaths of the American population. He&#39;s had record turnout.</p>

<p>And you are really trying to claim that his base are all a bunch of Ku Klux Klansman and ... NEO-NAZIS?</p>

<p>I mean, are you serious? How many of these supposed &quot;neo-Nazis&quot; do you think there are?</p>

<p>Oh wait, that&#39;s right. You&#39;re the guy who is pro-Communist, and a Bernie Sanders supporter.</p>

<p>Never mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>these comments were in response to the claim that the democrats were the &quot;party of slavery, the KKK, and segragation&quot; I found that funny, since so far I have seen NO support for democrats by the KKK (aside for a single KKK supporter for Hillary Clinton (who i believe rightfully belongs on the republican party)).</p>

<p>I believe you are confused, I said that most KKK members choose Trump over other candidates, not that most of trumps supporters are members of the KKK. there is a big difference between these statements, read carefully before replying.</p>

<p>I am literally saying that neo nazis and KKK members prefer Trump. can you show me a single piece of data to prove me otherwise. I am saying NOTHING about all trump supporters, other than the fact that they might share some political ideals or interests with these hate groups.</p>

<p>Not Pro communist either, not that it matters, I believe my whole argument on that subject started from the statement that fascism was better than communism, which I was arguing against.</p>

<p>Bernie Sanders is the only candidate i would trust to fight for the people, I think Trump cares more about power and ego than the people, I may be wrong. That does not mean I am against his policies on honesty and putting an end to corporate interest controlling government instead of it&#39;s citizens. i honestly think that Bernie and Trump have more in common than many think, so lets just focus on the common enemy, Clinton ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the Democrats were the party of slavery, the KKK and segregation.</p>

<p>Now, neither party is the party of slavery, the KKK (which doesn&#39;t even exist anymore) nor segregation.</p>

<p>This is hilarious, this crass attempt at guilt by association. You act as if the KKK or the neo-Nazis are some legitimate groups that have a lot of members. They essentially do not exist except in the fevered dreams of the left.</p>

<p>Bernie Sanders is the candidate of neo-commies and the Zionists. I&#39;m just saying that communists and Zionists support Sanders. The Democrats are the party of Communism, gulags, mass starvation and murder.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that ALL Democrats are Communists that support gulags, mass starvation and murder. But isn&#39;t it true that most Communists support the Democrats and Sanders?</p>

<p>You see how that works?</p>

The KKK still exists, if it didn&#39;t, than how did all these politicians become a part of it, or how come they literally attend rallies for trump. your statement is about as untrue as it gets.

nope not guilt by association, I said 
NOTHING about all trump supporters, other than the fact that they might share some political ideals or interests with these hate groups.
do you disagree? you honestly think that the KKK member at a trump rally disagrees with all the other people at the rally? I&#39;m not saying they are all racist, I&#39;m saying they are all supporting Trump.</p>

<p>Bernie Sanders is the candidate of neo-commies and the Zionists. I&#39;m just saying that communists and Zionists support Sanders. The Democrats are the party of Communism, gulags, mass starvation and murder.
I am so confused by you. REPUBLICANS want to take away food stamps, REPUBLICANS (not all) started and support the wars/mass murder america commits. Gulags!??!? the fuck are you talking about Gulags for, neither party is a party of fucking gulags. 
you&#39;ve truly gone off the rails, so thanks for trying to make me like this subreddits conversations less, but I wont let you. Bye bye crazy dude, have fun in your personal reality. Come talk when you want to bring some proof or talk rationally.</p>

<p>Not true. Learn Russian, read the laws and get back to me. That&#39;s all I have to read, that shows you have no idea what you are talking about. I&#39;m from the US but speak/read Polish/Russian/and a few other Slavic languages. Educate yourself.</p>
