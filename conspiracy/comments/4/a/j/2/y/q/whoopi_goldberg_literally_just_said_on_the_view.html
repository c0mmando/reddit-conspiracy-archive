       You missed the point. The GOP will make shit up and attempt to destroy any high profile Democrat. Period. Some will be able to survive the onslaught of lies, others will not. Whoopie's point is that Hillary has shown for 25 years that she can endure the constant, coordinated smears and lies of Fox News, talk radio, and the entire GOP machine. That is a real asset.

       Is this sarcasm? Fox News wasn't even around 25 years ago. The current onslaught of never ending bullshit really didn't get super ramped up until Sept 11 2001. Hillary sucks, that's why people don't like her. She's a bad politician, either a murderer or supremely incompetent to the point of negligence and an average liar at best. She laughed about the murder of Gaddafi. Libya had a higher standard of living than Japan or Brazil, and the highest in all of Africa, what a terrible regime. You are either one smoothly sarcastic poster or someone in need of a closer examination of real history.

       True. Fox didn't join the effort until 1996. But Hillary has been dogged by constant smears and lies from the right since setting foot on the national stage in 1991.

       I'm curious: What exactly do you base this on? The opinions you hear from your brethren on the far-right? 
Because you could not be more wrong if you tried.
Sure, conservatives, wingnuts, lunatics, and psychopaths don't like Hillary. But she's been the front-runner to win the presidency since the campaign started in early 2015. She remains the favorite to beat Trump. And she has received more popular votes than Trump and every other candidate in the primaries so far.

       Gaddafi may have had some nice policies, but he was also a brutal butcher, tyrant, despot, and dictator -- an authoritarian strongman. In other words, just the kind of person I would expect a conservative to root for.

      <p>
       What has happened in Libya is tragic, but don't pretend it was a peaceful paradise until Hillary showed up. The country was in an active state of revolution, and Gaddafi was going around the country killing civilians en masse. The US didn't do anything to help, but the disaster was well underway before we intervened to prevent some of the killing by Gaddafi.

       LOL. Hillary Clinton is a fucking elephant in a donkey suit. She takes money from gun manufacturers and is close to gun lobbyists, but wants to sue them over gun control. She gives speeches to wall street interests for 6 figure pay, but is against wall street. If literally anyone else had done what she did with her email server, they'd be in jail. The GOP didn't destroy Hillary, Hillary destroyed Hillary. She wasn't "made out to be" a liar, she IS a liar. Shit, this election is pretty much Trump Vs. Trump 2.0.

       The west supported good terrorists in Lybia and when the government tried to fight back, the western media proclaimed the government was attacking it's citizens. Then the operation moved to Syria. Plus, the CIA was even moving arms out of Benghazi when the consulate was attacked. Obviously,  Gaddafi was a terrible person.  Sounds like you have no grasp of history.

       I'm not your friend, and your wrong, but let's agree to disagree. You believe in a convenient version of mainstream history whereby you ignore incidents like what happened at Benghazi and the collective effect of "blow back". I will never vote for a Republican as long as I live so I don't know what kool-aid flavor you are referring to. Democrats are Republicans are on the same team at the highest levels.

       I'm curious: what do you think happened at Benghazi? What are your sources for information about this? I'm especially interested because you renounced the GOP. Does that mean you also renounce the GOP talking points and sources on Benghazi?

       I said nothing about blow back, but the reason I was one of the few Americans opposing the Iraq invasion in 2002 and 2003 is because it was obvious that the invasion would be a disaster and lead to dramatic blowback harming America. Just like previous foreign policy blunders led to 9/11.

       Basically none. I think you could justify US intervention for humanitarian purposes - like, to stop a genocide. And you could justify some US intervention if it TRULY was necessary for US security. But 95% of US foreign policy over the last 60 years cannot be justified and has been disastrous for the US and the world.

       Even if you don't acknowledge reality when it comes to the 25 year campaign by the right to smear Hillary, there is a separate question about what Whoopi Goldberg meant. And what she meant was that Hillary has proven for almost 3 decades her resilience in the face of non-stop lies and attacks from the right wing smear machine. Which is of course impossible to dispute. Anyone with even slight familiarity with the history since 1991 could witness the history with their own eyes. The GOP and all it's appendages have been coming after Hillary for 25 years and they have never been able to lay a single finger on her. Every effort to smear her and destroy her has failed. No matter how concentrated the effort, no matter how many lies, she just keeps on surviving -- because there is no basis to the lies at all.

       When people with dirt on you died all around you it's hard to get caught isn't it. Also when you've been up to your eye balls in the DC shit hole you have dirt on people and can blackmail them. That's why I think it's taken so long to bust this cunt for treason. The massive right wing conspiracy doesn't exist, Hillary is just a stupid bitch that can't get anywhere without playing the victim card( probably why the blacks love her). As for whoopi she hasn't been relevant for around 20 years I'm sure she says the incredibly stupid things to get a few more minutes in the sun.

"The regans did so much good" "where was Sanders in 93" the women can't honestly believe her own shit, right? Right?

       The information was classified years afterwards. It wasn't classified when it was sent to her. At least not the vast majority of what was eventually deemed classified. Furthermore, she was only doing what the previous 3 Secs of State did. Her 3 Republican predecessors all say this is a non-story. It's  a non-story. It's a story that Fox News and the wingnut hoarde of the GOP are pushing because they will pick up any cudgel they can find to swing at her, whether it has merit or not.

       It was a dumb comment, she was trying to be gracious in recalling the life of someone who had just died. She was trying to be respectful. And said something stupid. I can live with it. It's not like she's telling her followers to phyically attack people who disagree with her. It's not like she's offering ethnic cleansing as a national policy. It's not like she wants to ban Muslims from entering the country. It's not like she's offering to commit massive war crimes. In other words, compared to Trump, it's pretty funny the best you have is she said something nice about Nancy Reagan.

       Look don't get me wrong Fox news is beating to death the Email thing. Now the reason for this "scandal" is Clinton had a private server set up in her home allowing her to do some work in a home office which is odd when you think about it. Now the last 3 Secretary of States: Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell, Madeleine Albright. From what we know about their communication habits Albrights and Rice didn't use much emails because there are other ways to communicate. Now for Powell the reason he doesn't have any person emails is because he didn't use a personal sever to communicate. Clinton acted before she stopped to think of she could or should it seems to be a habit with her. Clinton is being mentioned in the same breath as Stephen Kim and David Petraeus.  For what its worth not only Fox news it's taking about it, so is the BBC and Washington post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think my dislike of Clinton is proof of my Trump support well big surprise I don't like Trump either he does and says more obscure things than Hillary or Sanders combined. The fact that she watered down the Regans involvement, or lack there of, in AIDs epedimic is laughable. Not only did they ignore it but then they retroactively created legislation banning homosexuals from donating blood which means even today if i get leukima and need a blood transfer my brother who would be a match can't donate to me. Clinton tied to rewrite history whether on purpose or accident i don't know either way she's a ignorant twit i hate that bitch.

       Despite countless GOP investigations and millions of wasted taxpayer dollars that have never produced a single shred of evidence of any criminal wrongdoing. You believe she's a criminal because your "ideas" consist of what has been repeated shit into your skull by Rush Limbaugh and his peers over the past decades. If you could think for yourself, you might wonder why there isn't any, you know, evidence that she is a criminal.

       No, I look at her involvement in Watergate, on, and decided that she is a criminal. Vince Foster is one good example, but also the acts committed by her husband while he was Governor, leave quite a few unanswered questions.

       I suppose you mean White Water. So, you "decided she is a criminal" after you "looked at her involvement in" White Water, even though she was never found guilty of anything. How can you justify calling her a criminal when she was totally exonerated by several massive Republican-led investigations that dragged on for years?

       Vince Foster is an example of how Republicans will literally accuse the Clintons of

       Again, this was investigated extensively. No one who knows anything about it believes Hillary had Foster killed. This is just more BS made up by the Republican smear machine.

       I believe there a specific religious passages that speak quite ill of the lukewarm at heart. It would seem that, whatever you chose to support, you should do it full force. Whoopi plays the game, you don't survive in the media as long as she has without selling a part or two of yourself.

       Lived outside of DC for a lot of years and worked in government PR, so we often got the inside scoop on a lot of stuff. No one who knows anything about the case believes that Vince Foster's death was a suicide.

       But, the issue of who had him killed... well everyone has their opinion on that.

       True. Fox didn't join the effort until 1996. But Hillary has been dogged by constant smears and lies from the right since setting foot on the national stage in 1991.

      <p>
       I'm curious: What exactly do you base this on? The opinions you hear from your brethren on the far-right? 
Because you could not be more wrong if you tried.
Sure, conservatives, wingnuts, lunatics, and psychopaths don't like Hillary. But she's been the front-runner to win the presidency since the campaign started in early 2015. She remains the favorite to beat Trump. And she has received more popular votes than Trump and every other candidate in the primaries so far.

      <p>
       Gaddafi may have had some nice policies, but he was also a brutal butcher, tyrant, despot, and dictator -- an authoritarian strongman. In other words, just the kind of person I would expect a conservative to root for.

       <p>
        Libya had a higher standard of living than Japan or Brazil, and the highest in all of Africa, what a terrible regime.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What has happened in Libya is tragic, but don't pretend it was a peaceful paradise until Hillary showed up. The country was in an active state of revolution, and Gaddafi was going around the country killing civilians en masse. The US didn't do anything to help, but the disaster was well underway before we intervened to prevent some of the killing by Gaddafi.
