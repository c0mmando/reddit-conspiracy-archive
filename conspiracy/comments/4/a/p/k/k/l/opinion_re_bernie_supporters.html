<p>Do you believe Donald Trump is hiring actors to pose as Bernie Sanders supporters and act a fool at trumps events? The first reason I believe this may be true, is Donald was ALREADY caught hiring actors to pose as trump supporters at his campaign announcement and other campaign events.</p>

<p>But I leave it to the reddit cognoscenti... what are your thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The story&#39;s bunk.  First HuffPo is biased and points its story to &quot;the Hollywood Reporter&quot; as the source.  Then there&#39;s endless speculation only.  Finally, the purported email from GR is full of spelling and grammar errors which no large, reputable company would ever let past its editors.</p>

<p>The story proves nothing at most or is outright lying at worst.  Stop propagandizing with this bullshit.</p>

<p>Why not keep your bullshit to yourself, or do you regularly just spew what Democrats tell you is truth without learning for yourself?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>YEAH THAT’S TOTALLY A TRUE STATEMENT. The Democrats are CERTAINLY nothing but poor fucking wretches who were hoisted up as champions of the people to save them all from slavery...</p>

<p>Oh, wait, no, the RINOs and DINOs are the exact same fucking party of oligarchs with the exact same background and comprised of the exact same people and you’re just fellating one side while being told it’s the other. Instead of coming to the conclusion that “your vote doesn’t matter”, as some here would tell you after being told that DemE and GOPe are the same party, simply know that there are, probably, three parties in the country. First is the marxists, who should all be hanged. That’s roughly half of the Dem base these days. Then there’s the RINO/DINO oligarchs who’ve comprised the government majority for the last 60 years or so. Finally, the traditionalists, who want nothing more than to get rid of the last century’s worth of amendments and restore the country to constitutional rule (and hang most of the people in Washington for treason). Never mind keeping them in line at gunpoint thereafter.</p>

<p>You’re on step one of figuring out that you’ve been lied to, and that step is “you’re still being lied to”.</p>

<p>Every single vote they have ever undertaken since <a href="https://ideacapitalists.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/your-a-racist-charlie-brown.png">the creation of the party</a>. Maybe you’ve forgotten, but the Republicans ended slavery. And don’t you dare fucking start on HURR DURR THE PARTIES SWITCHED, because that’s not even remotely fucking accurate.</p>

<p>Voting for welfare is not voting for the poor, you imbecile. It simply creates a perpetual slave class that MUST vote in marxists to maintain its position. These people will create the very world they advocate against. They are nothing more than a destructive force without reason.</p>

<p>They defend Islam and Women’s Liberation in the same breath. They are antigun and anti-feudalism without realizing that one will lead to the other. Social Darwinism? It’s real. These people are a part of it, even when they scream at Republicans for advocating it. They want to end poverty but entrench it through welfare programs. They are against racism but empower it through social reforms that favor race over ability. These people are socially awkward, academically deficient, historically illiterate, and morally bankrupt. They are leeches of the lowest class. They have nothing, can create nothing, and are worth nothing. In their last moments of consciousness before they drift off to sleep, this face eats away at them because they start to lose the ability to deny it and push it back into their minds. They remedy this by blaming everything but themselves for their problems.</p>

<p>Human society is eusocial. Where we came from, and where we go is entrenched in social interaction. It is our evolution. Our survival of the fittest. These people are dead end genetic lines. Through the political sphere they gain the power to drag useful members of society down into their genetic deathbeds with them.</p>

<p>Once they obtain their “utopia” after getting their way (or sane people do the equivalent of white flight) they are left with a situation. There are not better people to villainize, so what do they do? They find the better off amongst themselves and turn the knife on them as the new anti-Christ figure.</p>

<p>Do you believe Donald Trump is hiring actors to pose as Bernie Sanders supporters and act a fool at trumps events</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. Trump doesn&#39;t need to, because Bernie supporters are, predominantly, fools. No action required on Trump&#39;s part other than show up and <em>not be Bernie</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Donald was ALREADY caught hiring actors</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It sounds as though you&#39;ve started from a conclusion and are working backwards, <em>begging the question.</em> Show us what actors he hired. Provide proof of payments from him or his campaign to these actors. Evidence, or it didn&#39;t happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The story&#39;s bunk.  First HuffPo is biased and points its story to &quot;the Hollywood Reporter&quot; as the source.  Then there&#39;s endless speculation only.  Finally, the purported email from GR is full of spelling and grammar errors which no large, reputable company would ever let past its editors.</p>

<p>The story proves nothing at most or is outright lying at worst.  Stop propagandizing with this bullshit.</p>
