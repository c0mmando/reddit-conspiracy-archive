    <div class="md"><p>I just don&#39;t see how SAP material (for Hillary&#39;s eyes only) was compromised on her private server with out Hillary herself being directly involved in the transfer of it. Someone had to physically bypass the air gaps in a secure network (like JWICS/SIPRnet) and place it in an email.  This can be done in a few ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>She gave someone her passwords</p></li>
<li><p>She or her aide copied it off secure channels onto e-mail</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Her aides do not have the clearance to handle these SAPs. She had to be directly involved in the mishandling of them.  Special Access Programs are <strong>born</strong> classified and on a completely different system.  I have no idea how she gets around this one.  Nixon 2.0</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She told them to remove the headers and send the text over email. I was surprised that story wasnt bigger, because it led me to have the same theory as OP. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/08/politics/hillary-clinton-emails-2016/">http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/08/politics/hillary-clinton-emails-2016/</a></p>

<p>I know from my own background that documents have &quot;headers&quot; that state when they are classified, FOUO, etc. So my guess was that by removing those headers and sending the text of the document (by copying the words from one screen to another) she knew she would circumvent transmission protections probably developed to stop people from faxing classified information. </p>

It&#39;s true the government is made up of ordinary people like you and me who do good and bad things. The thing is there are a lot of good people who truly want to make a positive difference in politics. Of course there are some not so great people in the government too who may be just greedy or power hungry.

    <div class="md"><p>The amount of people in this thread that are entertaining this as a legitimate possibility makes me feel like I&#39;m taking crazy pills. </p>

<p>This is beyond a stretch. Have we forgotten the multiple times Obama has hinted at support for HRC? Did we forget that Obama came out last week and basically endorsed Hillary in front of a room full of private donors. Basically saying it&#39;s time to unite behind her and at the same time slighting Bernie by comparing him to GWB in saying that authenticity is overrated. </p>

<p>I am a huge Sanders support but yal is on some next level shit. Im hoping for an indictment but it&#39;s laughable that theories like this that make it to the top and it only reenforces the stereotype that conspiracy nuts are way out of touch with reality. I know it may just be a fun little theory but posts that aren&#39;t rooted in evidence and are pure speculation make it harder for skeptics to have their voices heard when a valid conspiracy comes about. </p>

<p>Although I think a lot of conspiracies are fucking retarded.. Due to the slow death of investigative journalism and the conglomeration MSM, healthy skepticism is needed now more than ever. Too often do I see armchair &quot;experts&quot; doing mental gymnastics to deny facts and reality solely because it might upend their certain world view. They start at the conclusion that fits their ideology and work backwards from there, cherrypicking supporting data while completely ignoring contradictory evidence. It ends up just being another form of politics where a pro corporate/anti gov (or vice versa) agenda is being pushed. Skeptics end up becoming just another misinformation propaganda tool used to penetrate a different segment of the public.</p>

I agree with you 1000% and I&#39;m glad we bring this up because it is very important but it&#39;s so hard not to worked up about it. She should be in jail, but I just don&#39;t know if it&#39;s going to happen.

<p>That&#39;s why I keep bringing up Nixon.  Clinton is going to be thrown under the bus by everyone in the intelligence community, and every republican congress member.  The head of the FBI is going to recommend indictment, leak it, and she drops out.  This is her fuck up -- she personally asked for this server.

Witnesses say 3 shooters, then there&#39;s a time gap of 15 minutes where no one sees the shooters, then out of no where a dark SUV is spotted with 2 shooters, husband and wife.

<p>NIST was tasked with investigating the collapses. It is their responsibility and <a href="http://rememberbuilding7.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/NIST-collapse-model-building-7.jpg">this is what they gave us</a> after 7 years... </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dissenters will come from every angle. </p>

<p>No one can deny the models cannot be peer reviewed. Show them this response from NIST, as evidence: <a href="https://cryptome.org/nist070709.pdf">https://cryptome.org/nist070709.pdf</a></p>

<p>TL;DR They will not release their WTC 7 model data for peer review because it may jeopardize public safety.   </p>

<p>So before videos are released of the modeling sessions will they be approached to sign this for public safety?</p>

<p>The 1995 bombing in Oklahoma City was a direct blow to the heart of America. 168 people were killed, including nineteen children. For those watching the nightly news, terrorism had come home. For years following the bombing, countless victims&#39; family members, survivors, rescuers, and ordinary Americans, have questioned the official accounts about that fateful day. Hoping to shed light on answers long ignored and censored, both by prominent media outlets and the U.S. government, A Noble Lie peels back what we thought we knew about the bombing and it&#39;s perpetrators. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My question is one of ignorance, not of suspicion regarding whether what you&#39;re saying is true.  So when Clinton says &quot;calm down, those &quot;classified&quot; emails were <em>retroactively</em> classified&quot;, that is some sort of lie/half-truth/misdirection, right?  I don&#39;t trust her as far as I can throw her, but I don&#39;t know enough about it to dispute her &quot;it was standard bureaucratic bullshit&quot; angle.  What is the truth in regards to this angle?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, she&#39;s trying to misdirect her way out of it. She has stated that there is a lot of a lot of misinformation out there to make her look bad when the info is actually going from the investigation itself. It&#39;s not like some people made this shit up.. No she knowingly did all this herself. She said it&#39;s not an investigation but rather a &quot;security review&quot;...  I didn&#39;t know a &quot;security review&quot; involved giving her IT admin complete immunity to testify.  Honestly, the only person that can save her from this is Obama and the DOJ. Everyone else involved (FBI, state dept, Intel) has her dead to rights so we&#39;ll see what ends up happening. Obama not standing behind Hillary as a candidate may be some foreshadowing too..</p>

<p>no it&#39;s not:</p>

<p><a href="http://usuncut.com/politics/bernie-sanders-worst-states-behind/">A candidate needs 2,383 delegates to clinch the Democratic nomination, and as of March 16, Clinton only has 1,094 delegates to Sanders’ 774. All of the states most favorable to Clinton have already voted, and the states most favorable to Sanders are still on the calendar.</a></p>

<p>In comparison to a soccer game:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It&#39;s now half time.</p></li>
<li><p>Clinton was handed 3 &quot;lazy&quot; goals early in the game (noting strong biased for Clinton by the referees)</p></li>
<li><p>Sanders has scored 2 &quot;brilliant&quot; goals (despite the odds), and is strongly favored by the fans.</p></li>

<p>General Petraeus was sharing classified information with someone who didn&#39;t have the proper clearance to obtain it (I still believe she was a spy), revealing an interesting interagency and international shadow war for those who cared to look.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The license dropped in Rock Creek Park was surely reminiscent of Chandra Levy - I believe that was a message both for her and others paying attention. :(</p>

<p>Also, there was someone else in Hawaii that Obama pardoned with Petraeus&#39; mistress&#39; maiden name for crimes many moons ago, I believe it could have been an uncle. For check kiting/cocaine dealing, if I recall, and he was later able to re-enlist in the military (despite the court martial and many years before the pardon). Nothing definitive, but some strange apparent connections.</p>

This is the <em>worst</em> mistake you can make as a member of the intelligence community.  I honestly believe she will be stripped of her security clearance.  To us peons it may not be a big deal (because we don&#39;t live in that security clearance world) but to the CIA, DIA, FBI, DoD, Oval office, etc...THIS IS REALLLLY bad.

<p>It may not bother the ignorant civilians with no knowledge of how security clearances work, but <em>every</em> government worker in <em>every</em> agency that has classified material realizes this is a major breach of National Security.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), national intelligence information concerning sources and methods which is protected by control systems defined by the Director of National Intelligence. Note that SCI markings are separate from those of other SAPs.</p></li>
<li><p>Single Integrated Operational Plan-Extremely Sensitive Information (SIOP-ESI, replaced by NC2-ESI), the national plan for nuclear war. Note that SIOP-ESI was listed among non-IC dissemination control markings on classified documents, not with other SAPs.</p></li>

<p><em>But.........did you hear about this?</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>When Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died 12 days ago at a West Texas ranch, he was among high-ranking members of an exclusive fraternity for hunters called the International Order of St. Hubertus, an Austrian society that dates back to the 1600s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>wtf?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The society’s U.S. chapter launched in 1966 at the famous Bohemian Club in San Francisco, which is associated with the all-male Bohemian Grove — one of the most well-known secret societies in the country.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Uh...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Woah, so quick to judge aren&#39;t you? Other people&#39;s theories are batshit crazy but yours isn&#39;t. You criticize NY post yet you link to NY times. An employee at <em>Fox News</em> is the person to trust, you say. Then you point me to the Bohemian Grove stuff without stating your point. Cool dude I&#39;ve learned a lot here.</p>

<p>To entertain your idea that this &quot;Paladin Justice&quot; guy must be batshit crazy, I looked up his blog. Here are a few quotes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’m expecting that the autopsy will take place in Texas, conducted by someone under the control of the Illuminati (call them what you will–the power elites, globalists, oligarchs, etc.) If I were the Scalia family, I’d make sure that an independent autopsy were done, and make sure that whatever evidence of disease within Scalia’s body that is revealed is not planted evidence.</p>

<p>You may remember that Andrew Breitbart dropped dead under mysterious circumstances. I recall an autopsy showed his death was caused by a heart attack. Breitbart’s audience had become too large. He couldn’t be ignored by our rulers, so he was removed. Miraculously, some men who have the truth figured out, men such as Henry Makow, are allowed to live.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Look there, he wasn&#39;t too far off base in those predictions now was he? This doesn&#39;t stand out as batshit crazy to me. He talks about Breitbart and Henry Makow, this guy is at least a little in the know when it comes to conspiracy stuff.</p>

<p>The reason I find the NY post article which I linked interesting is because it attempts to marginalize conspiracy theorists, but at least one of the conspiracies contains hard core accusations. Why would someone spend time on a <em>conspiracy theorists are nutters story</em> anyway, does it generate lots of ad revenue? Which theory is the imposter that holds an ounce of truth, being grouping in with the more unbelievable theories and theorists to cast doubt on the whole damn idea of there being a conspiracy at all? <em>Oh you think THAT&#39;S a conspiracy, here have a joke about it laugh lol hehe ufos and spacelizards. Now you feel dumb don&#39;t you?</em></p>

<p>You know, looking back on things, Scalia must have died from natural causes. Like a pill in his drink, naturally. There was totally nothing suspicious about him going on a good ol&#39; &quot;hunting trip&quot; with the boys, or the dinner he had in a place away from society with a cult, or him being dead the next morning after the dinner with Poindexter, or the lack of the resident coroner that day and the lack of an autopsy, or him declining a security detail, or the other people present at the ranch who all refuse to comment, or the FBI deciding not to investigate because the US Marshalls (whom Scalia turned down and apparently weren&#39;t even there) told the FBI he died of natural causes. There is totally nothing about Scalia worth looking into.</p>

<p>But did you hear about the Bohemian Grove? <em>It&#39;s where conspiracies are born!</em></p>

<p>If he&#39;d lived, it would still take so long for the case to get to the supreme court that Scalia might have died of old age during the wait.

<p>&quot;Intelligence reports were being inappropriately manipulated by members of the Obama Administration.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Congressional representatives charged with overseeing the war have expressed shock and confusion&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...The whistle blowers allege that the Obama Administration attempted to portray a rosy image of the fight against the Islamic State by altering some reports to seem more positive, while burying other reports to keep them from the press and Congress...&quot;</p>

<p>this was the largest whistleblowing in history, many resigned. Over 50 CENTCOM intel analysts not counting numerous DIA and other civilian contrators joined in to sign a classified petition. Much of which was leaked to press. This could&#39;ve been the straw that broke the camels back, where congressmen asked the fbi to get all they can on her. Leading to the emails.

    <div class="md"><p>Well Sanders wanted a meeting for awhile, and finally got one on that Wednesday.  It may be a coincidence, but it would make sense for Obama to at least hint to him that there could be a storm brewing in the FBI investigation.  That&#39;s why sanders is committed to staying in the race until the convention, the FBI wraps up its case in May/June. </p>

<p>Also, Obama campaigned for Sanders in Vermont in the past.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know that I necessarily agree. Let&#39;s assume the opposite, that she has no such assurance. Her best bet to avoid indictment is to win the nomination, and as quickly as possible. Her best bet to win the nomination is to state emphatically and with seeming certainty that she will not be indicted. She loses absolutely nothing by making that declaration if she is not indicted, rather it helps her win the nomination, and if she does get indicted, she doesn&#39;t really lose anything there either. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying she has or has not been assured, but I don&#39;t think we can draw that conclusion from her public statements. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiIP_KDQmXs">Politicians always deny wrongdoing publicly</a> so as not to appear guilty. </p>

<p>President Obama is insistent: He doesn&#39;t want to endorse a candidate in this year&#39;s Democratic primary contests. At least not quite yet. The only problem with that? The comments he has been willing to make sound sort of like an endorsement of Hillary Clinton. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/17/obamas-almost-endorsement-of-hillary-clinton/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/17/obamas-almost-endorsement-of-hillary-clinton/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>For all Hillary is bad, and I know most people here are feeling Sanders and The Donald, because they&#39;re seen as standing up against &quot;The Establishment&quot;- do you know what would be worse than a Hillary presidency?  Another neocon presidency.  </p>

<p>Yeah, Hillary is going to try to get ISIS to go into Iran and Turkey, and she&#39;ll definitely be putting troops in Syria to take out Assad under the auspice of combatting ISIS&#39; genocide.  This is a neocon agenda.  But do you know what a neocon president like cruz or rubio is going to do?  They&#39;re going into pakistan and yemen and lebanon and somalia.  They&#39;re calling for austerity while going full force against eastern bloc states moving russian gas.  They&#39;re not just supporting trade agreements which will demolish the working class, but they&#39;re cutting all the social programs which keep urban minorities from rioting in the streets.  They&#39;re deporting the mexicans that work on all the farms that provide the majority of your american grown food and the kitchens at all the restaurants you eat at.  They&#39;re not just continuing the war on drugs, but they&#39;re intentionally creating an explosive situation where cops &quot;need&quot; heavier and heavier weaponry to combat angry poor people and rising gang violence.  They&#39;re starving the beast until it starts eating people to force a revolution.  They&#39;re not the libertarians they pretend to be- they are hard core authoritarians.</p>

<p>Be very careful what you wish for.</p>

I think ultimately Obama would be happy to see Sanders take the mantle. I do think the President is a &quot;progressive&quot; in his heart despite some of his questionable policies and decisions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>National Security Information can be classified at one of the 
following three levels:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>“Confidential” applies to “information, the unauthorized disclosure 
of which reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the 
national security that the original classification authority is able to 
identify or describe.”   </p></li>
<li><p>“Secret” applies to “information, the unauthorized disclosure of 
which reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage to 
the national security that the original classification authority is 
able to identify or describe.”  </p></li>
<li><p>“Top Secret” applies to “information, the unauthorized disclosure of 
which reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave 
damage to the national security that the original classification 
authority is able to identify or describe.” </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Access to classified material may be further restricted if the material 
pertains to a Special Access Program, defined as “a program established for a 
specific class of classified information that imposes safeguarding and access 
requirements that exceed those normally required for information at the same 
classification level.” Information concerning a Special Access Program is 
referred to as Sensitive Compartmented Information or SCI information.</strong></p>

<p>Classified information may be compartmented within a classification 
level.  Thus, TS/SCI is information classified at the Top Secret (TS) level that is 
subject to the enhanced controls applicable to Sensitive Compartment
Information.  </p>

<p>For instance, TS material must either be “under the personal 
control of an authorized or appropriately cleared person” or “guarded or stored 
in a locked security container,” typically a General Services Administration-
approved safe.  See DOJ Security Program Operation Manual at 6-202.  </p>

<p><strong>However, SCI material must be stored in a SCIF irrespective of its classification 
level.  According to Director of Central Intelligence Directive No. 6/9 (Nov. 18, 
2002), a SCIF is a specially constructed room or other structure “intended to 
prevent as well as detect visual, acoustical, technical, and physical access by 
unauthorized persons.”</strong></p>

<p>Oh shit.  This SCI material was on her private server...?!</p>

There was some published gossip a few months ago from leakers that the FBI investigation has expanded to cover possible corruption charges re:instances where nations and corporations who heavily donated to the Clinton Foundation got favorable approvals from the State Department (and there are bunches<sup>1</sup> - the Uranium One deal, arms deals to multiple middle eastern nations, etc.).</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope your theory is correct.

She deleted any emails that would 100 percent damn her. The emails we have will only lead to speculation and inevitably nothing. Sanders will begin to chip away at everything those in the shadows have worked over generations to get to. I am an avid bernie supporter if only to spread the word of what society could be. But that is a far reach anymore. They have their plans. They have their ways. 11 hours on stand in front of people who would love nothing more than to indict her and nothing. What really makes any of us believe they will hand over their interests to sanders or even trump? Convince me. </p>

<p>President Obama is insistent: He doesn&#39;t want to endorse a candidate in this year&#39;s Democratic primary contests. At least not quite yet. The only problem with that? The comments he has been willing to make sound sort of like an endorsement of Hillary Clinton. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/17/obamas-almost-endorsement-of-hillary-clinton/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/17/obamas-almost-endorsement-of-hillary-clinton/</a></p>

<p>And a lot of republicans have been saying there&#39;s a bit of chaos in the FBI because the agents investigating want indictment, but Comey and the DOJ et al ultimately make the decision.  </p>

<p>Issa and DeLay are the most outspoken about that, but people say it&#39;s just political smearing. Either way, there&#39;s definitely over 100 agents working on this case, and the evidence is very strong. Her aides are definitely going down.  Going to be nuts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died 12 days ago at a West Texas ranch, he was among high-ranking members of an exclusive fraternity for hunters called the International Order of St. Hubertus, an Austrian society that dates back to the 1600s.</p>

<p>wtf?</p>

<p>The society’s U.S. chapter launched in 1966 at the famous Bohemian Club in San Francisco, which is associated with the all-male Bohemian Grove — one of the most well-known secret societies in the country.</p>

<p>If he&#39;d lived, it would still take so long for the case to get to the supreme court that Scalia might have died of old age during the wait.  We&#39;re talking multiple years for a case with this much shit to sift through.  There&#39;s absolutely no chance of it getting there before the general election.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t just start a case off at the supreme court level, no matter how much you want to.  That&#39;s not how it works.</p>

<p>The 1995 bombing in Oklahoma City was a direct blow to the heart of America. 168 people were killed, including nineteen children. For those watching the nightly news, terrorism had come home. For years following the bombing, countless victims&#39; family members, survivors, rescuers, and ordinary Americans, have questioned the official accounts about that fateful day. Hoping to shed light on answers long ignored and censored, both by prominent media outlets and the U.S. government, A Noble Lie peels back what we thought we knew about the bombing and it&#39;s perpetrators. </p>
