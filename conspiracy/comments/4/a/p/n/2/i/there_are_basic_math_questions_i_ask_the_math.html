<p>wolframalpha answers, but nobody dares to explain why it is a certain complex number. I question if it is a complex number at all, since many math expressions, such as the squareroot of 1, have mutiple answers (which is not &quot;a&quot; number at all but a set of numbers), and if math expressions create multiple answers, recursively that should generate an impractically large number of possible combinations of answers leading the whole global infrastructure to destruction by paradox, like it has in politics. Lets pretend these paradoxes dont exist and continue using math ops which create paradoxes in some combinations. As long as the paperwork admits no flaws, nobody less than certified expert has any right to question it. BTW, I am a certified college and jobs logic expert and do question it, and nobody cares. Thats just something they say to nonexperts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I would like the proof, since &quot;sin(i)=i*sinh(1) where sinh is the hyperbolic sine function&quot; only defers the possibility of a solution to sinh which is still undefined as a function of parameter type complexNum. What I ask is damn simple: Either admit sin(i) is not a complex number or give its real and imaginary parts both as scalars (the imaginary part mulitplied by i plus the real part), including all possible solutions to sin(i) which I hypothesize are infinitely and uncountably many and the general consensus claims but has never once proved is finite, or even more extreme their claim of a single value.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is only one. sin is defined by an infinite series, so by the uniqueness of limits theorem it only has 1 solution. This is the second time I&#39;ve explained this to you.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t need sinh defined on the imaginary numbers, only on the reals since 1 is a real number.</p>

<p>As for the real and imaginary parts, sin(i) has real part 0 and imaginary part sinh(1). sinh(1) is a real number, it is equal to 0.5*(e- 1/e), or approximately 1.175. So, approximately, sin(i)=0+1.175i, and this is the only answer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A PDF with 11 pages is not a &quot;book&quot; or a &quot;general website&quot;. What you were linked to was an article devoted to defining inverse trigonometric functions in the complex numbers: if you&#39;re interested only in arcsin you can skip to page 4 where they do just that. Given that skimming the PDF to find that takes like 5 seconds, it&#39;s not unreasonable to link to that as an answer to your question. It does require you to know about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_logarithm">the complex logarithm</a>, so you should read up on that first.</p>

<p>And you were given the definition of sine in terms of e<sup>x,</sup> which is enough to define it. Of course that relies on a definition of e<sup>x</sup> , but that one can be defined simply in terms of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function#Formal_definition">power series</a> among other options(you can also define sine directly as a power series too if you want). In turn you need limits to define power series: and limits are defined in terms of basic logic and arithmetic, so that&#39;s where the tower of definitions ends.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you really want to understand Euler&#39;s formula as compared to the circle, you should read &quot;Where Math Comes From&quot; by George Lakoff and Nunez.  Most of what you are asking relates to the two kinds of circles: circles like a knob and circles like a screw.  When you rotate a knob 2Pi radians, you&#39;ve returned it to an position indistinguishable from not rotating it all.  When you rotate a screw 2Pi radians, you&#39;ve translated it to a new position, what complex analysis calls a &quot;branch cut.&quot;</p>

<p>Anyway, these questions have been answered.  Maybe not everybody on the Internet can refer you to the answers, but the topic has already been covered by Lakoff and Nunez.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we&#39;re playing troll math questions, I have two:</p>

<p>Firstly: if 0.999 is accepted as 1, then 1 is constantly under revision, decreasing downwards. If you&#39;ll follow my logic here...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Step 1: 0.999 = 1, which is, in actuality 1 reduced by 1/1000--or &quot;an acceptable margin of error&quot;. We&#39;ll call this 1a.</p></li>
<li><p>Step 2: 0.999 = 1a. But, as we&#39;ve established, 1a is 0.999, or &quot;one reduced by 1/1000&quot;, so then really you&#39;re saying that 0.998 = 0.999, so 0.998 becomes the new 1, 1b.</p></li>
<li><p>Step 3: repeat until 0. 0 = 1.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Secondly: division by zero is possible and gives the same answer as multiplication by 1. This is solved by changing it from raw numbers to a simple word problem.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>10 apples = 1 bushel, or one barrel of apples. (10/10 = 1)</p></li>
<li><p>20 apples = 2 bushels/barrels. (20/10 = 2)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Bob divides his 100 apples into no bushels. How many apples does Bob have left? (100/0 = 100)</p>
