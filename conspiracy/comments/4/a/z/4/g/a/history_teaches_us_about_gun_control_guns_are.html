<p>History shows that bad things — very bad things — happen when a government confiscates the guns of its citizens. It is an undisputed fact that gun control and gun confiscation has preceded every instance of genocide in the 20th century. </p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li><p>In 1911, Turkey established gun control. From 1915-1917, 1.5 million Armenians, unable to defend themselves against their ethnic-cleansing government, were arrested and exterminated.</p></li>
<li><p>In 1929, the former Soviet Union established gun control as a means of controlling the “more difficult” of their citizens. From 1929 to the death of Stalin, 40 million Soviets met an untimely end at the hand of various governmental agencies as they were arrested and exterminated.</p></li>
<li><p>After the rise of the Nazi’s, Germany established their version of gun control in 1938 and from 1939 to 1945, 13 million Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, the mentally ill, and others, who were unable to defend themselves against the “Brown Shirts”, were arrested and exterminated. Interestingly, the Brown Shirts were eventually targeted for extermination themselves following their blind acts of allegiance to Hitler. Any American military and police would be wise to grasp the historical significance of the Brown Shirts’ fate.</p></li>
<li><p>After Communist China established gun control in 1935, an estimated 50 million political dissidents, unable to defend themselves against their fascist leaders, were arrested and exterminated.</p></li>
<li><p>Closer to home, Guatemala established gun control in 1964. From 1964 to 1981, 100,000 Mayans, unable to defend themselves against their ruthless dictatorship, were arrested and exterminated.</p></li>
<li><p>Uganda established gun control in 1970. From 1971 to 1979, 300,000 Christians, unable to defend themselves from their dictatorial government, were arrested and exterminated.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>genocide 57. Cambodia established gun control in 1956. From 1975 to 1977, one million of the “educated” people, unable to defend themselves against their fascist government, were arrested and exterminated.</p>

<ol>
<li>In 1994, Rwanda disarmed the Tutsi people and being unable to defend themselves from their totalitarian government, nearly one million were summarily executed.</li>
</ol>

<p>The total numbers of victims who lost their lives because of gun control is approximately 70 million people in the 20th century. </p>

<p>Nonsense. It&#39;s irrelevant that Cambodia brought in gun controls in 1956. The government that brought in those rules was kicked out in a bloodless coup in March 1970 and from thereon in Cambodia was awash with weapons. A large proportion of those who were executed during the Pol Pot Regime were (armed) militants from within the organization. So basically your argument doesn&#39;t wash with regards to Cambodia, I bet the rest of your &quot;points&quot; are just as flawed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you look at current weapons being developed, they&#39;re aimed at gaining control in guerrilla warfare situations. It could be argued this is done due to the common environment of middle east but the technology will be there if an uprising in the US were to ever happen.</p>

<p>Autonomous drones capable of high speed navigation through even the most challenging obstacles, ultrasound weapons to disrupt and disable &quot;enemies&quot; within a large radius. If the rising were a serious threat to the standing government, NATO nations could even offer support to &quot;get things under control&quot;.</p>

<p>If you remember we&#39;ve even seen this back during the Ferguson non-sense with Egypt appealing to Obama, as if it were a huge threat. If our military defaults on moral reasons we could very likely see foreign troops doing the job. If they don&#39;t already have indiscriminate A.I. by that point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The military could wipe us out, gun control or not.  It&#39;s ridiculous to think a political wedge issue is of any real importance to the deep state.  It&#39;s a wedge issue because there are special interests (ie, NRA, gun/ammunition manufacturers) involved and because it doesn&#39;t matter to corporate America whether Americans own weapons.  So it&#39;s safe for politicians to champion the issue. </p>

<p>The military either refuses to kill civilians or it doesn&#39;t.  Personally, I think it&#39;s more likely that they&#39;ll refuse to kill people who aren&#39;t shooting at them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Claiming that there would be exterminations in the U.S. is a difficult one to justify. The main reason is because we&#39;ve are already been defeated. If someone wanted to arrest you and take all your stuff, believe me, they could do it without firing a single bullet or anyone batting an eye. Anyway, guns make people paranoid, and paranoia controls people. </p>

<p>If on the other hand there was some sense that the country was rising up to take back control of the House of Representatives, or that people were overcoming their red vs. blue feeling of alienation from each other, I could see why owning a gun might be a secondary way of safeguarding positive change. What makes no sense, however, is this idea that guns in themselves make us free. Our freedoms are being whittled away your guns aren&#39;t doing a thing to change that.</p>

<p>How about we as a people unite to take back the House of Representatives, and block all military spending in America? Then I might possibly think that guns are more than just a cool hobby. </p>

<p>Both Canada and the UK have some pretty strict gun control laws. Based upon your subject, I would expect millions of their residents to have been exterminated because of those laws.</p>

<p>What if somebody just went through a messy break-up? Is that enough to stop someone from getting a gun? </p>

<p>What if someone saw a therapist for a few months, years ago? Would that deem them to be emotionally unstable? What if they see a therapist on a regular basis?</p>

<p>What about people that are on anti-depressants or other psychotropic medications?</p>

<p>I could go on, but you probably get my drift. Not only is that a subjective, unmeasurable analysis, it would also have terrible unintended consequences. </p>

<p>If there were to be a law banning guns for people who seek help, you could expect the amount of violent incidents to skyrocket. It would have the exact opposite effect than intended.</p>

<p>I would think that&#39;s a diagnosis from a physician, most likely psychologist or psychiatrist.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the first one in your list that I think might qualify as a diagnosed issue, but I&#39;m not a physician, so I&#39;m not certain. I would assume you need a legit diagnosis to be prescribed those types of meds.</p>

<p>Diagnoses are objective and measurable.</p>

<p>And who decides what the qualifications/symptoms would be? The government? &quot;Medical experts&quot; (which are given grants by the government)? If you aren&#39;t familiar, you should look into Project Paperclip and the affect it had on the field of Psychology. That would be like the fox guarding the hen house.</p>

<p>On surface level, it sounds fine. If somebody is screwed-up enough to be on psychotropic medications, they must be too screwed-up to own a gun, right?</p>

<p>But, doctors pass out those medications like candy. Most people that are on them are not actually screwed-up&amp;mdash; they are just sad or stressed. I&#39;m not saying depression and whatnot aren&#39;t real, just stating that MANY people turn to doctors and are then pushed into taking medication before any other treatment, many times because doctors receive kick-backs from pharmaceutical companies. Those people may not be &quot;clinically depressed&quot;.</p>

<p>Passing a law like that would have the exact opposite effect than intended. Instead of keeping guns out of the hands of people who need help, it would stop those people from seeking help in the first place. It&#39;s only logical that this would cause the number of violent incidents to skyrocket.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a number of problems with that. One being how often people with anti-authoritarian attitudes are diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder. It&#39;s similar to how people in the USSR were diagnosed with mental illnesses. The reasoning was that the USSR was a workers utopia, therefore anyone that was unhappy with living in the USSR was mentally ill, therefore they needed to be shipped off to gulags/mental hospitals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know if you are admitted to a hospital in illinois they take away your FOID card for five years.

    <div class="md"><p>Any hospital for psychiatric reasons. Yeah, it&#39;s bullshit but Illinois has FOID cards. Just got concealed carry in Chicago though, but you&#39;ve got to take some classes. </p>

<p>Guess the reasoning is that if you haven&#39;t stockpiled any ammo, you couldn&#39;t go on a shooting spree. Unless, you know, you left the state and went to a gun show out in the woods in Missouri and bought whatever you wanted cash and carry. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if you could just cross the border into Indiana and buy ammo with an Illinois ID, or if they&#39;d even card you. It&#39;s screwy though, and detrimental to people. I know a guy who gets panic attacks so bad he fears he&#39;s having a heart attack, but he&#39;s reluctant to go to the hospital bc they may recommend a 72 hour psych evaluation, then he&#39;s in, technically, illegal possession of his firearms. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not illegal. You can get just about any pistol, any caliber, except short pistols (under barrel length of 4&quot;) and .25 and .32 caliber for some reason.</p>

<p>The difference is you have to have a higher class of licensing, and you can only shoot those pistols at a shooting range. And there&#39;s strict rules for transport of pistols (have to have paper work with you, have to have the pistol trigger locked and in a locked case, have to drive with a reasonably direct route to range and back).</p>

<p>I have a Girsan Berretta 92 clone in 9mm. I&#39;ve shot S&amp;W .460 and .500 as well as .50 AE dester eagle people own at the range among others, for example.</p>

<p>Oh, AR 15&#39;s are in the same class as pistols. My Ruger mini 14 which shoots the same caliber and same type of action (semi auto) isn&#39;t restricted and I can take it to my friends farm for pest control. Laws, eh?</p>
