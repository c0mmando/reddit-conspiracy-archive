       I would normally agree but then why is the establishment so determined to take away this nomination from him? The GOP is would rather put Hillary in office, somebody who is more than willing to carry out an elitist agenda.

       Wouldn't it be more effective if he didn't just have half-ass voting supporters like most other candidates, but true serious (to the point of fanaticism) voting supporters?
      </p>
      <p>
       Hitler had fanatical supporters.... I'd even say Hitler couldn't have accomplished what he did in Germany without those fanatical supporters. Moreover, Hitler gained power in many of the same ways that Donald Trump is gaining power...

       He also took power with the point of a gun. Look into how he got into the party's power. He did it by force behind closed curtains. I'm not saying you're off, but also, it could of been a because of the times. Either way, Trump is playing closely to Hitler's playbook. Don't forget, Hitler gained a ton of power mostly because Germans were getting very poor and the military was taken down several notches so the German people felt like they were being bullied.

       People tend to forget about the massive inflation of the Weimar Republic. European-based international bankers wouldn't write down or restructure post WWI loans, which drove Germany into hyperinflation. This literally starved German people. That was the cause of Hitler's rise to power and the vengeance against Jews.

       True. And they would if he did it overnight.. But if he really took the time to convince his followers to trust in him and his plans.. And went through that whole process... Man, who knows.

       It took Hitler over a decade, of strategizing behind the scenes and then upfront in the public eye before he rose to total power. But that was without internet.

       This is patently untrue. If the media hated him, they would ignore him like they did with Ron Paul. The media LOVE him. Big business LOVES him.

        CBS CEO on Trump, "It may not be good for America, but it's damn good for CBS.
       </a>
       The idea that Trump is "anti-establishment" is absolutely ridiculous. A billionaire that brokers deals with Chinese sweatshops, and flies around on private jets is not anti-establishment. He's only "anti-establishment" in the sense that white, middle America believes there's an established control on national rhetoric. Unfortunately, they equate that control with college liberals and the ivory tower, when in reality the control is by big business.

       The media ignored Ron Paul at least partly because he was nowhere near as popular as Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media loves to
       <em>
        talk
       </em>
       about Trump because it makes for good ratings. But they take every opportunity to criticize him and paint him as a shitty candidate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is decidedly anti-establishment. If you can't see that, it's probably because his politics clash violently with yours (it's easy to see what your political leanings are just based on this one post). I think Trump is a buffoon who would be disastrous for the US as a president, but it's blindingly obvious that people with money and power are doing their best to keep him out of office. He is as anti-establishment as they come. Being anti-establishment is not about being poor or for the common man, it doesn't mean you're a good person with sound policies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump would be bad for the US as a president, but great for the US because of what a Trump win would do to American politics.

       The 2012 Republican primaries were basically a no contest win for Romney. He won 65% of the delegates, Paul got 6%. In terms of popular vote, Paul was in 4th place. Rallies don't mean everything. If you have a small, loyal, passionate following, (like Paul did) you're going to have great rallies, but that's not going to translate into good poll results.

       Because of public manipulation via media, if America were in fact a democracy and we weren't split by this 2-party false ideology and votes were sent to a third party administration to check if they tally up, we would be referring to Ron Paul as President, I know that much.

       This is wrong, he was incredibly popular and was systematically shut out of the conversation.

       Every TV character has to play a role. Trump's is the antagonist. They criticize him because it accomplishes many things, 1) creates a facade of journalistic integrity, 2) empowers the left who hate him, 3) empowers the right who love him, 4) polarizes the masses, 5) creates controversy, which creates ratings which 6) $$$$$$$.

      <p>
       Also, wrong. The boards of CBS, NBC, ABC, and all media networks are littered with corporate executives with past work in oil, energy, banking, manufacturing, if they want to keep him out of office, they would keep him off of TV.

       they'd rather back him than the ones criticizing capitalism if they became desperate. maybe not this year, but the next election, when both the democratic and the republican establishment is truly exhausted, and nothing else stands in the way for some kind of economical revolution, big money will gladly back somebody ready to use violence to prevent this from happening. Trump is a loose cannon, but he's better than certain defeat from the perspective of the capitalists.

       People need to stop thinking about Dem. vs. Rep. And start thinking about controlled or owned vs. free. The Donald is many bad things (and a few good ones) but he is not beholden to the Invisible Hand, as it were, for where he is today. I would happily vote Bernie if he could get the Dem nod and Cruz got the GOP nod. All the rest are controlled clones.

       They love to talk about him and his antics, but they shit on him every chance they get. Every time he talks about TPP, the cameras cut away. Supposedly this has happened on 3 different occasions, even with Fox. Check out his coverage on Fox, they don't treat him like a Republican candidate. In the Fox Republican debate, they literally put up claims Trump had made and compared them with real numbers - they put this up on the screen and confronted him about it. They don't do this shit to other Republican candidates.

       I dunno, I've never seen the GOP work so hard to defeat one of their own candidates. As far as the MSM, they are setting him up for assassination. Even Faux news is beating the leftist drum now to turn public opinion against Trump and the current message being programmed is that it is ok to attack him because, he's violent.... I've been watching the useful idiots attack him so when there is a response, they can play victim. If he manages to secure the nomination and win the Presidency, I believe the collapse will be laid upon his shoulders because he is not establishment and they can always use a good scapegoat.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the record gun sales in the past 8 years refutes the perceived lack of resistance and as someone who interviewed many of the militia leaders in Texas during the initial border (or lack thereof) row in 2013, there is PLENTY of resistance. Not claiming any chance of success against a modern army, just saying the resistance is there and there is plenty of it.

       Yeah this exactly. They are trying very hard now to prime the public that Trump is dangerous so that if they assassinate him people wont riot. However it's not working since the half of the population that likes Trump only get more defensive the more he is attacked. So assassination risks sparking off civil war like conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes if they are forced to let him take the Presidency I suspect they will pump the market with some more QE to keep it from crashing on Obama. Then let it go belly up shortly into Trump's office, and have the MSM says his policies caused it.

       With Trump there seems to be an oddity.  No matter what he says or does his followers will always stand behind him.  This feels to me to be a movement, something that is fated.  (ok throw tomatoes at me. :)
      </p>
      <p>
       We have come to a pinnacle were we all lean to one side or anothert.  This election is going to push us into a new area and whether its good or bad doesn't seem to be at play,  what I see is the one camp (all the other politicans) not understanding Trumps popularity and those people will continue to do business as usual.  This business as usual willcontinue to breed our discontent and help feed our views about one world governments etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I see Trumps campaign and I understand his appeal.  He is throwing out the playbook and letting politicans through out our country know their positions are no longer secure.  The people who follow Trump are fed up.  They no longer believe the 'same way' is ever going to work.  They may not believe Trump will make any changes but they are aware that just putting him into office will force politicans into rethinking their positions.  Change is important.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you noticed that most politicans in government or congress is not saying anything?  Its either they feel they are standing in the front of headlights and are blinded by the results or they are playing their same ole game of waiting to see the momentum and then taking the popular side.  This way of running a government has got to end.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is like the French revaluation without the killing etc.  Just like in France the people were fed up.  The elite didn't underrstand their position because they were far removed from those struggles.  Instead of the people picking up axes and swords, guns etc, Trump and his supporters are trying to change the system using the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       One can say Trump is being malnipulated or he has a different agenda than is exposed but what I think we are seeing is a maverick.  What I think that makes people think of heavy imaginativel motives are people who have been exposed to long to the current political Arenas and no longer trusts anyone.  Change is coming whether we like it or not.  The only thing that matters is how we respond to that change.

       Also, I think he's a demagogue, and his movement is proto-fascist, in my opinion.
The establishment doesn't want Trump because they'd rather have someone rule with consent rather than brute force. They're hoping for another centrist like Hillary. With Trump they'd get someone willing to threaten violence to get his way.
      </p>
      <p>
       When big money starts backing someone like that is the moment fascism occurs. I don't think they're that desperate quite yet, but as soon as people try to turn away from the establishment it's going to go one of two ways, is my feeling. What people are really tired of is capitalism, even if they don't know it yet. It's not the government that makes people lose their jobs, most people are employed by private industry. Trump doesn't talk about that. He's a winner, a business man. He clearly doesn't shy away from threatening violence either.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think he's being manipulated, and his agenda is mostly his own, but that doesn't mean he can't be used by people in the future.

       I'm not necessarily disagreeing, but when the government acts primarily in the interest of corporations I find it impossible to distinguish one from the other.  Our government is controlled by corporations who finance politicians to further their best interests.  The politicians we "elect" are selected and promoted by corporations and the main stream media.
      </p>
      <p>
       The image of Oprah parading Obama onstage saying "This is THE ONE!" like he was some Messiah is just stuck in my head.  Pretty much cant get more corporate/media endorsement than Oprah in 2007-2008, imo.
      </p>
      <p>
       And here comes Trump seemingly without a dog in the fight.  He's made all the money he needs to make so he doesn't need corporate donations.  He's already nationally recognized.  I've heard it said he's bringing issues that people really care about to light:  unsecured borders, endless war for nothing, government corruption and waste.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, it's been said that he is "pandering to the lowest common denominator in society."  The uneducated, bigots, idiots.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today is primary election day for me, and I still don't know how I'll vote.  None of the Republicans have made clear their plans and policies.  Lacking another option, I'm probably going to vote Trump because at least he's not a career politician.

       So far the only one's being violent are protestors trying to crash Trump rallies. You can find people all over Twitter/Facebook saying they will key someones car with a Trump sticker on it for example. The hate against him, and his supporters is very real, and fueled by the MSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as for why big business isn't backing Trump. Have you even looked at Trump's economic policies? The man is basically campaigning on ending cheap labor across the board. It will cost big business billions in profits. It has nothing to do with them not wanting to back a proto-fascist lol. They just don't want to have to pay Americans 15 dollars an hour end of story.

       And how is he going to end cheap labor? Does he actually have a plan? Does he encourage people to organize into unions? What kinds of jobs does he see the unemployed having? Where are they going to come from? Is he forcing corporations to stay inside the borders? Is he ready to take on free trade, or is he just going to close the borders for people while corporations are still free to move around as much as they want?
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't heard anything about his plan, except for kicking out brown people and building a wall, but feel free to enlighten me.

       Honestly I've always considered that trump is just an opportunist. He see a split in the republican party and he's taking advantage of that anger. I mean he's clearly contradicted himself from the soundbites I've heard, so I doubt he sincerely believes what he says, but either way he'll probably end up filling the role you described. Whether he's in on it or not I can't say.

       Just read about this today. From one of my favorite commentators out there at
       <a href="http://twoicefloes.com/down-the-trump-rabbit-hole-manufacturing-consent/">
        Two Ice Floes
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Thus Donald Trump and his rebel yell, the great white hope (in distinct contrast to the 2008 great black hope), is simply a reflection of the escalation of Empireâ€™s attempt to control whatever it perceives as a threat.
       </p>
       <p>
        Again, â€˜controlâ€™ doesnâ€™t mean absolute and unwavering. There are more than enough conflicting synergies and special interests in the system to contain Trump right up to the point where it is possible for Trump to do significant damage to the system. At that point there are many methods, many of them used in the past, which can once again be used to neutralize even the great and almighty Trump. Personally I donâ€™t think that will become necessary.
       </p>
       <p>
        Trump is every bit the media creation as any other politician, only in this case strengthened by negative press rather than positive. Whenever I see the MSM singing with one voice I try to ignore the spoken message, the narrative if you will, and look elsewhere for the real agenda. When the elite are declaring they are worried about a mere mortal I really start looking for a hidden agenda.
       </p>
       <p>
        The elite want us to beg Trump to be our President just like they will want us to beg the Fed to print more money to save â€˜ourâ€™ money system.
        <strong>
         If I (assuming I was an â€˜eliteâ€™) knew an economic shit storm was headed my way and I wanted someone pre-positioned to do the dirty work for me, in this case a 'strong' leader who will ram 'reforms' down their throats, I would manipulate the herd into begging me for my foul tasting 'medicine'.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Careful what you wish for.

       What if it's less dire, but not by much? Scenario: TTP, TTIP and other major secretly written, controlled and fast tracked (ie. shoved down the people's throats) trade agreements ARE ALL TIMED to be carried to the end zone by the break out candidate. The result is something like a crypto-fascist neo feudalistic corporate dictatorship. I predict corporations will be able to perform arrests for those who appose it. That's right! "You are under arrest by the order of General Electric."

       Nice theory except for the fact Trump is against the TPP, and the media doesn't cover that. If anything the real fascist intended to bring in this corporate dictatorship is Hillary. Wife of the same man who brought us NAFTA.

       You have to go back to 1913, ww1, great depression, ww2,  jfk? mlk, rfk, x, Vietnam, 911, Iraq, Afghanistan, 2008 and so on and so forth. It's a huge build up to come to crescendo that I have seen coming whole life and no one can stop it.  See yall later if Trump is POTUS.

       Yes he is.  But because there is such a dislike of him by the powers that be in the house and senate (if its genuine), this could ALSO perhaps spark a claw-back of legislative powers from the executive branch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or perhaps I am too optimistic.

       I think TPTB just did what they always do and hedge their bet. Trump is there to secure a Hillary presidency and if Hillary were to get indicted or something else then that's ok since there will be Trump there to deregulate all restrictions on corporations. Either way they win and people to continue to think they are part of the game and can actually make a difference. Until a non-peaceful revolution takes place we will continue not to matter.

       If Trump gets voted president he more than likely will be part of a fake assassination. He's about the right age now to slither into the shadows as part of the Elite.

       Oh, I finally get it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I always wondered why idiot progressives use the term "fascist" incorrectly. I figured, hey, communists always call their enemies "fascist" so there's probably nothing more to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then I read the idiot progressives quoting Mussolini saying that "fascism is the merge of state and corporate power."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a fake quote. Mussolini never said it.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I think I figured out where the idiot progressive made their mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mussolini (well, his translators) used the word "corporate" a few times, in the sense of a "corporate body," or a "collective group." It's meant to mean the same thing that the idiot progressives mean when they say "the elites divide us" - the elites divide the "corporate body" and turn the groups against each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the idiot progressives didn't realize that the term "corporate" - as used by Mussolini - was meant in the sense of "unity."
      </p>
      <p>
       Not in the modern, American sense of "limited liability corporations" or even "corporate personhood."
      </p>
      <p>
       So the idiot progressive actually believe that Mussolini was talking about limited liability corporations when he was actually talking about "unity of the people."
      </p>
      <p>
       This has bugged me for a while, so I'm glad I finally figured out why progressives sound so fucking stupid all the time.

       But the media (all forms) always teaches kids to LOVE the government and LOVE other races and to HATE the white race and that being on welfare is GOOD. So, no. If anything, we've been indoctrinated to accept someone like Bernie Sanders, not Donald Trump, who millennials by and large abhor. (Which is one reason Donald Trump has my vote: if millennials hate it, it must be good.)

       I watch Donald Trump on TV and see a somewhat buffonish, but kinda likable old guy that reminds me of his hilarious appearances at professional wrestling events.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the left watches Donald Trump on TV and nearly wets themselves, as they fantasize about a New Hitler, a merciless dictator that will send them all to the gas chambers.

       I guess I'm forced to have to agree with the conservatives - liberals are a bunch of cowardly little girly-men wetting their beds.
