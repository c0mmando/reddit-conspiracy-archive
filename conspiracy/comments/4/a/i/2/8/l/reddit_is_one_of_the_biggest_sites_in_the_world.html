        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m no expert in the whole conspiracy field yet I do think it&#39;s very very very suspicious that all political videos are not allowed on <a href="/r/videos">/r/videos</a>, which is, afaik,pretty much the biggest video source of information spreading on the internet. </p>

<p>Perhaps it&#39;s just mods being dumbasses or too sensitive to do what they need to do, but I think there is a real possibility that if there is some form of elite power structure that likes to control information, you would simply go to one the biggest information sites on the internet and remove and possibility of this fraudulent system being talked about, which I think is a fucking shame, because the sub used to be better without the rule and there wasn&#39;t such a problem as it&#39;s made out to be. </p>

<p>And <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalVideo">https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalVideo</a> is a joke, because the rule removed more than just politics. Take the &#39;Quran/bible experiment&#39; video for example, it got submitted over and over again and it hit the top 5 of <a href="/r/videos">/r/videos</a> multiple times. Now politics per definition is not religion yet it still was removed despite the community saying it was pretty much the best video there was to see those days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It worked fine before they introduced &quot;control&quot; , which is nothing more than a fancy word for (ensorship. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Criticizing the US !ntelligence community suddenly becomes problematic. Even if you can prove that they have systematically and brazenly broken laws and rules. It doesn&#39;t matter that you can also prove that the head of the N5A has lied under oat, not once but twice, in front of congress without any consequences.</p></li>
<li><p>You can&#39;t criticize major corporations or hold them accountable for their illegal activities. Criticizing the (orporate 0wned mass media is completely out of the question. </p></li>
<li><p>Even mentioning the VAST criminality taking place inside the financial industry will get you immediately 9anned from many a forum. </p></li>
<li><p>If you use certain phrases and word, you will trigger algorithms that hide your post and comments from other users. On you own profile everything appears normal, but if you switch to another profile/computer/internet connection, you can observe it. Using the words: zh!ll or 9und!t just isn&#39;t appropiate any more...</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In essence they want to limit and control access to information. They have an agenda. Their methods are extreme sophisticated. They are extremely manipulative. The average citizen is utterly clueless. </p>
