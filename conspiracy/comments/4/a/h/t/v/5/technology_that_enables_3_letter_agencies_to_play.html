       I'm sure you guys are aware that the "No Such Agency" shares data with law enforcement and other 3 letter agencies. But do you know how they can make sense of it?

       My favorite example of how access to any data you 'produce"(for lack of a better term) can be used maliciously if the person in possession has the right motivation and time.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a group who figured out being granted access to ones battery usage was enough for them to follow your phones location throughout the day based on how hard your battery has to work to hit different cell towers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using that in conjunction with let's say your FB or twitter. Where you post things like "getting my 7 am coffee" and "Last one to leave the office" can then be used to show a pattern with your battery usage. So at this point you could effectively track someone based solely on their battery. Just that sliver of information and the fact that humans tend to have a routine we complete every normal business day, ends in that little innocent piece of data enabling someone to have access to more information than you realize.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Google lets pretty much any app gain access to battery usage data, so a hacker could either build a fake app to monitor that data or pull data from another app.

       What about a cell phone rootkit that masquerades as "diagnostics for service improvement" and was once present on 150 million devices?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        IQ Agent is software, typically pre-installed on mobile devices by handset manufacturers or network operators, designed to gather, store and forward diagnostic measurements on their behalf. Data available can include metrics on the device itself (e.g., firmware,
        <strong>
         battery levels
        </strong>
        , application performance, web performance) and performance data on voice and data connectivity between the device and radio towers.

       course they do. The things do things for you. They take control of your life for you so you can glide through the day never noticing the outside world. then one day they'll have no need for the grinders. and poof all the things that were important are gone.

       I don't think your garden variety human knows how their "metadata" manifests itself on a graphical chart. If they did, they wouldn't like it. Those people, like many here, who sounded the alarms on those revelations at the onset were able to conceptualize how this data would be compiled and charted down the road. Now some creep in a black van can pull-up your profile and know 99% of your entire life's movements, to the meter, at a 2-second glance.
      </p>

       What's so insipid about dragnet ops is that they are easy to skirt if you really needed to skirt them. And, if they do in fact hold this data on all humans, what morality code is used as judge and jury? Most cages could be filled with elected officials
       <em>
        alone
       </em>
       if THEIR metadata was charted-up. But then, who would the prison companies bribe..
