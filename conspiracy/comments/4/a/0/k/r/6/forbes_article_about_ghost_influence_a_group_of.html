       Looks like our tin-foil hat wearing isn't necessarily in vain. A Forbes article (
       <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/julesschroeder/2016/03/10/the-magic-formula-behind-going-viral-on-reddit/#6885c7655271">
        "The Magic Formula Behind Going Viral On Reddit"
       </a>
       ) just uncovered a guy who has created an entire community of people who shill on Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       He goes by "Ghost Influence" now, used to be "Social Shirpa". He charges $97/mo for advertisers (I assume?) and has a slack channel where they collude to make shit "go viral" on Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I work in advertising. I don't have a problem with ads in general. But this is black-hat marketing. When there's no disclosure that someone is being paid to advertise, that's against FCC guidelines. It's despicable. His description on his membership page reads "Leverage Democracy", and that's exactly what he's doing - taking a democratic process and leveraging it to make money for himself and infiltrate Reddit content. I hope he gets what's coming to him.

       The thing that kills me is that so much of the Front Page is good, valuable content (if you manage your subscriptions). I've been on Reddit for over 7 years (5 on this account), and I love this community.

       Clarification below about the shill thing, but as someone who knows a great deal about social algorithms... you should question 100% of what you see everywhere. Not so much of a conspiracy IMO, but rather warranted investigation (and interesting to understand). Some of it is certainly "manipulation" but most is just the circumstances of math.

       Oh geeze, that's a beast of a topic (but a fantastic question).
      </p>
      <p>
       So, Reddit's algorithm (math) has a menagerie of variables with varying weights. Theirs is one of the most simple social algorithms (Facebook is beastly and the reason you see such "curated" content in your feed). There have been a number of data science experiments on Reddit (linked below), but the two things I'll call out are this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It's been shown that, "
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJdLl8qLgeU">
         seeing upvotes before the content being upvoted can result in a 25% to 32% increase in the likelihood of additional upvotes
        </a>
        " (it's human nature to follow the masses). So as a "marketer" (i.e. someone submitting something and wanting people to see it) I'd want to post in the morning when
        <a href="http://ramiro.org/tools/reddit-post-times/">
         more people are online
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Binary content (content easily consumed and determined "I like this" or "I don't like this") is far more likely to garner votes (and conversation). This is noted in a somewhat recently
        <a href="https://blog.datastories.com/blog/reddit-front-page">
         data science study here
        </a>
        . So taking some time to craft an effective message (what could be called "copywriting") will help (good) content get seen more.
       </p>

       Ahh, thanks for clarifying. Yea, there's certainly less happening on Reddit, but it's here (proportionately) as much as anywhere else. Once or twice I've gotten the compliment of someone saying "thank you" in the comments of a Facebook ad and can't help but smile. When you "sell" something to someone and they thank you afterwards (i.e. it was something they really needed or wanted)... that's how it should (or can) be. It's also more fun.

       Totally, I tell people I teach "digital empathy" (i.e. "give a shit about the human on the other end of the keyboard and money things will happen"). Currently working on changing the phrasing of the Ghost Influence website, but (as much as I hate to admit it... and that Forbes knew when creating that title) "Reddit Marketing" is a more compelling headline.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yea, data science and sociology are fucking fascinating. That's the majority of what I teach and the "reddit marketing" thing is purely a gateway drug to a bigger (harder to quantify) methodology. Technology is fantastic, but it's so easy to forget you're engaging with other humans (and has quantifiable

       Truer words.
      </p>
      <p>
       I struggled in business for years because I refused to be a part of that machine. It was only when I stopped giving fucks and started teaching people how to be human that people started wanting to pay me (significant) money.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's honestly become a great filter. Some companies don't give a fuck and those are easy to spot, but others just don't understand how to speak the language and need some help. The latter are who I work with, more just because the former are pains in the ass, morally conflicting, and pay for shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a simplistic example I'll say, "Hey... so when you 'like' your own posts on Facebook it's the interpersonal equivalent of narcissism. Kind of like you saying you made a thing and then telling them how awesome it is. If it's awesome, they'll tell you... if it's not... make it better... they'll tell you how."
      </p>
      <p>
       The people who care (which is a surprising amount some days) are like "oh, heh... that makes sense. Judy! Tell the intern to stop making us look narcissistic!!"
      </p>
      <p>
       There will always be "those people" but that doesn't mean the "others" don't exist. Find (and buy from) the latter.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I write this, I'm sitting at a cafe in the westside of Los Angeles drinking a free ($5) coffee. The cafe where I'm camped about 20 hours a week is
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/comedy/comments/3olrxh/writing_at_my_local_cafe_when_jerry_seinfeld/">
        bright, busy, and full of great scenery
       </a>
       . The coffee is more expensive, there's no power to charge, seating is limited, and the wifi could stand to be faster... but the staff are amazing. I've come to know all their names and they've come to know mine. They see me walking up and prep my normal coffee (which I pay for most days). Occasionally, like today, I go to pull out my credit card and they say "you're all set"... it makes my entire week. Especially considering how many "regulars" I know that don't get nearly the same treatment. They genuinely care about me and I genuinely care about them. I spend about $150 here a month (cheaper than an office and I get more done in busy places), but (as a customer) I wouldn't give up the way they make me feel for anything. Businesses have the ability to do that, they're all made of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you need something, buy it. If you want something... buy it from someone who cares about you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't ever let companies get away with treating you like a profit.

       This used to be true even a year or two ago, it isn't anymore.  And my prediction is it'll just continue to get worse going forward.  The single biggest turning point that I noticed seemed to be when they took away showing the upvote and downvote totals for comments.  It used to be obvious when certain things were being heavily promoted or completely buried - noticing how blatant it was is part of what led me to discussion forums like
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       in the first place.  There's clearly a big difference between a comment that's at (+1/-0) and one that's at (+120/-119) but on the reddit of today you wouldn't know it.

       You're so generous. I find Reddit quickly becoming less and less interesting. When I joined, I was mind blown. Now the comment threads are totally predictable and the links often appear on my Facebook feed first.

       News, politics, religion, the internet . . . why is everything so fake?  Why do people look at other people as a resouce to be exploited?   Why do people love the lie and fear the truth?   Even science is full of quackery, agenda-pushing, groupthink, covering up uncomfortable truths . . . it's sickening.  Of course Reddit is no different.

       Evil is simply self-serving behavior at the expense of others.  Try to think of an evil outside of this definition.  It's just a choice available to consciousness to pick in a given situation.  Evil requires conscious choice or else it is just inconvenient causality based on physics and our ignorance of how to overcome it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The core essence of evil is a seeking to gain benefits from and/or shift one's burdens onto others.  It can be seen as slave seeking (seeking to get others to serve oneself) behavior.  It can be seen as parasitic.  Deception is a valuable tool to this end.
      </p>
      <p>
       ALL of the things you mentioned are caused by this self-serving behavior at the expense of others.  If we all consistently made this choice, we'd move toward low systemic integrity, entropy.  We'd be treacherous and undermine others' efforts and systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       The opposite choice would be to lose out on gain and/or take on burden to serve other people.  This is what the best spiritual teachers told us to do.  If we all consistently made this choice, we'd move toward high systemic integrity.  We'd be trustworthy and build on others' efforts and systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       When all involved would win in a perceived to be adequate way, even those that usually chose evil will usually choose to cooperate.  It's the temptation for self-serving gains or burden shifting that causes conscious beings to choose evil.

       We really need a rule on here that if you want to link to a site with the "must have adblock off" bullshit, you need to copypaste the whole article so people can read it. Forbes and now Wired are the two I know that do this. Forbes doesn't know how to properly monitor their advertisers and the ads they allow to run can hijack yoir browser. Google it if you don't remember/didn't catch the debacle when they first went "no ad block".

       Just catching your comment. It's not (intentionally) an advertisement, but I use trackreddit.com to catch brand mentions so I can participate in the conversation (no affiliation, but been using their service a few weeks and it's well built). It's not an advertisement in the sense that I didn't make any effort to get it submitted here. It is an advertisement in the sense that me taking the time to participate in the conversation usually results in people hating me less (because I'm open and honest) which is good for business... more so... it's just good practice in communication.

       One of my favorite sayings, "I learned it on accident, but I now use it on purpose."
      </p>
      <p>
       I got attacked on
       <a href="/r/drama">
        /r/drama
       </a>
       when I was featured in AdWeek and jumped into the conversation solely to understand perspectives different than my own (I teach 'digital empathy' and temporarily stepping out of your reality is nothing if not educational). The four hours of commenting resulted in a client inquiry from a $2B company. We didn't end up working together, but it drove home the value of having conversations.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the core of what I teach people (in regards to Reddit and otherwise). Invest in the community as a member of the community and let the rest happen. I work with a lot of charismatic companies that seem to lose all personality when they go into "marketing" mode. Most of what I do is lecture (and show) them how to be themselves when they speak (regardless of platform or context).

       Someone told me to read a book years ago. They were very forceful about how much the book meant to them and that I should read it. I refused to read the book because it was forced on me to directly. Years later, I happened to pick it up and it made meaningful changes to my life. If that person had put it in front of me subtly, rather than crammed it down my throat, I would have seen the positive shift much sooner. That's where the name 'Ghost Influence' comes from.

       The individual nature of a human is crafted partially from who they are, but more so from what they experience. I made the choice to adopt what I read in that book, no one forced me. Similarly, I'm sure the version of you that existed ten years ago might not recognize the version of you that exists today. We're humans, we grow and develop over time. "Fake" in this context doesn't fit as it felt real to me and (not offense intended) that's all that really matters.

       Offering some clarification and happy to answer questions.

      <p>
       tl;dr — I don't do advertising, but rather teach people to contribute (and not be assholes)
      </p>
      <p>
       The podcast (45min) attached to the bottom of the Forbes article goes into a bit more detail, but Ghost Influence (the Slack group) is where I teach Reddit. There's a fantastic plethora of amazing people in the world who want to engage (authentically) and don't know how. I learned the hard way, but love the interaction on the platform and wanted to make it easier for people to jump in (without rightfully being condemned as shills). I've got a podcast where I interview people who've hit the front page and break down both intentional and accidental leverage of Reddit which comes from understanding the community, creating / sharing something awesome, and garnering (warranted) interest.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        He charges $97/mo for advertisers (I assume?)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again, I don't work with advertisers. I work with cool people who want to learn (for all intensive purposes) how to use Reddit. It's a lot of "hey... that's super self-promoting, how could you create something of value to them?" and "let's focus on the story, if they're interested they'll find you on their own."
      </p>
      <p>
       End goal, less spam and more cool people who understand how to be Reddiors.
      </p>
      <p>
       I occasionally consult with companies that have tried to "market on Reddit" and been banned for things like campaigning for votes or hiding behind the guise of a third party. Most of the time, a fan had submitted something of theirs (product, video, etc.) and, remembering the impact, did the same themselves the next time they came out with something... but not knowing the platform they violated every rule imaginable and were rightfully banned. This consulting usually entail explaining the basics and why they were perceived as such assholes. Sometimes they heed the advice and submit something cool, other time they just avoid it and let things happen naturally (if they do at all).
      </p>
      <p>
       Other times, like last week, an $18B company contacted me wanting "to get traffic from Reddit" and I (as politely as possible) told them they would be murdered if they stepped foot in the room (syndicated viral content created for the sole reason of generating pageviews).
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, open book and happy to answer any questions.

       Look, man. I understand that you're trying to make a buck like the rest of us. But what you're doing is against FCC guidelines - if you're advertising a product and not disclosing, you're doing something illegal.
      </p>

       Whether the companies you're counseling are $1B or $100, seeding "organic" content on Reddit for advertising purposes is against the rules.

      <p>
       You use language like "Leverage Democracy" and "$0 Paid, 100% Organic"... those are marketing terms. Are you really going to tell me that your activity on Reddit is "less spam and more cool people who understand how to be Redditors"?

       Heh, you sound like me. I regularly give people the FCC lecture. Everything that is promoted needs to be disclosed (that's not Reddit, it's the law). Rarely are the people I work with directly advertising a product. As an example, I launched a blog and made it intentionally difficult for people to contact me as I didn't want to come off as self-promoting shill (I had no email opt-in, no "work with me" page, and my "about" was a cheeky paragraph). That submission (and the post) went viral and I never once sold something... publicly. It did however foster a ton of awesome conversations with people, companies, conferences, etc. and powered a consulting business for two years.

       I've had a few chats with Reddit HQ and they're aware of what I do. They offered to pass a few people they chose not to work with to me so I could coach their marketing departments, but nothing has come from that yet.

      <p>
       100% agree and honestly hate every word on the site. The reality is that I "catch" people (often marketers) who want to "leverage reddit" and then teach them how to contribute. The language is designed to speak to people who don't understand, but once they start going through stuff if makes sense. That said, I'm changing a lot of the language as communicating Reddit to non-Redditors in a way that makes them want to learn how to "do it right" is... challenging to say the least.

       So let's talk about the
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/49jo3i/because_tuesday/">
        most recent post you made to /r/Funny
       </a>
       . That's a product that you're trying to seed on Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you disclosing anywhere that you have a professional relationship with "Delicate Estates"? Because it looks to me like you're receiving money behind the scenes to post this (or somehow stand to gain financially), and you haven't in any way disclosed that relationship.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can condemn your own site all you want, but your post history makes it clear - you spread marketing links around Reddit. You're astroturfing.

       I don't have a professional relationship with Delicate Estates (therefore no disclosure needed), but that said... one of the cofounders is (kind of) an ex and I was curious if (primarily male Redditors) thought it was funny. My feedback to them was to change/fix their product pages as people didn't "get the joke" right away.

       And before you jump to it... she has a boyfriend now so I didn't post it for "other gains"

       You state that I'm making financial gain behind the scenes, but I'd hope you understand that's an assumption (and a false one at that). I completely understand the skepticism and am happy to have an honest conversation, but "you spread marketing links around Reddit" is a pretty far leap.

       You are correct. That's what I'm saying, no one is paying me to Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are paying me for a lot of other things, but not that. I get bombed with "can you submit my thing" and it's usually the seed of a shitpost. Not bad people or (always) bad products, just not a fit for Reddit. My activities elsewhere drive people to Ghost Influence (where I make money).
      </p>
      <p>
       I use Reddit for fun and (if I find something cool and it hits the front page) I might talk about it on my blog, but again no one  is paying me (directly or indirectly) to submit to Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, I tell people "if you're looking to pay someone to do it for you... it's not the platform for you."

       Seems like a rather typical consultant, and I'm sure he is one of many.  Contemplate your consumption carefully, that applies to all realms of consumption, not just Reddit.

       You're spot on. I got into marketing because I started contemplating my consumption (and that of others). I have no degrees in marketing (Graphic Design actually), but was just perpetually curious and ended up being good at it. Everything you see is curated... even the people in front of you. Think of how you act at home versus in public (use of pants for instance). I'd argue that any action taken to modify behavior for any reasons other than your own is "marketing" or (if you want to be sensationalist) "manipulation". So yea, question everything — always.

       Not on any side here but my two cents is I worked in digital advertising in the entertainment dept. When FCC guidelines were being violated or riding the line (via the client or the company that employed me), I was told they were JUST guidelines and to "just do my job". Advertising is doing way more covert things than using some shills to drive traffic to their "product". 
It was a year of hell working in advertising and a terrifying eye opener.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr -- Advertising is far more insidious than you think and GI/Brian is just making a living and seems like a genuinely nice fella.

       Hi there.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's your opinion on how to get something to 'go viral' on a sub like
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ? What would you post that would get a lot of upvotes?

       The first thing I tell people is that Reddit is 95% research. This is the first time I've ever engaged on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       so I'm not familiar with the what's of interest to the community.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second thing I tell (or rather ask) people is "why?" Everyone and their mother wants to go "viral" and few ever know why. Most of the time, in just a conversation, people start to understand the value of one-on-one conversations and small groups. I've "gone viral" several times, it really doesn't amount to anything meaningful... but it does provide a platform for you to make something meaningful.

       You are manipulating reddit. Thats what it comes down to. You can word things however you want but its easy to read between the lines and see that what you are doing is some of the lowest of the low.  Manipulating opinion and manipulating what people see and trying to do it undetected. Its the reason you are vague with every sentence you write and use orwellian words instead of being clear. If you were actually being clear and upfront you would have to say exactly what it is you are trying to accomplish and what people are paying you for and that is to manipulate.

       Said differently, they have a desire to learn the platform and, previously scared off by unfavorable experience or the possibilities thereof, they want to learn how to engage effectively.

       "Marketing" is not the most favorable word to Redditors and I think most of that ties back to the people with massive budgets and no fucks invested in how annoyed you are by the ads. IMO a "10% click through" (which most would brag about) means you pissed off 90% of the audience. Apply the same logic at a bar and you'd wind up with your face pummeled so... avoid doing it online and you're more likely to get a "thanks" from a random stranger ;)

       Have you ever had any inquirys from people not wanting to market a product, but wanting to market "public image" or inversely to destroy public image/a news story/a competitors product?
      </p>
      <p>
       From my personal point of view, a market place such as the internet, needs to find a way to help people learn about new products they need or want.  That can be very intrusive and annoying if done wrong, to the point where it ruins the novelty of the market place.  But when done well Its a welcome service to help us find all these things we like, and actually adds value to the market place.
      </p>
      <p>
       My concern comes with manipulation of public perception, such as the girl who claimed to see iraqi soldiers leaving babies on the ground to die while they stole incubators from hospitals in Kuwait.  It turned out to be a lie that helped gain consent from the public and the Congress for a war that cost countless lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or when a huge corporation can afford to use negative marketing to cover up the flaws in their products, or make a big deal out of the flaws in a competitors product that are disproportionate to reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Too much negative marketing makes a confusing market place,  destroys legitimate companies and tricks consumers into making bad choices.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also can in a public relations role cause society itself to suffer from... Well bad people being put into positions of power like the Bush dynasty and the Clinton dynasty.

       Fantastic questions. Personally, I haven't had anyone come to me wanting to destroy public image. That said, I'm rather fluent in reading body language, voice inflection, and written tonalities (translation: I can usually tell a lot more about people than they'd like me to know). I talk (a lot) about not working with people that don't match your energy / morals and am making more and more money by passing on clients (I make a lot of referrals and occasionally people send me a "thank you commission" but we don't have a formal agreement and I don't expect it). Said differently, this "epic marketing by way of giving a shit about fellow humans" only works with the right people so I politely pass very often.
      </p>
      <p>
       I interviewed Ali Spagnola in Episode 14 of my podcast (an influencer who's also a Redditor, but rarely submits to Reddit. Her stuff hits the front page from time to time solely because it's hilarious). I originally wanted to talk about her "how to make a mimosa" gif (which was stolen and submitted without attribution) as she made a brilliant response video. We ended up talking a lot about her creative process. She does a fantastic job channeling who she is into her content — total authenticity. I've run into her a few times and (regardless of her alcohol consumption) what you see on her Vine, Twitter, and Youtube is exactly what you get in real life. She's been my recent go-to example for building "public image".
      </p>
      <p>
       To the rest of your message, there will always be "those people".
      </p>
      <p>
       You're absolutely right. There are two problems at the core of what you described. The first is that people manipulate maliciously. I manipulate often, but with good intentions. For example, my friend took way too much acid and was freaking out so I slowed the cadence of my voice, made direct eye contact, and ask him emotional questions (e.g. "can you describe to me what you're feeling right now" and "where do you feel you need to be?"). After 30 minutes in a parking lot he looked less like he was on the run from a murder and was able to go back inside (he was trying to run away).
      </p>
      <p>
       The second problem is the real problem. People don't question what they see nearly as much as they should. I'm not saying everything is a conspiracy, but everything does warrant exploration. I learned everything I know about algorithms (i.e what's seen on social), data science, sociology, cognitive science, etc. because I refused to grow out of the three year old phase of perpetually asking "why?" I don't think there's a utopian answer and have long given up on my soapbox, but rather try to lead my example and taking conversations deeper — even when it's with someone with whom I don't agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yea, the more adoption there is to a marketplace the more people will change the nature of what it once was (the definition of evolution), but (and this is my hope) if more people come into that marketplace with a better understanding of how they fit in... the more that marketplace will evolve for the better.
      </p>
      <p>
       People often "spam" as a hail mary because they simply don't understand another means to communicate effectively.

       My point is that we need marketing on some level.  We have to decide what kind of marketing is acceptable.  But marketing is a thing we have all benefited from at some point.

       Right,

      <p>
       As if the computer/smartphone/tablet you're using right now to talk shit wasn't built upon the foundations of capitalism/marketing/consumerism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take your complaints into the wilderness and survive without all these conveniences that have been marketed to us for generations by people who had ideas, realized the utility of those ideas and reached out to others who might also benefit from that utility.

       If you truly feel the way that you do then say goodbye to Intel, Apple and Asus.   Remove yourself from the market place, but don't cry on my boots because I'm smart enough to RECOGNIZE the obvious market place that brings packaged spinach to the dinner table while you type at me on the internet which most definitely doesn't exist without the market place.

       I love how you presume I oppose all marketing. Somehow tie that in with the presumption that I'm a communist. And finally, assume all of this is why I oppose your abuse of simultaneous position as moderator and joined-at-the-hip friend-of-shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       No. Once you engage in Edward Bernays style misrepresentation and abuse of market, you've stepped into black hat territory in violation of basic morality and truthfulness. To oppose such is not "communist". It's simply right.
      </p>
      <p>
       I repeat: you do not deserve your position as moderator. You abuse it. And that what I say is true is clear based on your conduct in this exchange.

       Heh, you sound like me. I regularly give people the FCC lecture. Everything that is promoted needs to be disclosed (that's not Reddit, it's the law). Rarely are the people I work with directly advertising a product. As an example, I launched a blog and made it intentionally difficult for people to contact me as I didn't want to come off as self-promoting shill (I had no email opt-in, no "work with me" page, and my "about" was a cheeky paragraph). That submission (and the post) went viral and I never once sold something... publicly. It did however foster a ton of awesome conversations with people, companies, conferences, etc. and powered a consulting business for two years.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr — the best monetization happens in the conversations that come after viral
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Whether the companies you're counseling are $1B or $100, seeding "organic" content on Reddit for advertising purposes is against the rules.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I've had a few chats with Reddit HQ and they're aware of what I do. They offered to pass a few people they chose not to work with to me so I could coach their marketing departments, but nothing has come from that yet.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You use language like "Leverage Democracy" and "$0 Paid, 100% Organic"... those are marketing terms. Are you really going to tell me that your activity on Reddit is "less spam and more cool people who understand how to be Redditors"?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       100% agree and honestly hate every word on the site. The reality is that I "catch" people (often marketers) who want to "leverage reddit" and then teach them how to contribute. The language is designed to speak to people who don't understand, but once they start going through stuff if makes sense. That said, I'm changing a lot of the language as communicating Reddit to non-Redditors in a way that makes them want to learn how to "do it right" is... challenging to say the least.

       Oh geeze, that's a beast of a topic (but a fantastic question).
      </p>
      <p>
       So, Reddit's algorithm (math) has a menagerie of variables with varying weights. Theirs is one of the most simple social algorithms (Facebook is beastly and the reason you see such "curated" content in your feed). There have been a number of data science experiments on Reddit (linked below), but the two things I'll call out are this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It's been shown that, "
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJdLl8qLgeU">
         seeing upvotes before the content being upvoted can result in a 25% to 32% increase in the likelihood of additional upvotes
        </a>
        " (it's human nature to follow the masses). So as a "marketer" (i.e. someone submitting something and wanting people to see it) I'd want to post in the morning when
        <a href="http://ramiro.org/tools/reddit-post-times/">
         more people are online
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Binary content (content easily consumed and determined "I like this" or "I don't like this") is far more likely to garner votes (and conversation). This is noted in a somewhat recently
        <a href="https://blog.datastories.com/blog/reddit-front-page">
         data science study here
        </a>
        . So taking some time to craft an effective message (what could be called "copywriting") will help (good) content get seen more.
       </p>

       Not on any side here but my two cents is I worked in digital advertising in the entertainment dept. When FCC guidelines were being violated or riding the line (via the client or the company that employed me), I was told they were JUST guidelines and to "just do my job". Advertising is doing way more covert things than using some shills to drive traffic to their "product". 
It was a year of hell working in advertising and a terrifying eye opener.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr -- Advertising is far more insidious than you think and GI/Brian is just making a living and seems like a genuinely nice fella.
