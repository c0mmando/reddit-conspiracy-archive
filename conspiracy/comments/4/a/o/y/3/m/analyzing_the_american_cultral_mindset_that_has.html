        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Trump&#39;s campaign bewilders a lot of people, and rightfully so. It doesn&#39;t make sense in a whole lot of ways. You notice when Trump is &quot;attacked&quot; by the media or other people, it seems to only reinforce his campaign. He apparently doesn&#39;t care about what is true or not as far as convincing others, he only cares if he looks good. It&#39;s an image game, and he knows it. It&#39;s a 330-million-person high-school popularity contest. The key to looking good is being confident. He is extremely confident, to a point where he never experiences a moment without confidence, because he is an extreme narcissist. He thinks he is the greatest thing, and so do all his followers. No Trump supporter is on the fence about Trump. You are either with him or against him, 100%, according to his camp. The lack of ability to see shades of gray comes through in his speeches, and in the behavior and speech of his followers. It is emotionally polarizing to a much higher degree than most candidacies in history. </p>

<p>This desire for confidence from the people comes from the fact everything generally sucks right now and the country is falling apart. Most everyone sees it on some level. People want a guy to step in and save the day, a hero. Like in the movies. They know the system has been taken over by big money, and they think this may be the reason Trump can stand a chance against it. Truth is though, he&#39;s not anti-establishment, he is merely a different establishment. He will sell out to the military-industrial complex just like the rest including Hillary, Obama, Bush, Clinton and so on. Billionaires have far more in common with each other than they do with the middle class, and Trump is no exception. </p>

<p>We see the obvious hypocrisy coming from the information spearheading his PR campaign, like how he is so mad at Oreo for sending their factories to mexico. Yet Trump sent his clothing line manufacturing from US to Mexico! <a href="http://wp.production.patheos.com/blogs/dispatches/files/2015/07/trumpmexico1.jpg">(image of clothing tag)</a> But when you point this out, his supporters say &quot;Well, he&#39;s just taking advantage of the system as a smart businessman. It&#39;s really the system that is at fault!&quot; I must ask, then why all the hate for Oreo? Are they not doing the same? It&#39;s so blatantly hypocritical. Trump cares not for the middle class one iota, only for himself gaining more power. </p>

<p>There are a million examples of him being a hypocrite or just flat out lying. But his supporters, by and large, don&#39;t care! They&#39;re convinced it&#39;s a media smear job. Where did they learn that? Why, from the media of course. But it&#39;s different when <em>they</em> do it. Ego-centrism runs amok.  </p>

<hr/>

<p>I made 2 comments in <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> today (because it&#39;s on the front page constantly, so I felt free to comment) and I was instantly banned. Here are the two comments as np posts because I do not want to encourage vote brigading: <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4algx9/every_liberal_i_know_right_now/d11mpq5">(one)</a> <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4ak5gy/mrw_florida_was_changed_to_winner_take_all_for/d11mobb">(two)</a></p>

<p>I was banned from the subreddit immediately after posting these 3 sentences. The banning message said I could reply to contact the moderators. So I replied only saying &quot;Why was I banned?&quot; and I immediately got a reply saying &quot;You have been temporarily muted from r/The_Donald. You will not be able to message the moderators of r/The_Donald for 72 hours.&quot;</p>

<p>So it seems they want only an echo chamber. They love memes and jokes tearing down others, except when it&#39;s aimed at them, then they will silence you. It&#39;s funny to consider this behavior in the light of the recent protests/riots at the Trump rally in Chicago, when Trump supporters came out after saying &quot;How <em>dare</em> these supporters try to censor his free speech?&quot; But then when I try to talk, in the place where I am supposed to be able to talk about Trump, I am censored. </p>

<hr/>

<p>I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s lots of bots and shills, or if the supporters following him are really just that emotional and blunt and unsophisticated, or both. I think the appeal to the emotion of &quot;fuck yeah, we&#39;re on the winning team, let&#39;s do this crazy shit!&quot; is a lot of what drives people, it&#39;s something to be proud of in place of the nationalism or religiosity that is gradually falling out of fashion over the last 40 years as we enter decline. It&#39;s something they can root for, like their football team. They can root for it against all the haters, and the memes and the emotion of trump keep it fun and light despite it being so adversarial, so it&#39;s emotionally attractive. It&#39;s a fun game to them. They should be allowed to hear dissenting opinions, but it seems people like me are not allowed to do so in the venue of discussion about that very person. Trump supporters need a &quot;safe space&quot; to operate, it seems. They need an echo chamber. Only a perfect echo chamber can support the lack of specific facts necessary to create an emotional environment that remains appealing to exhausted agitated low-information voters. That&#39;s why that subreddit is filled with memes, not facts. Because it&#39;s about emotions, not thoughts and logic. The thoughts and logic are merely a delivery system to produce the right emotions, with this type of campaign.</p>

<p>Will people keep falling for it? How much of his popularity is media-created, and how much is real? It&#39;s very hard to tell. But it certainly will take much longer for people to wake out of their Trump-supporting stupor if they are isolated from information that would convince them otherwise, especially if it&#39;s without them knowing and they think they&#39;re getting an actual free speech zone, like they always talk about desperately wanting. I thought they hated PC and censorship?  </p>

<p>It&#39;s cool if people want to support a candidate, but why are they so hot-set on censoring everyone who disagrees with them, and talking over the people they can&#39;t censor? Why are the points never engaged on a topical or logical level, and instead are always addressed at the emotional level? It&#39;s because these are emotional people, and they are being emotionally played by someone who is good at projecting the right emotions. The people supporting him are emotionally insecure because they see their country falling apart and their lives deteriorating economically, and they are attracted to the confidence and wealth of Trump because he makes them feel good again. It feels good to be on the winning team, and Trump is projecting a lot of winning vibes through the unbreakable overconfidence. Doesn&#39;t matter if his policies make sense exactly, or if he has a long history of just saying whatever to get what he wants, just as long as everyone is feeling good about America moving in the right direction again. </p>

<p>This &quot;feels-based&quot; campaign is reminiscent of the SJW movement, but more aggressive. They use the same tactics of censoring the speech of those they disagree with, and making fun of others who disagree with over-confident memes to cover up their actual lack of confidence. They don&#39;t investigate issues too deeply when contradicted because they&#39;ve emotionally decided on them already. They have taken the tools and the lessons learned from these SJW movements (which they ironically vehemently oppose) to create an echo chamber to draw people in and get emotionally hooked on the Trump juice.</p>

<p>They are like people who do not know the difference between good attention and bad attention. Any press is good press. Supporters are happy if you love Trump too. If you hate Trump, they make fun of you, which empowers them more. Either way, you contributed to the emotions, so you add power to it in theory. This comes from the overconfidence. This tactic is a strength and a weakness. It&#39;s a strength because no one can ever knock you down, nothing will ever prove you wrong, as long as that confidence is there. It&#39;s a weakness because it excludes discussion that goes against what is already known or believed. </p>

<p>I&#39;m aghast at the whole thing. It is possible to speak out and change Trump supporters minds, or otherwise they wouldn&#39;t bother banning people like me who go against the flow of the echo chamber. Their success relies on appearing to be flawless and unquestionably the best. As long as that appearance can be maintained, his supporters are going nowhere. </p>

<p>I think months or maybe a year ago we could&#39;ve ignored this guy and he would&#39;ve fallen out of favor. I felt a lot of people were honestly going along with it as a joke for a while, which I think is a grave mistake for something as serious as this, especially when our country is in such a precarious state. Many bad leaders have risen to power because the people who opposed them didn&#39;t speak up loudly enough until after it is too late. The media knows that if they just ignored him, he&#39;d be gone super fast and everyone would forget him. Down the memory hole. Just like they did to Ron Paul. </p>

<p>But clearly the media is not doing that. Instead they&#39;ve been constantly talking about him from day 1. Often in a bad light, but still giving him attention. And the fact it&#39;s in a bad light doesn&#39;t matter, because any press is good press to the overconfidence that rules his campaign. So it seems almost as if the media wants him to matter, when he really shouldn&#39;t. Which makes me wonder if there is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/400m4w/trump_and_clinton_are_friends_trumps_purpose_is/">media corruption and payoffs going on to keep Trump on the air.</a> I&#39;m almost certain there are, just like for all the candidates. Only the hate flows easier than the love in our pissed off fucked up culture, so Trump wins out of this. His followers get to feel like victims, so they can take victim status and &quot;defend&quot; from the &quot;attacks&quot;. You know, like Israel defended from Palestine by going in to Palestine and killing hundreds of people and flattening hundreds of buildings. &quot;Defense&quot;. It&#39;s not attacking, so it&#39;s not immoral! &quot;They started it!&quot; But it seems the concept of disproportionate retribution is lost on some people. This is also like the SJW movement, always claiming to be the victim, thus giving them the freedom to exact revenge via any sort of righteous anger they see fit, because they were attacked and they are the victim here. </p>

<p>The point is, so many people in this world <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3qwr1v/american_society_is_broken_because_americans/">fall for emotional traps set by clever powerful people.</a> They get ensnared in a belief system, and if their emotions strongly override their logic, they can lose the ability to reason clearly about certain topics. You can&#39;t reason someone out of something they didn&#39;t reason themselves in to, the saying goes. This theme is rampant throughout world politics, but is coming to perfect fruition in the Trump campaign because of the large number of (justifiably) frustrated people. It&#39;s okay to be mad, but if you just go with what sounds good instead of what makes sense, then you will easily fall for traps. Traps like payday loans, or rent-to-own. They sound great at first, but they are tools by which the poor are kept poor. The powerless are tricked in to remaining powerless. They offer temporary short-term relief at the sacrifice of solving the problem in the long-term.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it&#39;s very weird. If it&#39;s not the mods then perhaps it&#39;s a rule like &quot;if the post goes under 50%, hide the vote count&quot;. That would explain why I saw it coming and going when I refreshed, back when the percentage was jumping between 40 and 60%. I don&#39;t know why the admins would make the site have such a rule, seems like they want to cover up vote brigading? Keep people from figuring it out? Same reason they removed the individual up and down vote counts a couple years ago, perhaps. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. It must earn them a lot of income to allow certain brigades, or else they wouldn&#39;t allow it to deteriorate the site like it is. I think those sites are probably minor players, but they&#39;re allowed in the folds in between the larger organizations doing the same, that reddit earns their income from. They&#39;ve sold out like digg also did, but it manifested itself slightly differently, in a less obvious manner. </p>

The Digg day is definitely coming though and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s all that far away now, the next reddit is long overdue and the corruption is becoming too evident even to the ordinary users. I remember what this site used to be in the Swartz days and it&#39;s pretty sad to see how far it&#39;s fallen. All empires crumble under their own weight in the end.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. Voat was supposed to be the next one, but it became a cesspool of the worst elements of reddit that were removed forcibly, which created a safehaven for racists and super-right wing people as a result. It unfortunately became a very rightist website. There&#39;s really no good alternatives out there. I have a few ideas for some, but I lack the programming ability to make something as complex as reddit without hundreds of hours of study. I wish someone would come along and try, but I might have to try myself. news.ycombinator is alright, it reminds me of reddit 9 years ago, back when it was mostly tech. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I find anything that goes below 60% upvoted is either <em>extremely</em> poor quality, obviously false, or is being targeted. This right now is at 56%. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s particularly low quality compared to anything else I&#39;ve written. Other subs liked it. Maybe people are really tired of talking and hearing about Trump, or US politics? Maybe there really <em>are</em> that many Trump supporters? Or maybe there is some targeted downvoting going on. Or maybe a combo of all those.  </p>

<p>I find with posts where this happens, once you get past about 10 net positive upvotes, which puts you near the sub front page, then they stop downvoting and the percentage goes back to the more normal 80-90% range. They know if something doesn&#39;t get out of the &#39;new&#39; tab, it won&#39;t be seen by very many people. </p>
