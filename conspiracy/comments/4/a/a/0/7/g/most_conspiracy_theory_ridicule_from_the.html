    <div class="md"><p>Here are Altemeyer&#39;s authoritarian personality characteristics:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1) a high degree of submission to the established, legitimate authorities in their society
2) high levels of aggression in the name of their authorities
3) a high level of conventionalism.*</p>

<p>*Conventionalism. By conventionalism, the third defining element of the rightwing authoritarian, I don’t just mean do you put your socks on before your shoes, and I don’t just mean following the norms and customs that you like. I mean believing that everybody should have to follow the norms and customs that your authorities have decreed. (page 20).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Submission is the right word when it come to acceptance of things like the Warren Report&#39;s magic bullet theory. Yet the media on behalf of the political establishment has ridiculed members of the public who dared to believe the magic bullet theory was total bullshit.</p>

<p>The label &quot;authoritarian&quot; is usually used by the left (and libertarian ideologues) to refer to what most people call traditional conservatives - people who are, in fact, quite supportive of democracy and in fact, often quite libertarian.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not linguistically incorrect, it&#39;s the definition of the word as used by the people who popularized the term, the authors of The Authoritarian Personality, and virtually all of the academic studies that have been done in the last 50 plus years of people with supposedly &quot;authoritarian&quot; personalities.</p>

<p>That is patently false, whites are one of the least authoritarian races, by anyone&#39;s definition.</p>

<p>Congratulations, you&#39;re the first.</p>

<p>Your assertion seems to imply that <em>&quot;authoritarianism&quot;</em> began with the &quot;East Indian Trading Company&quot;, and frankly, I find that hard to swallow, as the concept, as popularly believed, revolves around the idea of  <em>&quot;a form of government characterized by strong central power and limited political freedoms&quot;</em>, which is pretty much the definition of MOST forms of government throughout human history - stretching from the Middle Ages back into ancient Chinese and Mediterranean societies, and even into the Americas.</p>

<p>If that be the case, WHAT has it to do with &quot;Authoritarianism&quot;?</p>

<p>I have no idea. Perhaps you should ask some <strong><em>&quot;white supremicists&quot;</em></strong>?</p>

<p>Your line of &quot;reasoning&quot; is convoluted, to say the least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Corruption and the complete nonsense that gets posted here about fucking mystical shit, chem trails, and aliens controlling govts are completely different things.  So no, i would say most ridicule comes from the actual ridiculousness of the &quot;conspiracies&quot; people come up with.</p>

<p>Now when people say &quot;oh no they could never be corrupt&quot; then yes that probably has something to do with what you posted.</p>

<p>And lastly, theres no need to post one sentence personal revelations.  Its silly, we have all thought these things before.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a Sicilian American who get&#39;s racially profiled by whites(anglo-saxon and wasp) on a normal basis. You can try to claim the Greeks so that you can then claim their achievements (in true white parasite fashion) but put some Greeks in a white majority town and you will find out who is white and who isn&#39;t <em>real quick</em> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;m not at all oppressed by anyone because I don&#39;t believe in being a victim. Anyone with darker skin knows what it&#39;s like to be profiled by wasps, but it&#39;s not just wasps it&#39;s even the liberal atheist white progressives too.</p>

<p>This is just more of that &quot;racial realism&quot; that you whites are fans of..when it suits you </p>
