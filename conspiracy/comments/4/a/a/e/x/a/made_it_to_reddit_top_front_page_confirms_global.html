<p>&quot;It&#39;s also a conclusion that has been masked until recent decades in many areas by the wide use of industrial aerosols, which have a cooling effect on temperatures - another key finding of the paper.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>However you want to classify that, it is clearly not the way the article is defining industrial aerosol. Words mean different things to different people, and the meaning of words change with time and use. Just because to you chemtrails are a type of industrial aerosol, does not mean the author of the article believes that. It&#39;s simply not what&#39;s being talked about. What is being talked about is interesting, but you&#39;re making fewer people care by adding in a false agenda.</p>

<p>If you want to talk about chemtrails, find an article that talks about chemtrails.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You believe that when the author of the article mentions &quot;industrial aerosols&quot; we should understand that this includes &quot;chemtrails.&quot; This is despite the fact that the author never mentions chemtrails in the article. It also ignores the chemtrails are a controversial topic and the discussion of their existence is beyond the scope of an article that size.</p>

<p>You also believe that this article making it to the front page of reddit is somehow significant. I am not sure if you think that means it is true or that reddit agrees with the article. I think you also believe that the redditors upvoting this article actually read all of and came to the same chemtrail conclusion that you did.</p>

<p>I am not sure what you are trying to argue. All I know is that you premise is on very shaky ground, and is both confused and confusing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All the more reason to read into the article. The actual study is behind a pay wall, conveniently. Use of the phrase &quot;Industrial aerosols&quot; is a way to circumvent the chemtrails conversation because industrial aerosols are not controversial. But &#39;jet exhaust&#39; or chemtrails are certainly an industrial aerosol. Even though the article does not explicitly say so.</p>

<p>It shows what people on reddit care about. Or what some algorithm thinks we care about. In any case, attention is attempting to be drawn to this relatively short article for some reason.</p>

<p>My main point is this is a limited hang out, more blatant than usual for things this controversial.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People should come to this conclusion because it&#39;s not a major leap to include jet exhaust as an aerosol. Though it&#39;s not explicitly stated.</p>

<p>People who have read about geoengineering know that part of chemtrails is precisely designed to combat global warming by making areas cooler.</p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly what the article says is happening, and it&#39;s a mainstream source. It corroborates information on &#39;fringe&#39; sites like geoengineeringwatch.org</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I&#39;m reaching. It&#39;s worth it to be wrong to me, if there&#39;s a chance that I&#39;m right.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not like the government is just going to openly admit outright and upfront to chemtrails until they have prepared people subconsciously, otherwise there&#39;s a mass panic situation. Little subtle pressure releases like this article are part of the subconscious preparation.</p>

<p>Look it up LA government asked to have their weather modified. It was in the LA times I think. I think they called it cloud seeding in the article. It&#39;s been on reddit mainstream subs and here. </p>

<p>I&#39;m glad you disagree with me that&#39;s healthy. It also shows the governments work isn&#39;t done.</p>

<p>This absolutely matters though. This is ultimately about the future of our planet!</p>

<p>You said &quot;Except all data ever collected in any scientific field says that there is no global warming.&quot;</p>

<p>It adds to the hilarity when you quote my entire post, except the part that says &quot;Not my fault you didn&#39;t specify.&quot;</p>

<p>Anthropogenic Global Warming(AGW) may or may not be true. It&#39;s a fact the earth is getting hotter. All the oil companies in the world don&#39;t have the money to try and skew that fact. That&#39;s why they tried shifting the blame to other sources of greenhouse gases. Which is a reasonable argument, but tragically it&#39;s not the case.</p>
