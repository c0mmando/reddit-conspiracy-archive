<p>Jewish is the race name.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jewish is to Judaism what Christian is to Christianity or Muslim is to Islam.</p>

<p>The Romans neither exterminated nor expelled the Jews after their little insurrection. They killed every <em>rebel</em> they could get their imperial hands on and those with rebel sympathies got the fuck out of Dodge. The rest of the population, the <em>Jewish</em> population, that just wanted to live peaceful lives in the land of their forefathers, stayed behind. They paid their taxes and they refrained from open rebellion and over the next thousand years most of them converted to Christianity and Islam. Now we call them Palestinians.</p>

<p>Same race, different religion.</p>

<p>The fiscus judaicus - A tax levied on Jews in A.D. 70 which raised funds to support the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus. </p>

<p>The near-complete destruction of Jerusalem in which reportedly over a million individuals were massacred.</p>

<p>The beginning of the Edom Exile which saw a massive fall in the Judean population.</p>

<p>Laying the foundation for the Kitos War and Bar Kokhba revolt, both of which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Jews, enslavement of many hundreds of thousands more, and further persecution of anyone who openly practised Judaism (inc. Christianity at this point). </p>

<p>I think you fundamentally misunderstand the Roman mindset. Things were not done in half measures.</p>

I use it to label any asshole &quot;person of the book&quot; who tries to manufacture the &quot;end times&quot; scenario in the holy land. Jew, Christian, Muslim, if you think you are so &quot;righteous&quot; that you deliberately try to encite the so-called &quot;end of days&quot; because you know you&#39;ll go to &quot;heaven&quot; instead of living your goddamned life, you are a problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s break this down into a few quick digestible lumps.</p>

<h1>1</h1>

<p>Humans have free will and they are not determined to <em>be</em> anything just because of their genetic heritage.  Saying shit like &quot;the Jews run Hollywood&quot; or &quot;the Jews run the banks&quot; all the time doesn&#39;t add anything to the conversation on this sub, and it&#39;s only partially true.  Mostly, Jewish people were born into a religion and have a cultural heritage just like anybody else in this sub.  Blaming an ethnicity for an amorphous societal problem is just fucking stupid, and I&#39;m fucking tired of seeing it all the time on this subreddit.  You guys should know better than to generalize like that.</p>

<h1>2</h1>

<p>If we&#39;ve learned anything by hanging out here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, we should know that the actions of a nation-state should never be attributed to the populace who were accidentally born under that government&#39;s rule.  The Palestinians got fucked.  It&#39;s not fair at all.  The Israeli government is the one responsible for the massacres, and the land grabs, not the &quot;Jews.&quot;</p>

<h1>3</h1>

<p>Zionism on the other hand is a dangerous idealism.  It&#39;s not shared by many people who were born Jewish.  Zionism is all about expansion and imperialism and exceptionalism.</p>

<p>I think the subreddit needs to do a better job of discerning between these two concepts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand youre being speculative about them discussing who to exterminate, but why would they do that? Is it some kind of angst they have from the Hitler era to get back at the world? Is it too claim power so they can run their laws?

    <div class="md"><p>As mentioned by others, Zionist and Jewish are far from the same thing.  There are tons of non-zionist and even anti-zionist Jews.  Zionist powers use the tag as a sort of multipurpose trump card to silence those who would speak against them.  This tactic works exceptionally in many circumstances, as those who care little about religion are often seeking approval from those who care about race, and vice versa.  </p>
