       Breaking(no really) just learned that Hillary and her money man Soros funded the Chicago rioters to yell "Bernie" while assualting attendees at Trump rally to divide Sanders and Trump supporters so sanders supporters would stop voting for Trump! Sanders supporters are Trump crossover voters helping Trump win. This is a Hillary trick to divide them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't criticize sanders supporters.  They hate hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a Hillary George Soros trick to make Trump supporters hate Sanders supporters o Sanders supporters stop voting for Trump!
      </p>
      <p>
       The funded was admitted by move on already.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know Obama chief of staff and Chicago mayor Raum Emmanuel told Chicago police not to arrest the  Hillary Soros rioters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we know why they yelled "bernie" which was confusing becuase Bernie voters arenot militant like Hillary supporters are. It frankly didn't make sense. Black lives matter people don't like Bernie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now it all makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't bash Sanders people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its a Hillary trick.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remind Sanders people that only Trump can stop the corporate establishment abuses that they care about now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sanders people should vote for Trump in ohio, Missouri and Illinois tomorrow.(they cant crossover in Florida.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Sanders people  ..Trump will do more to stop corporate abuse and job loss than anyone else now.   Hillary is Paid for.  Sanders can't win.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump supporters welcome your support. Keep jobs in America. Its good for everyone.
      </p>

       This is the theory I think is true as well. Do you have an actual link or something that shows they were trained to shout "Bernie"? I've been wondering if this is the case since day 1. It looks bad for both Trump and Sanders, which is a win for Hillary. She comes out looking clean and sane because she wasn't directly involved.

       Do t have a soruce that got them to say it yet but that's the logical story if you are trying to entice Bernie suporters to disrupt the rally.

       ok, i definitely believe the money connection, but can we stop pretending this is the kind of thing that would divide Trump and Sanders supporters? the only thing keeping Sanders supporters from voting for Trump is Trump himself ffs. that sack of shit belongs just as far from the white house as Hillary, if not further. i will be voting green party again if Hillary gets the nomination, because a vote for Trump would definitely be just as bad or worse than a vote for Hillary. please stop promoting Trump and acting like he isn't controlled by special interests, he is a proven liar and charlatan, a lot like many of the people that support him.

       Well, this is misleading and probably completely false. Sanders supporters wouldn't vote for Trump because of the fundamental differences in their ideas and agendas. All the informed voters would find themselves at only one side of the spectrum (Trump or Bernie). You should read the government plans of the candidates before making those kind of affirmations. Now, about Hillary hiring rioters, I don't have enough information to make a point but I highly doubt it is as useful for her campaign. Just my opinion, have a nice day.

       He just takes the attention away from Bernie. Makes people think that the only way to beat him is with Hillary because she seems like a sure bet. To me that's Trump's purpose, not to take away Bernie supporters, but to keep anyone that would of been one, distracted long enough so they don't vote for Bernie.

       Sanders supporters are supporting trump in primary after primary becuase they too areanti establishment and know Sanders can't really win in Tue democrat super delegate system. They know trump can stnad up to the foreign factory losses and bring good paying jobs back.  That is the biggest issue of this campaign. They don't agree on everything. They don't have to.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not sayig  some Sanders supporters didn't go.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am saying it was organized to entice them to go by MoveOn and Hillary and apparently now David Brock  with the intent of driving a wedge between trump and Sanders supporters so snaders supporters won't keep voting for trump.

       that is the craziest bullshit ever. Sanders supporters want nothing to do with Trump, because he is part of the fucking establishment. what do you idiots not get about this? he is a rich, lying piece of shit who is trying harder to scam you than even Hillary. we aren't voting Trump, stop lying.
