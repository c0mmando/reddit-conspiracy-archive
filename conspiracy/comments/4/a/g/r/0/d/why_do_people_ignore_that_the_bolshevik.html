    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read multiple opinions about it. Considering the sources I&#39;ve read, Stalin did seem to have two minds about it, as he did about many things.</p>

<p>He denounced it yes, but practiced it when it suited him.</p>

<p>None the less, he was clearly much more interested in removing/purging jews that any Russian leader in a long time. At some points his purges even caused tension with the USA&#39;s communist party, which was not for purging jews at all. </p>

<p>Ultimately I feel like the key point about the purges is what you said - he removed anyone who threatened his powers, and not so incidentally many of these were jews.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you so much :) I must admit that after doing a little more research today, I&#39;m quite discouraged by the amount of backlash people receive for pointing out mere facts. I was reading about David Duke&#39;s arrest for example. Speaking the truth is still punishable, especially when it comes to matters like these. You cannot get jailed for denying slavery or denying the native American genocide, but you will suffer extreme consequences for pointing out an overlooked part in world War history. Unbelievable. 
Edit: David Duke is a massive weirdo and I do not support him. However, he has some arguments which still stand. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well to state the obvious, I try to go by the evidence. The Nazis certainly did get to tell their side of the story (you can read it yourself, personally read several sections of Mein Kampf, watched the first few hours of TGSNT, and read into a lot of their racial theory claims as I&#39;m a biologist and the quaint ideas of ignorant people from the past amuse me), it&#39;s just recognized as being heavily imbued with propaganda and unsupported claims (particularly regarding racial theory).

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>People forget that Goebbels was a major pioneer of the PR/propaganda industry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pioneer? Actually, the techniques Goebbels employed he learned from the best of the best in the realm of the science of propaganda: <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays">Edward Bernays - the (Jewish) double-nephew of Sigmund Freud</a></strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Physorg:</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://phys.org/news/2015-07-american-mindedward-bernays-birth.html#jCp">The manipulation of the American mind—Edward Bernays and the birth of public relations</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Bernays&#39; ideas sold a lot more than cigarettes and Dixie cups</strong></p>

<p>Even though Bernays saw the power of propaganda during war and used it to sell products during peacetime, he couldn&#39;t have imagined that his writings on public relations would become a tool of the Third Reich.</p>

<p>In the 1920s, Joseph Goebbels became an avid admirer of Bernays and his writings – despite the fact that Bernays was a Jew. When Goebbels became the minister of propaganda for the Third Reich, he sought to exploit Bernays&#39; ideas to the fullest extent possible. For example, he created a &quot;Fuhrer cult&quot; around Adolph Hitler.</p>

<p>Bernays learned that the Nazis were using his work in 1933, from a foreign correspondent for Hearst newspapers. He later recounted in his 1965 autobiography:</p>

<p><em>&quot;They were using my books as the basis for a destructive campaign against the Jews of Germany. This shocked me, but I knew any human activity can be used for social purposes or misused for antisocial ones.&quot;</em></p>

<p>What Bernays&#39; writings furnish is not a principle or tradition by which to evaluate the appropriateness of propaganda, but simply a means for shaping public opinion for any purpose whatsoever, whether beneficial to human beings or not.</p>

<p><strong>This observation led Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter to warn President Franklin Roosevelt against allowing Bernays to play a leadership role in World War II, describing him and his colleagues as &quot;professional poisoners of the public mind, exploiters of foolishness, fanaticism, and self-interest.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And like Bernays, Frankfurter was Jewish.</p>

<p>The science of &quot;mind poisoning&quot; has evolved immensely since those days - as has the technology that can be used for such purposes.</p>

<p>Reddit is a fine example of a Mind Manipulation Machine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Check out a book called <em>Gruesome Harvest</em>.  It&#39;s the best source I know of for this info and was written shortly after WWII ended so it includes eyewitness testimony and contemporary sources/reports.  It shows definitively that this was a deliberate campaign on the part of the allies to destroy post-war Germany and crush its will completely, as opposed to simply the result of &quot;problems with logistics&quot; like most modern history textbooks would have us believe.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also another really good one called <em>Other Losses</em> and multiple books in German have been written on this subject too, though finding English translations is difficult.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m talking about occurred after the fall of Hitler and after WWII ended.  Millions of Germans died between 1945 and 1950, most of them woman, children, and other civilians, and it was the work of more than just Russia and Stalin - Churchill and Roosevelt were also very much involved.</p>

<p>Millions died to outright ethnic cleansing by Russians, Poles, Czechs, and Serbians, millions more starved to death, a couple million more died in allied captivity performing slave labor, thousands of woman and children were raped.  The list of allied atrocities committed in the years after the war goes on and on.</p>

<p>the lack of information about the atrocities committed again the German people, after and during the war, is equally disgusting. I believe it&#39;s a testament to the great will and resolve of the German people, the way they picked themselves up after the war and where they stand today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed man.  And the amazing thing is that Germany did the same thing after it was basically destroyed the first time after WWI.  You can argue about Hitler and the Nazis&#39; methods and history all you want but the fact remains that the country and its average citizens were <em>decimated</em> after WWI and rebuilt their country to be one of the most powerful on earth in the span of a few decades.</p>

<p>Also I don&#39;t like the term &quot;Holocaust denial&quot;.  It&#39;s emotionally charged and vague, it means too many different things to too many different people and I think it&#39;s used dishonestly by certain people to shut down debate.  All most of us want to do is study history and find the truth, we shouldn&#39;t need to attach derogatory labels to that.</p>

<p>In my experience there really isn&#39;t, at least not for the people who throw those terms around and label others with them.  A lot of times it seems that anyone who questions any part of the &quot;mainstream&quot; story of the Holocaust is called a denier and jew hater but asking questions and examining evidence isn&#39;t hateful in itself.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Fair enough, but I said Hitler <em>and</em> the Nazis in my other comment.  There are a lot of negative things you can say about them of course but they were the ruling government of the country and they do share in the credit for helping turn the country around, just as we say that FDR and his administration helped turn the US around after the Great Depression.  It&#39;s usually the leaders guiding policy and thus when the country does well, they get some or most of the credit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm.. well my opinion is that arguing there were no gas chambers isn&#39;t the same thing as arguing there was no holocaust.  I think we need to define these terms more clearly.  I don&#39;t know this user&#39;s opinions specifically but my guess is that grandmacaesar agrees that many were mistreated by the Germans, that the internment camps were horrible, that Jews and many other people died awful deaths, and that the holocaust did happen - the argument being made is simply that some of the details were different from what we&#39;ve been told.  Whether you agree with that or not, just shouting &quot;denier&quot; is dismissive and doesn&#39;t do anything to address the arguments.  It just leads to further back and forth arguments which don&#39;t get any of us anywhere.  We should be able to discuss the facts without bringing emotions into it or labeling people.</p>

<p>Archaeology at Treblinka, a complete bust, where are the 900,000 there? These were allegedly first buried as whole bodies and dug back up and burned on wood pyres.

    <div class="md"><p>No people of all groups died there and not just Jews. In 1942 there was a bad typhus outbreak at Auschwitz because of bad management. There was death from abuse. Jewish workers were put into harms way as shields for air raids.  Air raid casualties were enormous for everybody on the ground. In 1945 there were disease outbreaks in many camps because of lack of supplies and overcrowding. The Red Cross put camp deaths at 250,000-300,000, but they didn&#39;t have good access late in the war when ALL people in Europe were in great stress, so it is likely more.</p>

<p>Go to Theresenstadt in Bohemia and you will see a cemetery with thousands of Stars of David.  All dated 1945 many after liberation. You actually need to ask the guides how these folks died, because they won&#39;t volunteer the reason. But they will tell you if pressed, outbreaks of typhus and fevers.  </p>

<p>Discipline was strict so there were executions. There were ghetto liquidations in the East. There were pograms and paybacks (for Red Terror) conducted by locals in the Baltic States and Ukraine. There was partisan war in Russia where Jews fought as guerrillas. The Germans were ruthless with anybody involved in this. The Jewish deaths in Russia ran into the hundreds of thousands. This needs to be properly researched, but the Holocaust promoters would rather stick with the gas chamber myth (religion) than exhume smaller mass shooting sites and do real research. </p>

<p>Even so-called &quot;denier&quot; David Irving, who is an excellent historian, puts the Jewish deaths at a couple million. The promoted history is full of lies replete with code phrases like denial, but there is real history to still be developed. Remember the Iron Curtain come down in 1990 delaying much of this. ALL history is normally revised, except apparently this one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First there were very few witnesses (yes, liars) to alleged actual gassings. There is also much hearsay (they really don&#39;t know, but get caught up in the popular rhetoric). If you listen to their actual interviews (and I have), they fall apart under rational common sense and reason. Many of these gassing story telling commentators are just asinine and embarrassing for the gas chamber promoters. It is one of the reasons you have deniers (as opposed to revisionists). So whether lairs or hysteria I put low value on such &quot;witnesses&quot;. As far as hysteria, if I were a Jew uprooted and tossed into a camp, I would have little problem with making up some very slanted stories for pay back, totally understandable. </p>

<p>The German witnesses were tortured or threatened. In a court of law that is considered tainted evidence. There were Jewish death squads that went around Germany and Europe killing staff and SS involved with internment and round ups, getting rid of evidence and witnesses.  <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/1546515/posts">http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/1546515/posts</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one, not even Holocaust gassing promoters are saying the camps in Germany had gas chambers. Every gassing facility is placed in Poland. American soldiers never liberated those Polish camps. If you haven&#39;t figured that one out I can&#39;t really help you. That is pretty elementary and not part of the debate anymore.</p>

<p>The iconic emaciated corpses photos and film taken at German camps are typhus victims. </p>

<p>BTW these corpses are German civilians fire bombed at Dresden, 1945:

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, in fact there are American soldiers that saw gas chambers. Are you saying that the American soldiers that saw the (unused, but planned to be used) gas chambers at Dachau are liars? There were also American POWs at Auschwitz, are they liars as well?</p>

<p>Edit: What does Dresden have to do with any of this? Could you please cite when I denied atrocities committed against the German people?</p>

<p>Show me one citation where an American POW witnessed a gassing at Auschwitz.</p>

<p>My point on the bombing victims is those people could just as easily have been Jews as Germans given the indiscriminate bombing raids. Jews were used as labor in German factories.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m smart enough not to believe neo-nazi propaganda. The soviets put up that plaque, to demonize the Germans, they had no basis to put it up in the first place. When further research was done, it was changed to a more proper number of 1.5 million. Aushwitz wasn&#39;t the only death camp, just the most famous. Also a large percentage of the 5.7 million murdered Jews, were killed outside of concentration camps. The six million newspaper is neo-nazi copy-pasta. David Cole is a fool, even <em>other revisionists</em> say so, let alone sane people. I never said Hitler ordered it, he very well may have left it up to Himmler and company, and focused his attention on the war effort. You have a computer and an internet connection. You have no excuse. Take a few moments to realize how wrong you really are. I believe what I&#39;ve seen and read, I&#39;m not biased by bigotry.

    <div class="md"><p>I feel people should do their own research.  I didn&#39;t just ignorantly take someone else&#39;s word (as I had done for years)...I examined the information myself.</p>

<p>But if you want to know <em>the basics</em> of why I question:</p>

<p>I am not a Nazi, nor a &quot;white supremacist&quot;.  This has nothing to do with hating anyone.  It has to do with an impartial review of the facts.</p>

<p>I used to believe what I was taught by the textbooks and the media until a few years ago when I decided to take a closer look.  </p>

<p>The facts are these:  We have been shown <em>no proof</em> of the three main claims of the holocaust...(a) six million jews were killed, (b) many in gas chambers, (c) due to an order from Hitler.</p>

<p>(a) No one went down the line counting, &quot;5,999,997...5,999,998...5,999,999...6,000,000!&quot;  Six million is propaganda that was used multiple times in newspapers many years before WW2.  See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dda-0Q_XUhk">this</a> and <a href="http://holocausthandbooks.com/dl/06-tfh.pdf">this</a>.  You can claim that it&#39;s (duh!) copypasta---as if copying and pasting information somehow detracts from its truthfulness---but it&#39;s there, literally in black and white, as reported in multiple newspapers before WW2.</p>

<p>(b) To date, there has never been an autopsy report of a holocaust victim who died from zyklon-b poisoning.  <a href="http://whatreallyhappened.info/pinknotblue.html">The &quot;eye-witnesses&quot; to the &quot;victims&quot; claim they saw black-and-blue bodies, when in reality (the real world, the world in which we live) zyklon-b poisoning causes a body to become pink or red.</a>  There were supposedly millions of people killed this way, yet there was not a single autopsy---not even one!---to show proof.</p>

<p>Besides, on the surface, the gas chamber story is ridiculous. The expedient Germans wouldn&#39;t have pulled fighting men off the front lines to bring millions of jews into camps by train, then spent millions of wartime funding on Zyklon-B to kill them (with no receipt, by the way), then millions more in wartime funding on coke for cremation (again, no receipt), then totally disposed of all the evidence, when they were needing all able-bodied men and all their money to fight a war on multiple fronts. And they wouldn&#39;t have purposefully killed off a work-force of confined laborers when workers were desperately needed for the war effort.  If killing all jews was the top concern, they would&#39;ve simply put a single bullet in the back of the skull back in the Warsaw ghettos and elsewhere.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=typhus+auschwitz+proof&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8#safe=off&amp;amp;q=typhus+concentration+camps">The majority of jewish deaths in the labor camps was caused by typhus.</a>  </p>

<p>(c) There is no proof that Hitler ever ordered the genocide of jews.  <a href="http://www.writing.upenn.edu/%7Eafilreis/Holocaust/wansee-transcript.html">The claim is made of a &quot;final solution&quot; at the Wannsee Conference on January 20, 1942, but no mention of killing jews can be found, and Hitler was not in attendance.</a></p>

<p>This is just the basics.  There&#39;s a lot more information to be found, just google holocaust revision.  I refuse to write a dissertation in an attempt to convince people who are too close-minded to do their research.</p>

<p>Just because you can&#39;t handle the truth doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s hateful or a lie.</p>

<p>That&#39;s honestly a little hard to believe considering that you posted this, just in this same thread;</p>

<ul>
<li>It&#39;s easy. Because holocaust six million God&#39;s Chosen People™, you jew-hating anti-semite. -<a href="/u/grandmacaesar">/u/grandmacaesar</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;m sure if I could actually be bothered to look, I&#39;d find no shortage of comments that are more than a little racist/anti-semitic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The facts are these: We have been shown no proof of the three main claims of the holocaust...(a) six million jews were killed, (b) many in gas chambers, (c) due to an order from Hitler.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To a), yes we have been shown that, same with b) (although it&#39;s true that many were in fact killed by other means). c) is really the only one that has anything remotely resembling a leg to stand on, and at best you can say &quot;Hitler wasn&#39;t <em>directly</em> ordering this, he just accepted and enabled it&quot;.</p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s see just how many clearly disproven neo-nazi claims you&#39;ll bring up. Will you bring up Leutchter? What about the newspapers?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(a) No one went down the line counting, &quot;5,999,997...5,999,998...5,999,999...6,000,000!&quot; Six million is propaganda that was used multiple times in newspapers many years before WW2. See this and this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well shit, that was fast. Let&#39;s break this down a bit. So for starters, the actual number of people killed in the Holocaust is somewhere around 11 million, if you include Soviet POW&#39;s, Ethic Poles, Slovenes, Serbs, the mentally and physically handicapped, Romani, Freemasons, Jehovas Witnesses, and Homosexuals. As for the Jewish number specifically, you&#39;re right, it&#39;s not exactly 6 million, it&#39;s closer to 5,933,900, but it&#39;s this magical thing called rounding. As for the newspapers themselves, you seem to have overlooked this thing called context (also that is possibly the worst formatting job I&#39;ve ever seen on a PDF).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(b) To date, there has never been an autopsy report of a holocaust victim who died from zyklon-b poisoning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you suppose that might be because most of the bodies were cremated or buried in mass graves, not to mention we have literally no reason to assume that wasn&#39;t the case considering that we know objectively that it was used for this very purpose? (Although why do I just know you&#39;re going to bring up delousing).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Besides, on the surface, the gas chamber story is ridiculous. The expedient Germans wouldn&#39;t have pulled fighting men off the front lines to bring millions of jews into camps by train</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They would if they actively wanted to exterminate them, which Surprise! They did.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(with no receipt, by the way)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the Nazis tried to destroy as much incriminating evidence as they could at the end of the war.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>when they were needing all able-bodied men and all their money to fight a war on multiple fronts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even during the height of WW2, not every single man was fighting. The fact that they had a relatively small amount compared to the regular Wehrmacht dedicated to this isn&#39;t really all that unsurprising.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And they wouldn&#39;t have purposefully killed off a work-force of confined laborers when workers were desperately needed for the war effort.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You do realize that labour camps existed, right? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If killing all jews was the top concern, they would&#39;ve simply put a single bullet in the back of the skull back in the Warsaw ghettos and elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which they did on many an occasion. Or did you forget the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einsatzgruppen">Einsatzgruppen</a> existed? In fact, your argument for the entirety of point b) seems to be &quot;genocide takes effort, why would the Nazis have put effort into this&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The majority of jewish deaths in the labor camps was caused by typhus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did you just link to a fucking google search? That&#39;s pretty half-assed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(c) There is no proof that Hitler ever ordered the genocide of jews. The claim is made of a &quot;final solution&quot; at the Wannsee Conference on January 20, 1942, but no mention of killing jews can be found, and Hitler was not in attendance.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Once I really am in power, my first and foremost task will be the annihilation of the Jews. As soon as I have the power to do so, I will have gallows built in rows - at the Marienplatz in Munich, for example - as many as traffic allows. Then the Jews will be hanged indiscriminately, and they will remain hanging until they stink; they will hang there as long as the principles of hygiene permit. As soon as they have been untied, the next batch will be strung up, and so on down the line, until the last Jew in Munich has been exterminated. Other cities will follow suit, precisely in this fashion, until all Germany has been completely cleansed of Jews.&quot; -Adolf Hitler.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>This is just the basics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And if even the basics are outright wrong, what hope does that leave for the rest?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s a lot more information to be found, just google holocaust revision.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s really not very helpful. It seems like you just want a way to deny the Holocaust up until someone disagrees, in which case you try and end the debate with &quot;it&#39;s not my job to educate you&quot;. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I refuse to write a dissertation in an attempt to convince people who are too close-minded to do their research.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was about to say...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just because you can&#39;t handle the truth doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s hateful or a lie.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can handle the truth. My issue is that nothing you&#39;re saying is the truth, and is a lie. As such, yes it is a lie, and yes it is very much hateful.</p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth: At a library in a town that is 55% black, one of my jobs was to give lessons to blacks and the elderly on how to use the computer/internet.  Another was to help black people fill out job applications.  I worked there for five years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was actually mostly propaganda from the White Russian forces during the civil war. Bear in mind that at the time Russian society had an extremely anti-Semitic sentiment within their population, as did many European nations. Communism was seen as a major threat to Europe&#39;s hierarchical societies, one that TPTB were willing to oppose at any cost. All shit sticks unfortunately and to this day the myth has been perpetrated by anti-Semites and anti-Communists ad nauseam. </p>

<p>Now that aside, why is it a bullshit claim? Well... Like many political parties, the Bolsheviks kept records of their members. So, how many Jews were members of the Bolshevik party in February 1917? 364. Out of a total membership tally of 23,000. At their greatest point (early 1918), Jews comprised just 4.5% of the Bolshevik party. This had fallen to 2.5% by 1922 and kept falling down from there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jewish historian Leonard Schapiro wrote, &quot;Anyone who had the misfortune to fall into the hands of the Cheka stood a very good chance of finding himself confronted with, and possibly shot by, a Jewish investigator.&quot; In Ukraine, &quot;Jews made up nearly 80 percent of the rank-and-file Cheka agents,&quot; reports W. Bruce Lincoln, an American professor of Russian history.</p>

<p>Israeli historian Louis Rapoport writes: &quot;Immediately after the [Bolshevik] Revolution, many Jews were euphoric over their high representation in the new government. Lenin&#39;s first Politburo was dominated by men of Jewish origins. Under Lenin, Jews became involved in all aspects of the Revolution, including its dirtiest work.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The 62 members of the [Central] Committee were composed of five Russians, one Ukrainian, six Letts [Latvians], two Germans, one Czech, two Armenians, three Georgians, one Karaim [Karaite] (a Jewish sect), and 41 Jews. -  R. Wilton, The Last Days of the Romanovs</p>

<p>The Atlantic, Sept. 1991, p. 14.; In 1919, three-quarters of the Cheka staff in Kiev were Jews, who were careful to spare fellow Jews. By order, the Cheka took few Jewish hostages. Richard Pipes, The Russian Revolution (1990), p. 824.</p>

<p>Routine comments from intimate observers (beside Churchill noted above) at the time: </p>

<p>David R. Francis, United States ambassador in Russia, warned in a January 1918 dispatch to Washington: &quot;The Bolshevik leaders here, most of whom are Jews and 90 percent of whom are returned exiles, care little for Russia or any other country but are internationalists and they are trying to start a worldwide social revolution.&quot;</p>

<p>The Netherlands&#39; ambassador in Russia, Oudendyke, made much the same point a few months later: &quot;Unless Bolshevism is nipped in the bud immediately, it is bound to spread in one form or another over Europe and the whole world as it is organized and worked by Jews who have no nationality, and whose one object is to destroy for their own ends the existing order of things.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Bolshevik Revolution,&quot; declared a leading American Jewish community paper in 1920, &quot;was largely the product of Jewish thinking, Jewish discontent, Jewish effort to reconstruct.&quot;</p>

<p>Jewish historian...</p>

<p>Weber is a noted holocaust-denier so should probably be taken with a grain of salt. What he has missed in his analysis (assuming you have lifted this text from <a href="http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v14/v14n1p-4_Weber.html">here</a>) is the motivation. Consider that of this relatively tiny proportion of Jews within the Bolshevik party were themselves born within a society that regularly organized massacres of their people. The Russian Jewish community was isolated and distinct from the rest of society, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s surprising that a militant revolutionary party would find a higher proportion of individuals willing to commit acts of violence in order to bring about radical social change within such an ostracised group. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wilton</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, a known anti-Semite who fought alongside the White Russians. His words should be weighed up against this considerable bias. This is a man who also believed that Jews would kidnap children for use in religious ceremonies. At any rate his claims are blatant nonsense, he claims for instance that there were over 300 People&#39;s Commisars of which the majority were Jewish when in fact there were only 17, of which only one (Trotsky) was Jewish and an apostate at that. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Bolshevik leaders...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Back to Weber I see... At any rate this is still nonsense. Five of the seven members of the first politburo were ethnically Jewish however this number includes Lenin, Trotsky, and Kamenev all of whom were apostates or the children of apostates. It&#39;s completely pointless to associate them with some kind of Jewish conspiracy at this point as they were no longer true members of any Jewish community. </p>

<p>So tl;dr - You have found a bunch of anecdotal quotes from extremely biased individuals trying to associate a socio-political movement with some imagined conspiracy born out of religious discrimination. Maybe try extending your sources outside of anti-Semites and Holocaust deniers? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weber? Where did I cite him. Are you saying Jewish historians Schapiro and Rapoport are fraudulent citations? Then you accuse someone (the straw man) I didn&#39;t even cite as &quot;anti-semite&quot;? What is this, cut and paste rebuttal from some guide book?</p>

<p>At any rate per your suggestion let&#39;s go with strictly Jewish sources since everybody else is &quot;anti-semite&quot; to your eyes: Israeli source- Ynet, Sever Plocker on the Jew Yagoda. He covers Lazar Kaganovich as well. Himmler was a piker compared to these monsters. </p>

<p>&quot;An Israeli student finishes high school without ever hearing the name &quot;Genrikh Yagoda,&quot; the greatest Jewish murderer of the 20th Century, the GPU&#39;s deputy commander and the founder and commander of the NKVD. Yagoda diligently implemented Stalin&#39;s collectivization orders and is responsible for the deaths of at least 10 million people. His Jewish deputies established and managed the Gulag system.</p>

<p>He goes on: very forthright for a Jewish writer. </p>

<p>&quot;In 1934, according to published statistics, 38.5 percent of those holding the most senior posts in the Soviet security apparatuses were of Jewish origin.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Jews active in official communist terror apparatuses (In the Soviet Union and abroad) and who at times led them, did not do this, obviously, as Jews, but rather, as Stalinists, communists, and &quot;Soviet people.&quot; Therefore, we find it easy to ignore their origin and &quot;play dumb&quot;: What do we have to do with them? But let&#39;s not forget them. My own view is different. I find it unacceptable that a person will be considered a member of the Jewish people when he does great things, but not considered part of our people when he does amazingly despicable things.</p>

<p>Over half of your post appears to be lifted directly from <a href="http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v14/v14n1p-4_Weber.html">this</a> text as I stated above. I simply assumed that you were quoting this work directly. I like that you completely ignored my rebuttal and instead focus on the points I raised in regards to the validity of his statements.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>let&#39;s go with strictly Jewish sources</p>

<p>That&#39;s not what I suggested at all. This isn&#39;t a black and white issue I simply suggested that you might get a more balanced view of events if you brought in sources outside of a very niche community. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yagoda</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So as I alluded to in my last post, part of the problem here is the lens you are viewing this through. Sargon of Akkad posted this rather nice <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zezhdw_dNlU">video</a> yesterday on this topic (<em>&#39;The Ideological Lens&#39;</em>) which is well worth watching imo. At any rate, you are focusing on the ethnicity of a single individual within an organization that had been operating under the exact same level of barbarity and impunity for close to fifteen years by this point. You are looking for evidence of Jewish involvement in the Bolshevik regime therefore this is the sole feature you focus on. The fact that thousands of Jews were murdered by the various iterations of the USSR&#39;s secret police force, the fact that pogroms actually continued in the early years post-revolution, the fact that many other non-Jewish members held this post seem to be completely irrelevant to you. Why does an individual being Jewish automatically link them to some conspiracy in your mind? Why is it at all relevant? </p>

<p>Last point for reference - The Gulags were initially formed as an extension of Trotsky&#39;s forced Labour Camps. As I have already explained, Trotsky was the child of Jewish apostates he was not actually a religious individual. Can you explain how this fits into your theories and why it is relevant? By this same logic one could describe both the Western Allies and Nazi Germany as violent Christian movements intent on world domination could you not? Why is Churchill&#39;s massacre of Bengalis through the diversion of grain shipments not considered as evidence of a Christian conspiracy to destroy the Indian population in your eyes? Using the logic I have employed (i.e. the cultural associations of one&#39;s ancestral religion make absolutely zero difference to an individual&#39;s motivations) this is fairly easy to explain however I am struggling to adapt your apparent mental framework to this question. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I notice Weber cites several of these, as do others. For the record I didn&#39;t actually get that from Weber&#39;s write up. But so what if I, or someone else did, the citations are accurate. Since when has it become proper scholarship to dismiss a citation from a second source because it happens to be used by someone who doesn&#39;t pass your personal approval or favor. Were they accurate citations? That was my sole unanswered question. </p>

<p>You really need to up your game beyond &quot;anti-semite&quot; accusations too. That may work with dum dums, but not to intelligent people any more.

<p>I am well read on Red Terror. So I will state my point succinctly, I believe ethnic Jews as a ORGANIZED GROUP overwhelmingly played a role in RT and in Red revolutions in Europe (such as Hungary and Germany in 1919). This is well documented and I gave source citations including Jewish scholars. I say organized group, because individuals do not just &quot;happen to get into positions of power&quot;. This was an ingroup who promoted, sponsored and advanced their own tribe. The Bolshevik ideology well suited them. </p>

<p>As far as later history, yes they ebbed and flowed in terms of power, and at times Jews were on the payback end and were culled such as in the 1937-38 purge. I would not argue that they were only dishing it out, and the only ones dishing out RT, but Jewish Bolsheviks were some of the biggest monsters of that era. I wouldn&#39;t argue that Jews, ran communism from start to finish either, but they were the major factor for a good portion of that first twenty years. That is not even debatable.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>And I have provided both academic and logical arguments to suggest that these citations are inaccurate. I raised the anti-Semitism of the authors simply to highlight a bias, it&#39;s not like I ignored the actual content. Could you address the counter-points I raised rather than complaining that I have dismissed them off-hand? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is well documented and I gave source citations including Jewish scholars.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And again, I have raised the logical point that in fact the overall membership rates of Jewish individuals within the Bolshevik party were fairly low, that repression against Jews actually continued after the end of the civil war, and that the majority of prominent Jewish individuals within the party were non-religious and largely alienated from the wider Russian Jewish community. All points that you have still not addressed at all. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>individuals do not just &quot;happen to get into positions of power&quot;. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And who helped Lenin get into power? Was the Kaiser in on this Jewish conspiracy as well? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This was an ingroup who promoted, sponsored and advanced their own tribe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is why so many non-Jews and apostates achieved high rank? Sorry I don&#39;t really follow the logic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Bolshevik ideology well suited them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well considering that the other choice during the civil war were itching to get started with another pogrom it&#39;s hardly surprising. During the civil war at least the Red Army weren&#39;t displacing or massacring Jewish populations everywhere they went. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jewish Bolsheviks were some of the biggest monsters of that era</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But why do you need to specify Jewish? What difference does it make what cultural affiliations an individual holds. Trying to categorize and simplify in this way seems to release many from the individual motivations that drove the barbarity of the RT. We don&#39;t need to identify Robespierre as a Christian in order to determine that a significant proportion of French Jacobins were sadistic anarchists. Similarly identifying certain individuals within the early USSR as being from a historically repressed cultural and religious group does nothing to help us determine why many non-Jews were equally drawn into the blood-frenzy of Stalin&#39;s reign. If we instead forgo the religious or cultural context and instead focus on class and economics we see a very clear trend of repressed and economically disadvantaged groups rising up and lashing out against those who previously lead the repression. It&#39;s hardly a surprise. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jews... were the major factor for a good portion of that first twenty years. That is not even debatable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clearly it is. As I have repeatedly stated now you are viewing this through a very specific lens which is forcing you to miss many other critical elements within this story, notably the class conflict and massive societal changes that travelled across Europe in the mid 19th and early 20th Centuries. Tsarist Russia in particular was a rotten obsolete structure waiting for collapse. A feudal society based around serf-labour is not remotely compatible with an industrialized economy as Russia was becoming in the 1910&#39;s. It&#39;s hardly a surprise that the German high command would recognize this and use it to their advantage during a desperate war nor is it surprising (again using France as a previous example) that the collapse of this structure would result in a great deal of violence and bloodshed with many different groups seeking revenge for historical transgressions and ethnic repression.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, we&#39;ve made our points and I will give you most of the last word.</p>

<p>I would only add that your source Oleg Budnitskii quoting the ludicrous 4% Jewish participation in the early Bolshevik movement appears to be a highly biased source and worse a hired gun for the Holocaust Museum. How much does a prime fellowship there pay? 
<a href="https://www.ushmm.org/research/competitive-academic-programs/fellows-and-scholars/all-fellows-and-scholars/oleg-budnitskii-2009">https://www.ushmm.org/research/competitive-academic-programs/fellows-and-scholars/all-fellows-and-scholars/oleg-budnitskii-2009</a></p>

<p>So just as you reject Weber as biased, I will reject a paid fellow/scholar like  Budnitskii, especially given the absurd percentages he lays out. On that front you might go back and suggest a Bolshie percentage shtick more plausible to thinking people. 4% is laughable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it wasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>There were many high profile Bolsheviks and Communists that were Jewish, but the movement itself was very much Russian nationalist and had no specific religion or nationality (other than Russian). Jews were still very much a minority, even among the Bolshevik leadership. The Jews who were involved got in because the Tsarist regime was extremely oppressive to the Jews, so as soon as murmurs of a revolution began, many Jews leaped aboard. </p>

<p>Furthermore, the White Russians hated Jews, so they used propaganda and touted it as a &quot;Jewish movement&quot; to put people against it.</p>

<p>In the end, it didn&#39;t work out well for anyone. The Bolsheviks weren&#39;t any friendlier to the Jews than the Tsarists were, so most of the Jewish Bolsheviks chose to abandon or hide their religion. Once Lenin and the Russo-Communists rose to power, Judaism was banned from being taught and practiced the traditional way. The Soviets set aside a city in Siberia called Birobidzhan and basically said &quot;You want to be Jewish? Go there and practice it as we say it should be practiced. Otherwise get Gulag&#39;d&quot;. </p>
