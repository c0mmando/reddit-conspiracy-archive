       These are direct quotes from Donald Trump about protesters in his rallies:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        October 14th, 2015:
       </strong>
       "Maybe he should have been roughed up because it was absolutely disgusting what he was doing."
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        January 22nd, 2015:
       </strong>
       "So if you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously. Okay? Just knock the hell - I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Feb 23rd, 2016:
       </strong>
       "I love the old days. You know what they used to do to guys like that when they were in a place like this? They would be carried out in a stretcher,"
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        March 3rd, 2016:
       </strong>
       "Get him out. Try not to hurt him. If you do I'll defend you in court."
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        March 11, 2016:
       </strong>
       "He was swinging, he was hitting people and the audience hit back. And that's what we need a little bit more of."
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell us again how Donald Trump is not responsible for violence at his rallies.

       So he's allowed to openly advocate violence because he was attacked once? How about no. He's a presidential candidate, not a mob boss. Sorry that happened to him, but it doesn't excuse his behavior. He is supposed to set an example, not sink to their level.

       So you
       <em>
        don't

       agree that Trump should be held responsible for saying things to incite violence against people he doesn't like? That's pretty fucked up, imo.

       He should be held responsible by public opinion and the national discourse, I don't mean legally because like you said no laws have been broken.

       They're all liars, I don't know why you would think Trump isn't lying. Agreed, the violence is coming from Soros.

       I’d like to challenge (question) this, simply because of the context of the rest of his replies in this thread, as well as the demonstrably decontextualized text of the submission itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Specifically,
       <strong>
        18 US Code § 1752
       </strong>
       states:
      </p>
      <p>
       (a)
       <strong>
        Whoever—
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       (2)
       <strong>
        knowingly, and with intent to impede or disrupt the orderly conduct of
       </strong>
       Government business or
       <strong>
        official functions, engages in disorderly or disruptive conduct
       </strong>
       in, or within such proximity to, any restricted building or grounds when, or so that, such conduct, in fact, impedes or disrupts the orderly conduct of Government business or official functions;
      </p>
      <p>
       (b)
       <strong>
        The punishment for a violation of subsection (a) is—
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       (1)
       <strong>
        a fine
       </strong>
       under this title
       <strong>
        or imprisonment for not more than 10 years, or both, if
       </strong>
       —
      </p>
      <p>
       (A)the person, during and in relation to the offense, uses or carries a deadly or dangerous weapon or firearm; or
      </p>
      <p>
       (B)
       <strong>
        the offense results in significant bodily injury
       </strong>
       as defined by section 2118(e)(3); and
      </p>
      <p>
       (2)a fine under this title or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both, in any other case.
      </p>
      <p>
       (c)
       <strong>
        In this section—
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       (1)
       <strong>
        the term restricted
       </strong>
       buildings or
       <strong>
        grounds means any posted, cordoned off, or otherwise restricted area—
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       (B)
       <strong>
        of a building or grounds where
       </strong>
       the President or
       <strong>
        other person protected by the Secret Service is or will be temporarily visiting
       </strong>
       ;
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s
       <em>
        illegal
       </em>
       for protesters to do what has been done to Trump. Additionally, does anyone expect someone who has been physically harmed to simply lie back and take it? Trump speaks nothing but common sense in calling for a RESPONSE to violence acted at his rallies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further clarification: would it have been acceptable to paint a broader stroke? Generic leftist bot, perhaps? Cruzbot? or even further: Anti-Trumpbot?

       None of that is relevant to you accusing another user of being a troll.

       How was he a pussy at all? He could have been killed. If someone came at Obama like that he'd be ducking and cowering away hiding behind whatever he could. Trump literally just stood there and watched.

       I kind of regret posting this after how this comment section is going, but I'll leave it I guess. Obviously the protesters shouldn't be violent. But it is also true that Trump shouldn't be openly advocating violence like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        I'm not supporting the protesters in any way.
       </strong>
       I am merely saying that there are conditions that led to this violence, some of which are caused by Trump.

       How can you actually call yourself a proud zionist? You must only look at Israel itself to know why it's a heinous creed -- it's the state of barbarians, one of the only modern day states participating in apartheid, it sickens me to my core. How can you honestly stand for those who commit acts of genocide? I really want to know, I hope you respond.

       Fuck bro I honestly can't tell if you're being satirical of the average Zionist or you believe the crazy doomsday prophecy shit you're saying.

      <p>
       And if you really are Zionist, why do you guys insist that the United States be your bitch and pay all of your bills? If you're really that great why can't you handle the international criticism that every other country that commits acts crimes against humanity takes? Why can't you guys just fucking man up and stop trying to rule by subversion, if you're so fucking special? Chosen my ass, just another ethnocentric group who mistakenly believes they are the chosen one. Seriously, people who are proud of themselves do not have to lie about their actions, the zionists are not a proud people; they are shameful, which is why they act based on shame. They prey on the lack of willingness of the average person to believe such evil exists in this world.

       So let me get this straight, in order for your savior to return to Earth and be satisfied with the Human race, he has to see Israel run by Jews? Ok, I get that, but... what if his chosen people are taking part in ethnic cleansing? I mean -- I'm not a theologian but that has to be against Jesus' teachings, I just can't see Jesus really being ok with ethnic cleansing. In fact, if there is anyone being satisfied by the current conditions, it would have to be Satan, and I say this as someone who doesn't believe in the Bible, but if they do exist and Satan is real, wouldn't it make sense that you're appeasing the bringer of light: Lucifer? Jesus don't want no part of ethnic cleansing, nor a people who are committing it, for fuck's sake he was crucified! Why on earth would he want to come back to earth and see that shit?

       WO WO WO WO HER NAME IS NOT BRUCE FUCKING JENNER!! 
Oh my bad, that was another conversation I was just having with someone similar (a reddit user), hard to keep these straight sometimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       For an anti-trump person, you sure have done your research. I can't say I've listened to every speech made by every candidate that I disagree with (or agree with for that matter), and I can't say I went through them with a fine toothed comb, but that's just me, and I have other jobs to worry about. If you have done this much research than the lack of understanding shown is both curious and troublesome, and if your purpose is not to unfairly characterize a candidate you oppose, not sure why you even posted it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's clear some things up for the logical and levelheaded among us:
      </p>
      <p>
       It goes from "Donald Trump openly encourages violence at his rallies.", to "So you don't agree that Trump should be held responsible for saying things to incite violence against people he doesn't like?" encouraging and inciting are two different things, and you are mis-characterizing his statement in the first place: Trump doesn't advocate violence at [all] his rallies like you say he does, he first rhetorically questions if offering courtesy to a person who is discourteous to him is justified (10-14-15), then is advocating for preventive strikes (stopping people from throwing things 1-22-16), and self defense (happy to see the audience hitting back 3-11-16). He also reflects on a time when violence was more acceptable, which is not advocating for it today (2-23-16). The last one I haven't mentioned is about him making sure to get a disruptful person out of his speech, specifically without violence, then makes a joke to add levity to the situation. This is not advocating violence, to be clear.  No, he's not a push-over that's for sure.  Is that a quality you usually seek out in a Presidential candidate?
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not going to say that the OP is an obvious shill. Having said that, he wrote an openly misleading title and backed it up by taking out of context quotes, that aren't even that unreasonable. Then proceeds to defend against every opposing comment rigorously (soundly or not), and when presented with conflicting/disproving evidence, he resorts to ad-hominem attacks, or generalizations. I don't like to see people berating other commenters with opposing views (worldoftanks21), or falsely equivocating (jumping to the conclusion) that others (BrotherSpartacus) want people deported. I also don't like when people assume, without basis, that if someone disagrees with you, that means they must hate you for being [insert group] (BrotherSpartacus). Again BrotherSpartacus is attacked for making a logical argument about free speech which disagrees with the post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rights don't work that way, and not because one side is better than the other or vice versa. It's also laughable that the venue and expensive nature of the assembly should have any impact on this discussion, and it was a weak attempt to slide the conversation down another tangent that is emotionally touchy, but not at all important to the issue of free speech.  To the point, there have been hundreds of "Black Lives Matter" protests in public places that did not require lots of money to arrange, and good luck disrupting their rally with your "free speech" and expect anything other than violence (i.e. mizzou "can we get some muscle over here for this reporter!) even in a "safe-space" lol!  It's not the time to play that card sir, go fish.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the nature of free speech, you can't pick and choose when to agree with it. Perfect example , (LOL) this quote by OP: "Like the right to assemble and protest?" What?? If the Trump people don't have a right to gather and talk without person A interrupting them, then person A doesn't have a right to PROTEST in the first place! They go hand in hand. You can't ignore someone's freedom of speech or freedom to assemble on the grounds that YOUR free speech trumps theirs. By disrupting his event (notice I didn't say protest), they are basically shitting on free speech (the concept), which is why people that understand the constitution are scratching their heads when the justification used for said shitting was the "freedom of speech".
      </p>
      <p>
       I could go through the rest of this garbage thread but ahh, why bother, it's not like I'm getting paid for this shit!
      </p>
      <p>
       Nice job eliciting a response tho
      </p>
      <p>
       trump is super pro israel, pro waterboarding, pro evangelical, and some other things that are better points to stick to when trying to engage this subreddit to hate him.  Being tough on people designed to disrupt a conversation is something us veterans have had experience with on r/con for a long time, hell, that's half the content in any good thread!

       It's being deliberately stirred up to destabilize America. Everyone is so hyper-polarized that the infighting amongst fellow citizens has almost consumed all our focus as a society. I've heard it said that war is merely the expression of a collective societal mental breakdown. I think this breakdown is being engineered so that the military industrial complex can get more profitable wars started without anyone standing in their way.

       All you shrinking violet liberals who are aghast at the mere thought of violence, you make yourself a part of it and party to it when you support political parties that hire rent-a-mobs to threaten people in the streets in order to prevent a political rally.

       You are right, both sides are at fault, but the left is so much more potentially dangerous than the right, given the high number of mass killings whenever the left rises to power.  The holodomor, the 'great leap forward', the bolsheviks, the holocaust, pol pot and the killing fields...the list of horrific crimes committed by the left makes the right-wingers' worst exploits seem cavalier in comparison.

       I see your point, but you're cherry picking history to support your argument. There have been extremists from both sides. Rightists include: Mussolini, the US, Pre-WW2 Japan, not to mention all the highly-religious arab spring countries that have seen so much turmoil and death lately. It really goes both ways, the fact we only have 2 parties shows how controlled it is any way. We aren't offered real choices, or else we would have more than 2 political parties.
      </p>
      <p>
       Authoritarianism knows both the left and right. Have you heard of horseshoe theory?
      </p>
      <p>
       In my mind, the real battle is between the authoritarians and the anti-authoritarians. The left/right thing is just a divide and conquer tactic. As soon as you align with a "team", you are easy to control.

       My point is that they're NOT "much  more potentially dangerous" and that is only your perception because of the way you view history. It makes you think one side is "the good guys" when they're not any better at all.

       Okay, lets say it's true. The US doesn't even have a left though, the whole spectrum is so far to the right and everything is corporatist. The US caused the deaths of over 800k people in the war in Iraq, and that was only one war! And it was started not by leftists, but rightists! Not to mention what Raegan did in central and south America. These are conservatives, not liberals. You cannot ignore this stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it does pain me a bit to see you saying "the left is the worst side" when most of the recent atrocities of war have been initiated by the Right, since the US Republicans are most firmly under the thumb of the military-industrial complex. But then the left isn't much better either, because the whole country is so far right.

       No, you are the one who is too partisan, as your defensive replies showed from the very beginning that you are a leftist yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are brainwashed to immediately think 'right wing' when you hear the word 'corporation', for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is such a leftist thing to say.  You may as well have said that right wingers "want to legislate your sex life" or  "right wingers are inherently racist" or  "The right is anti-freedom, as pro-life ideology restricts a woman's right to choose".  I have heard leftists say all these things, and more, about the right when not one of these is true.

       Just because I can identify your bias, does not automatically make me the biased one here.

       I believe we are seeing similar changes in society as during the Red Terror or the rise of Adolph Hitler.  Recent events suggest that the left is agitating for revolution, and it looks like we are due for some societal upheaval.  The country is so divided right now, I wouldn't even rule out civil war.

       Both the left AND right are agitating for revolution, remember the tea party and Occupy wall street? Things are divided and people want change. If only the right and the left anti-authoritarians would realize they want essentially the same thing and unify against the authoritarians. I think we are a ways from a civil war though, I hope it doesn't come to that. I think it would take a stock market crash and a police violence situation of a very large scale before there would be anything resembling a civil war. Which is possible, but I'd say there's minimum 5-10 years before we get to that point. And I don't think it's inevitable, I think we could change peacefully if people were organized enough.

       The tea party was a political movement, not a revolutionary movement.  There is more than one meaning of the word 'revolution'.  There is the military meaning of the word, as in the American Revolution, and then there is the political meaning, which is a method that leftists use to attain power.

       This is where 'they' have us over a barrel.  All the divisions in society that keep us from uniting, all that is by design.  Racism, sexism, political correctness, are just a few of the tools used against us, to keep the population divided and at each other's throats.

       I would agree with this, except I see the left pushing for revolution now.  They are using Trump as a catalyst and a rallying point, and they are going to take advantage of this opportunity.

       I see your point, but you're cherry picking history to support your argument. There have been extremists from both sides. Rightists include: Mussolini, the US, Pre-WW2 Japan, not to mention all the highly-religious arab spring countries that have seen so much turmoil and death lately. It really goes both ways, the fact we only have 2 parties shows how controlled it is any way. We aren't offered real choices, or else we would have more than 2 political parties.
      </p>
      <p>
       Authoritarianism knows both the left and right. Have you heard of horseshoe theory?
      </p>
      <p>
       In my mind, the real battle is between the authoritarians and the anti-authoritarians. The left/right thing is just a divide and conquer tactic. As soon as you align with a "team", you are easy to control.
