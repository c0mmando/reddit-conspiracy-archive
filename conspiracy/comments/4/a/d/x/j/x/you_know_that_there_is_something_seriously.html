    <div class="md"><p>No its not. A board of directors are in charge of making the financial decisions for a company. They do not choose the curriculum for schooling (thats the government), they also dont pick what goes into the books.</p>

<p>They have absolutely nothing to do with the decision making process of what goes into textbooks. Thatd be editors who are pretty much always people with doctorates on the subjects. You can actually look at the back of any textbook to find the list of people who wrote it, and you&#39;ll find the source materials all come from scholars... since thats kind of what scholars do. Theyre generally people with masters/doctorates in Education, majoring/minoring in the subject of the text.</p>

<p>IE a physics textbook probably was dictated and editted by someone with a Masters in Education, Majoring+Minoring in a combination of physics/math/stats/chem.</p>

<p>The board of directors are in charge of stuff like hiring, investing, choosing which city to put the next office in, choosing the best suppliers for the books, landing deals... that kind of shit.</p>

<p>And all of what goes in the book is laid out by the Government of that country, pretty much all first world countries have school curriculums laid out in the Federal area, so they have a board of education of some kind (in Canada we have the Canadian School Board Association, who make choices for schools across the whole country, which sometimes takes the form of &#39;this topic will be handled at a provincial level&#39; etc etc)</p>

<p>They then hand a list of topics that textbooks need to cover to companies like Pearson, and they have to make sure their books hit all the checklists.</p>

<p>So go take a look at the chair members of your countries federal board on education, thats who you want to scrutinize, they make these decisions.</p>

<p>Why the fuck would you even think a publisher would have anything to do with whats in the school curriculum? Being suspicious of businessmen being in the very job their credentials are for is fucking retarded.</p>

<p>Theres so many layers of idiocy to this entire argument I don&#39;t even know where to start.</p>

<p>To try and connect financial majors in a financial position of a textbook manufacturing company to issues in school policies is so absurd it makes my head hurt.</p>

<p>A business major in a CEO position? How fucking astonishing! A bank manager in charge of financial decisions? Somethings afoot!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was home schooled most of my schooling years except high school; it was a horrifying, eye opening experience to finally be put into a classroom full of 15-16 year olds who couldn&#39;t read a paragraph clearly or even understand what they had just read. Also no finances were taught but I&#39;m grateful to have had that personal finance/balancing your check book lesson taught by my mother when I was around 12-13 years old.

<p>Meanwhile the teachers just kept passing these students because they felt bad for them, instead of finding out why they hadn&#39;t gotten the attention to help them with their weak area&#39;s they did what the last teacher did sign off and let them walk out.

    <div class="md"><p>No one in k-12 wants to be there. Even the hard workers are only doing it for a &#39;future&#39;.</p>

<p>The reason is because we are not taught HOW to think, but WHAT to think. Children are inquisitive by nature, but that doesn&#39;t mean they want to be molded for 6 hours a day in disjointed classes metered by a pavlovian bell.</p>

<p>Old school houses had it better, the older children can help with the younger so they get both sides of the education. Further things like the Trivium, Quadrium, and Great Conversation are completely gone from school.</p>

<p>John Taylor Gatto wrote about this in a few great books. Dumbing Us Down is a good intro.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my teenage years i came to the conclusion that education</p>

<p>was kinda like A tribe teaching you how to process and cook meat </p>

<p>But they never teach you how to hunt I dropped out of school at the age of 20.</p>

<p>I fucked up in so many ways and have hit the ground,</p>

<p>heck even went rock bottom. But 6 years later i&#39;m a self thought hunter</p>

<p>I co-own a company with my trustee, a friend since childhood</p>

<p>And the last two years since we started the company has been rather good to us</p>

<p>I guess around the age of 30 I&#39;ll find out if i made the right choices in life or not.</p>

<p>Not that i would recommend this path. </p>

<p>But it did teach me that you can do pretty much anything</p>

<p>as long if you keep passionate about it and keep envisioning where </p>

<p>you wanna be. who you suppose to be, the best possible you.</p>

<p>life has the strange tendency to hand you the tools it&#39;s just</p>

<p>the art of seeing them when they are presented to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first time you take PA is in college, and there are quite a few pre-reqs/reqs before you cna even take it.... Debt part makes complete sense. I know way to many people who grad. HS and have no idea what to do with their money (what little they have) and the last thing they think about is an accountant or learning Personal Finace themselves. (First is really expensive and I would rather be my own account then have one who skims off the top of my shit. My family(Pa) owns quite a few buisnesses in our town alone.... the accountant/payroll person def skims from the top, she edits out hours from paychecks and somehow keeps few hundred for herself.(fuckin&#39; cunt)... </p>

<pre><code> But what can we do? We either gotta get a new accountant, or go through year(s) of college just to be able to hopefully stay debt free.(Almost 95% impossible unless your family is wealthy....)
</code></pre>

<p>Honestly without my fam Id be dead... Dead. My diabetes insulin is 541$ a month, a month! My thyroid(30-50~mth),Subxne(442$/mnth), Teststrips(500$ 3Mnth(notevenjoking)...and 1,500$ a month(insurance wont cover) for injections in my eye to stop the cancerous overgrowth of veins in my eyes...(1.5k$ for one eye... 3k$ both eyes, monthly, for a year).... Not including rent 750$ a month,at the least. Food 150$ a month(severe stomache issues can rarely eat, 150$ may be generous). Oh and all the doc visits where insurance wouldnt cover... or over my prem for being sickly.... Its just outragous. </p>

<pre><code>   All med prices are with insurance ezcept eye injections.(wont allow).... AND ontop of that , 3k$ a semester at the LEAST for basic comm. college, just PREREQs alone, not even the reqs to even be able to get into Finacing.... So just tell me how someone who is 23, can afford this.... Let alone, know how to keep myself alive, literally, without finacing skills... Anyone??
