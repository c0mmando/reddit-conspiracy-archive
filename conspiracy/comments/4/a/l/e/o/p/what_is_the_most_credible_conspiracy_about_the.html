       He was whacked by the CIA/MIC/Mafia. Why? Because he was making enemies with the first two and investigating the last one with his brother.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I should also note, that the Kennedy's were rich Catholics and knew much about the Jesuits. One could say too much. Mafia/CIA ties to the Vatican are strong. JFK was not like his father, and him and his younger brother (Robert) had other agendas. JFK wasn't even first choice, the eldest brother was, but he died.

       The CIA didn't do it. It was the Cubans and Russians. They orchestrated it and worked with fired CIA director Allen Dulles. Dulles had the CIA turn a blind eye towards what was happening because both he and the agency wanted Kennedy gone.

       JFK had sworn to break up the CIA, had fired Dulles, was not going to go into Vietnam, and had pissed off the mafia and oil men, and finally, Johnson had aspirations and loathed/hated being 2nd fiddle.  It was all carefully planned in advance.

       Here's a talk given by the author of JFK and the Unspeakable.  It gives you a good idea of how much is missing from history lessons.

       I read somewhere that after JFK was shot, his wife refused to change clothes before she got on Air force 1. When someone asked her why she hasn't changed out of her blood soaked clothes yet, she responded "I want them to see what they've done."

       Although I do not necessarily agree with everything in it, "Everything is a Rich Man's Trick" is a great documentary, so is "Evidence of revision", (part one) which will blow your mind.  But the book, "JFK and the Unspeakable" is what you want.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        When New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison charged businessman Clay Shaw with participation in the JFK assassination conspiracy Garrison stumbled upon the Israeli Mossad connection to the murder of President Kennedy. Shaw served on the board of a shadowy corporation known as Permindex. A primary shareholder in Permindex was the Banque De Credit International of Geneva, founded by Tibor Rosenbaum, an arms procurer and financier for the Mossad.
       </p>
       <p>
        What's more, the Mossad-sponsored Swiss bank was the chief "money laundry" for Meyer Lansky, the head of the international crime syndicate and an Israeli loyalist whose operations meshed closely on many fronts with the American CIA.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the pages of "Final Judgment" the Israeli connection to the JFK assassination is explored in frightening--and fully documented--detail. For example, did you know:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         <p>
          That JFK was engaged in a bitter secret conflict with Israel over U.S. East policy and that Israel's prime minister resigned in disgust, saying JFK's stance threatened Israel's very survival?
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          That JFK's successor, Lyndon Johnson, immediately reversed America's policy toward Israel?
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          That the top Mafia figures often alleged to be behind the JFK assassination were only front men for Meyer Lansky?
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          That the CIA's liaison to the Mossad, James Angleton, was a prime mover behind the cover-up of the JFK assassination?
         </p>
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Why didn't Oliver Stone, in his famous movie "JFK" not mention any of this? It turns out the chief financial backer of Stone's film was longtime Mossad figure, Arnon Milchan, Israel's biggest arms dealer.

       There are many reasons he was killed, pointed out in these comments, all valid.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the final straw was this:
      </p>
      <p>
       JFK was going to end the money printing press of the Federal Reserve system and in doing so would expose the biggest secret of all, something called the Global Collateral Accounts.  This was what the allies used after the war to hijack the global financial system, and without it, they lose control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today the accounts are estimated to be about $93,000 trillion in hard assets.  Yes, 93 quadrillion dollars of gold.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Kennedy’s Green Hilton Agreement with Sukarno
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1963, President John F. Kennedy entered into an Agreement with President Sukarno of Indonesia to provide the funds to allow the United States Treasury to print its own currency, thus subverting the “right” to print the currency held by the Federal Reserve.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Agreement would have transferred some 59,000 tons of gold to underpin this currency. The problem with this was that the US domestic currency would have then been backed by gold which would have been a violation of international agreements meant to stabilize currencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eight days after signing this agreement, President Kennedy was assassinated.
      </p>
      <p>
       President Johnson suspended the EO-11110 as issued by Kennedy and transferred the bullion to the Federal Reserve. In Indonesia, President Sukarno was gradually placed under house arrest.
      </p>

       I've read that story before, but it doesn't appear to have any evidence to support it.
      </p>
      <p>
       JFK did not ever attempt to do anything with the Federal Reserve. Even his famous executive order about silver has been misrepresented.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why in the world would JFK have to sign something with Indonesia to print currency?
      </p>
      <p>
       The other explanations of JFK's assassination are far more convincing than that one, which appears to simply be an elaborate fictional mythology.

       No, he orchestrated it on the behalf of the Russians and Cubans. Is it too far fetched to believe that the first and longest running CIA director would have made powerful connections in Cuba and Russia? The Russians and Cubans had him (easily) convince the CIA to turn a blind eye to what was happening and allow them to kill Kennedy.

       JFK was objectively and distressingly weak.Many people thought, at the time, that he was too weak to keep the world together. He had failed to provide air support in The Bay of Pigs – after falling for the CIA’s trap in the first place. He got spanked by Khrushchev in the Vienna talks after that. He allowed Russia to build a wall in Berlin, and his manifest distaste for confrontation prompted Russia to cause the Cuban Missile Crisis. To the wing nuts (e.g.; Lemnitzer, LeMay, Dulles) in power, he lost the CMC by not invading Cuba and by agreeing to pull Titan missiles out of Turkey. To top it all off, he got into a limited test ban treaty with Russia, which could not be entirely verified, thereby (in the minds of the wingnuts) allowing the Ruskies to cheat and develop superior nuclear weapons. These people thought they were saving the free world by removing an incompetent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The technocrats put in place by McNamara (who I am convinced was perfectly loyal) had extrapolated that, by late 1963, the U.S. would have its maximum technological advantage over the Russians. The Wing Nuts wanted to cause a Pearl Harbor type event around that time as an excuse for a first strike. Kennedy, characteristically, didn’t like this idea, so he became the event. The CIA was only too happy to join the military in the creation of the event, since they hated Kennedy too, and since they wanted to be in charge of the military – as they seem to be to this day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, Khrushchev was being viewed as an adventurist and a clown by the people around him in the Kremlin. Nobody on either side got the CMC joke – The Kremlin disliked it for the risk; the U.S. military disliked it for the lack of decisive action. As a result, both leaders were removed within a couple of years. Khrushchev was kept in longer than he would have been because he seemed to have come out of the CMC with a special relationship with Kennedy. (Khrushchev decided by the end of it that he liked Kennedy a lot more than he liked Castro. Ironically, Castro’s views on CMC strategy seemed to mirror those of Lemnitzer.) When Kennedy was hit, Khrushchev’s ouster became inevitable.

       I think the theory about the fatal shot coming (accidentally) from the gun of one of the secret service agents riding in the car behind has a lot of weight behind it. There was a great documentary about it but I can't seem to find it at the moment.

       the real killer is the women with the camera. The babushka women I think they call her. Perfect killer no one would expect a women capable of that in that era. Videos camera gun is the weapon. Why video tape something so important and not come forward with it to the public saying ya I saw it?

       Agent George hickey accidentally did it with the ar 15 in the Cia follow up car behind the president . With the sudden acceleration of the motorcade after Lee Harvey oswald squeezed 2 off, hickey with the ar15 safety off and scanning around for the shooter (which you can see in a photo),fell  backwards and caused the fatal head shot to jfk. All the trajectory angles line up, frangible pieces of bullet found in jfks brain proves the bullet dispersed into fragments which is what ar15 bullets do , Lho's carcano bullets were full metal jackets which are meant to pass through you with almost no fragments left behind. Read mortal error by bonar menninger if you are interested in this theory. Bonar menninger worked with ballistic expert Howard Donahue who was the only man to successfully mimic oswalds so called 3 shots in under 6 seconds at a moving target. I've read over 6 books on different theories, 2 term papers in college, the Warren commission, and movies about the jfk assassination and this book mortal error opened my eyes to a different angle. It's time we find out from the mouth of the monster itself about the truth. Thanks.

       The most credible conspiracy theory is that a lone gunman that had his trip back from Russia paid for by the US government shot JFK in such a manner Jackie O went towards the lone shooter to retrieve a piece of her husband's skull.  Most credible conspiracy theory.
