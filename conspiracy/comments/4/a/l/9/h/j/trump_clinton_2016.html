<p>ridiculously over the top, disgusting, violent, racist campaign</p>
</blockquote>

<p>God, this stupidity will never end.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign is appealing to what is called &quot;civic nationalism&quot; - it is the OPPOSITE of &quot;ethnic nationalism&quot; or what the looney-tunes on the left call &quot;racism&quot; (except for Israel.)</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s campaign has been attacked by the violent left - Bernie Bros, Black Lives Matter people, and hostile aliens have snuck into virtually every Trump speech and started loudly &quot;protesting,&quot; using &quot;fighting words&quot; and screaming at people, calling them &quot;racist&quot; and the like.</p>

<p>The other day some professional left wing agitator actually rushed the stage to try and attack Trump, but was stopped by the Secret Service.</p>

<p>Not to mention in Chicago, where the anti-Trump rioters threw bottles at police, blocked ambulances, and screamed violent slogans.</p>

<p>I mean, really, the far left wingnuts need to look in a fucking mirror. They are acting like unhinged lunatics.</p>

<p>Trump is basically a Democrat - some of his rhetoric could have been Jimmy Carter&#39;s rhetoric in 1976. That&#39;s how far to the left the Democrats have veered in the last few years.</p>

I claimed that he sympathises with hitler or Nazis and gave you the proof of his wife saying he reads books of Hitlers speeches. Maybe Trump only likes him for his abilities as an oriator and wants to be as good as he was at giving speeches. Even if that is the case, one of the tames explanations of him reading Hitler speeches, he still is attempting to use the same emotionally charged statements and nationalist sentiment that Hitler used. Maybe your right, and the only familiarity is their ability to envigorate a crowd and gain the peoples confidence, but even if that&#39;s the case, I don&#39;t like it when politicians are taking notes from Hitler.

<p>So now you are claiming that if someone reads a book, they must &quot;sympathize&quot; with the author? That idea is beyond stupid. I&#39;ve read the Communist manifesto, does that mean I&#39;m a Marxist? What an idiotic idea. Second of all, all you are quoting is hearsay - that&#39;s not proof. And third, Trump himself has denounced Pat Buchanan claiming he was a &quot;Hitler lover&quot; - and guess what? Trump sounded just as stupid making up that lie as YOU do making up your lies about Trump.</p>

<p>That&#39;s monstrous, but hardly surprising coming from someone who is literally a Communist apologist.</p>

And I have graduated highschool thank you very much.
To be honest, I think you&#39;re a mean dude right now. I posted that I enjoy the kind and logical conversation on this subreddit, and you have refused to engage in that, but comment anyway. I&#39;m just trying to have a chat and discuss some things. 
The fact that you still deny the existence of the KKK is silly. They were havinga fucking march not that long ago, people where there fucking uniforms still. If you are suggesting that they are all faking it, that&#39;s interesting, and something I can&#39;t prove right or wrong, can you?
You have never tried to prove anything to me, at least I have tried, not my fault you reject my sources.
Goodnight :)
I hope you have a nice day and wake up on the right side of the bed tomorrow.</p>

<p>NEVER, encouraged violence towards Trump,</p>

<p>As we see, KKK Grand Wizard &quot;coolio-o-doolio&quot; encourages violence against average people he calls &quot;white&quot; - presumably, due to his Communist ideology.</p>

<p>We now know that coolio-o-doolie is AGAINST free speech and believes that murder and violence is acceptable against anyone who isn&#39;t voting for Communist Bernie Sanders, or anyone who doesn&#39;t support Communism.</p>

<p>I mean, coolio-o-doolio has admitted it himself, as he is a supporter of mass genocide, Communism, mass murder, and Communist atrocities.</p>

<p>I know, I personally don&#39;t support his blood-thirsty violent narrative, but I do think it is important to allow free speech for Communist supporters of mass murder and genocide like coolio-o-doolio (he is a typical Communist &quot;Bernie-Bro&quot;) to say what is on their mind.</p>

<p>That way, we get it on the record.</p>

<p>Doth protest too much methinks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, no doubt, the Bernie Bros and anti-Trump lunatics screaming about &quot;racism&quot; and the like are, in fact, protesting too much.</p>

<p>I think the Bernie Bros are in serious denial why Sanders has virtually no support, out side of his lily-white base of &quot;progressives.&quot;</p>

<p>Certainly, black and brown Democrats are voting in huge numbers for Clinton, not Sanders.</p>

<p>Just look at a Sanders rally, it&#39;s whiter than a Tea Party.</p>

<p>Plus, when Black Lives Matter interrupted the Bernie Sanders event and called all his lily white fans a bunch of &quot;racists&quot; and told them to &quot;shut up&quot; and let colored people speak for once, the lily-white progressive were aghast.</p>

<p>I mean, if all those white progressives actually shut the fuck up, how would anyone know what wonderful &quot;anti-racist&quot; progressives they are? The whole point of being a Bernie Bro is to signal your moral superiority.</p>

<p>So, you know, the Bernie Bros have resorted to shrieking &quot;Raaaaacist!&quot; at Trump, to hide their own, er, &quot;problematic&quot; issues with race.</p>

<p>Yes, methinks the Bernie Bros doth protest too much.</p>

<p>I swear to God, the left are such drama queens.  Trump hasn&#39;t said anything more or less offensive or violent than any randomly chosen politician of the 20th century.  The American people are largely behind him, they don&#39;t want muslim refugees or free trade or having leftist youth mobs threaten them as they peaceably assemble as is their constitutional right.  Actually I feel that Trump has been rather restrained.  </p>

<p>The left is going to keep up the pressure, trying to gin up trouble, making mountains out of any molehill they can dredge up, and just generally doing what the left does best.  And it&#39;s annoying, really it is.  It is annoying and sickening to see, and I don&#39;t even care about Trump, but because the left hates him and is up to their old tricks, here I am put in a position where I am defending him.  Whatever, though.  Hopefully sooner or later the populace will get sick of this shit and start putting things back in order.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the left perspective we are being given a second chance to stop hitler before his rise to power. I think it&#39;s logical to take some slightly extremer methods in order to raise attention to the issue. I don&#39;t want him assasinated, but I want him to be exposed as an idiot who was given his fortune by his family (with nazi roots) and not actually made very much for himself aside from bad decisions and publicity stunts. He would be the buzzfeed reality TV version of a president, lowest common denominator shit right there.</p>
