<p>Firstly: Bernie was never going to win. For one thing, he&#39;s a rampant communist and everyone with sense in America knows this. For another, Hillary is the feminists&#39; dream girl at this point, so it&#39;s all aboard the bandwagon on the blue team for Hillary.</p>

Our country was built on lies and evil, we fucking committed genocide against the native Americans, the US has always been a fucking joke, like you bro. </p>

<p>Yes. People just like you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>haha you sound like a fucking loser.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Personal attack.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ever since Vietnam our government has been controlled by other countries/Israel</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And liberals going along with them pushing a liberal <del>communist</del> <em>socialist!</em> agenda.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>9/11 was a false flag</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it wasn&#39;t. Did we know about it in advance? Certainly. Did we do it to ourselves? No. Just like Pearl Harbor. Therefor, not a false flag.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>our government today is run by fucking war criminals and America could not be any worse today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It will if Hillary were to get elected, or Sanders. Obama just paved the way for more diversity-hire presidents. Hillary&#39;s big problem now is she&#39;s shitting bricks because she isn&#39;t being <em>given</em> the presidency for having a vagina, and her campaign is pretty much feeding her chill pills to keep her from going into a rage on camera about it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>from our racist legal system</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Crime stats don&#39;t lie. Blacks and minorities commit crimes at higher rates per their population group than whites. It&#39;s not racist to point this out, or to arrest and prosecute the people doing it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if you are rich you can pay to never go to prison</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not true, but it is <em>less likely</em> to go to prison if you&#39;re rich, mostly because you can afford better lawyers. This isn&#39;t racist, but it is class-ist if you&#39;re into that sort of communist ideology.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>to our high incarceration rates</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I reiterate, crime stats don&#39;t lie.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>our evil big pharma that kills </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This has little to do with the government and everything to do with corporations. The government doesn&#39;t <em>allow</em> them to do anything, they purchase laws from the government to allow them to do things.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>meanwhile marijuana is legal</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think you mean illegal. And it should remain illegal because drug users are, on the whole, degenerates.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>our shitty education (because we would rather spend billions on war than feeding and educating people) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is, again, due to your people. Liberal cucks pushing for bullshit like Common Core. It has nothing to do with war spending. We could <em>continue</em> spending money on the war and <em>still</em> allocate funds to education. You&#39;ve chosen not to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>then we have people so fucking ignorant like you who call Bernie a communist</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sanders <em>is</em> a communist. His &quot;socialism&quot; is communism in a pretty new dress, all made up and ready to go to prom with millennials like you, who didn&#39;t live through the Red Scare and who&#39;ve never been taught that <em>communalism does not work</em>. Communism, socialism, marxism--these things fail, time and time again. Every nation that has tried it large scale, beyond a few simply niceties like paying for roads, school, etc through taxes, has either failed economically (China) or Balkanized (USSR). But hey, keep thinking you&#39;re going to get something for nothing, because you failed first year economics and never bothered with political science.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our country was built on lies and evil, we fucking committed genocide against the native Americans</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is your white guilt speaking. You&#39;ve been indoctrinated, <em>by liberals</em>, into feeling <em>guilty</em> that you are descended from a proud race of conquerors--from a race who <em>put men on the moon</em> for fuck sake. Stand tall and be proud that you come from such good stock. Never let anyone tell you differently.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the US has always been a fucking joke.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, actually. We&#39;ve never been a joke and we&#39;re <em>still not a joke</em>. We are still the world&#39;s number one superpower. Admittedly, we are a dark shadow of our past glory at the moment and have been on the decline since the 60s (about the time the free love, pro-drug, pro-communist movements started up... in other words, Vietnam Era). We <em>will</em> make this country great again. With, or preferably <em>without</em>, people like you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a fucking joke, like you bro</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two personal attacks for the price of one post. Learn to debate without using this shitty tactic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, Hillary Clinton is going to beat Bernie Sanders fair and square, for obvious political reasons.</p>

<p>Sanders is a whackjob left-winger that is far out of step with the average American. He has no charisma and poor political instincts.</p>

<p>Bernie Bros are some of the most obnoxious, self-righteous and annoying &quot;social justice warrior&quot; types that turn off more people than they attract with their unhinged fanaticism.</p>

<p>Clinton is very popular among Black and Mestizo Democrats, because of her name recognition and her appeals to their interests.</p>

<p>Sure, Clinton is a criminal, war-mongering crook, but Democrats don&#39;t care.</p>
