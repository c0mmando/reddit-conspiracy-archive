       Copy-pasta of the wiki entry before it gets edited by paid shills:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The experiments were exported to Canada when the CIA recruited Scottish psychiatrist Donald Ewen Cameron, creator of the "psychic driving" concept, which the CIA found particularly interesting. Cameron had been hoping to correct schizophrenia by erasing existing memories and reprogramming the psyche. He commuted from Albany, New York, to Montreal every week to work at the Allan Memorial Institute of McGill University and was paid $69,000 from 1957 to 1964 to carry out MKUltra experiments there. These research funds were sent to Dr. Cameron by a CIA front organization, the Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology, and as shown in internal CIA documents, Dr. Cameron did not know that the money originated from the CIA.[43]
        <strong>
         In addition to LSD, Cameron also experimented with various paralytic drugs as well as electroconvulsive therapy at thirty to forty times the normal power. His "driving" experiments consisted of putting subjects into drug-induced coma for weeks at a time (up to three months in one case) while playing tape loops of noise or simple repetitive statements. His experiments were typically carried out on patients who had entered the institute for minor problems such as anxiety disorders and postpartum depression, many of whom suffered permanently from his actions.[44] His treatments resulted in victims' incontinence, amnesia, forgetting how to talk, forgetting their parents, and thinking their interrogators were their parents.[45]
        </strong>
        His work was inspired and paralleled by the British psychiatrist William Sargant at St Thomas' Hospital, London, and Belmont Hospital, Surrey, who was also involved in the Intelligence Services and who experimented extensively on his patients without their consent, causing similar long-term damage.[46]
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         It was during this era that Cameron became known worldwide as the first chairman of the World Psychiatric Association as well as president of the American and Canadian psychiatric associations. Cameron had also been a member of the Nuremberg medical tribunal in 1946â€“47.
        </strong>
        [47]
       </p>
       <p>
        Naomi Klein argues in her book The Shock Doctrine that Cameron's research and his contribution to the MKUltra project was actually not about mind control and brainwashing, but about designing "a scientifically based system for extracting information from 'resistant sources.' In other words, torture."[48] Alfred W. McCoy writes that "Stripped of its bizarre excesses, Dr. Cameron's experiments, building upon Donald O. Hebb's earlier breakthrough, laid the scientific foundation for the CIA's two-stage psychological torture method," which refers to first creating a state of disorientation in the subject, and then second creating a situation of "self-inflicted" discomfort in which the disoriented subject can alleviate their pain by capitulating.[49]

       False dichotomy between torture and mind control. Torture is used as a
       <em>
        tool
       </em>
       in mind control. The goal is not merely to "extract information" but to
       <em>
        plant
       </em>
       information, both in the form of knowledge and in personality.

       This is how mind control programming works. First you shatter the psyche through drugs, torture, and ritual abuse. It is like wiping and partitioning a hard drive. Then you "upload" the desired information, including safeguards (the "self inflicted discomforts") that keep the victim from breaking through the programming.
      </p>
      <p>
       VigilantCitizen.com covers this in detail. You can see this programming at work in mind control victims like BeyoncÃ©, Britney Spears, Miley Cyrus, and Lady Gaga. Occult imagery is all over their music videos, and on YouTube you can see footage of them "breaking character" and slipping between alternate personalities.

        Notwithstanding his high professional reputation, he has been criticized for his administration, without informed consent, of disproportionately intense electroshock therapy and experimental drugs, including LSD, which rendered some patients permanently comatose. Some of this work took place in the context of the Project MKUltra mind control program.[2]

       Morals and the hippocratic oath apparently went out the window for the cream of the crop when they were approached by the CIA. The CIA didn't get run-of-the-mill psychiatrists, they recruited the best in their field.

       Another scoundrel was Dr. Jose Delgado of Yale. He was famous for mind control using implanted electrodes, but he said he could eventually achieve all the same results using only EM waves. It's also worth noting that these are the people that wrote the DSM and put mental illnesses in it like, "Patient believes the government is beaming voices into their head."

       I wonder how the simpsons (like programming) factor into this. The TV reference comment response has more upvotes than the previously added links to documentation. We have allowed ourselves to be programmed by the TV; we respond more to the fantasy than the reality.

       Think about it,something as influencial as SIMPSONS left to chance?

       They thought of it as driving medical research forward, especially Cameron. The basic premise of physic driving was to erase ones memory completely and then you could eliminate there "disorders". And it worked too, one lady didn't remember a thing until she saw the hospital she was at in the newspaper for being connected to the cia. And then it finally clicked. She went on for years being a different person, probably not for the better , but it completely erased her former memory . And to Ewing Cameron. That was a success.

       Most of his victims didn't need to have their personalities completely erased and rebuilt. The weren't raving sociopaths, rather they had mundane psychological problems that he made exponentially worse.

       I think he knew he was doing evil, but justified it as the ends justify the means. The ends being, in this case, better mind control techniques than the Soviets- ready to be deployed on "real" bad guys should it ever come down to that.

       Really good movie, rated 100% on Rotten Tomato.  Based off Dr. Cameron and his victims from Canada.  It's worth it.
