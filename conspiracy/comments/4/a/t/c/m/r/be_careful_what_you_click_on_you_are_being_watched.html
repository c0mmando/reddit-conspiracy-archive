    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re rolling out a small change over the next couple of weeks that might otherwise be fairly unnoticeable: click events on outbound links on desktop. When a user goes to a subreddit listing page or their front page and clicks on a link, we&#39;ll register an event on the server side.
This will be useful for many reasons, but some examples:
Vote speed calculation: It&#39;s interesting to think about the delta between when a user clicks on a link and when they vote on it. (For example, an article vs an image). Previously we wouldn&#39;t have a good way of knowing how this happens.
Spam: We&#39;ll be able to track the impact of spammed links much better, and long term potentially put in some last-mile defenses against people clicking through to spam.
General stats, like click to vote ratio: How often are articles read vs voted upon? Are some articles voted on more than they are actually read? Why?
Click volume on links as you can imagine is pretty large, so we&#39;ll be rolling this out slowly so we can make sure we don&#39;t destroy our servers. We&#39;ll be starting off small, at about 1% of logged in traffic, and ramping up over the next few days.
Please let us know if you see anything odd happening when you click links over the next few days. Specifically, we&#39;ve added some logic to allow our event tracking to be accessible for only a certain amount of time to combat its possible use for spam. If you notice that you&#39;ll click on a link and not go where you intended to (say, to the comments page), that&#39;s helpful for us to know so that we can adjust this work. We&#39;d love to know if you encounter anything strange here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. I also found this explanation in a thread on <a href="/r/TheoryOfReddit">/r/TheoryOfReddit</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s worth noting that this isn&#39;t tracking general trends, but instead specifically linking user accounts to clicks on outbound links. That&#39;s a huge, huge difference. In the thread, they keep going back to the point of being able to implicitly / indirectly track self post clicks / entering the comments, but that&#39;s a wholly different thing from tracking which outbound links you click.</p>

<p>The problem is that, now, that data exists. It&#39;s the difference in, say, committing some small but offensive crime or social transgression, vs making a video of you doing the same thing and uploading it to YouTube. Once it hits the web, it&#39;s forever. And now every link you&#39;ve clicked is accessible to anybody who buys out or buys a significant stake in reddit in the future, or anybody who buys a stake in any of those companies, and so on down the line. Forever. Even if they super-duper-pinky-swear to use it responsibly, the mere existence of the data is a much greater transgression than they&#39;re trying to pretend. All it takes is somebody who didn&#39;t make that promise buying implicit access, and it&#39;s all over.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s any chance at all (and it&#39;s a pretty good chance) that your reddit account could be tied to your identity, and you ever click a link you wouldn&#39;t want people to know you&#39;d clicked, that&#39;s now a cloud hanging over your head indefinitely.</p>

<p>I mean. I&#39;ve been a fan of reddit for a long, long time. I&#39;m coming up on my 10 year badge in a few months, I&#39;ve had reddit gold subscription uninterrupted since before gold was a thing, but this might well be something I&#39;ll let it lapse over, and move away from using the site save a few communities. I wish I&#39;d seen this before I added more time a few days ago. I&#39;ve been willing to stay optimistic and positive about reddit over an awful lot of stuff, I&#39;ve never been the kind to get dramatic and say I&#39;m leaving over this or that little thing, but there&#39;s just no way to look past this.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a huge abuse of privacy, and they&#39;re flying it very much under the radar, and being super dodgy about the real implications and concerns brought up in that thread.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very alarming. </p>

<p>But there is something far worse like people mentally checking out because they woke up and can&#39;t stand the rotten reality anymore. Suddenly people only do what they &quot;need&quot; if at all than try their &quot;best&quot; to keep the ship floating.</p>

<p>More and more people ignore MSM is one syndrome which is a sign that the system&#39;s cohesion is failing.</p>

<p>And there&#39;s a solution. Use Tor and then create a new account. Use that account for a few days, delete. Change IP address, create new account, repeat. It&#39;s like 2 minutes of work every 3 days. The only problem would be this subreddit. They have automod set up to remove any comments/posts made by accounts less than 3 days old. You will just have to think ahead. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Soon anything you do will be in a data base some where. You may not be actively watched, but it will all be in a database available to be analyzed and scrutinized. Your smart electric meter can use algorithms to know what appliances you are using and when. Your water meter will soon have the same capabilities to know when you are taking a shower or flushing the toilet, &quot;too many times a day&quot;. Your car&#39;s black box computer knows when you are speeding, braking or accelerating or cornering too hard.   Your cell hone tracks your movements and know what apps and websites you use. Cortana, Siri, Facebook, and your TV all listen to everything you say. Cameras are every where on the streets and in buildings. your credit and debit card info can be used to know where you have been and what you have bought. We are all being watched. </p>
