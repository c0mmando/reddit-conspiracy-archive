        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In March 2011 Forbes estimated Donald Trump&#39;s net worth to be $2.7 billion, with a $60 million salary. Many praise and analyze his “success” as if it were self-made, and they fail to attribute the proper credit to others in society where it is deserved. Despite what Trump may espouse, his success would have been in no way possible without his father, the general public, and the US government. Unfortunately, Trump decided to forget or selectively ignore these truths while forming his political philosophy, a sentiment made particularly clear during his brief bid for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination.</p>

<p>Trump was born in New York City in 1946, the son of real estate tycoon Fred Trump. Fred Trump’s business success not only provided Donald Trump with a posh youth of private schools and economic security but eventually blessed him with an inheritance worth an estimated $40 million to $200 million. It is critical to note, however, that his father’s success, which granted Donald Trump such a great advantage, was enabled and buffered by governmental financing programs. In 1934, while struggling during the Great Depression, financing from the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) allowed Fred Trump to revive his business and begin building a multitude of homes in Brooklyn, selling at $6,000 apiece. Furthermore, throughout World War II, Fred Trump constructed FHA-backed housing for US naval personnel near major shipyards along the East Coast.</p>

<p>In 1974 Donald Trump became president of his father’s organization. During the 15 years following his ascension, he expanded and innovated the corporation, buying and branding buildings, golf courses, hotels, casinos, and other recreational facilities. In 1980 he established The Trump Organization to oversee all of his real estate operations.</p>

<p>Trump eventually found himself in serious financial trouble. In 1990, due to excessive leveraging, The Trump Organization revealed that it was $5 billion in debt ($8.8 billion by some estimates), with $1 billion personally guaranteed by Trump himself. The survival of the company was made possible only by a bailout pact agreed upon in August of that same year by some 70 banks, allowing Trump to defer on nearly $1 billion in debt, as well as to take out second and third mortgages on almost all of his properties. If it were not for the collective effort of all banks and parties involved in that 1990 deal, Trump’s business would have gone bankrupt and failed.</p>

<p>In 1995 Trump took Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts Inc. public and received a substantial financial boost from society and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations that enable the market to function. He initially sold 10 million shares at $14 per share and then in 1996 sold 13.25 million shares at $32.50 a share. This initial public offering granted Trump’s company a stability and legitimacy that would have been impossible without millions of people around the world trusting his organization and investing with the hope of shared success.</p>

<p>Despite the clear societal and governmental assistance described above, Trump continues to be outspoken in his criticism of government. In his book The America We Deserve, Trump explains that “the greatest threat to the American Dream is the idea that dreamers need close government scrutiny and control. Job one for us is to make sure the public sector does a limited job, and no more.” This quote proves to be particularly ironic when considering Trump’s feelings about eminent domain laws. He was quoted as saying, “I happen to agree with it 100 percent” when speaking of the 2005 Supreme Court decision on Kolo v. New London, which affirmed the government’s ability to transfer land from one private owner to another for the purpose of economic development in the area. In fact, Trump attempted to take advantage of eminent domain laws on multiple occasions, once even demanding that an elderly widow give up her home so that he could build a limousine parking lot.</p>

<p>Perhaps more disturbing than his hypocritical condemnation of the government is his failure to acknowledge anyone’s contributions, save his own, in the creation of his success. At the 2011 Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump made clear his feelings on the creation of his wealth: “Over the years I’ve participated in many battles and have really almost come out very, very victorious every single time. I’ve beaten many people and companies, and I’ve won many wars. I have fairly but intelligently earned many billions of dollars, which in a sense was both a scorecard and acknowledgment of my abilities.” Furthermore, Trump apparently sees no benefit in supporting taxes to maintain institutions such as the Securities and Exchange Commission to regulate the stock market, in which he publicly trades his company, or the court system, which actively protects his property rights: “We are the highest taxed nation—I would tax foreign countries that are ripping off the US and lower taxes for Americans.”</p>

<p>From the moment of his birth, Trump was set up for success. The large inheritance left to him by his father, coupled with the contributions and the protections of society and the US government made his ascension to the Forbes 400 list almost inevitable. Nevertheless, Trump fails to recognize this phenomenon and continues to express his belief that he did it alone.</p>

You think the criminal Bushes or Kennedy&#39;s, or Clintons had ever fucking made dime without using people? That&#39;s how the oligarchy class gets into power pretending like they earn honest money.   I hate Trumpacho but your stupid paste sounds exactly like Liberal media Puke of John Oliver&#39;s rant about Trump. Is everyone but Trump  exempt from scrutiny? Trump is just another sleazy business man but he&#39;s no worse than the rest of slimy criminals running for president. It&#39;s like the Dalai Lama, who ruled under a feudal slave system worst than Chinese communism pretending like he cares about democracy . There is no fucking point in searching for heroes among criminals. What is so relevant about this mans inflated ego selling himself like his cheap linen? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe in the hope and Change of puppets on a strings. Trump is sleazy asshole, he&#39;d sell his grandma to rub shoulders with money. But he is a peasant  in the scheme of money and power. He is just a joke, bread and circus for people. American business is not a meritocracy, I never implied it was. Bill Gate fucking IP lawyer father and how he stole from Xerox is proof of that too. American business beyond small business is giant web of oligarchy dominated wealth leeching off of corrupt government system in feedback loop of a sick symbiotic relationship. Real merit based big business doesn&#39;t exist in this system, it cant.</p>

<p>&quot;Donald Trump, The Devils Run for the Whitehouse&quot;
<a href="http://mindcontrolblackassassins.com/2015/08/19/donald-trump-the-devils-run-for-the-white-house/">http://mindcontrolblackassassins.com/2015/08/19/donald-trump-the-devils-run-for-the-white-house/</a></p>

<p>At these levels, not only are they all actors, but they are all in on the grand plan, and do as directed. We have nothing in common with the oligarchy, and we are treated merely as literal human resources, trading our life force energy for meaningless materials, and food and water which has been falsely sold as scarce.</p>

<p>We are all in transit, souls in vessels, and &#39;they&#39; do everything they can to have us focusing on the vessel and it&#39;s illusory comforts, than the passenger. The soul. The one thing that we all have, that which unites us and defines our divinity.</p>

<p>Fuck trump, the office of the president, and any one who participates in the ownership levels of the human plantation.</p>

<p>Voting is a charade.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is amazing is that none of the trump supporters or frankly, those who vote in general are addressing a few facts.</p>

<p>Trump nor any other &#39;candidate&#39; or future president will change the fact that so called &#39;white&#39; people will be the collective minority in 25 or so years. I personally do not care at all about this, but apparently trump voters do very much, see below.</p>

<p>Trump nor any other &#39;candidate&#39; or future president will have any ability to end the Federal Reserve Central Banking system which enslaved all Americans and the world with fiat- debt based theivery.</p>

<p>Trump nor any other &#39;candidate&#39; or future president will stop or in any way inhibit the global economic crash, elimination of the US dollars reserve currency status  or the move to a paperless one world currency.</p>

<p>What trump and the others WILL do is offer the mechanism of further division in their (either &#39;sides&#39;) brainwashed followers, leading to massive civil unrest.... by design.</p>

<p>Since when is a CT forum aligned with the minds of the polled and the would be masses? NEVER.</p>

<p>One must ask, given the nature of places like GLP especially, why do They, want you to want Trump?  They being the Tavistock  institute and it&#39;s stake holders, of course.</p>

<p>&quot;Trump is polarizing and reflecting the fear of the inevitable  the white move towards minority status IMHO.</p>

<p>This guy&#39;s too:</p>

<p>Kevin MacDonald </p>

<p>Donald Trump is the implicitly White candidate. One indication of this is that he is doing better in primaries where there is cross-over voting, implying that independents and Democrats, especially working-class Whites who have not already bailed on the party of Al Sharpton, La Raza, and the rest of the Rainbow Coalition, are attracted to his populist themes. In the most recent debate (March 10) Trump emphasized that he is drawing support from Democrats and independents in an effort to defuse Republican fears that he is appealing only to a very narrow base. </p>

<p>In effect Trump is expanding the White base of the GOP — to the point that pretty soon the only Whites voting Democrat will be college professors and the young SJWs who take them seriously. </p>

<p>The cross-over appeal of Trump will only be increased by the violent clashes between Trump supporters and protesters in Chicago (March 11). Most Whites will associate the opposition to Trump with last year&#39;s BLM and radical left riots and protests, like those in Ferguson, Baltimore, and numerous college campuses where speech that offends the left is routinely shouted down in a torrent of (often anti-White) hatred phrased as lofty moralism. The Chicago protesters looked like a combination of BLM protesters and Bernie Sanders-supporting, White SJWs — a combination that is likely to anger a very large swath of White America. I would be amazed if Trump did not benefit from this. </p>

<p>The implicit Whiteness of Trump&#39;s campaign is apparent in the results of a recent poll by two UMass researchers, Tatishe M. Nteta and Brian Schaffner showing that Whites are fearful of a majority-minority America — as well they should be given the bloody history of ethnic conflict throughout the ages (&quot;New poll shows Trump supporters more likely to fear majority-minority America&quot;). The poll 
directly measured Americans&#39; fear of the demographic change that is projected to make the United States a majority-minority nation by the year 2043. Recent work has found that white Americans, once told about this impending demographic shift, are more likely to identify with the Republican Party, to express conservative policy positions, and view themselves as conservatives.
This, of course, is further evidence of the racialization of American politics and the implicit Whiteness of identifying as a Republican and holding mainstream conservative views (see also my VDARE comment on the previous research cited by Nteta and Schaffner on what happens when you ask White people about being a minority: &quot;Diversity Is Strength! It&#39;s Also…Racially Polarizing Politics, Despite MSM Efforts To Lull Whites&quot;). The results fit well with the finding that an increasing percentage of Whites are voting Republican, around 1.5% in each presidential election cycle. </p>

<p>The percentage increase may be much higher with Donald Trump because he is stressing the most important implicit White issue, immigration, not to mention his many violations of political correctness, likely also an implicitly White issue.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.abeldanger.net/2016/03/chicago-protesters-reinforce-implicit.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+abeldanger%2FzWgH+%28Abel+Danger%29">http://www.abeldanger.net/2016/03/chicago-protesters-reinforce-implicit.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+abeldanger%2FzWgH+%28Abel+Danger%29</a></p>

<p>&quot;Specifically, the poll asked the following: </p>

<p>According to the U.S. Census Department, by 2043 African Americans, Latinos, and people of Asian descent will make up a majority of the population. In general, do you think that this is a good thing or bad thing for the nation? </p>

<p>Of the respondents who expressed an interest in voting in the Republican primary, just 6 percent saw the ascent of the minority population as a good thing, while 45 percent said it was a bad thing, and 49 percent said neither. Trump won the support of more than 60 percent of those who responded &quot;bad thing&quot; to this question. </p>

<p>The relationship between responses this question and Trump support persists even after accounting for a respondent&#39;s ideological affiliation, educational experiences, age and gender. Individuals who think the increase in the minority population is a bad thing are 20 percentage points more likely to support Trump than those who responded &quot;good thing&quot; or &quot;neither.&quot; </p>

<p>Of the respondents who expressed an interest in voting in the Republican primary, just 6 percent saw the ascent of the minority population as a good thing, while 45 percent said it was a bad thing, and 49 percent said neither. Trump won the support of more than 60 percent of those who responded &quot;bad thing&quot; to this question.</p>

<p>The authors cite other research on the characteristics of Trump voters: </p>

<p>A number of political scientists have found that those statements might actually be a key reason for his success. Support for Trump is highest among whites who expressethnocentric viewpoints, score high on measures of authoritarianism, identify strongly aswhite, and who express negative views of racial minorities.</p>

<p>I fully expect more violence as we get closer to the election. The effect of the 1965 immigration law — itself the result of a top-down process made possible by Jewish power as an elite rather than reflecting the attitudes of the majority — has been to create facts on the ground that make increased ethnic/racial conflict inevitable. Quite a few of the signs and the Mexican flags that were so obvious among the anti-Trump protesters reflect their interests in expanding their share of the US population.&quot;</p>

That can help in business, but it&#39;s not a guarantee. So, when OP says, his success is a myth, and he is basically set up for success and doesn&#39;t attribute said success to all the cogs in the wheel over the years, is a very child like/simplistic rationale. It&#39;s the mentality that it takes a village to raise the child, not the parents. It&#39;s collectivist drivel and very childish....</p>

<p>What&#39;s funny is Trump is literally the least intelligent candidate in our lifetime</p>

<p>He&#39;s actually very intelligent. It&#39;s unintelligent people who think that he&#39;s not. Self projection.</p>

<p>you align yourself with him</p>

<p>Not sure how you got that from what I&#39;ve said. FTR I&#39;m not for any one in the election.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe in the hope and Change of puppets on a strings. Trump is sleazy asshole, he&#39;d sell his grandma to rub shoulders with money. But he is a peasant  in the scheme of money and power. He is just a joke, bread and circus for people. American business is not a meritocracy, I never implied it was. Bill Gate fucking IP lawyer father and how he stole from Xerox is proof of that too. American business beyond small business is giant web of oligarchy dominated wealth leeching off of corrupt government system in feedback loop of a sick symbiotic relationship. Real merit based big business doesn&#39;t exist in this system, it cant.</p>
