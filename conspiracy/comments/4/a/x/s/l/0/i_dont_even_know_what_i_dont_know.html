<p><em>Great advice!</em></p>

<p>I&#39;ve found that Terence Mckenna really helped me think.  He helped me learn how to really deliberate on a topic, look at it from many angles and above all--doubt...even myself.  Even to doubt McKenna himself--he&#39;s giving you a key piece of info right there: be a doubter.  (ie: <em>doubt even this</em>)</p>

<p>First of all, listening to the podcasts of his archive I was fascinated by his perspective.  But then when I was reading about <em>him</em> I found many claiming he was a CIA agent.  So here was this smug but fascinating hipster drug-advocating philosophical gadfly from the 70s-90s, acting as the intelligent persons&#39; tim leary, but the whole time he was working for the spooks?  It was a tough pill to swallow.  </p>

<p>Especially since McKenna would have his folks believe that the incriminating statement was a &#39;flight of fancy&#39; whereing Mckenna was communicating with mushroom aliens---at some point we realize this guy is putting us on in big way, but part of his trickster personality is one in which a winking self-discrediting is happening.  On the one hand he&#39;s telling you he communicated with mushroom aliens who have some kind of &#39;agency&#39; for which he is an ambassador and spokesperson, and on the other hand he&#39;s telling you to &#39;wake up&#39;, &#39;think for yourself&#39; and &#39;be like Thomas the Doubter--doubt everything&#39;.  In other words, he was like a double agent, working in service to the people he lectured to, but speaking strictly in a code that only the most intelelligent and critically thinking would understand.  </p>

<p>In other words, the fact that he worked for the CIA is fairly provable, especially if you discount a 5 yr statute of limitations on drug trafficking which had expired through his covert, off-grid, 5yr wanderlust through east Asia.  It&#39;s provable through the laurel canyon cia psychedelic connection, Esalen group and all of McKenna&#39;s contemporaries and acidheads like Tim Leary, Alan Watts, Ram Dass, Robert Anton Wilson, etc.</p>

<p>It became clear over the course of some 500hrs of his talks, that he was trying to transmit this &#39;you cannot even trust me&#39; idea when he says a specific thing over and over: &quot;don&#39;t diddle the dose&quot;  I pondered this repeated koan, DDD is what I came to.  D cubed what&#39;s that about?  I thought of a perfect cube, a three dimensional differential, and escape manifold.  More than that, McKenna was saying &quot;don&#39;t take a responsible dose, go all in&quot;.  This is very bad advice.  In fact, it is <em>dangerous</em>.  Why would McKenna tell people to do something very dangerous....and were they smart enough to follow this advice?  </p>

<p>It was clear to me he was giving intentionally bad advice that is obvious to anyone who truly <em>does doubt and critically think</em>.  Why would he do that?  To discredit himself?  OOh....</p>

<p>Even still, and despite knowing this, listening to over 500 hours of McKenna has been fruitful.  I still listen to McKenna and value his words.  I am not going to rubbish the entire body of his work just because he was caught and in some way inculcated (a word he LOVED) into the nazi cult of the CIA because he wanted to be free and have a relationship with a mushroom...that was inhibited by an illegitimate government.</p>

I believe their money is older than that, as far back as the Holy Roman Empire, but it will be easier to find research materials starting in 1810ish I think.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what you mean by putting &quot;discovered&quot; in quotation marks. Zika was discovered as part of research into yellow fever at what was then called the Entebbe Virus Research Institute, founded by the Rockefeller Foundation in 1936. The <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0035-9203%2852%2990042-4">1952 paper that announced the discovery</a> describes how it was isolated from a monkey and directly from mosquitoes. It also mentions four other viruses that were first identified in the same research program: <a href="http://www.atcc.org/products/all/VR-87.aspx">Bunyamwera virus</a>, <a href="http://www.atcc.org/Products/All/VR-78.aspx">Ntaya virus</a>, <a href="http://www.atcc.org/products/all/VR-81.aspx">Uganda S virus</a>, and <a href="http://www.atcc.org/Products/All/VR-67.aspx">Semliki Forest virus</a>, as well as strains of already-known viruses including yellow fever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Rockefeller family are Rothschild agents in the United states, just as J.P. Morgan and Junius Morgan were. The Rockefeller family was Rockenfeller in Germany (Gotthard Rockenfeller, in the 16th Century). The Rochschild family can be just entry level searched back via the surface net to the 15th Century in Germany, to someone named Uri Feibesch (Fajsch) zu Bacharach (Bacharach). Tips of many icebergs. This is just the power shown to the public who are willing to dig.

<p>Neither of the Morgans were agents of the Rothschilds in the United States. August Belmont &amp; Company was the sole agent of the Rothschilds from 1837 to at least 1924, when August Belmont, Jr. died. Also, almost all of Junius Morgan&#39;s banking career was in London, where the Rothschilds represented themselves! J. P. Morgan certainly did business with the Rothschilds.</p>

<p>People have often suggested that there was some sort of connection between the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds, but without evidence.</p>

<p>This link alone can prove that Morgan was doing the work for the Rothschild octopus. If Belmont was the sole agent, what about Schiff? Did he just fund Marx and Engels by his own volition?</p>

<p>The ancestry comes into play because the Rockefeller purpose did not just begin with John D. Rockefeller Sr discovering he could refine oil in the 1800&#39;s. And the Rothschild family did not just come to make a few cutthroat investment choices to gain control of the finances of the British Empire. Their ambitions were spawned from somewhere. So you have to trace.</p>

<p>I was aware <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/43t5p8/zika_virus_is_property_of_rockefeller_foundation/czlltaf">six weeks ago</a> That Jordi Casals-Ariet, the <a href="http://yalemedicine.yale.edu/fw2004/features/capsule/52785/">great virologist</a>, deposited the virus sample in ATCC. That is <em>nothing</em> like a patent. Casals was sharing the virus with all other virus researchers in the world. Until last year, Zika was considered a very mild disease.</p>

<p>Thats like saying I own the patent for the flu or the common cold. I dont, I cant, and even if I theoretically could what would that even mean?</p>

<p>We cannot create or manufacture viruses. Viruses are not a design. Viruses are not IP. Viruses are fringe life forms composed of genetic material and proteins.</p>

<p>Uh, no. It&#39;s not semantics. Getting a <em>patent</em> on something you <em>invent</em> means that you have exclusive rights to it for a number of years.</p>

<p>Instead, Casals deposited a sample of the virus with the non-profit ATCC, which shares it at cost with researchers all over the world.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty much the <em>opposite</em> of a patent.</p>

<p>I attacked your premise that the Rothschild&#39;s own the patent on the Zika virus. </p>

<p>It was also false because you meant to say that a Rockefeller foundation funded organization discovered Zika.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything else that you said was acceptable, I have no quarrel with you my friend. </p>

<p>That being said, when you make an argument riddled with false premises people will not take it seriously. You cannot have a sound conclusion based on false premises. That DOES NOT MEAN that the conclusion itself is wrong. </p>

<p>Just because an argument is not sound, or contains fallacies, does not imply that it&#39;s conclusion is therefore false. I am telling you to learn about logic because it is the study of making indisputable arguments. It will only help you, and the spreading of information that you find important. Coherent, logical arguments are compelling arguments.</p>

<p>If we all agree that the premises are correct and sound, we can all agree that the conclusion is as well, using the operations of logic. Logic is the math of words and phrases. As long as you follow the rules and start with the correct information, you CANNOT be wrong.</p>

<p>Oh and arguing semantics is when we disagree about the meaning of an ambiguous word or phrase. There is nothing ambiguous about &quot;patent for Zika virus&quot; or &quot;Rothschild family.&quot; You were factually incorrect and refuse to admit it. </p>

<h2>I wanted to correct you because you make me look dumb for holding some similar beliefs about family powers in the world. After reading your post someone could easily see that the one recent piece of information you provided was indisputably false and then never consider the other possibilities that actually have hard evidence.</h2>

<p>Family wealth and power is obviously what runs the world. How could it not be? Is that not evolution and nature at work? Of course your family is more important to you that the people who produce the goods you need, I&#39;m pretty sure everyone would say this.</p>

<p>But all of the money in the world is not old money as you seem to think. Old money industry is disrupted all of the time and that is the creation of new huge powers that COULD threaten the old powers. That&#39;s why there are stocks and IPO&#39;s and that&#39;s why they were really created around the Gilded Age. The old money can bring you up to &quot;their tier&quot; if you let them double their money with you. If you refuse, it will be much harder to make, certainly much harder to join the tier - especially today.</p>

<p>They control the banks and manipulate the markets, but they didn&#39;t always have this global control of money. This is brand new.</p>

<p>Railroad magnates (Vanderbilt and friends, Carnegie) gained wealth in a few generations in America that rivaled the European banking/royal families. So did the oil magnates of a few decades later (Rockefeller and friends). This is not really disputable I don&#39;t think. Railroads and kerosene refining were cutting edge technologies that old money had absolutely no role in or control of at the outset. As were Henry Ford&#39;s car plants, and to a lesser extent Google&#39;s search engine, Facebook&#39;s whatever narcissistic service, etc. </p>

<p>Morgan&#39;s electricity nearly put Rockefeller&#39;s oil completely out of business. But they worked together with Ford to run cars on the waste &#39;gas&#39; that is produced from kerosene refinement. Each innovation was made to benefit those who already had access to wealth and power.</p>

<p>They learned long ago that it is much easier to invite these people into the power structure of money with open arms than to fight them. Rockefeller and Vanderbilt learned this before the turn of 1900, I believe. In this top sphere of society there are groups which are based on influence, wealth, and intelligence. </p>

<p>This allows new companies and new families to immediately become absurdly wealthy to the point of the top 500-1000 in the structure while being reliant on the others for different resources. There are really quiet trillionaires out there I would imagine.</p>

<p>You concede to this structure at the cost of increasing the existing structure&#39;s power. Every person who gets into the structure increases the power of those already inside.</p>

<p>Consumer technology 1000% disrupted the standing economy, banks and current power structure. But they were let in with massive IPOs and a nice bubble to pad everyone&#39;s bank account. That &#39;decentralized&#39; technology is all connected to the cloud and mining data now. The tech giants who didn&#39;t like it? Ousted by the shareholders, painted as crazy by the media. </p>

<p>New money can absolutely be had but it requires significant potential for disruption of the standing power structure. You are right that the bankers have their hands in all of it, but that is just inherent to the system that they created, they do not &#39;own&#39; these other people agents. </p>

<p>There are many agents who have the power to rebel and change the system, they don&#39;t because once you acquire that much wealth it is no longer in your interest to try and disrupt. Your family wealth is completely guaranteed and your influence ingrained by the time enough power has really been accumulated. </p>

<p>Take John Kerry for example, obviously comes from money and inherited millions. But as a young senator he hated war and was damn near a hippy who really wanted to fix Americas foreign policy blunders. These days, John Kerry supports foreign wars for our national interests while shorting the markets from insider Congressional knowledge. And he hasn&#39;t even come close to the money needed to enact real change, but he does have quite a position of influence.</p>

<p>The system has been intricately structured such that once a breakthrough technology arrives, it is used to the advantage of the status quo. Then by the time this family acquires the influence, power, think tanks (usually a few generations), and wealth (banking), they are far to vested in the system to change anything.
They believe the very ideas that they may not have bought into at the outside because THEY ARE THE ONES IN CHARGE NOW. When you are in charge, corporate welfare, expansion of the state, manipulation of the people can all be rationalized. Surely you know better than these people. You have been here ruling them for years.</p>

<p>You either die a hero, or live long enough to become the villain. Just ask the Kennedy&#39;s, haven&#39;t heard much from the one&#39;s that they let live.....</p>

<p>edit: Or they just think that the only way they really COULD change anything is by continuing to play the game, just on a much much longer term. Remember, we are talking about families, close-knit community and control NOT individual ideologies or even necessarily conscious decisions (although most certainly are).</p>
