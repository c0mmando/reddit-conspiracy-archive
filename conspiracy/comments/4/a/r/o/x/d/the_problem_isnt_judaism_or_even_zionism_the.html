       It’s not even the biblical Sephardic Jews that are the main problem.  It’s specifically Khazars - now known as Ashkenazi Jews - who adopted Judaism, pretty much hijacked it from the Sephardics, claimed it as their own, called themselves the “real” Jews, continued then committing all their marauding atrocities now behind the name of Judaism, and who now constitute the vast majority of Jews in the world (2/3s of all Jews).  The main thing they used the real, biblical, Sephardic Jews for was for being the fall guys for all the false flags that they could then use to create “the holocaust industry” with - an industry they now use as a blanket to hide all their genocidal atrocities behind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those hiding behind Judaism are indeed very much a problem on the planet - but I’m not sure the problem in and of itself is Judaism specifically and in particular.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s Khazars and Khazarism.

       you are probably right, but zionism to an extreme is Khazarism. so...
      </p>
      <p>
       i mean... let's face it:  "God" (aka. God™) absolutely did NOT grant any Right of Land to any Chosen People.  (pah-lease!)
      </p>
      <p>
       so yea... setting aside that fucking nonsense, i am NOT saying "Israel" doesn't have a Right to exist -- sure it does.  But current "zionist"  agenda (generally recognized) is to establish and secure
       <strong>
        <em>
         "the greater Israel"
        </em>
       </strong>
       (i.e., taking over the entire middle east - primarily for the Jews) -- which is just criminal on so many levels i really wouldn't even know where to begin.

       The trouble with your statement is that most of the land Jews now occupy and call Israel was stolen from Arabs in very recent times -- only a few decades ago. Israel itself was founded by terrorists, using terrorism. Innocent people were murdered by Jews to force Western powers to create Israel. Most of the past leaders of Israel have been terrorists. Israel is a criminal terrorist state.

       Correct and agreed - no more so than any land was granted to any other human or non-human anyway.

       Let's look at what we know for sure:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Ashkenazi Jews are genetically a lot more white than they are Semetic. Some of them look almost identical to white Christians. Some of them have blue eyes and blond hair, which you don't get with Semitics.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Ashkenazi Jews look down  upon Sephardic Jews and black Jews as a distinctly lower class.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Ashkenazi Jews are the ones running the media in the West. They run the Western banks and stock exchanges. And they run Israel -- all the highest political positions are filled by Ashkenazis.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So, whether or not Ashkenazis are Khazars or something else, they are not really Jews in a genetic sense. The real Jews, genetically speaking, are the Palestinians. Their ancestors stayed in Palestine after the Romans destroyed the Second Temple.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sephardic Jews are not the problem, and never have been a problem. It is the Ashkenazi "Jews" who never cease to scheme and plot and devise and plan against white Christians. And they are not even true Jews! They are some sort of historical abomination.

       What they do isn't about Christians only - white or otherwise.  It's not an afront to white Christianity only, so that group should not be specifically singled out any more than any other group.  It's an afront to everything and everyone that's not "Ashkenazi/Khazarian Jew".

       I see where you are coming from. It's not considered stylish to talk about Christians and Christianity, so if you want the criticism of Jews to stick, then apply it to a broader and more sympathetic base, and just refrain from mentioning Christianity, which so many Christians have been trained  to hate, without even realizing that they have been trained. You say it's an affront to everyone. Well, that's true. But the greatest foes of Jews have always been Christians. Jews sought to live among Christians because that's where the wealth and advantage were to be gained, but at the same time Jews hated Christians for the power we held over them. Right now the primary focus of educated Jews is the destruction of the white race. And the white race is Christian.

      <p>
       Christians have been trained to hate their own religion without even knowing it?  I can see a
       <em>
        certain
       </em>
       argument being made for that…but that statement kind of confuses me nonetheless, honestly.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I personally don’t feel one needs much of anything to make the criticism of Khazars stick other than simply tell the truth and show the facts.  Simple as that.  They’re a marauding people.  Facts show it simple enough regardless of who and what it’s applied to.  Again, just show the facts.

      <p>
       Although I understand part of what you’re saying from a historical, biblical context, I think a few Palestinian Arabs would definitely like a word with you.  Additionally, considering that A) The United States is one of the biggest centers of Christianity on the planet, and B) Khazarian Ashkenazis
       <em>
        own
       </em>
       the United States…I’m not sure it can much be said that Jews have all that much jealousy or hatred toward Christians in particular.  Again, they
       <em>
        own
       </em>
       them…them and “all the other goyim” as far as they’re concerned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying this should be the case.  It shouldn’t.  It’s an abomination as far as I feel.  However, it does indeed seem that Khazarian Ashkenazis have kind of overtaken the main centers of money and power in the US.  I wouldn’t say there’s any “hate” of the white race on their part.  Hell, if anything, Khazars
       <em>
        love
       </em>
       the white race and all the rest of the “goyim” along with it.  After all, without them, Ashkenazis wouldn’t have such an ample host to be parasites upon and feed off of.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s like saying humans “hate cows”.  Of course not.  Humans
       <em>
        love
       </em>
       cows…for food…to feed off of.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that’s how Khazars view humans who aren’t Khazars - regardless of whether they’re European or whatever non-Khazar race they happen to be.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

      <p>
       This seems to me to be like…a weird form of reverse and subtle (but still very strong) racism on the part of what seems to be a small but rather vocal minority of whites I’ve come across here (in this website) in that they rage against Jews, but only because they think “it’s all about
       <em>
        us whites!
       </em>
       Jews want to destroy
       <em>
        us
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        our
       </em>
       race!”
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s kind of…very strange really and I’m not sure what’s worse actually:  The harm Khazars cause everybody, or the insistence Europeans have (who Khazars, incidentally, often look practically
       <em>
        identical
       </em>
       to and indistinguishable from) in thinking that it’s “only
       <em>
        they”
       </em>
       who are being harmed by it or are being "harmed worse" than other races.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again,
       <em>
        everybody’s
       </em>
       being harmed, and, in all honesty, when Europeans try to make it about only them, it’s like they’re raising their hand in a classroom of children saying “Ooh ooh!  It’s
       <em>
        us
       </em>
       it’s
       <em>
        us!
       </em>
       WE’RE the ones that are getting it worse than everyone else!” and it’s, ironically-enough, very similar to the rather nefarious “crocodile tear whipping boy” game that
       <em>
        Ashkenazi Jews themselves
       </em>
       constantly play when they claim some sort of harm caused to them and constantly play the victim as a result.  “You’re being antisemitic to me and harming me!”
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, ironically, this ultimately makes the whites that play this same game no better than the Jews they criticize.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being mixed race, I have every genetic variant in me.  I even have some Ashkenazi blood, for that matter.  So I don’t actually have a dog in this fight.  I’m just pointing out what I’ve observed many times by some “white rights” types in this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems to kind of miss the point as far as I can see because, at the end of the day, Khazars seem willing to harm
       <em>
        anyone and everyone
       </em>
       who's not
       <em>
        them
       </em>

       Sephardic Jews collaborated with the Moors to enforce an alien occupation on the indigenous Europeans of Spain. It was only after the Spanish reconquista, when Jewish and Moorish occupiers were overthrown that Spain could flourish to become a truly great civilization and a world power.

       I'd say it was the Moors who occupied Spain, and the Jews went to serve the most powerful force, the Moors, as tax collectors and torturers, among other things. Two occupations the Jews were known for in Medieval times are tax collection and torture. The Jews themselves didn't have the power to occupy Spain.

       It’s not a “game” that’s being played.  It’s an understanding that should be had.  I’m not in any way excusing anything Jews have done.  Not in the least.  I am
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       against what they’re doing in Palestine.  However, independent of any of the “Freemasons” or “Vatican” statements that you made, the point is that you would do well to know
       <em>
        who
       </em>
       it is you’re vilifying and
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the thing and the point here:  It seems that
       <em>
        whatever
       </em>
       religion the early Khazarian king would have adopted would have ended up being similar to how things are now with Ashkenazi Judaism/Zionism.  The likelihood is that we would be vilifying Christianity or Islam or Buddhism or
       <em>
        whatever
       </em>
       religion the king would have adopted had he chosen any one of them
       <em>
        because it isn’t the religion itself
       </em>
       that’s entirely at fault here.  If it were, then we would find that a great deal of problems caused by “the Jews” would be caused just as much by Sephardic Jews as by Ashkenazi Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       And we don’t find that at all.  Such just is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       the case by any means.  This is not to say that Sephardics are free from any sort of wrong, but the overwhelming amount of problems are not caused by Sephardics.  They're caused by Ashkenazis.
      </p>
      <p>
       And who are Ashkenazis?  Non-biblical Khazars that long adopted and hijacked the religion of Judaism for the own nefarious purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       As such, the point here is that it doesn’t seem entirely correct to vilify Judaism itself as much as it should be the specific
       <em>
        brand
       </em>
       of Judaism practiced:  Khazarian Zionism.

       I believe you're correct.  Obviously not "every" Ashkenazi is "the worst marauder on Earth."  As a whole and as a group, however, it's the simple truth that Khazars have historically wreaked much,
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       havoc wherever they've gone.

       Are you saying you think Khazars come from Atlantis?  I don’t know enough about who the Atlanteans were to guesstimate anything in that area, but part of me feels that there’s

        no way

       Khazars could have been the ancient Atlanteans.

       It depends on how you frame the development of civilisation. Many people think the rise of agriculture in the fertile crescent was when things started getting good for us but the opposite can be true as well. The rise of agriculture saw us dominating the land, going against the natural flow, acquiring property, acquiring wealth, creating more unnatural order. The people who resisted the spread of this wealth and power were forced off the best land and had to retreat to less manageable land or up hillsides out of the fertile valleys. The Vedics have kind of become refugees at the highest points on the planet because their peaceful lifestyle was incompatible with the march of progress below.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, what did that agricultural revolution do to our gut biota? The rise of opportunistic bacteria like candida can infect our consciousnesses with their parasitic nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you looked into the bloodlines of Cain and Abel? Or enki and enlil? The Atlantans had reptilian DNA mixed with hominid DNA from the first genetic manipulations. Atlantis attracted the calamity because of their collective consciousness's negative alignment with their greed and arrogance.

       Wouldn’t doubt that.  I’ve come across various posts and videos where it’s said that humans have been tampered with by no less than 26+ ET species throughout the millennia.  Earth seems to be a big genetic experiment for emerging “intelligent” species.

       So Atlantis may have had a certain level of impressive technological development, but the inhabitants apparently didn’t have the requisite mental, emotional, and spiritual growth and evolution to be able to handle that formidable technology properly and responsibly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder what if any is the connection this has to Khazars.  I personally feel that it might not have all that much of a connection, honestly, but I also admit that perhaps I feel this way only because I prefer not to think that a race of humans as demonstrably evil and marauding as Khazars had any ancestry as Atlanteans.

       In the lost book for Enki and Gods of Eden, they say that one of the brothers who did the genetic manipulation was subordinate to his older brother or their king. He was ordered not to save his creations during the flood and let their be a reset of the Earth's species. He couldn't do that to his creations and so as most of the Atlanteans left as the comet approached, a bunch of opportunistic ones stayed and capitalized on using their knowledge to dominate. The Khazars practiced babylonian black magic, which is derived from the Kabbalah, which is derived from a holofractal understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently Enki passed down his knowledge to the Sumerians on the stone tablets, which caused some to form positively aligned secret custodians of this knowledge and others which used it for purposes of domination and control. Apparently he then traveled the globe and disseminated information to indigenous groups as Quetzacotal and the other mysterious emissaries from around the globe.

      <p>
       Enlil obeyed the galactic hierarchy with a certain insensitivity to us, while Enlil felt compassionate and defied the order. Yahweh and Lucifer.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Khazars can also be affected by higher dimensional entities themselves. Maybe they've got knowledge to make them a 4d consciousness but 6d demons are inhabiting them as they operate on powerful programs of domination and control.

       Yes.  Enlil was older than Enki, but Enki still ended up being the king because, although Enlil was older, he was the result of an adulterous relationship his father Anu had with someone who

        Apparently Enki passed down his knowledge to the Sumerians on the stone tablets, which caused some to form positively aligned secret custodians of this knowledge and others which used it for purposes of domination and control. Apparently he then traveled the globe and disseminated information to indigenous groups as Quetzacotal and the other mysterious emissaries from around the globe.

       Yep.  “God” and “Lucifer”.  Very strange because Enlil is “God” here and was ultimately a complete asshole to humanity (much like the “jealous, wrathful God” of the bible) - while Enki was “Satan/Lucifer” and was the character trying to give humanity knowledge.

       Yeah, I don't think they were the first either. Lemurians were before that and the Australian Aboriginal appears to have been existing in a biodynamic/permaculture existence for over a hundred thousand years. Aboriginal mitochondrial DNA has been found in the Tamils and in South Africa. It could well be that it was Australia that actually hosts the "first people".
      </p>

       Check out this little documentary series on youtube called Egyptians in Australia:

      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently the Egyptians were coming to consult with the indigenous folk here for spiritual guidance for tens of thousands of years. The Aboriginal people also have a Thoth like character and the oldest hieroglyphs found in Oz appear to be made by the Aboriginal folk themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to get real whacked out on Atlantis and Lemuria though, you should check out Andrew Bartzis' Galactic History. His claim is that he can read the Akashic records from a sacred neutral perspective and give a recount of all that's been going on over the years. It's fucking out there and goes for 8 hrs of interview, but if you understand the hidden hand stuff as you've demonstrated with your Venusian story, then it may help you to put a few pieces together.

       I sometimes wonder if all the strife that the African race has continued going through in recent history (past few hundred years plus) is a result of some sort of collective karma put on them because they were, perhaps, an immensely advanced and civilized culture on Earth many civilizations ago, but somehow lost their way and squandered their great technology, etc through vice, avarice, etc, etc…and now, all these millennia later, the race in general is having to bear the karmic consequences of having been the “technologically superior oppressor” all those many civilizations ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a random wondering on my part is all…

       I think the black strife comes down to Cain and Abel again. Cain killed his brother Abel because he was jealous, but God commanded those with the mark of Cain not to be harmed. The mark of Cain is thought by many to be black skin.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this collective Karma you talk about is perhaps that legacy from Cain but despite his "wrongdoings" blacks down the line are not to be harmed for it. Many people throughout the years missed that memo though, and all the wrong they've brought down upon them will be returned to them during the tribulation.

       I know. Hence they will be judged.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like if you are an immortal being who is observing everything, in order for there to be any thing to observe, there has to be a point of contrast within your field of view- Some shadow to create the theatrics which you observe.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you fragment yourself into two beings of light and dark, the shadow fragment embodies the shadow elements and the light elements embody the light elements. The same way a kid in a sand pit holds a toy in one hand that's the good guy and a toy in the other that's the bad guy, there is the same cosmic theater going on with the creator.
      </p>
      <p>
       The black's allow us to fear that they are different so that we can come to experience the joy as we realize we're not. It also allows for the filtering and processing of those elements within either side that fail to see the bigger picture, and they continue to be stuck in karmic cycles until the lessons become so simple that they finally understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did Edward Furlong want to go and beat down the actor that played the black kid that shot him in the end of American History X? It creates the illusion which illustrates the point, but afterwards the director would have kicked him off the set if he tried to fuck with the black kid for what he did to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Maybe Edward Norton would be the better analogy of the one to deliver the beat down since Furlong is dead like Abel.

       Yep.  Absolutely.  It's occurring on a cosmic scale and timeline, however, so even though
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       humans are feeling the effects, the process is one that takes various lifetimes to fully enter into.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's very related to
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuga">
        Yugas
       </a>
       .  We're just transitioning out of the worst, most difficult Yuga -
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali_Yuga">
        The Kali Yuga
       </a>
       - and entering into the next, more developed one -
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvapara_Yuga">
        The Dvapara Yuga
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       It ultimately all has to do with the different electro-magneto-gravitic (emg) effects that the planets and stellar objects in the cosmos have upon each other as they move through space.  It's similar to the effects that magnets have depending upon their proximity and distance to one another.
      </p>
      <p>
       All objects have their own emg charge, and we're surrounded by them constantly.  The closer or further we get to certain sources with strong emg charges, the more we ourselves and our
       <em>
        own
       </em>
       emg charges will be effected.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're basically entering a stage, as the planets and the solar system itself continues to move through the Milky Way galaxy itself, where the collective emg charges of
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       objects in and around the planet Earth are being significantly increasing in their energy levels.  So yes.  We are absolutely feeling the effects, and the ascension that is slowly happening is no accident at all.

       I think it's good to avoid absolutes. I find it hard to believe that there is ANYONE with absolutely zero fear of death. It could be the fear of death itself that brought the vibration of love into existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, I get the idea of Yugas and the electric universe but the ascension isn't slowly happening. It's only slowly happening if you're anchored to the material world. The more you shed those attachments the faster the process occurs. The more you begin to channel pure creation and express that and be bold in committing to the journey in love, the faster it occurs. If I don't talk to a friend in a month, I end up having 2 or 3 bombshells to drop on them about where I'm at. The process will happen at whatever pace you can allow it to happen.

       Well, I’m certainly not enamored with the

       of dying.  Death
       <em>

       <em>
        is
       </em>
       life after death, or there isn’t, right?  If there is, then there’s simply no such things as actual, physical death.  It doesn’t exist, and we don’t have to be afraid of death as any sort of “end” or anything of the sort.  If there isn’t “life after death” or any continuance of one’s intelligent identity after physical death, however? and once you die, that’s
       <em>
        it?

       Well then you

       don’t have anything to worry about because you won’t be around to enjoy or regret it anyway. lol

       Kind of a win win situation either way you look at it.

       life after death, B) karma (the
       <em>

       </em>
       kind, not the reddit kind)
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       exist, and C) you were such an asshole while alive that you end up in an even WORSE place than where you were while you were here in this physical life…but, in my case, as much of an asshole as I can be often enough, I know in my mind and heart that I’m working hard enough to try to be a good person, and that, after I’m done with this incarnation, I’m not worried about waking up in any sort of heinous, demonic place where I’ll be tortured “forever” and hung from hooks or whatever…
      </p>
      <p>

        on the WAY
       </em>
       to death.
      </p>
      <p>
       No fear of death itself, but, for example, dying because I got stabbed in some dark alley and now I’m slowly bleeding out as my intestines lie splattered on the ground in front of me?  Yeah.  That would
       <em>
        totally
       </em>
       suck.  I’d fear
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       kind of death for sure.  Dying as I’m being tortured in some internment camp of some sort and have people standing over me, electrocuting the nerves in my teeth or something as they keep me alive only so they can torture me some more?  Yeah.  Dying
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       way would suck.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s not an issue with death itself, however.  That’s all about what might be involved in the
       <em>
        process
       </em>
       of dying.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I could be assured a peaceful and painless death?

       Depends which scale you consider the dynamic in.  If you look around us and notice that people
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       waking up right now, then yeah.  It seems that the ascension is
       <em>
        speeding up
       </em>
       and happening NOW.  Yes.  However, if you look at things on a stellar and cosmic scale, then what’s happening to us right now that we
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       notice is only but the
       <em>
        tiniest
       </em>
       drop of a hint compared to where things are
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       going in the larger scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s said by some that we live in a binary star system, the star Sirius A being the sister star to the sun.  These two stars are said to be in heliocentric orbit around one another on a timeline of
       <em>
        millions
       </em>
       of years.  The perihelion (closest) and aphelion (furthest away) points of the stars’ orbits result in
       <em>
        massively
       </em>
       different effects upon not just the stars themselves, but upon the accompanying planetary bodies associated with each star that are caught in their gravitational fields.  Where in their respective paths the stars are determines what energy signature they and their accompanying planets (as well as all the beings and organisms living on those planets) have.

       If you look at
       <a href="http://oi41.tinypic.com/9r4rwy.jpg">
        this graph right here
       </a>
       and consider what I’ve just said with the timescales and years that we’re dealing with, then you’ll see that - while you are
       <em>
        in one sense
       </em>
       correct in saying that “the ascension isn’t slowly happening” (i.e. it’s happening
       <em>
        now
       </em>
       and some of us can indeed see and feel the effects around us already) - we are only just
       <em>
        beginning
       </em>
       to enter into the next age/epoch, and the real effects of the age haven’t even begun to start happening yet.  That’s still quite a few human lifetimes away from us still.

       See I'm afraid of the loss of potential. I feel extremely grateful of my lot in life and feel the divinity of it, but I'm now attached to what I have. I experienced a lot of loneliness before finding my wife and I'm afraid of experiencing that again (even though I now know we're supposed to be together) as you're born "tabula rasa" again. I'm afraid for my parents not being able to deal with it. I'm afraid that I am supposed to do something significant and that if I make a mistake and I die before I'm actually supposed to, that will haunt me or I'll have to redo all the work again. I know if some external factor gets me, then it's meant to be, but if I die as a result of my own mistake, then I didn't pass the test.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well yes, it takes hundreds of thousands of years from this perspective, but from another perspective, it's already happened. As we wake up to our 5 or 6d selves, this entropic reality breaks down and we realize there is only the immortal now and we've simply been sleeping and dreaming some 5d dream.

       We're getting squeezed through the eye of the needle and that eye is the aperture of the universe. The shadow that's kicked up now, will be the kabuki theater for the rest of the universe. The etheric impressions people project as they undergo their lessons until they realize that they need to reflect instead will travel forward and back in spacetime through entanglement to be the original embodiment of those memes.

       Good for you with your partner. I've only been with mine since August (we lived together as friends for a year and half first) but we got married in October and are expecting a kid in September. It's been the an amazing journey already and I think it's the best way to learn about yourself and be held to shed more and more layers of fear.

       I think I understand this.  Perhaps it might have to do with one’s personal feeling about their lot in life coupled with their thoughts about the “afterlife”.  If they think they’re in pretty good standing here on Earth or are in
       <em>
        great
       </em>
       shape (financially, physically, etc), then perhaps the prospect of
       <em>
        losing
       </em>
       those things would indeed be problematic or foreboding - especially if one also happens to think that there is nothing else in existence for one’s personal identity once this physical life expires.  I’d imagine it’d be
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       problematic under those circumstances.  If one “loves” their current life, but they also have a really strong sense of going to “an even better place” afterward, then I suppose you could have a person who loves this life but who also has no fear of death.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my case I don’t personally feel my lot is all
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       great in this life (“Could be a lot better”, “Could be a lot worse”, kind of thing), and I also happen to feel that, as I said before, either there
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       be something after (in which case I think it won’t be worse than what I’m going through now) or there
       <em>
        won’t
       </em>
       be anything afterward (in which case I won’t be around to worry about the loss of this relatively shitty life as it stands) so that’s all good too.
      </p>
      <p>
       The good thing about this seemingly dismal situation is that, as I said before, it makes me have pretty much zero worry or fear about death…at all.

       Ahhh.  Yeah.  I can definitely understand that.  I have worked hard and consciously to

It may seem like I might be “attached” to how shitty I feel it is…but I’d say it’s an “attachment” that I’ll be REALLY ready to drop and be done with the moment I’m done here.  I’ve been working consciously to not be attached to the
       <em>
        good
       </em>
       that’s happened in this life is what I really mean.  I feel it’s been only passing and fleeting anyway, so I don’t feel there’s been a great deal in this life to hold strongly on to anyway.

      <p>
       Very interesting though because, based on this sentence here, it seems you no longer have that feeling of loneliness…and that seems like a
       <em>
        good
       </em>
       thing, no?  It seems like your wife has brought you pretty darn good solace, no?  If that’s the case, then that’s very good.  Honestly, I’d absolutely
       <em>
        love
       </em>
       to find that
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       solace.  But, alas, I don’t think that’s the lot of this life - much as I thought about it growing up.
      </p>
      <p>
       My partner encompasses a dynamic of
       <em>
        work
       </em>
       - not so much a dynamic of “love”, so to speak.  There’s definitely good things that can come out of such a dynamic (focus, discipline, work-ethic, etc), but - even though I
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       feel like I’m a bit of a stronger, more disciplined person than before - I still, like most people I would imagine, would prefer to just exist in a situation of “blissful love”.  Oh well.  Not in this life, I guess.  :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Like you said about your wife, I feel that I “know” I’m “supposed” to be with my partner.  It’s an assignment though; one I’ve committed to and that, to be sure, is indeed being fulfilled…but I consider the situation more of an assignment and “work” than some sort of “blissful love meant-to-be soulmate”.  lol

       Since I have a certain feeling that, like Einstein said, “God does not play dice with the universe.” I don’t think that A) you’re going to pass up an opportunity to do something you’re
       <em>
        supposed
       </em>
       to do.  And if you do? then I don’t think that B) you won’t get the continued opportunity to do “it” (whatever “it” is) over and over again in life after life until you finally
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       do it and
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       get “it” done.  As such, I personally don’t think there’s all
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       much to worry about in the area of “not doing what you’re supposed to do.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe I’m just saying that because I might be the walking epitome of letting things I was “supposed” to do pass me by. lol  I don’t know.  Honestly, I don’t
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       feel that, as I feel I am indeed doing what I’m
       <em>
        supposed
       </em>
       to be doing…but, given that I’m not very successful at it
       <em>
        at all

       at this point (at least not financially), and I spend most of my time just kind of lounging around typing on Reddit (lol…jesus), perhaps I
       <em>

       just a mass of wasted potential and opportunity. lol  Oh well.

       If it’s a mistake that happens as you’re focusing and still trying your very best, however, then I’m not sure it can be said that you “didn’t pass the test”.

       I should point out that though I mentioned I have these fears, they're not anything really. They're just thoughts that sometimes pop into my head or I'm intuitively aware of but they are in no way prohibitive from me enjoying anything. Which is what I meant when I try to avoid absolutes. Life is a process of overcoming those fears and acquiring power through those struggles. I just feel I'd be losing myself a little if I said I didn't have these fears to a slight degree.

       Not trying to compare but it's interesting you said your relationship feels like work. Mine feels like play. Sometimes you have misunderstandings and that causes you to remember your differences but most of the time I'm just amazed with how we are actually one. It really feels like divine union and we get people coming up telling us how honoured they are to witness our love.
      </p>
      <p>
       My friend told me and I believe it, when you get the masculine and feminine energies truly and completely balanced in yourself, wherever you are in the universe, your divine union will appear right next to you and you will become a star together.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you can super impose the phallic and the challic energies, the fusion in that relationship is so potent you will attract the highest good reality around you.

       That’s great.  Honestly.  I mean that.  I’m glad about that and wish I was in a state in this life where I had that kind of relationship as well.

       Awesome.  I feel I have a pretty decent understanding that we are one…but, in my case, I apply that to
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       in existence and just understand that we get tasked to help one another in different ways throughout our incarnations.  Sometimes those ways are blissful and “wonderful” and full of cheer and laughter…and sometimes those ways involve work and effort and focus and determination.  Both ways have their benefits and good points, and, of course, they’re not mutually exclusive.  I much prefer the former (cheer) than the latter (work), but I also know that there’s a lot that can get done and gained via the latter method.
      </p>
      <p>
       It can perhaps be a bit like being a parent - which, at this point, you are about to
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       find out about. :)  There’s care and love for the child, of course, but there’s also a
       <em>
        looot
       </em>
       of just…
       <em>
        WORK
       </em>
       and often, drudgery, and yelling and crying and screaming (from the kid…and the parents sometimes), and wiping smelly, shit-filled asses, and dealing with recalcitrance from a new personality that has its stages and phases in life.  Lots of frustration sometimes, but, as a parent, one has a responsibility and, if one is worth their weight in salt at all or have any real honor in them, then one is still going to comply with their responsibilities and hopefully, at the end of one’s days, you’ll will be able to say that you helped raise a decent, competent human being.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not saying my partner is a “child” and I’m “the parent”.  Far from it actually, as - professionally-speaking anyway - she’s actually far more accomplished than I am at this point.  However, our personalities and life experiences are such that there’s a lot of “teaching and learning” that comprises the relationship.

       Very interesting.  I wouldn’t doubt that there is much truth in that.

       I find that there may also be some incarnations where a major theme involves simply
       <em>
        working
       </em>
       and addressing one’s karmic responsibilities in that way, and a good deal of development can occur by simply being able to move forward in such a manner.

       That's true, but how spiritually intelligent are they if they seek to dominate and control? Are they really a genius if they're getting half their genius revelation fed to them by higher up entities and then claiming it as their own?

       It's one thing to be "smart" and have a bit of intellectual aptitude.  It's quite another thing to be
       <em>
        wise
       </em>
       .  Khazars might be "smart", but they don't seem to have anywhere near the emotional maturity necessary to posses the level of wisdom needed to keep from harming and killing others.  At the end of the day, that's not the kind of "genius" you want.  It's an m.o. that will eventually come back and turn on you.

       The spirits inhabiting them might be wise though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember in the hidden hand, many of these beings incarnated are doing this out of love. Because they come from such a pedigree, there may only be a couple of beings that are incarnated here but they are then fragmented among all the khazars. This fragmentation may diminish their capacity to operate out of love and give very profound lessons for the fleshy versions of themselves as they come back to love.

       I wouldn’t be surprised if the spirits inhabiting them are the ones that
       <em>
        aren’t
       </em>
       wise.  It’s the spirit that gives wisdom - the physical brain that gives intellectual intelligence/IQ.  Perhaps their brains and/or their culture are such that a focus on intelligence exists…but it seems that their spirits are such that they
       <em>
        use
       </em>
       that intelligence to harm others that are not like them.  This is a mark of
       <em>
        lack
       </em>
       of wisdom.

       Ah! Good for you, understanding that a distinction
       <em>

       exist. A ton of people don’t want to believe that. Here’s the thing, then. Since we must define Christianity as a specific set of behaviors, lack of adherence thereto is heresy and therefore not Christianity, we must do the same with Judaism.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what is “Judaism”? Technically, by the historical understanding, it doesn’t exist anymore. Judaism as practiced by Judeans followed the Torah as law and spread the “talmud” as the oral teachings of the rabbis, never written down. After their expulsion from the Holy Land in 70 AD, the Talmud got written down because the diaspora didn’t want to collapse to sectarianism.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Judaism” today is Talmudism. The Talmud is the only holy book. They don’t even believe in the Torah at all. And so we must judge based on what the Talmud says.

       It really has to be one or the other. In the same what that catholicism isn’t Christianity, either Talmudic judaism is actually Judaism or it isn’t. Even the orthodox jews believe the Talmud.

       Of course.  The unfortunate truth, and a great deal of the very point I’m making here is, however, that Khazars have, again,
       <em>
        hijacked
       </em>
       Judaism in such a manner that they have dictated what type of practice and interpretation of Judaism is and is not heresy.  As such, while what they do and have done is absolutely heretic to Judaism, they have used their marauding influence to convince most of the world that what they’re practicing is in fact “Judaism in its truest sense” - when very little could be further form the truth.

       That's not the point.  The point is that most people are spending all their time vilifying the religion when it's not the religion itself that should be vilified.  It's a section of practitioners that are using it in a particular manner.

      </p>
      <p>
       It is no accident that all the major world religions are this negative and corrosive to real development and evolution.
       <a href="http://www.whale.to/c/Gods_of_Eden_Bramley.pdf">
        This was done on purpose.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       However, if you go deeper than just the major "MSM" type of thinking, even a quick, cursory study alone of, for example,
       <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=jainism">
        Jainism
       </a>
       will show that you are ultimately singularly incorrect in saying that "all religion is the enemy".  Jainism is a strain of religious, philosophical thought whose basic tenets go
       <em>
        far
       </em>
       away from being "the enemy", and humanity in general would do well to practice and imbue its basic precepts.  Within the context of making sure and protecting and defending ourselves from violence, I would say that the basic tenets of peacefulness and doing no harm that Jainism espouses seem to be what we should all follow.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would most
       <em>
        definitely
       </em>
       not look upon any school of thought that urges
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       peace and unity as being "the enemy".  I know all the other major world religions
       <em>
        say
       </em>
       they "urge peace", but we all know this is only evil lip service and in actual practice, more harm and death and killing and violence and evil have been done in the name of these "religions of peace" than in all other forms of violence on this planet combined.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's an insane statistic when you think about it - and, for that reason, I do understand your general feeling that "all religion is the enemy".  Yes.  It certainly seems that way, and I would say a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of religion actually
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       "the enemy" in the sense that much of it serves to keep humanity dumb, violent, and ignorant more than anything.  However, there are tiny, hidden strains here and there that have fallen between the cracks of coercion on this planet that have survived and that are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       the enemy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jainism seems to be one of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's all.

       eastern religions in general emphasize the god within, and in general I agree with much of what they teach. I mean animism gets a little absurd, as humans and animals are in no way equivalent, and to dig even further, the mystery schools have lots of valid information, yet it has been suppressed and abused by a small minority of our population.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is even the abrahamic faiths teach god is within, you just have to read the words for yourself and not rely on anothers interpretation of the texts. The whole point of "religion"(the spiritual aspect, not the organized clusters of humans practicing it) is to remember we are all divine and within us is all we need to create our heaven.

       I agree with you - and it is for this reason that I don’t feel that “all” religion is the enemy.  It is a teaching that has been most definitely obscured, watered down, and twisted into an almost unrecognizable visage of its true form, but it can be a helpful crutch that one can use temporarily to help keep one from falling and completely losing their way until they can begin to walk on their own.
      </p>
      <p>
       I look at most religion more as “training wheels for developing souls”.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point of training wheels, of course, is to eventually get you
       <em>
        off
       </em>
       of them and be able to ride
       <em>
        on your own WITHOUT them
       </em>
       , however, and too many of us remain stuck in old teachings without ever evolving out of them in our life.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s another topic altogether, however, so I’ll stop there for now.

       As above so below in the cosmos as on earth there is a hierarchy. Nothing Ive read or been presented has lead me to believe an animals life is worth as much as  humans. Like all of natures bounty, they are here for our sustenance, e.g plants are sentient as well, and indeed they eat animals(check the soil nutrients and fertilizer labels for bone marrow) just as decaying animals in nature nourish the soil. The hypocrisy regarding animal rights is not only prevalent, but I concluded is also a part of a plot to get us to debase ourselves and draw a false equivalency to animals, thereby further alienating us from the divinity within.

       Humans are food to many others and are regularly murdered and used as such.  I wonder if you’d use the same logic as you did above on yourself if you were to meet up with a being significantly superior to you.  I wonder if you would willingly prostrate yourself before them, lay your neck bare, and gladly give yourself up as a willing sacrifice to them - knowing that you are, after all, the “lesser” of the two and, according to your logic, they would therefore have the “right” to murder you and use you in whatever way they see fit.

       With this type of thinking, people drive themselves further and further away every moment from realizing that divinity is in everything - human and non-human.  As such, they ensure that they’ll move further and further away from the realization of the divinity within.

      <p>
       And sadly, through no fault of your own, the programming has worked, you believe that animals are divine. Only humans possess a fragment of what we'll call "creator" for simplicities sake. Thats why "demons" and lower vibrational entities don't possess animals, they have nothing the "demons" covet.

       The problem isn't even Jews or Khazarism.  Before the Mexicans, before the Jews, there was the IRISH.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Irish arrived like Mexicans and polluted like filthy dogs, lowering the standards of human hygiene, lowering the standards of the King's English, lowering the standards of European culture, lowering the standards of American culture, lowering the standards of societal cohabitation, and by this method, lowering the standards of Americans in accepting ALL multiculturalism INCLUDING Jews and Mexicans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because Americans were so beaten down into accepting &amp; tolerating Irish, their standards were weakened for later immigrant atrocities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Potatoes are a nightshade, they're not even a vegetable.  Catholicism is the origin of SJW vermin.  SJWism didn't even come from Jews, it came from Catholics, and from pig Irish vermin.  You can tell who's Mexican, who's black, and you can tell who's Jew.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        But you can't tell who's IRISH because they "pass."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       The insidious truth is that the IRISH are the source of the problem.

       In the bigger picture, “It’s just a ride.” like Bill Hicks says.  Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the here and now, things can get pretty complicated, however.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps that’s part of the point of the ride...
