        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I had an account on reddit a little over a year ago that dissapeared. I am new to this whole conspiracy side of things, however, the last posting I made was on this thread and it suddenly was gone and I was unable to login to my account. I shrugged it off as rules I unknowingly violated and stopped going on reddit all together.</p>

<p>Yesterday I decided &quot;what the hell?!&quot; And made a new account. I remember new accounts aren&#39;t really popular around here, but if you guys would be so kind as to help out!</p>

<p>I&#39;m curious about government take over and the One World Government and have read a bit but if you guys could help educate me a bit that would be awesome!</p>

<p>For clarification, I&#39;m interested in all sorts of conspiracies. I&#39;ve been reading about the shootings lately as well! So if you&#39;re passionate about any conspiracy in particular I&#39;d love to learn a new point of view.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem too chipper to be willing to accept the truth. That’s just my impression.</p>

<p>People come to the truth–<em>this</em> particular truth–because they’re broken. Because the world has beaten them down by behaving in a way that seems unnatural to them and they have nowhere else to turn.</p>

<p>The truth–objective truth–is something that rejects what we’ve been told to believe nearly since birth. It affects our view of society, economics, and governance. It’s all connected, and it all came together relatively recently, in the grand scheme of things. But it’s so fundamentally different from what we’ve been told to believe (and what the majority will want to believe) that you’re going to be ostracized for it if you’re not careful about it.</p>

<p>All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being self-evident.
<strong>– Arthur Schopenhauer</strong></p>

<p>We’re still at one and two. We <em>will</em> be until a societal collapse of some sort. That would have to be instigated. An economic collapse, however, is inevitable and fast approaching, and that would cause a societal collapse.</p>

<p>The point is to reeducate as many people as possible before that happens, because if we don’t they’ll just ‘vote’ for their own genocide, thinking it immortality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The takeover will be by the international banks and the international corporations.</p>

<p>The international banks I refer to are the Bank for International Settlements, (BIS), The International Monetary Fund (IMF),and the World Bank. who together have just made great progress towards forming a world wide monopoly on the creation of money. The middle eastern countries that had independent central banks able to compete in the creation of money, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya Syria and Iran, have, all but two been converted to debt slavery to the western central banks  and their independent  banks have been for the most part taken over.  Syria has been destroyed in order to force them into debt slavery to the BIS, the IMF and the World Bank.  When Syria borrows money to rebuild itself they will automatically become beholden to the monopoly cartel. Thus only Iran and North Korea along with a couple of relatively tiny countries,  will retain their independence at that point.</p>

<p>When Iran and  North Korea have their independent central banks added to the control of the monopoly leaving only a couple of tiny nations like Somalia,  still independent,  those nations will give in to the world cartel and the &#39;war on terror&#39; will be over.</p>

<p>The central banks will come out from the relative shadows and declare themselves the world rulers that they already are. Then they, with the help of the international mega conglomerate corporations will become the international  center of power  and  nations like yours and mine will simply give up their sovereignty and  become local jurisdictions. Money beats all competition, even military.</p>

<p>The acts of complicity by the various governments with this overall plot are true treason but in what kind of court are we to get that  verdict? </p>

<p>The creation of money is the true superpower of the world and by creating a monopoly they gain a strong enough hold on power to just declare themselves the rulers of the world. the New World Order will begin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMHO, if we cannot prevent it from happening, it will last until there is a global event capable of ending (almost) all of humanity, especially once one considers the technological power that countries and corporations currently wield.</p>

<p>An example of these events: large asteroid/comet, record breaking X class solar flare, supervolcano, ect. Something that would eliminate enough electronics, food, water, ect for the commoners to be able to break the hold of the elite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I know you are likely genuinely looking for answers, you are doing it wrong. If you ask, as you have, for a narrative, that is what you will be given, though this is not what you truly want. Seek for truth and you will find it. Do not accept the dogma platters offered to you, instead take the time to chew each idea around for yourself, maybe swallow it for a time, vomit it back up and chew the cud, see how that tastes. Trust your own senses and sensibility and form your own narrative through your own involvement in the process of your own becoming. Seek and keep seeking and ye shall find the truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I will say that there&#39;s a lot of cross training for riot control, crowd suppression, locking down entire square miles of city in a period of a few hours to set up relief centers. </p>

<p>The ploy is that these situational response simulations are for private company assistance for FEMA and other relief agencies when dealing with large events like terrorist attacks and whatnot. After all, private contractors are just hired guns for DOD and DHS contracts.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a certain amount of ammunition, supplies and armaments kept on hand for drilling. However, the stockpiling continues.  According to the older guys, we haven&#39;t had this much on hand since initial contracts went out for overseas deployment. It&#39;s slightly concerning but again, maybe I&#39;m reading too much into it.</p>
