    <div class="md"><p>Here is the study: <a href="http://www.jbc.org/content/87/3/651.full.pdf">http://www.jbc.org/content/87/3/651.full.pdf</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Two normal men volunteered to live solely on meat for one
year, which gave us an unusual opportunity of studying the
effects of this diet. The term “meat,” as used by us, included
both the lean and the fat portions of animals. The subjects
derived most of their calories from fat and the diet was quite
different from what one, who uses the term “meat” as including
chiefly lean muscle, would expect. Rubner (1) called attention
to the fact that a man cannot live on meat alone because of the physical limitation of the apparatus of mastication. He was evidently
considering only lean meat as fat offers little difficulty.
It is well known that the Eskimos have lived on an almost exclusive
meat diet for generat.ions. Certain explorers in the North
also have subsisted for long periods on meat. Dr. Vilhjalmur
Stefansson in particular has demonstrated that it is feasible for
travelers in the arctic region to “live off the country,” which
means living on meat alone. The experiences of Stefansson and
his companions have been given in his book “The Friendly Arctic”
(2). He spent over 11 years in arctic exploration, during 9 years
of which he lived almost exclusively on meat. Stimulated by this
experience, Stefansson and Andersen, the latter a member of one
of the expeditions, voluntarily agreed to eat nothing but meat for
1 year while they continued their usual activities in the temperate
climate of New York.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually no, I have an amazing non-feminist fit healthy girlfriend who has her masters in bioscience. My suggestion is that we make women more like men rather than vise versa, and by that I mean give them more steak and help them build some testosterone, which reduce their <a href="https://zerocarbzen.com/tag/menstrual-pain/">period pains</a> which also make them more attractive women like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/annanystrom/?hl=en">Anna Nystrom</a></p>

<p>It will make them also more right wing, more capitalist, which will lead to more competition in the market place, less government, more freedom, more logical and less emotional, more science, and thus more advancement, so we can fix global warming, replace our body parts with bionic body parts so we can become immortal and evolve ourselves as per 2001 space odyssey series.</p>

<p>Hopefully we still aren&#39;t teaching the next generation of women to be: quiet until spoken to, ladylike, polite, coy, indirect - saying: don&#39;t get dirty, muscles are masculine and a bad thing; making fun of them for being smart and liking science and math; or tying their worth and status to sex appeal starting at a young age; etc. Tomboys in the south have a rough time growing up. </p>

My wife eats steak on day 1 of her period, it lasts 3 days max and then fades quickly.  !!! .. You struck a chord when I read that! You had me at short periods, the longer I have to wait to get some the worse my life is. I doubt many redditors are banging hot blondes and eating steak to shorten period cycles. I be they live in fear of a relationship or any life practice which emboldens masculinity. We are dinosaurs. Have you drove in traffic in the last twenty years? People are pussyfoot Pansy&#39;s.

Many consumers are aware that animals used for meat and dairy are commonly supplemented with synthetic growth hormones, but what they don’t consider is that animal flesh and cow milk also contain their own naturally occurring estrogen— and this is true even of “grass-fed” and “organic” animals. Furthermore, meat, dairy and eggs all contain phytoestrogens; they are pervasive in our food, both plant and animal-derived, and you are not avoiding them entirely by avoiding soy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>cholesterol is not bad for you, its actually good for you. Cholesterol plugging your arteries is bad for you and this is cause by inflammation and scoring of the arterial walls. The leading cause of  inflammation and scoring is processed salt (table salt). Table salt is mined and bleached so it looks white and pure, but it is 30% silica (tiny glass particles) that get absorbed into your blood stream.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve pretty much come to the same conclusion about women voting, too. This isn&#39;t meant as a slight to women at all. The problem is as you stated. Women <em>on average</em> have a whole bunch of concerns to deal with. When faced with a difficult choice they will most often pick safety over some intangible ideal. So what happens is the female vote ends up creating a society where saftey trumps liberty and high risk actions. But in order to advance as a people and a species, we do need to take risks, and we need the freedom to do so. No pain, no gain, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Capitalism rewards risk, those who take the risk of starting a business and become successful by bringing a good product to the market get rewarded for it.   The more capitalist a nation is the faster it advances. Socialism holds men back by trying to make them equal and feminized (risk-averse).</p>

<p>When risk averse people vote, they&#39;re going to vote for a risk averse government (socialism), estrogen makes you risk averse and testosterone makes you a risk taker.</p>

<p>aggressive traits so that they become leftists</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sorry but you&#39;re completely incorrect.  They are being entrained into authoritarianism and fascism, which is neither left nor right.  It&#39;s a description of how people behave with regard to information and influence.  Trump is evidence to the contrary of what you&#39;re saying.  The dem party is imploding.  dems i know (former dem here / ultraleftist) are for sanders.  I&#39;ve been to sanders things and everyone there is nice.  You go to a trump rally and well...you&#39;ve seen the videos.  </p>

<p>The aggressive thing...it&#39;s not on the left, it&#39;s on the right.  but more to the point, it&#39;s from stupid people.  And by stupid people, I mean authoritarians.  People who think it&#39;s cool to cough up 15k for a noisy american made motorbike so that they have at least one thing going for them after they turn 40, when you don&#39;t have abs or hobbies or the ability to talk to girls as equals and without fear and with humor and ...well personality generally.</p>

<p>People <em>are</em> being dumbed down, but that&#39;s all of society, not just men.  </p>

<p>Society is also valuing the manner of speaking as in demeanor and rapidity and eloquence of speech, but not the content contained therein.  So loquacious  females are rewarded in all areas over men, and this is translating into &quot;girls are doing better in college&quot;.  Being able to articulate ideas is a very important skill but the problem is that men excel at spacial manipulations and problem solving over articulation (males more mechanically and logically oriented, females more language oriented).  So instead of the education system trying to pair males and females up so reap the benefits of their gender skillsets, they create a gender-adversarial environment and push this idea that women &gt; men and it&#39;s clearly not so.  Men still excel at STEM stuff...so why is this downplayed?  As an IT person, I&#39;ve met very few women in the field.  Those I have met have been extremely talented, but they are few.  So how is it that they are better than men exactly?  I mean let&#39;s pull out all the stops, men and stop making websites.  Then with no websites they won&#39;t be able to post reports about how well women are doing in school. That will show em!</p>

<p>Anyway, my point is that OP needs to look up the frankfurt school, read about what&#39;s actually happening and realize that a lot of what we read is sensationalized drek and propaganda from obama&#39;s ministry of truth.  There is no truth in it.  Trust your own experience.  Don&#39;t start spouting off on liberals because that sounds like the dagum unabomber when you do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Institute was founded, thanks to a donation by Felix Weil in 1923, with the aim of developing Marxist studies in Germany. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s all I need to know. </p>

<p>You need to learn that man is driven by incentives. Nature gives man incentive through the use of pleasure and pain. Man chases pleasure and runs away from pain. This is what drives evolution.</p>

<p>Capitalism fits nicely ontop of the natural order of things, it directly aligns with the pleasure and pain system of nature but on a social level. If the market likes the value you offer, it rewards you. If the market doesn&#39;t like what you have to offer, it punishes you. </p>

<p>Getting rid of the free market will remove incentive for people to compete and advance, and evolve. Socialism retards men, and Capitalism evolves men.</p>
