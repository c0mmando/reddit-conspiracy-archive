    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, mate. Ditto. I believe it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve seen the doc you linked to, cannot remember exactly what was in it (seen too many docs), but both are theories and honestly I&#39;m not sure if the truth will ever been known. But, I just linked this to OP in another comment. It&#39;s a short 8 min run down of the Jesuit angle: <a href="https://youtu.be/G_dCQ8I6tSU">https://youtu.be/G_dCQ8I6tSU</a>, if you&#39;re interested.

    <div class="md"><p>You really want to know? When forbes gives you the richest 100 people in the world, do you really believe that is the richest 100? Of course it isn&#39;t. Why? Because if the plebeians realized just how rich these ultra-ultra-ultra-ultra-rich are, there would be riots on the streets. It is orders of magnitude larger than what they tell you, estimated to be in the trillions. Their wealth is so massive that they wouldn&#39;t be able to give you an accurate estimate, because their wealth is on the scale of nations. What is a nation worth? What is a life worth? If you live in America your birth certificate is an asset traded on stock exchange. When America went into chapter 11, it ended up selling its assets to the bankers. What are the assets of a nation? The labor of it&#39;s people. </p>

<p>When you talk about the Rothschilds or the Rockefellers, you are speaking of the people who imagineers of our current world. You are talking about the people who plan everything, 95% of the world&#39;s media are owned by 6 media companies, and every song you hear, every book you read, every website you browse is edited and sculpted by those who don&#39;t have your welfare at heart. By those who want to influence you to betray your humanity and to be a consumer above all else. These families are beyond wealthy. Wealth is owning a lot of property and other valuable assets. What these people are is another level though, they own the governments that print the money. Do you understand the magnitude of wealth and power we are speaking about here? These people used to meet in the shadows, but they have become increasingly nonchalant in their onerous behavior. They no longer even try to hide the fact that they completely run everything from the ground up. We see this in American politics more than anywhere else, where the corruption is so blatantly obvious it would be dishonest to even call it hidden. </p>

<p>So that is why we hate them. They send us into unnecessary wars to spill blood of the innocent so they can earn a buck, they poison us in our food, our drugs, our water, they saturate the airwaves with propaganda, making our culture nothing more than a consumer paradise. They have distilled this process into a science, and it takes the life out of life. They are vampires sucking the life-force from every edge of the world, and you wouldn&#39;t be that insane to think they are gods for how they have swindled 6 billion people from their life&#39;s work. But, they are not gods. They are mortal, and one day we will have our revenge. </p>
