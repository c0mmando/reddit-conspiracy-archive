       Here is the number 1 question that nothing but flat earth can explain.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the planet is rotating at 1000MPH, how come there is no evidence of it influencing anything off the ground?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you take a plane from Africa to the Philippines that arrives in 5 hours, why the fuck does it also take 5 hours to go from the Philippines to Africa?
      </p>
      <p>
       I asked my friend majoring in astrophysics and he took a while to Google this cause it shocked him so much and he at first tried explaining that the plane going with the rotation would be going 1300mph while the other one would be going 700 mph. Which is absolutely bullshit lmao. The one going against the rotation would be going -700 mph. But he could not explain why all flights around the world take the same time going back and forth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another excuse he googled was that the atmosphere moves along with the earth's rotation and that still doesn't explain why planes all take the same time back and forth. I also call bullshit on that atmosphere theory since there's no evidence of it moving anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hot air balloons and weather balloons actually do not move far from their point of release depending on the wind.

       I'm not a physicist, but I'll use an analogy that I think will work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever ride on a school bus?  If the bus is moving at 60 MPH and you jump absolutely straight up, does the bus move under you?  Would you land in the same spot you jumped from, or would you end up losing your place, and moving backward relative to the bus?
      </p>
      <p>
       You would stay in the same place.  The bus is moving at 60 MPH, and so are YOU.  You're moving WITH the bus.  Same goes for planes, and same goes for planes flying around the planet Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW, planes do NOT take the same amount of time at the same speed to go from East to West as they do from West to East.  Your entire assumption is wrong from the onset.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a teeny bit of information as to why:

       It's really hard to explain something to someone who doesn't even have a rudimentary grasp of basic physics.  But good for you for trying.  You may also want to try
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1sjlu3/how_much_does_centrifugal_force_generated_by_the/">
        centrifugal force
       </a>

       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_of_Earth">
        force of gravity
       </a>
       but that might be too advanced.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT : btw the bus explanation is great.  Using that concept in the plane scenario where the plane is travelling against rotation of the earth---that means that when the plane took off from the ground it was already travelling 1000mph backward relative to space
      </p>
      <p>
       The plane has to first overcome the first 1000mph backwards rotation in the relative context to be working with the rotation of the earth.
      </p>

       I feel like I'm wasting my life explaining this

       Pull up a directions panel from say, San Franciso to Washington, and flights is one of the options for transfer modes. You can easily reverse the direction and see that there are differences in flight time.

       You want the "Washington" that lies to the east of San Francisco. The city, Washington in the District of Columbia, not the state of Washington.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will find the differential lies only on E/W flights, not on N/S ones like you tested.

       I have great news for you. I watched throught the video and he makes claims that the direct SYD to SCL flight doesn't happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, it looks like you can buy that
       <a href="http://imgur.com/Ks55x3Z">
        ticket
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       You can easily test to falsify the flat Earth theory by going and taking that flight . If you can take that flight, FE is falsified.

       How the fuck can you post a video to back your ass up and then admit that you didn't even watch the fucking video?
      </p>
      <p>
       The guy could have said "Just kidding about all this. Also, I like shoving pineapples up my ass." and you wouldn't even fucking know. Then you bitch about the guy not giving you a time stamp on the video YOU FUCKING POSTED. You've gotta be trolling. This is embarrassing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: and then you said "and don't provide (evidence, I assume) when asked. Reported"
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat earthers thrive on not having to provide evidence. If you actually watch the videos you provided for "evidence" you'd realize the theory is fucking bullshit.

       Yes, it would still work. If you jump straight up on the roof of a moving train, you only land a few feet behind your initial starting point. The only thing pushing you back is air resistance/wind. There's no air in space.

       If they're thrown from inside the bus, it won't matter what direction you throw it.

       I feel like you've never personally tested these common sense examples you're using.  Jumping while on a moving object should have been the clearest giveaway.  Like you can jump on an airplane and not get smacked by the back of the plane as soon as your legs leave the ground.  Why?  Because objects in motion tend to stay in motion.

       Haha wtf. Take a liquid and let it float in space. What shape does it take? Any liquid. You pick. Molten nickel. Water. Piss. Pepsi Max. Let it float in space. What shape does it take?
      </p>
      <p>
       Throw a million different combinations of liquid and let it go in the zero gravity of space. What shape does it take?
      </p>
      <p>
       A sphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we also learned that the bigger the mass the bigger the gravity. So even solids and gasses would get pulled together to form.... you guessed it  spheres.
      </p>
      <p>
       At what fucking point would it ever float around flat?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or is all that footage of astronauts playing with liquid fakes?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now borrow a telescope from a friend. A decent $49.99 walmart  telescope will do. Find Mars. Or Venus. Or the moon. Fuck, look directly in the sun with it  what shape are they?
      </p>
      <p>
       A circle. Now imagine them in a 3D space. What's a circle in 3D?... yea buddy, you're right. A sphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or are the other planets and moon and sun photoshopped into the sky by the government?
      </p>
      <p>
       No. So if surrounding planets and moons and stars and suns are spheres floating in space.... why would the Earth be? Are we special? No.
      </p>
      <p>
       The earth isn't flat. Stop being stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       No.
      </p>
      <p>
       Use your brain for a second and you'll see how fucking stupid flat earthers are.

       Oh what a surprise! I link you to a video showing the Earth from the ISS and you call it fake! Who in the world could've seen that one coming!?
      </p>
      <p>
       The ISS is far too big and sturdy to be launched into space as it. It would break apart due to the stresses involved with rocket launches. It was launched piece by piece and assembled in orbit. There's probably some videos/images of the actual launches that lifted pieces of the ISS kicking about somewhere, but for reference just look at any rocket launch. Please see
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHkY3FusJIQ">
        this video
       </a>
       to understand how the pieces were put together.

       How about when you can see the ISS through a telescope? Do they just string it up from the dome?
      </p>
      <p>
       The dude in that video comes up with some fucking stupid bullshit about Chris Hadfield crossing his legs and says it's because he his abs are too weak to support himself upright in a harness? Jesus christ give me a fucking break, that's just some bullshit he made up to try and convince himself it's fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a bit where he says that the video must be filmed on a zero-g plane because the astronauts are grabbing handles to stabilise themselves like you do in zero-g on a plane. Well no fucking shit, it's probably pretty annoying when you're trying to talk to the camera and you're just spinning around randomly, of course you'd fucking grab something to keep yourself more or less still. The mental gymnastics are fucking real, see in Rio!
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a bit where he talks about detaching exercise machines so they don't make the station shake, but they'll happily push off walls and things, that actually makes perfect sense. A person floating into or pushing off a wall at a low speed doesn't really make much of an impulse. The problem comes from repetitive movements like running a treadmill or moving weights up in down, this oscillation is transferred to the station. Imagine you're in a rowboat, if you lean over to one side, the boat might move a bit but it's not going to go crazy. Now, if you rock side to side repeatedly the boat will also start to rock more and more. Same sort of thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's talking about some santa model floating around, and the girl catches it and he's like "Oh she looks a bit embarrassed like she messed up", when here face literally doesn't fucking change. He's also talking about how the astronauts seem overly happy in videos, well of course they would be, people don't make videos for public consumption where they're just moping around and looking glum, because people would just be put off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, he talks about how water and air are recycled on the space station, as if it's somehow impossible to filter or distill out waste from water (hint: we do it all the fucking time with sewage) or remove carbon dioxides and recycle the oxygen back. He says it couldn't be done because it's clearly impossible to restock the ISS with replacement parts. It's not like you could ever possibly put those things on a rocket and launch them up along with food and water, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, I'm fucking done here. Eric Dubay is a fucking moron, he'll say whatever he can possibly think of just to try to bend his mind around his premade conceptions that the Earth is flat and so on, when even with the slightest working knowledge you can see that all he says is utter fucking bullshit.

       The only way earth could be flat and have gravity is if earth was accelerating constantly upwards at 9.8m/s
       <sup>
        2.

       Earth has been around for billions of years which means we would be today, going way faster than light... This makes absolutely no sense.

       Have you ever been in a very long elevator?
At first you feel it accelerate. You feel yourself kind of pushed harder against the floor. Then it reaches "cruising" speed and all that is left is actual earth gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if you deny that earth is a sphere, it means you deny the force of attraction that would make it a sphere, and therefore you deny the force of gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
       If earth was at cruising speed through the universe, there would be no gravity. It needs to accelerate. Just like the elevator.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there's also my other argument about what happens when you reach the end of the flat earth.

       I just explained it. It's the principle of the elevator. The only way you can create the effect of gravity is via acceleration. In a fast car, when you accelerate, you feel yourself pinned to the seat. The car "creates" "gravity" towards the seat. But if it stops accelerating, even if it's going 500mph, you won't feel the force pinning you to the seat again.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's literally basic physics man.

       If you put a napkin on your hand and spin around, the napkin would stay on your hand. Why would you need to accelerate to create an illusory feeling of gravity?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even our gravity is constant.

       Try that with something rigid that doesn't curve over your hand.

       And why would we need to accelerate? Because that's just how it is! It's basic physics.

       of which there are tons because even if ONE can't be debunked, well, there are people orbiting the planet in zero G. Sorry. Here's an easy one. Explain to me how they can appear to be in zero G for over 20 minutes. I bet you'll change the subject.

       No they don't actually. They see the same constellations in different orientations.
      </p>
      <p>
       A person from the northern hemisphere would look at Orion in perfect orientation while people in the south would see it in reverse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know that we are on a planet spinning 1000 mph yet the stars never change 24/7/365? We see the same stars everyday that never change no matter what. How do you think the ancient vikings of yore were able to navigate using the north star without ever taking into account curvature of the earth? This method of navigating would never work on a round earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you watch the video in the OP?
      </p>
      <p>
       And of course the sun never sets, since we are tiny human beings we can never see it with our own limited eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is footage of the sun never setting. And why people think they see different stars. But again stars never change.

       Where you, and the maker of that video, seem to have gone wrong is you don't truly appreciate the scale. The Sun is unimaginably large and 93 million miles away, the stars are millions of times further away.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter how far the earth moves or how fast it is nothing compared to the distance between us and the stars you see in the sky. It appears that we are stationary when you look at them because we move so little compared to how far away they are we might as well be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also Vikings didn't navigate by the North star alone, they use a number of things to understand where they were going.

       And, also the moon never looks like it's right next to the clouds. You can make out depth and 3D features on clouds, the moon never looks like more than a flat image.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at the moon and clouds and think they look like they are close together then I seriously think you might need your eyes tested because you might lack depth perception.

       Wrong again, and that video is totally wrong. The closer you get to the equator, the closer to the horizon Polaris gets. This is something that has been known for over 2000 years.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Actually, it is not. It just has the same temperature all year round, due to being at a neutral point in regards to the angle of the ground to the sun.
      </p>
      <p>
       The hottest places on earth, are found
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       23.27° (accurate inclination of the earth) north and south of the equator. Wikipedia provides a
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropics#/media/File:World_map_indicating_tropics_and_subtropics.png">
        handy image
       </a>
       where you can see the hottest places line up nicely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, there not
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       point at the tropic of cancer/capricorn is the hottest relative to his neighbours, but that is to various other factors, such as ocean currents.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        How is it winter time when we are closest to the sun by 3 million miles?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Because the influence of the distance to the sun is negligible relatively to the influence of the angle of the sun.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me illustrate this to you:
      </p>
      <p>
       At it's closest point, the earth is ~0.98 AU (for reference, 1 AU = ~1.5 * 10
       <sup>
        8
       </sup>
       km = ~93 million miles) from the sun away and it's farthest it's ~1.02 AU away.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference in power received from the sun (according to the inverse square law) is (1.02
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       - 0.98
       <sup>
        2)
       </sup>
       / 0.98
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       = ~8%, meaning we receive about 8% more power from the sun when we are closer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, let's say you are at 30° northern latitude.
      </p>
      <p>
       The angle to the sun is then in summer 30° - 23.27° = 6.73°, which then translates to receiving ~99% of the power per area we would receive at 0° angle to the sun (or, more accurate) 0° angle between the normal of the ground and the direction to the sun).
      </p>
      <p>
       In winter the angle to the sun is then 30° + 23.27° = 53.27°, which then likewise translates to receiving ~60% of the power per area.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference in angle makes a whopping 65% more energy received per area in summer compared to winter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Q.E.D.: The difference in distance to the sun is negligible compared to the difference in angle.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Also, how does the Flat Earth Model account for the seasons in the southern hemisphere being exactly opposite that of the northern?)

      <p>
       Imagine a sphere on which top you are sitting, and imagine it rotating. You can see the whole horizon all the time, right? Right. If you don't think you can, I urge you to find a big sphere and look around you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now tilt that sphere a bit. The horizon from which you tilted away vanishes behind the horizon of the sphere (if it is big enough or you tilt far enough). The horizon you tilted
       <em>
        towards
       </em>
       however you can still see.
      </p>
      <p>
       Put the sun there. You can still see it. It's very basic three dimensional geometry, shouldn't be that hard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now sit on the equator of the rotating sphere, and imagine the rotation axis being an actual physical axis that extends to infinity. As long as you stay on the upper half of the sphere, you will always be able to see part of the upper axis. The north star is kinda similar, as it is approximately infinitely far away and very close to the axis of rotation. You also cannot see it on the southern hemisphere.

      <p>
       They do. Every wondered why the paths of planes are curved on maps? That's because they follow the shortest distance between to points on a sphere (the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance">

      <p>
       A gyroscope has nothing to do with up and down. It is simply a tool to measure rotation.
      </p>
      <p>
       A mechanical gyroscope usually does this by having a rotating object, which will hold it's rotation axis independently from outside rotation.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, we can observe the rotation of the earth with this.

      <p>
       Most of this has already been answered in the point above, so I'll only shortly explain why the poles are cold. It's very simply explained with the principles I already laid out further up: The poles are always at least 90° - 23.27° = 66.73° inclined, and thus
       <em>
        at most
       </em>
       receive ~40% of the energy per area from the sun (relative to 0° sun inclination, yada yada).

      <p>
       Also simply not true. There have been observations of satellites (in any situation where they could be seen). However, the average satellite is
       <em>
        much, much
       </em>
       smaller than the moon, and thus usually not perceivable by the naked eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can however regularly see bigger objects (even with the naked eye, if I'm not mistaken here) such as the ISS in the night sky. With the naked eye you will only see a not very bright dot drift by, but with good telescopes you can make actual images.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have a good telescope, you can make photos of satellites (though even with very good equipment still blurry), as [some italians](

       I would disagree.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I have sadly never seen a ship disappearing behind the horizon myself (I live quite far from the sea and can't really visit the sea or a suitably large body of water on a whim), I have seen dozens of image which show that exact phenomenon (though, most of them are very blurry due atmospheric distortions and/or shitty cameras).
      </p>
      <p>
       There might be some effect of ships lingering longer than they should in view, due to atmospheric refraction, but eventually the ship will disappear.

       One thing which shows the effect of the earths curvature rather nicely is

      <p>
       How does FE explain two hemispheres with different star trails? (Northern Hemisphere has polaris in thr middlr and rotates clockwise while south has polaris somewhere else and rotates the other way). That is the current hardest question I found on this thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what the star trails look like in the equator. You can see both and a mini one in the middle.

       I guess a video of a launch all the way to the moon would suffice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Too bad NASA accidentally deleted the original footage directed by Kubrick.  One of the biggest discrepancy for the landing footage is how close the earth is. The moon is supposedly 13 earths away yet it sees the Earth like it's a few thousand miles away. And another thing.  There were no stars.

       Ok, I get it. You're in middle school, maybe a high school freshman, trying to make "#cool" and "#edgy" comments. Take at least one high school level physics class and you'll understand why you're wrong here.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example: a plane leaves the ground going say, 1,100 mph relative to the ground. It leaves the ground in the same direction as the rotation of the earth. This means that relative to a fixed, unmoving point at the center of the earth, the plane is moving at a velocity of 2,100 mph. If the plane was moving opposite the direction of the rotation of the earth, it would be moving at 1,000 mph relative to the fixed point mentioned above. Why do we never really see things like this happening? Because nothing moves at 1,100 mph on the surface of the earth. This occurs because the linear velocity of the surface of the earth is added to the linear velocity of the plane while it is on the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       This answers your question about why those flights take the same amount of time: if the plane takes off with the rotation of the earth, then the plane is moving at a speed of 1,100 mph in relationship to the ground. Now, if the plane takes off against the rotation of the ground, the plane is moving at a speed of 100 mph in relation to the fixed point, the ground is moving at a speed of 1000 mph in relationship to the fixed point, and together, the plane is moving at a speed of 1,100 mph in relationship to the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       This can all be learned from a precalc course (angular momentum, linear momentum, linear velocity, simple introduction to vectors) and a physics course (multiple velocity vectors add together, an ability to visualize concepts).

       Because the atmosphere is moving at a similar speed.  plus or minus a couple of miles per hour.
      </p>
      <p>
       To illustrate. You are driving at 85 mph with your air conditioner on  and a fly is buzzing around you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does the  fly get splattered against the back window because the car is traveling at a speed that would tear the fly's wings off??
      </p>
      <p>
       Does that fly have to go 85 miles an hour to keep up with the car?
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer is no he doesn't because the atmosphere inside the car is also traveling at 85 mph. so the fly can just drift about with no undue effort.

       Exactly. Much like trying to jump in a free fall elevator to save your life. Can't be done because you're moving every bit as fast as the elevator . Even if you jumped 3 feet you'd still be moving at free fall speed.

       Have you ever actually done it? If you have then you would know it falls straight down and lands at the same point in the bus from where it was dropped. No evidence we give you will satisfy you as you will just say it's been modified so please go get in your car, jump on a high way, set cruise control to a safe speed, and start dropping shit to see if it falls to the ground or launches out your back window.

       That's not how the laws of physics work. A general rule of relativity (not special relativity, don't worry) is that if you aren't accelerating, there is no
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       way to prove that you're actually moving, physics-wise. A non-accelerating car and everything in it going 85mph will do the exact same things as a standstill car would do.

       That's literally what happens. Are you trying to warp reality by saying that balloons are not pushed to the back in a moving car? How the hell do you deny reality? A balloon just like a plane is not affected by the car or ground.

         In an accelerating car, a balloon will actually move to the front of the car because the balloon is of a lower density than the air. There are plenty of youtube videos of this phenomenon in action.

         I'm not talking about Einstein's theory of relativity, I'm talking about an idea that was popular many years before his time. The idea that inside a perfectly smooth train with no windows and no acceleration, you couldn't actually tell whether you were going 0 or 3,000 mph relative to the earth. That idea wasn't proposed by a jew, if that makes it more credible to you.
        </p>

         Let me repeat that thing above. One of the key rules of
         <em>
          newtonian
         </em>
         physics is that
         <strong>
          there is no experiment that you can perform inside a closed system to find your velocity, velocity only exists when compared to the movement of something else
         </strong>
         . If you could determine your velocity by letting a balloon go in your windowed car you would violate all of the work of Newton.

       Sure if the initial acceleration would because the air in the balloon is resting, but right after the balloon would move back from then on. Those same youtube videos show this too.

       Except the car isn't just the surface, it's also the atmosphere. The atmosphere moves with the earth, just like the air in the car moves with the car. Therefore, a plane traveling relative to the earth and atmosphere system will go 700mph in any direction, nomatter how fast the earth/car is moving.

       Go to the southern hemisphere. Look at the night sky. On a flat Earth, you'd see the same stars no matter where you were looking from. The southern hemisphere has a completely set of stars visible which straight up would not exist on a flat earth under a dome.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sun cannot set on a flat Earth. If the Sun is ~40 miles across and 3000 miles high, even at the furthest point on it's circle away from you (i.e. when it should be set), it would still be ~13 degrees above the horizon and have an angular diameter of ~0.15 degrees, well above the human resolution limit of ~0.02 degrees. The Sun would absolutely be visible at all points during the course of it's movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       We also know that the Sun doesn't just move in a small circle above us because we would see it get bigger and smaller as it move towards us and away from us. The Sun in the sky has an angular diameter of about half a degree and it's apparent diameter stays constant as it moves across the sky. As I said above, on a flat Earth we'd expect it to be ~0.15 degrees at it's further point, and ~0.75 degrees when directly overhead, we don't see this.

       No they don't actually. They see the same constellations in different orientations.

       A person from the northern hemisphere would look at Orion in perfect orientation while people in the south would see it in reverse.

       Did you know that we are on a planet spinning 1000 mph yet the stars never change 24/7/365? We see the same stars everyday that never change no matter what. How do you think the ancient vikings of yore were able to navigate using the north star without ever taking into account curvature of the earth? This method of navigating would never work on a round earth.

       Some of them you can see in both hemispheres, if they're near the equator, or if you're near the equator you can see some of both. But for example, you
       <strong>
        cannot
       </strong>
       see Polaris from the southern hemisphere. Similarly, you
       <strong>
        cannot
       </strong>
       see the southern celestial pole (near Octans) from the northern hemisphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're right about seeing them upside down though, because in the southern hemisphere you're literally standing upside down compared to someone in the Northern hemisphere. How would this work on a flat plane where everybody is standing up the same way?
      </p>
      <p>
       The earth rotates slowly. You can in fact see the stars move due to the Earth's rotation, it's not readily visible to the naked eye, but they do in fact move in circles around the north and south celestial poles over the course of the day/night. If you do a long exposure you get
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/IAOZhbB.jpg">
        pretty patterns
       </a>
       of the circular paths.
      </p>
      <p>
       I literally explained that the Sun would
       <strong>
        always
       </strong>
       be visible. At no point along it's path would it just disappear. Even if it did just disappear when it was far enough, like you're saying, you still haven't explained how it clearly moves down below the horizon when in the flat earth model it never moves below ~13° above the horizon.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't watch the whole video, I skipped through it a bit at a time before I had seen enough and got bored.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly, it shows a picture of the Milky Way that the video says was taken by NASA. That picture is either an artist's representation, or a picture of a completely different galaxy. There are no pictures of our own galaxy from the outside because we can't go out there to take such a picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       It then goes on to talk about how the Sun doesn't set above 65°N at the summer solstice. This is perfectly explained on a spherical Earth, the declination of the Sun at the summer solstice is +23.5°N, so it's high enough in the sky (celestial sphere) to never go below the horizon. Note that the latitude at which it is visible is 90°-declination. The sun is at a lower declination at other times and so the latitude above which the Sun never sets decreases between the spring equinox (when the Sun moves into the northern portion of the celestial sphere, +declination) to the summer solstice (declination = +23.5) (i.e. you have to be further north to see at the equinox than at the solstice), and then increases again from the summer solstice to the autumnal equinox, at which point the Sun moves into the southern portion of the celestial sphere. When the Sun is in the southern portion, you get permanent night at the North as it never rises above the horizon. As you approach the winter solstice the same thing happens for the south pole, the latitude at which the sun never sets increases from -90° at the autumnal equinox, to -66.5°, and then back up to -90° as we move back around to the spring equinox.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like I maybe could explain the above celestial model a bit better, so if you have trouble understanding it just say so and I'll try again when I've got more time. There's probably half a dozen other things wrong with the video I could go over as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Here's the points I've made broken down:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        On a flat earth, the Sun would always be visible as it wouldn't get far enough away to become too small to see. In the real world, it is not always visible.
       </li>
       <li>
        On a flat earth, the Sun would never set and would always be far from the horizon. In the real world, it clearly sets.
       </li>
       <li>
        Related to the above two points, the flat earth model cannot account for why you only get the midnight sun phenomenon above/below certain latitudes.
       </li>
       <li>
        On a flat earth, the Sun would appear to increase in size and speed across the sky as it moves towards you and decrease in size and speed as it moves away. In the real world, the Sun always appears the same size and moves across the sky at a constant speed.
       </li>
       <li>
        On a flat earth, the stars and constellation in the southern hemisphere of the celestial sphere literally do not exist. They clearly do from a simple look at the sky from the southern hemisphere on earth.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       EDIT2: Got my constellations mixed up, whoopsie!
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT3: Stars in the southern hemisphere also circle in the opposite direction to stars in the northern hemisphere (clockwise vs counterclockwise).

       Well that's subjective to camera and eye lense. If we all had telescopes and we're on high enough elevation (or maybe had flat elevation without mountains and valleys we could see the sun forever as if it were a star. Same way we can se the moon in day time.

       In that video with the 10p coin, notice how the coin gets smaller as it gets further away, which the Sun does not do. The edge of the table in the video, representing the horizon, is also higher than the camera, whereas the horizon is always lower in real life.
      </p>
      <p>
       The model in the star trails video doesn't work. The stars would never cross the horizon (hill/mountains in the way don't count as horizon) as they'd always be at some position in the dome higher than the horizon. It also doesn't account for the fact that the stars literally move in the opposite direction in the southern hemisphere, or the fact that the in a dome model you literally cannot have two hemispheres of stars!
      </p>
      <p>
       When I say the Sun would always be visible on a flat Earth I'm not using the real size and distance of the Sun, I'm using the numbers given in the flat Earth model: 39 mile diameter, 3000 miles high. I used the real life size of the Earth because we can measure the circumference of the Earth to be 40000km and we know from travel times and survey data that the azimuthal equidistant map typically given to represent the flat Earth is grossly wrong and the distances towards the rim are inflated due to the nature of the projection. So,  the maximum distance from the Sun (far point on the equator) and an observer (on the rim) would be 30000km, giving an angular diameter of ~0.1 degrees, still larger than the lower limit of the human eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll watch your other video later if I've got time.

       Can you answer why we are supposedly moving:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        going 1040 mph, though it can be argued that this speed is cancelled out during half the day if the Earth is moing around the sun in the opposite direction you are travelling on the surface of Earth.. The Earth travels around the sun at 66, 666 mph. The Sun (our solar system) rotates around the center of the Milky Way at beween 420, 000 and 540, 000 mph. Finally, it is believed that the Milky Way is traveling or moving around a "local group" of galaxies at 2, 237, 000 mph. So, do the math

       It doesn't make sense because gravity doesn't work that way. The sun just floating in a circle above the earth, that doesn't make sense, there is nothing keeping it there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The stars have changed, by the way, several have gone out during history, in fact. By and large they haven't changed because they are too far away for the small (by comparison to the rest of the galaxy) orbit we have in the solar system.

       Due to the fact that no outside forces act upon an object moving through space without the intervention of another object, and also due to the fact that gravity pulls straight towards the center of the earth (for all intents and purposes), the plane and the earth remain in similar or same inertial reference frames.  Also I don't know if you have noticed this but literally all the 'evidence' you have ever seen which supports the idea that the earth is flat is completely contradicted by the fact that your satellite TV works just fine.

       That's so incredibly asinine.  What are the credentials of the people who made these videos?  I was a satellite communications systems operator in the Army.  Those are my credentials.  Literally everything about the job, from the direction the antennas point (those dishes you see are called antennas) to the round trip time delay, the antenna tracking systems required that have to MOVE the antenna over time because many satellites do not orbit in a stationary spot, to the fact that no ground based antenna can transmit further than the horizon without tropospheric scattering, proves well enough that the satellites we connected to are in space, orbiting a round planet.  And I don't know if you actually watched these shite videos or just read the titles and was like "Oh that sounds like it supports my belief system" but they're so poorly made and so thoroughly debunked merely by the comments sections that you should be embarrassed.
       <br/>
       Besides all that, I think the question you need to ask yourself is "To What End?"  What the hell would be the point of anyone telling people the Earth is round if it is really actually flat?  What benefit would someone gain by doing that?  In the opposite direction, all I can see the "Flat Earthers" gaining is their smug sense of superiority that they are somehow "in the know" and that the rest of us sheeple are not.  So please tell us all, what's the benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Additionally you chose to ignore the first part of my answer.  Was it because you didn't (or weren't capable of) understanding it?  Or was it because you didn't want to address it due to the fact that it is correct and you are not?

       I don't kow where you are getting the idea from that you can't see satellites with a telescope but you definitely can.  So, that statement of yours is immediately false.  You can even see many satellites with the naked eye.  The fact that you have chosen not to attempt either of these things is your problem, not mine.  As for the moon being visible, uh, duh?  It is really big.  Of course you can see it from far away, especially when the light of the sun reflects off of it.

       You can travel to Antarctica any time you want.  Dunno where you got that stupid idea from.  So again, what is the benefit?  You can't articulate one.  Because you're demonstrably wrong and refuse to admit it.  It is also evident in the fact that you choose to attack parts of my answers that you percieve as weak instead of addressing each point like someone having a rational discussion would do.  I am literally an expert on the fact that satellites exist, and you are literally not qualified to even be having this discussion, though you keep trying soooo hard.

       These were sources giving instructions which will allow you to take your lazy ass outside and fucking look at them yourself.  I even stated that they were instructions.  So, take your fucking ass outside, and look up in the goddam sky.  Use the suggested satellite tracking apps to determine the location you need to look at.  Look with your eyes alone, with binoculars, or a telescope.  There is no fucking "we" in this equation because you clearly have NOT done it yourself, otherwise you wouldn't be pursuing this incredibly ridiculous and ignorant line of drivel.  Literally everyone on the entire internet can open this thread and see how obstinate, lazy, and fucking useless you are being right now.  Literally all you need to do is get up off your ass and go the fuck outside and look up in the fucking sky with a pair of binoculars.  Just fucking DO IT.  I am so fucking done with your ignorant ass.

       It's one of those things where you never think you're going to have to prove that basic, demonstrable truths like a round earth and orbiting satellites are real things.

      <p>
       What I don't get is that he admits that the ISS exists, likely not knowing that it orbits the earth every 90 minutes at 7.66KPS. It is, by definition, a satellite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, for the OP, your satellite TV operates in the SHF band. A microwave radio signal can't make use of groundwave or skywave propagation. It has to be in direct line-of-sight, which is why there's a
       <em>
        satellite
       </em>
       over head providing that line-of-sight to your house.

       Mr. Expert I just saw the r/pics post of China's huge new radio "telescope".
      </p>
      <p>
       And it made me think about satellites again and came up with this question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since you have to position your radar in order to receive satellite signals, what would happen if your satellite is on the other side of the globe? How tf are you getting a signal if it is on the other side of the "round" earth for half a day?

       There are pictures. About 25 people have showed you them. Go look for yourself and then come back and say it isn't real as opposed to asking for evidence and sources, getting those things you asked for, and then immediately throwing it away because it might mean that you are wrong. Which is something your brain clearly doesn't allow you to do.

       under a three-thousand (3k) mile high artificial nickel-iron steel dome with a reflective golden oxide coating like tin foil. There's room I believe, for an additional ring(s) with eight (8) or more additional Sun and Moon disks that are thirty-two (32) miles wide
       <em>
        [perhaps made of diamond semiconductor and held in place with diamagnetic levitation]

       daisy-chained above this possible ring just past Antarctica.

       There's evidence for additional Suns
       <em>
        [and Moons]
       </em>
       too, in the Arctic there's twenty-four (24) hour sunlight for four (4) months; you can film the Sun going around in a circle. You also get nice curved star trails on long photographic exposures. However in Antarctica you get side-scrolling action; the Sun and stars go by like a two-dimensional (2D) side scrolling video game. The period where it's light for twenty-four (24) hours is only six (6) weeks long however. There's also a catch, the Sun is only visible scrolling by for twelve (12) hours of the twenty-four (24) hour period and the other twelve (12) is just light with no Sun visible.

      <p>
       On a side note, I'd like to cover the topic of gravity I've seen raised a few times here. It's actually that dense objects fall and light objects rise depending on their medium with æther being the case for an evacuated chamber
       <em>
        [space is fake/lie/hoaxed]

       . Ultimately what defines up and down is the electric field.

       The easiest way I can say it is that the atmosphere that envelopes the planet behaves similarly to the liquid oceans we can observe at sea level. Even though air isn't tangible we are still within it and enveloped by it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like the ocean, air isn't all moving in the same direction and speed. There are currents at different depths/elevations where you may find high speeds. But it's mostly just eddies and vortexes.

       Speed is only measured within a specific frame of reference. If you sit in a high speed train going 250km/h, and you are eating roasted cashews, you can throw the cashews into the air, and catch them with your mouth. They are not affected by the velocity of the train. Likewise you can stand in the aisle and sprint with the trains direction, and then run the opposite direction. No difference.

       Frame of reference. I have a hard time believing your astro physics studying friend wouldn't know this.

       Here's the thing. They give out hypothetical nonsense and no evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of them finally said for the car experiment. There is no possible way to determine momentum or velocity in the car experiment from the inside unless the car changes direction/speed. So basically they are saying the same for for earth. So where's the evidence of a rotating earth?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever hear of that retarded notion that bullets are affected by the earth's rotation?

       You misunderstood what they meant. They were speaking about a completely closed system with no frame of reference outside of that system. That is why the train in the example is windowless and the track is completely smooth. With those two rules in place you won't feel the movement from hitting a bump or going around a bend and you have no landscape to view for another frame of reference. In that scenario you can't tell you are moving no matter how fast or slow you are going so long as the speed stays consistent.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you placed a gigantic tarp around the Earths atmosphere to create the same system you wouldn't know you are moving unless you were on the outside. Since there is no tarp and we can see the stars, sun, moon, other planets, etc that are outside our "train" you know we are moving.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your entire premise fails at the misunderstanding that only the solids are moving (the ground, buildings, etc) and that the atmosphere would be outside of our frame of reference. That is false. The atmosphere is part of our "train" that is hurtling through space and the landscape for our train is outer space. Anything you do on earth like running, jumping, taking a plane all follows the same rules as dropping a ball on a train or throwing a baseball back and forth on a train. Everything has the same constant exertion on it regardless of direction which makes it seem non existent.

       I always find the
       <strong>
        reactions
       </strong>
       to flat earth questions interesting and many times they trigger red flags.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes many of the FE arguments are weak and easily explained but some are valid questions that are only met with weak analogies that don't answer the initial question, and then just ridicule.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Flat earth reaction reminds me of this old quote.

       Even if the Flat earth explanation isn't the real answer it is pretty apparent that something is being hidden. Maybe we are stationary and everything else spins, maybe the planet is vastly larger than we know with much hidden land (past the pole ice ).....  But as you said this is ingrained from early on.

       You have already disproved the claim that flights take the same time by providing one example of flights that do not take the same time.

      <p>
       I'm just here to help provide some tools for you to provide evidence. You have to do the work yourself. I can help by pointing out some obvious errors in your analysis (for example, flights that have layovers that aren't controlled for), but ultimately you have to test the hypothesis. Don't let other people tell you what's what, get out there and see for yourself. Try and prove flat Earth wrong; try and fail 1000 times (fairly), and if it always manages to survive, you might be on to something. But the first step is building a rigorous hypothesis that can answer the question.

      <p>
       Could you clarify this statement? It could either mean that the balloon stays above the same spot on Earth that it was released or that the Earth freely rotates while the balloon moves straight up. I would imagine that the balloon would be less and less effected by the air that moves with the rotation of the Earth as it rises higher into the atmosphere. The air would be less dense and less affected by the rotation of the Earth, so you really need to provide a source and explain in detail what you are actually claiming so that we can come to agreement.

        Another excuse he googled was that the atmosphere moves along with the earth's rotation and that still doesn't explain why planes all take the same time back and forth. I also call bullshit on that atmosphere theory since there's no evidence of it moving anything.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       A plane must endure resistance to air in order to get from point A to point B. If the air moves with the Earth at the same speed, it means that it would take the same energy to go either direction on the planet. You still have to move through the same amount of air. If you have to move through the same amount of air, it will take the same amount of time. The only thing I would say here is that maybe as you get higher into the atmosphere (really high), you aren't as affected by the rotation of the air around the earth, so it might be slightly quicker in one direction.

       Umm, forgive me if I'm wrong, but if you are going in the opposite direction of the way the earth and atmosphere is moving, wouldn't there be more resistance, and either take longer or take more power/fuel? Wouldn't it be the equivalent of sailing with the wind, rather than against the wind? Going with should take less time, going against should take more time and more energy/fuel.

       Think of it in terms of water instead of air. The water is moving at the same speed as the air above it. Imagine yourself sitting in the ocean while the Earth turns at 1000 miles per hour. Are you able to swim more quickly in one direction compared to the other? Of course not. You are moving through space with the water at the same speed. For all intents and purposes, you are still. Now, think of how much resistance the water gives you when you want to swim to a new location. Why would you think that swimming to a different location would be faster or slower?
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason why cars and planes are aerodynamic is because there is resistance to the air. The air behaves pretty much like the water does, except not as severely restricting.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Earth is spinning at 1000 miles per hour, why would the air remain separate from the Earth? If you put a bit of spin on a ball, the ball affects the air around it.

       Think of it this way (this is how I understand it). You are in a pool, you are moving around the edges to create a whirlpool. That is the atmosphere moving with earth in one direction. Once the current gets strong enough, you can kick back and are pushed relatively fast around the pool with little to no energy/resistance involved. Try swimming in the other direction, and you will need to exert more force/energy to travel the same distance. I could be way wrong, but this is my layman's understanding. Right or wrong?

       You are pushed relatively fast around the pool, yes, but in your analogy, the surface of the earth is the surface of the water in the pool, not the bottom of the pool. In your analogy, the water inside the pool is the earth and the bottom and sides of the pool are the space in which earth is suspended. It makes sense if you really think about it: the earth is spinning relative to the space around it, just as the water is spinning relative to the concrete bottom and sides of the pool.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Once the current gets strong enough, you are moving along with the water.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yes, you are moving in reference to the bottom of the pool. However, from the frame of reference of the water, you would be motionless, since you are moving at the same speed as the water; you are moving along with the water. If your frame of reference is the bottom of the pool, then of course it takes more energy to move against the current. But if your frame of reference is the surface of the water, then it would take the same amount of energy to move either way. If no energy is expended at all and you just float, you move at the same speed as the water, just like on earth if no energy is expended at all you move along with the ground. Think a little bit harder and it all makes sense.

       In order to move through the air, you must displace that air while going forward which takes energy and time. No matter which direction you take, since the air is part of the Earth, it takes the same energy and the same time to move a certain distance.

       A tornado is a separate thing from your relative position. I'm beginning to think that you forgot to take your medication today. I tried to dumb this down enough so that you could understand it, but now you are diving into air currents and other minor nonsense that does not debunk the general point being made here.

       My, aren't you pretentious. I'm playing devil's advocate here, trying to get you to explain. You fail to do so, without relying on personal attacks and superiority. Simply asking questions should be easy for you, if you actually knew what you were talking about without resorting to ridiculing. That's the problem here, pretentious people like you who cannot fully explain "simple" concepts, you know to be "science". Thanks for showing your true colors, if that stupid post about tinfoil hats wasn't enough. Have a nice Friday evening.

       A tornado has absolutely nothing to do with the general trend of the Earth's surrounding air following the earth. A tornado is a tiny, minute little discrepancy in the whole fucking earth's surface and the surrounding air from aligning to the same speed.

       If you want to go back to your pool analogy, once you made a whirlpool in the water the "tornado" would be another smaller whirlpool in one section of the pool. If you remove the sides and bottom of the pool and had a suspended whirlpool of water that would be the earth and its atmosphere. Place some pool toys in random spots and those are now cities. They would move at the same rate you are moving in the whirlpool. Swimming from one to the other would take the same amount of time no matter which way you went because everything is moving at the same rate. So if the water is moving at 10 mph everything in the water moves at 10mph. If you can swim 1mph then going to point A with the current would mean you are gaining 1mph on that point as it is moving 10 and you are moving 11. Swimming back to your original point at 1mph would be the exact same time as you would be moving 9 mph with the current but the original point is moving 10 mph with the current or the distance between you and the point is closing at 1 mph. Tornadoes would be smaller whirlpools that have an isolated area of affect on a section of the pool but not the entire thing but would also be moving at 10mph with the current. So as you approached your resistance would change in that area but it's affects would be isolated to that area that's in constant motion with the current.

       That still doesn't explain anything about rotation,  we all know about resistance but we are talking about forces of rotation.  A better example would be if a swimmer is swimming on an artificial wave pool. He can't really swim against the waves really well(depending on the speed) but going back he would go extra fast or wouldn't need to swim at all since it's pushing him that way.

       Here's another flat earth contemplation I hear often. Why isn't all the bodies of water in the planet affected by the rotation? When ever something is rotating such as a drenched tennis ball the water will always be pulled by the rotation towards the equator of the spin. If this is true then the oceans should be at the equator.

       No. 1) The earth has gravity and pulls the water down and 2) the spinning tennis ball is spinning much faster than the earth relatively speaking. Remember that the Earth only spins once per day. The earth, spinning at 1000 miles per hour, is a little over 24,000 miles in circumference (24 hours per day at 1000 miles per hour = 24,000 miles around)

       The earth is big.   It has a radius of 6384 km at the equator.   Relative to the stars, it rotates once every 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds - 86164 seconds per rotation.  (This is known as a "sidereal day").   (As the earth moves around its orbit, it takes another ~4 minutes before it has turned once relative to the sun, thus the 24 hour solar day).
      </p>
      <p>
       The formula for the acceleration required to maintain constant circular motion is
      </p>
      <p>
       a = v
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       / r
      </p>
      <p>
       Speed is distance travelled divided by time:
      </p>
      <p>
       v = 40,111,000 m / 86164s = 465.5 m/s
      </p>
      <p>
       substituting:
      </p>
      <p>
       a = (465.5 m/s )
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       / 6384000 m
      </p>
      <p>
       a = 0.033 m / s
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
      </p>
      <p>
       That acceleration is tiny compared with the acceleration of gravity - 9.78 m/s
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       at the equator, 9.832 m/s
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       at the poles.

       Still not sure you're asking seriously, but for the sake of the argument - and posterity - earth's
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity">
        escape velocity

       is about 40,270 km/h (25,020 mph). Much, much faster than its rotation.

       The atmosphere travels with it in the same way that it "moves" within a traveling car.

       Your argument is the equivalent of being inside a windowless car driving on a smooth road, and thinking you're not moving because hey, it doesn't feel like you're moving and when you toss a ball it falls straight down. 
(Hope that doesn't come off as condescending - I'm just drawing an analogy here. Nothing wrong with genuinely questioning things one is spoon-fed.)

       As mentioned elsewhere in this thread, you're conflating acceleration with momentum. In a car that's
       <em>
        increasing its speed
       </em>
       , the object will indeed be pushed back (actually
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8mzDvpKzfY">
        forward in the case of a balloon
       </a>
       due to fluid dynamics and the buoyancy of helium vs. air).
      </p>
      <p>
       But earth didn't "just start the ride", nor is it accelerating (I hope you didn't get the idea that it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       accelerating from anywhere). Earth is the equivalent of mid ride at a fixed speed, on a smooth road. Drop a ball and it'll fall straight down.

       Sure if the initial acceleration would because the air in the balloon is resting, but right after the balloon would move back from then on. Those same youtube videos show this too.

       Here is what you aren't grasping. We know there's air all around us.
      </p>
      <p>
       But where is the evidence that the earth is rotating at 1000mph?
      </p>
      <p>
       The earth only rotates 1 direction so why do all flights no matter if they are going east or west have no difference in travel times?
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything and everyone is supposedly moving 1000mph yet we don't feel it and can't change it. Where is the evidence we are moving at all? If we jump nothing happens. If we fly nothing changes. So how the fuck are we going to all fling to our deaths if the earth stops?(Looking at you askreddit, askscience,  TIL)

       Bingo!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's take this thought a step further.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do not feel, hear, or see anything that is constant.  If there was a sound that sounded and NEVER had any intervals (meaning it was perfectly sounding non-stop forever without change in volume, pitch, tone, source, or quality), you wouldn't hear it.  We can only detect the intervals.  We can only detect CHANGE.  It's just how our systems of experience work.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if you're on a perfectly flat surface and you move forward at a consistent rate of speed indefinitely, you wouldn't feel like you're moving.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like you don't feel the Earth spin, and you don't feel the Earth orbit the Sun and you don't feel the Sun move from its place in the galaxy, and you don't feel the galaxy's rotation, and you don't feel the galaxy's movement in space itself.

       Yeah and round earth science says the equator you would feel the full 1000 mphs while further away from it like in Macedonia you would feel only 700mph. Which has 0 evidence.

       no dude. you won't feel anything that is constant. it doesn't matter if it's 1000mph or 700mph or...... 67,000mph.
      </p>
      <p>
       67,000mph is the speed the earth is moving through it's orbit around the sun. do you feel that? no you don't.

       Taking an analogy and making it literal, completely destroying the entire discussion. This is the funniest thing I've ever read. Thanks!
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: If the earth and the surrounding air is moving at the same speed, there is no reason to think outside of the train. Everything is moving at the same speed. The train analogy is used to demonstrate a concept that my 4 year old understands; if you jump on a moving train, you don't go through the back wall of the train. Ok? Do you understand this concept? Yes or no?

       Concave Earth explains everything. Flat earth is a stepping stone/psy-op and has serious pitfalls such as the southern pole stars rotating about an axis opposite to those in the north.

       Earth is indeed stationary as Airys failure shows.

       There is also an experiment known as the Rectilineator of 1897 where the curvature was shown to move UP instead of down. The Tamarack mines experiment also showed divergence at 4000 feet deep between two plumb bobs run in adjacent mine shafts.

       There is also a glass sky 100km high, which is why radio waves reflect back at this height, lightning sprites branch out, Schumann resonance occurs there, the aurora borealis stop at that altitude, and why the thermosphere begins at that altitude.

       I think the point you are getting at is that we do not see the horizon going up. This is because light bends upwards and "flattens out" the horizon. Almost as if it were designed this way so humanity could never figure out he nature of their reality prison.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wilhelm Martin showed that light bends up:

        and he at first tried explaining that the plane going with the rotation would be going 1300mph while the other one would be going 700 mph. Which is absolutely bullshit lmao. The one going against the rotation would be going -700 mph.

      <p>
       Why would it be -700 according to your math?  1000-300 = 700.  To go -700 MPH he'd need to be flying west at 1700 MPH.  Basic arithmetic brah.

       Because the earth only rotates 1 direction. Not both. It is going 1000 mph 1 way. Like a conveyor belt. Basic logic brah.

       I'm not disputing that.  What makes you think I am?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you walk forward at 1 MPH on a 1000 MPH conveyer belt, you go forward at 1000+1 = 1001 MPH.  If you walk backwards on it, you go 1000-1 = 999.  However, according to your logic, you're suggesting 1000 - 1 = -1.
      </p>
      <p>
       To put it another way, when you are considering the plane's speed going with rotation, you are factoring in the rotation of the earth, but when you consider the plane's speed going the opposite speed, you're not factoring the rotation at all.  To compare it to the conveyor belt analogy, that's like saying you measure forward speed relative to the ground the conveyor belt is on, yet you measure backward speed relative to the actual belt (and the other things on it).

       Naw here's where the logic comes in.
      </p>
      <p>
       if we are moving 1000 mph on a conveyor belt eastward we would be moving 1000 mph forward if we go east.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we try to go westward we would be going backwards 1000 mph. Thats why I say negative. Sure We MIGHT Be Going 1000 Mph - Our Speed. But it is not the direction we want.

       Some experiments you can do on your own:
1. Buy a telescope and observe the satellites as they pass.
2. Get some friends who live on other parts of the planet and conduct a shadow experiment on tall objects of the same height. The length of these shadows are different based on if objects are round or flat.
3. Travel to the southern hemisphere and try to find the North Star or any stars close to the north star. You will not be able to find it.

       Why don't you try it and take your own videos? There aren't videos of some shit because it's common sense. It's so proven by science that no one thought "we better film this shit so people can use it as evidence that the earth isn't flat".
      </p>
      <p>
       You keep talking about how there's pictures of Venus but no pictures of satellites taken from a telescope... Duh. Who the fuck wants to see satellites? We can see them and know what they look like up close. Venus, on the other hand, is
       <strong>
        interesting
       </strong>
       to look at. So, people take pictures of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, what's the point of scientists and the government lying about the earth being spherical? I don't understand. What great thing are they pulling off by lying about it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, you keep calling for "proof" but all of your "proof" is amateur YouTube videos. Where are those credentials? I can go make a YouTube video right now stating everything I just typed and cite it as evidence, but that doesn't really mean anything does it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is more likely, that some amateurs making YouTube videos faked some shit and/or are talking out of their ass or that hundreds upon thousands of scientists are involved in a secret conspiracy to convince civilians that the earth is spherical (for no reason)???

       <p>
        If the planet is rotating at 1000MPH, how come there is no evidence of it influencing anything off the ground?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There is evidence. It's why the US launches rockets from Florida and not California. You want the rocket to be launched over the ocean, so if it explodes, it will fall into the ocean and not over a city. Since the Earth rotates towards the East, you pick Florida (east coast) because you can launch the rocket in the same direction the Earth is rotating and you get that 1000 mph speed boost. If you launched from California (west coast), you would have to fight that rotation and it would require a much more powerful rocket.
       <br/>
       The only space program in the world to go against the Earth's rotation is Israel. They launch towards the west in order to launch over the Mediterranean and not the surrounding countries towards the East. This is a costly problem for them, as they have to build their rockets to be more powerful to overcome the Earth's rotation.
       <br/>
       We also pick Florida because it's closest to the equator, and being that the equator is farthest away from the Earth's core, it's give you the maximum angular velocity and allows for cost reduction.
      </p>

        If you take a plane from Africa to the Philippines that arrives in 5 hours, why the fuck does it also take 5 hours to go from the Philippines to Africa?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Here's another way to look at this. The rotation of the Earth doesn't have an affect on plane travel, since it's still in the atmosphere of the Earth, which is all moving at the same speed. It's like the car example people have been giving you. If you throw a ball in the air while you are in an enclosed car, the ball comes back to you (it doesn't hit the back window) because the atmosphere inside the car is moving at the same speed as the car. If you were to open the convertible top and throw the ball, it would be taken towards the back because the ball has transcended the car atmosphere. This is similar to the rocket being launched. The rocket transcends the Earth's atmosphere, and the rotation of the Earth actually matters, thus the reason for launching East.

       It wasn't fully widespread until the 1900s. The last US made flat earth map was 1892. And there was also that 1988 NASA document talking about FE.

       For some reason flat earth is coming back again.  Probably because the internet. But why would I choose to believe something so out of this world and so controversial that I would be ridiculed for it. I had the choice, I would not want to be called a flat earther but choose to believe it anyway because I see more evidence here.

       You know NASA has lied about plenty in the past right?  You don't think they could fake a picture of earth?  Oh that's right.  They already did.

       If your only evidence is an image that could easily be faked, I'm going to have to say the discussion is still on.  Most flat earthers also hold that satellites and the ISS are faked.  How's aluminum supposed to remain a solid inside the thermosphere?

       Two pictures of the earth are photoshopped -&gt; "We don't have a real photograph of earth." Seems like quite a stretch to me. Also pictures aren't the only evidence. For example if you stand on a tower you see further. Other planets are round, it's hotter close to the equator, I could go on and on. Please stop feeling confirmation in few people agreeing with you, often conspiracy theories are believable because they make you feel smarter than the masses.

       I'm sorry if I sounded condescending.  It's just that picture is far from concrete evidence of the earth being a sphere.  Thinking that people who support flat earth theory are so stupid that they can't comprehend a photo like that is condescending itself.  The fact of the matter is if you dig into it, we don't have real photos of earth.  Plenty of evidence that the Apollo missions were fake and

       I could go on and on too.  I don't want to sound like a jerk but there's a mountain of evidence out there I don't think you've ever considered.  I thought it was completely ridiculous until a couple months ago when I decided to actually look at what was out there.  I don't think it has anything to do with how smart a person is.  Just how willing they are to consider the alternative.  I think if someone seriously reviews it, they'll at least come to the conclusion that we don't know for sure it's a sphere and TPTB have been trying very hard to make us think it is.

       Next time you're a passenger in a car, throw a ball in the air inside the car.  If the ball doesn't hit the back windshield then you are starting to get the idea of how things can be traveling at a high right of speed, contained within another object (in this case, the atmosphere), but still maintain the properties of the object in which they are traveling.

       I think there's actually a better way to put this question. The one you put forward can be explained
       <em>
        on the surface
       </em>
       by relativity (Nevermind why the atmosphere would be spinning with the earth.  I still haven't found a good explanation for that.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets say I was on the equator and flew to Michigan. The speed at the equator, according to Google, is 1037mph. At the 44th degree latitude, the earth's speed would be cos(44) * 1037 = 0.719 * 1037 = 745mph. So there would be a 292mph difference in horizontal velocity of the earth beneath when you go to land.  Even if the atmosphere is spinning as well, you should still maintain most if not all of that horizontal momentum in the air.  As far as I've been able to dig up, planes don't account for this in their flight paths or while they're in the air.

       Yeah they don't.  Thats the problem.  We have all of these factors that supposedly affect flight times yet all flight times are constantly correlated to distance only.

       Thanks for that, I can add to my argument as well.

       If you have a smartphone with an altimeter you can measure the curve of the earth using free apps on the App Store by walking a couple of miles in any direction and watching the change in elevation on a flat plane.

       Yeah but that's not measuring curvature unless I walk in a straight line for at least 20 miles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Curvature of the earth is supposedly 8 inches per mile yet the Bedford Levels Experiment disproved this. Ever since then, people have been disproving the curvature of the earth over and over. You can see Chicago from across Manhattan Beach with a telescope or a camera with great zoom. There's a news report of Kansas being totally flat with 0 curvature. The 100 mile long salt lake in Bolivia is flat all across. All these examples can be seen in the video in the OP. It is physically impossible to see any of these things on a curved plane. Canals, bridges, railroads ect never ever have to take curvature into account.  You can ask any engineer.  It's elevation and hills they have to account for. But for ones on flat planes they can stretch forever with never curving.

       Have you seen Jeranism new videos where he disputes the 8" squared per mile formula?   He makes the interesting point that it can't account for any number of miles above 1/4 of the total circumference (ie &gt;7k miles) since it begins to curve in not just down at that point.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's come up with 0.318 as the magic number.  So for a single mile it would be 16,352 feet down.  Obviously our world does not curve to that degree, but if his math is right and consistent with the ball math, the ball would be blown up as a theory.

       It's antartica. The north pole is in the center and we are surrounded by antartica but I heard you can exit the dome like in the Truman Show.

      <p>
       Here's the thing.  There is only one treaty in the entire world where every single government agrees upon. No one is allowed into antartica unless the government approves it, but even then they blindly escort you to who knows where.

       That literally makes no sense.  Nothing physics wise would work the same way if the Earth was flat.   Nothing would make sense.

      <p>
       OK so if the Earth is flat, what, pray tell, keeps us on the ground?  Gravity?  So, what, there's gravity underneath whatever is below the flat Earth?  Come on.  Flat Earther's think of the world and universe in 3 dimensions because we're so fucking stupid these days and we're not taught (or interested in) stuff like physics and math in school.  It's a burden and people can't wait to get through it, and they never learn to understand the WHY with the equations they learn.

       Flat earth says that there is no gravity but we and whatever we are on is moving upwards

       You know what G Forces are I assume? The resistance you feel when moving through space are G forces.

       Newton himself could not come up with a mathematical explanation for gravity because he assumed it is caused by density/mass of a round planet. He threw up his arms and gave up trying to prove it. Trying to prove how the gravity of of the planet counteracts the 1000mph rotation.

       How come planes fly horizontally? Don't they have to fly upwards at an angle? Otherwise the Earth would catch up to them and crash them.

       If that were the case, stars would over time change and NOT operate on the cyclic pattern they currently are on. Seriously, how can you be this dense? Look at over exposures of Polaris. Buy a camera and go a trip starting from as far north as you can go and make stops all the way to the equator. You will eventually lose site of Polaris along the way and your stupid idea of a flat earth will be dead.

       Please, explain to me what the benefit of lying to us all about the Earth's rotation and roundness is. Why, wouldn't that suck up every single building ever built? What would Engineers need all the tools that they use for? They wouldn't need half of them. Half of what they do is determining all of that stuff like the curvature of the earth so they can build a building that doesn't collapse. You,are a troll.

       They don't account for curvature. No engineer ever had to account for curvature at all. Only elevation of hills and mountains and ect. Watch the video in the OP first. 
Even the gyroscope on planes are there just to check the plane's orientation in relation to "gravity" but never record curvature.

        A plane must endure resistance to air in order to get from point A to point B. If the air moves with the Earth at the same speed, it means that it would take the same energy to go either direction on the planet. You still have to move through the same amount of air. If you have to move through the same amount of air, it will take the same amount of time.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Umm, forgive me if I'm wrong, but if you are going in the opposite direction of the way the earth and atmosphere is moving, wouldn't there be more resistance, and either take longer or take more power/fuel? Wouldn't it be the equivalent of sailing with the wind, rather than against the wind? Going with should take less time, going against should take more time and more energy/fuel.

       But where is the evidence that the earth is rotating at 1000mph?

       The earth only rotates 1 direction so why do all flights no matter if they are going east or west have no difference in travel times?

      <p>
       Everything and everyone is supposedly moving 1000mph yet we don't feel it and can't change it. Where is the evidence we are moving at all? If we jump nothing happens. If we fly nothing changes. So how the fuck are we going to all fling to our deaths if the earth stops?(Looking at you askreddit, askscience,  TIL)

       Even if the Flat earth explanation isn't the real answer it is pretty apparent that something is being hidden. Maybe we are stationary and everything else spins, maybe the planet is vastly larger than we know with much hidden land (past the pole ice ).....  But as you said this is ingrained from early on.
