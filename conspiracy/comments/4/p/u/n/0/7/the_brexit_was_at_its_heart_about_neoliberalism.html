<p>Neoliberalism is the ideology that promotes free markets, and free trade.  All sounds good until examined more closely. </p>

<p>A recent IMF paper titled “Neoliberalism: Oversold?” questioning the efficacy of a program that has been the basis of mainstream economic policy in most of the Western world since the end of the Cold War.</p>

<p>The paper — written by IMF Deputy Director Jonathan Ostry, Division Chief Prakash Loungani, and economist Davide Furceri — proposes that neoliberal economic policies have resulted in increased inequality and stunted economic growth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fundamentally, these days the term “neoliberal” has come to refer to free-trade pedalling, privatising and deregulatory economic policies, made famous my Reagan in the US and Thatcher in the UK. It is blamed by many to be the root cause of the financial crash in 2007.</p>

<p>Neoconversatism, by contrast, is a political ideology very closely associated with the US alone. It regards protecting American interests in the international theatre by use of military force, amongst other things. George W Bush (and indeed his father) were and are fierce proponents of these movement, as both Iraq wars give testament to.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the fact that Obama (on the face of it a polar opposite to George W Bush) still continues a lot of what are considered “neoconservative” policies, has blurred the boundaries a bit. His support for continued intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan are good examples. Have a look here (Neoliberalism: Neoconservatism Without a Smirk) for a look at some of the places they overlap and contradict themselves. There’s also a very good breakdown of the various policies shared by these groups here (Neoliberals and Neocons: What’s the difference, and why should I care?).</p>

<p>The main similarity between the two is that they have both become known as “technofacists”, meaning melders of corporate, state and military power into a few political elites that allow comprehensive control. The left and the right have marched full circle and met one another.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I said, both ideologies are simply different aspects of the same agenda, which is evidenced by the fact that that Clinton, Obama and W were essentially the same presidency. When the wealthy want to fight a resource war, they pull the neoconservative strings and the associated necon propaganda outlets dance. When the wealthy want to exploit 3rd world poverty via disastrous trade policies or erode civil liberties, they use liberals to achieve their aims. The truly sad part is that extreme right and left never realize that they are being used as pawns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, very poorly said.</p>

<p>Only in the U.S. can you get away with conflating &quot;cultural liberalism&quot; and &quot;economic liberalism&quot;.</p>

<p>In the rest of the world, those two are opposites.</p>

<p>In the U.S., &quot;economic liberalism&quot; is called &quot;socialism&quot; or &quot;communism&quot; or &quot;democratic socialism&quot;.</p>

<p>Both of you are either from the U.S. or very deliberately misleading about the conflation of the terms &quot;liberal&quot; and &quot;neoliberal&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Neoliberalism&quot; is NOT a term that originated in the U.S. and does NOT refer to cultural/social policy, or the U.S. meaning of the word &quot;liberal&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Neoconservative&quot; is very much a term that originated in the U.S.</p>

<p>&quot;Neoliberalism&quot; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism">originated in European circles</a> to denote right-wing-championed ECONOMIC policies that are &quot;liberal&quot; only in the sense of absolute freedom for the owners of society.</p>

<p>&quot;Neoconservatism&quot; denotes right-wing GEOPOLITICAL policies.</p>

<p><a href="/u/HS_00">/u/HS_00</a> is very much conflating &quot;Neoliberalism&quot; with the U.S.-only CULTURAL meaning of the word &quot;liberalism&quot; -- thus making the common U.S. error of ascribing ECONOMIC &quot;Neoliberalism&quot; as some sort of comparison to GEOPOLITICAL &quot;Neoconservatism&quot; simply because of the U.S. cultural <em>connotation</em> (not economic <em>denotation</em>) of the U.S. cultural meaning of &quot;liberal&quot; which is seen in an <em>opposite</em> way in the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Example:  <a href="/u/HS_00">/u/HS_00</a> says</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the wealthy want to exploit 3rd world poverty, they use liberals to achieve their aims</p>
</blockquote>

<p>False.  When the wealthy want to exploit 3rd world poverty, they use <em>neoliberals</em> to achieve their aims.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Neoliberals and Neocons: What’s the difference, and why should I care?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Neoliberalism is an economic term.  Neoconservatism is geopolitical term.  <a href="/u/HarvardGrad007">/u/HarvardGrad007</a> is conflating economic &amp; geopolitical as the same.</p>

<p>Is Trump a Neocon just because he&#39;s a conservative?  No.</p>

<p>Is Sanders a Neoliberal just because he&#39;s a &quot;U.S. liberal&quot;?  No.</p>

<p>Is Clinton both a Neoliberal and Neocon and &quot;U.S. liberal&quot;?  In many respects, yes.</p>

<p>But who benefits from the confusion of the U.S. cultural term &quot;liberal&quot; with &quot;Neoliberal&quot;?  Those who wish to muddy the waters?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a handy table to understand what&#39;s going on:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the further detailed explanation. I apologize for any confusion.  </p>

<p>The difference in the Neoliberal ideology and the Neoconservative political movement was outlined 2 posts up as well as in the OP, but two important links were left out. This is quite confusing because of the terms and it&#39;s important that they are not grouped with the left/right paradigm that plague day to day US politics, great table btw, I&#39;m saving that. </p>

<p>Neoliberal trade policies and market ideologies, based on Keynesian Economic Theory, have been applied by Labor, Conservative, Democrat and Republican administrations over the last 35 years and were at the heart of austerity over the last cycle. The Neoconservative political movement and the PNAC good ole boys club should be mentioned not to confuse the situation, but to reinforce that it is not an answer to Neoliberal trade policies, as the Neocons were huge supporters.   </p>

<p>Edit - links have been added two posts up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My contention is not that they literally thought about Neoliberalism as they were voting. More that this is the basis for the economic policies that have lead to that feeling of being left out of globalization. </p>

<p>I see this all the time. People who are the &quot;winners&quot; of globalization cannot understand why everyone is not as excited as they are. Pundits chalk it up to racism and xenophobia in order to not have to deal with the stark reality of a generation of failed economic policies. </p>

<p>It is convenient that now the Brexit can be used to take the blame for the impending bursting of the current bubble and economic suffering that was caused by the aforementioned Neoliberalism. </p>

<p>I agree. The problem is pushed up the chain, though because the government which is doing the intervening also needs to be accountable to the people it governs. The EU Commission represents a Politburo that has ultimate control over the lives of 500 million people which is completely unelected and unaccountable to its subjects. That&#39;s why I voted Leave.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would argue that crony capitlism is an obvious and inevitable result of an all-out free market. And how would you propose things like poverty/homelessness should be dealt with? Or chronic unemployment? Don&#39;t you think that there are certain things that should not, under any circumstance, be profited off of (like healthcare/medicine or prisons for instance)? I&#39;m not against freedom. I am against a government/society that allows economic exploitation, and turns a blind eye to its weakest members, those who fall through the cracks and legitimately need help surviving. This is what your beloved &quot;free market&quot; boils down to in reality. There must be some regulations in place to prevent things like crony capitalism, and some kind of safety net, if we are to have a society that is truly healthy. Otherwise, it&#39;s just the law of the jungle, every man for himself. And that is just primitive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it&#39;s an interesting discussion.  I think rather than look at things that are wrong in the world, of which there a great many, we have to look at what gov&#39;t proposes to do to correct them, and whether theses attempts will work or might backfire, possibly even making the situation worse.  Take wages for example. Minimum wage laws only reduce the number of low-pay jobs available, which hurts the very people it intended to help.  A worker&#39;s union, if successful, can be a very useful way of skilled workers to increase their pay. Forming unions is a function of free market forces, not a gov&#39;t solution.  There will always be income inequality. The best thing to cure it is a raging economy that all prosper in.  This is best achieved through zero gov&#39;t intervention and an inflexible currency.  In socialism, all incentives are removed and the economy stagnates, in a crony capitalism system, gov&#39;t has the power to assist corporations and so they buy the politicians.  A limited gov&#39;t can&#39;t aid corporations, so the corruption would end.  People must be free,  free to succeed and free to fail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just disagree with this idea that government always equals &quot;bad&quot; and less government always equals &quot;good.&quot; It&#39;s way too oversimplified and black-and-white. There are many problems with how our government does things. But I don&#39;t think the answer is to shrink the government. We need to fundamentally <em>change</em> our government, but not shrink it or abolish it, as libertarians would argue. By the way, what you said about minimum wage laws hurting workers, that is classic laissez-faire capitalist propaganda. The truth of the matter is that the more money workers make, the more money goes back into the economy. If low-wage workers made more money, they would not be just sitting on all of that extra cash. They would be <em>spending</em> it, sending it back out into the economy, which would be a huge boost. Ultimately, business-owners (and the economy as a whole) would do better, not worse, if the minimum wage were increased and workers made more on average. This is really just common sense. An economy is a cycle, a constant feedback loop. When people don&#39;t have any disposable income (i.e. they only make enough money to pay for bare necessities of survival), the whole economy ultimately suffers. The economic cycle then becomes a <em>vicious cycle</em>. And you say that the best cure for inequality is a raging economy all prosper in. This is simply unrealistic and utopian. If, as you say, there will always be inequality and poverty, then that is <em>all the more</em> reason for our government to realistically address the problem. The problem with libertarian economics is they are completely utopian and unrealistic. They seem to completely ignore factors like <em>human greed</em>, which will always rear its ugly head, and will eventually completely steer the entire system if allowed to, which is what we see happening in America. A free market, with no regulations or safety nets, is <em>precisely</em> what leads to crony capitalism. We don&#39;t need less government. We need <em>better</em> government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the point is employers will just hire less people if the minimum wage is raised too high. Gov&#39;t intervention in the market has never worked in history. If it did, there would be no struggling economies, every country would just wave these magical wands of policy. Show me where a gov&#39;t intervention in the economy has helped grow the economy.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You completely ignored everything I just explained about minimum wage. Businesses would not have to hire less people. If people had more disposable income, they would be out <em>spending</em> that money, which would be a huge influx of money <em>back</em> into businesses. Hell, eventually, businesses would even have to hire <em>more</em> employees to handle the increased business they would be receiving. This is common sense, but you have obviously whole-heartedly bought into all the libertarian propaganda. And surely you know that most of the struggling economies in the world (including America&#39;s) are victims of the globalist banker cabal. They create artificial struggle and hardship as a means of control. Things do not have to be this way in the world. As for government involvement in the market, look at America. Over the last several decades, there has been a concerted effort to <em>remove</em>, not increase, regulations on the financial sector. Neoliberalism (which is basically your viewpoint) has become the default ideology that our government has pushed with their rhetoric and their legislation. They have pushed for, and achieved, much <em>less</em> government involvement in the market, claiming that it would benefit everyone, rich and poor. This neoliberal agenda has obviously been complete bullshit, and has caused nothing but harm to the majority of working Americans. The middle class has been gutted as a result of this free-market agenda, and the 1% has swelled to ungodly proportions. Hell, even the IMF, who have long been proponents of neoliberalism, just released a report recently stating that they were <em>wrong</em> about it, that it was oversold and has been largely damaging. Either you are just not paying attention to what has been happening over the last several decades, or you&#39;re choosing to ignore all of that because it clearly undermines everything you&#39;ve been saying about how wonderful the free-market is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it&#39;s obviously a very complicated matter, and would take extensive planning. But I do know that less government involvement in the market is not the answer. A realistically livable national minimum wage is a no-brainer for a more robust and healthy economy. Also, a sliding-scale taxation system, where people are taxed either more or less, based on their income. All of that garbage about how tax-breaks for the rich would stimulate the economy (&quot;trickle-down&quot; economics) is a complete and utter load of shit. I also think we should put in place some kind of more transparent system for letting the American people see, and vote on, what their tax money gets spent on. I guarantee you if we enacted that, our absurdly huge military budget would shrink, as would billions in foreign aid to places like Israel. Some government work programs to create jobs and fix our crumbling, neglected infrastructure, like what FDR did during the Great Depression. Also, there are many industries that I think should not be privatized, but should be functions of the state. This includes the financial sector (people forget that the Federal Reserve is a PRIVATE ORGANIZATION, not part of the government), the prison-industrial complex, the energy sector, healthcare and medicine. Repeal Citizens United to get all of the corrupt big money out of the voting process. Stop all of the bank bail-outs and other forms of corporate welfare, and have more realistic welfare programs in place for people who actually need it. Repeal NAFTA and other neoliberal globalist trade agreements which have sent so many of America&#39;s jobs overseas. Again, it&#39;s a big, complex issue, and I don&#39;t claim to have all the answers. But I do know for sure that shrinking or abolishing the government&#39;s role in the market would simply result in more of the same bullshit status-quo, and would eventually make today&#39;s crony capitalism look like child&#39;s play.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I agree with: slashing military spending, ending foreign aid, never allowing a dollar in bank bailouts, and ending all free trade deals.  The rest of your prescriptions are well-reasoned, long sought policies of those who believe in active gov&#39;t.   I can&#39;t say for sure that they would backfire, perhaps they might work.  In general, efforts at a planned economy have all run up against the basic problem that Central planners can never plan an economy as efficiently as a million individual choices or the so-called invisible hand can.  But I&#39;m sure you&#39;re familiar with all those arguments and many smart people have been arguing on both sides of this debate for over a century.  Check out World crisis Radio podcast if you don&#39;t already, Webster Tarpley agrees with all of your policy positions as well as exposing conspiracies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, I love Tarpley! I&#39;ve been following him for a while now, ever since I saw that debate he did in DC about 9/11 Truth. I was very impressed. To be honest, that was one of the main things that convinced me to start questioning the official narrative, doing my own research into it, etc. I used to be a complete denier of the Truth movement. Tarpley is one of the true voices of reason in the world today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well he&#39;s one of the only liberals I respect.  Most of the major liberal figures like Noam Chomsky, Amy Goodman, Bill Maher, etc, work within the official narratives.  Most conspiracy researchers tend to be libertarian, which makes sense because if you think the gov&#39;t is actually killing its own citizens to blame on others, you&#39;re not going to look to them to make positive social and economic change. </p>

<p>I agree with his Wall St Tax.  I think speculation profits should be treated differently than profits from real businesses that create jobs, provide goods and services. I don&#39;t know what the current crop of liberals in Washington would really do with the money from a Wall St Tax though, they don&#39;t have a good track record of effective spending.  But perhaps more free Healthcare would be ok. </p>

<p>Generally though, I think Gov&#39;t can&#39;t really help an economy. It can redistribute income at the barrel of a gun, but that doesn&#39;t sit well with me.  That&#39;s how I arrive at a limited hands off approach. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fundamentally, these days the term “neoliberal” has come to refer to free-trade pedalling, privatising and deregulatory economic policies, made famous my Reagan in the US and Thatcher in the UK. It is blamed by many to be the root cause of the financial crash in 2007.</p>

<p>Neoconversatism, by contrast, is a political ideology very closely associated with the US alone. It regards protecting American interests in the international theatre by use of military force, amongst other things. George W Bush (and indeed his father) were and are fierce proponents of these movement, as both Iraq wars give testament to.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the fact that Obama (on the face of it a polar opposite to George W Bush) still continues a lot of what are considered “neoconservative” policies, has blurred the boundaries a bit. His support for continued intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan are good examples. Have a look here (Neoliberalism: Neoconservatism Without a Smirk) for a look at some of the places they overlap and contradict themselves. There’s also a very good breakdown of the various policies shared by these groups here (Neoliberals and Neocons: What’s the difference, and why should I care?).</p>

<p>The main similarity between the two is that they have both become known as “technofacists”, meaning melders of corporate, state and military power into a few political elites that allow comprehensive control. The left and the right have marched full circle and met one another.</p>
