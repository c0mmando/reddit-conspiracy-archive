       Wait, why do you think they are killing them. Because they run the good errands?
      </p>
      <p>
       No, because they aren't completely corrupt and aren't going to tag along the globalist game.
      </p>
      <p>
       And seriously, if bankers are going to be a thing, they will need an income so the profession in itself, being of service, is not a bad thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bad thing is when private corporations own banks and make their interest apart, although of being of public service, from that of the (a moral, interested in life-flow, which atm is nowhere to be found) government. 
Then shet goes bad and honest people in the industry get shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       If these guys were absolutely corrupt and ready to do the globalist bidding you can bet they would be allright, except a few cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since i'm not used to defending bankers as a whole (actually the opposite, although i blame more the ignorant citizen... Don't hate the hungry bear, just shoot him ffs), if you think i'm just a banker shill just check history.

       Doctors and scientists dying is terrible, especially when those doctors are helping the greater good and the scientists are finding new ways to coexist with nature, like we should

       but bankers that just fuck us over? make money out of nowhere, use everyone as pawns in their huge game, choke the world with their fucking system, yeah, hard finding sympathy for them, quite the opposite

       Bankers make money based on their administration of others money. That's their job. Is not necessarily a bad thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       If those were the bankers of a moral government just taking their part to live on there would be nothing bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is the banking culture being indipendent from the state legislation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another problem is the banking culture actually aided to be at ease being corrupted by government, which they bought more than a century ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       The WWs where a giant distraction to the real globalist agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a moral system, the fatigue of a farmer would be compared to that of a banker and then income decided on that basis (plus perhaps education needs) but no more. In no moral world a banker can make 100X more times than a farmer.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the banking system was moral and adjusted to the average male effort to keep up living there would be no problem.
The problem is in the culture which corrupted the system, or more truthfully that gave birth to this system.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a moral state created a banking office based on citizen needs, there would be no shame in being a banker. Just public administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say this because i'm a bit offended by the fact that all holistic doctors murdered are considered saints, yet all bankers are damned. If they were murdered there is atleast a seed of doubt about their personality to be considered, without the need to salvage the actual banking culture. We know this one is fucked up, but really, not all people getting into banking are complete garbage.
Some just want to occupy their mind and like math. Not the majority but. Consider that elite-murdering usually comes with a reason... good or bad it is... usually bad for us. So i just don't want to damn an already elite-damned soul even at risk he died for "good" reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reality is complex and often times gray (not clearly observable, only contextually inferable... And this is not at all a B&amp;W context for people to die, any career taken).

       Maybe so, but if you get a heart attack the doctors ( the real ones) in ER will do their damned to save you. That's something to respect.

       The comments you've made don't add anything to discussion. It would be one thing if you had evidence or sources, but you just state baseless negative drivel. If you feel that "nothing will be done by anyone" then why even keep up with current events?

       my comment add as much to these pointless conversation as any other.  i could have the most insightful, source riddled comment in the history of reddit, and no one is still going to do anything about the problem of corruption in our society as a race.

       if i was wrong, we wouldn't be on a subreddit discussing conspiracy, because you would be too busy doing something about the real problems.
