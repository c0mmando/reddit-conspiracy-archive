       also, all you talk about in your OP are material things, material wealth, if anything these are just things used to pull the wool over the eyes of the masses, I doubt these things matter much to the elite. they dont have
       <em>
        all

       the power, money or knowledge yet, or we wouldnt have even a semblance of freedom or free thought. we can still be further controlled and that I think is the aim, to make us an (even more) mindless slave-worker race

       Almost. Sure they can force their way into my dwelling, kill everyone I love and torture me until their medical knowledge fails us both. But they can't penetrate the furthest reaches of my mind, which sometimes elude even me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can think outside of their jurisdiction. This is insufferable to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure they are working on forcible (forget your memories) mind control, using directed energy weaponry. The last frontier to conquer, is thought.

       If we lose that, we lose everything. And we'll never know it, because we won't be able to think that way...

       On "Christmas day" when they first received the device, they would ... what is the crime of forcing someone to have sex with you by forcing them to want to have sex with you? Whatever it is, that's probably the first thing they'd try. Eventually, Dipshit McFrankenberry Rothschild is going to get some girl magi-pregnant, which will result in motherfucking shit... and the shooter's are the unwilling victims used for calibration...

       Then you could smuggle the children using CPS all above board... Damn untestable hypothesis!
      </p>
      <p>
       They would have fucked up by now. Sure you can run around doing anything you want, because you can modify perceptual reality for all affected parties. But they never missed a person, assuming that's possible?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's an untestable hypothesis, much like the universal simulation. We can't possibly test the theory if our ability to remember what we just tested is entirely in question. Without that, there is only blind delusion; Perhaps it's all there ever was.

       They will invent nanobots that can carry sperm intact through the air, then they will create spermclouds to impregnate all women everywhere with psychopath archon sperm.  Boules on private jets will nanocast spermtrails over big cities and impregnate millions with psycho athelete/entertainer/actor-celebrity children sperms. But Baron von Nanosperm Von Roths-childrape will always have the latest version which can disable black freemason nanosperms in the air with aryan augmented roboperm, which uses cyborg dna (dna that makes organic circuitry) so that rothschilds cyborg banking partners grow up faster and use less power to operate their affiliate networks.

       Um, so, they can already do that. Mengeles research in Germany and here under the pseudonym Dr Green, gave them all kinds of abilities and the financing to build the technology to make it efficient on a large scale. Everyone wants to yell: martiallaw! FEMA camps! The ability to be much more sublime is already theirs.

       Depends on your cultural take, as for me, I shall follow in Jesus footsteps, unlike most religions do and live like my creator wants. They are an ever changing group of cretins, that like their babies raw, and their children young and that will use any dirty trick they can to make offerings to a false god. But mostly your vulcans and my paperclips. And those that they can control.

       Great answer. The soul is exactly what this is all about. Jesus is the savior escape route and vulcans and paperclips are key to the death and corruption of many.

       Walking in his shoes is the escape route, he didn't want prayed to. He wanted people to do like he did. And the only act of violence we know of is overthrowing the moneychangers tables. The synagogue of Satan is a very real thing, and they work in the shadows by way of coersion, bribery, drug dealing, human trafficking and dark money. Seems I was not justamonarch but one of many and we All have a similar story. Same with some targetedindividuals. This was completely perfected by the Vril Society, long before the Nazis even had power. They are incredible illusionists and have perfected gaslighting a whole society. Kind of amazing what you can do with the help of a few summonsed demons, eh?

       Ever hear the term 'pull the silver cord' or something like that.  That's what that's about.  Killing the soul.  Disconnecting the spirit from the source.  Allegedly there is an electronic weapon that can kill people's brain activity instantly, killing them instantaneously within an area the size of a football field.  This is unverified but it's tesla / scalar tech, alleged to have been develpoed in russia.  could be bullshit.

       Weapons like that are what we are talking about directed energy weapons. My understanding is that we are all in reality electrified beings of light depending on vibration we show a color, depending on mood. I do see auras, not always but a good part of the time. Less so when near cell towers. Most of what the Mk paperclips were doing was electronics testing, to try to replicate the brain wave patterns they found useful. I have heard from someone on the ground that they literally stopped Saddam's troops and made them turn around and go home during the first kuwait invasion (early nineties) . Ever notice how the burnt up vehicles we can see in the pictures of the aftermath of that strongly resemble the cars at the have of the twin towers? The only time I have heard of a silvercord was from someone that actually told me thirty years ago that he was a Mktimetraveler. He was also sure he knew that I was mk'd as he remembered my father. He is who I got my original Vietnam veterans and mkultra papers from. I am truing get a hold of him, but have only found him online in random comments on CERN. And Facebook, which I do not do. But by Wednesday night I should be back in touch, as a meatspace peep is going to get ahold of him through hers. I might be wrong it has been a long time,but apparently when you are traveling through time space continuum the silvercord is your line back to current time space.

       It has always been interesting. Why gold? Why not the more common silver?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why not uranium or radium for it's dangerous effects?
      </p>
      <p>
       Gold is awesome to work with, because it doesn't want to effect anything. It just wants to hang out. Need to put some interesting space fluid into a cup? Better use a gold cup.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would filter everything with gold if I could afford it. Gold is intrinsically valuable because it's such a loner, just like it's friend Nitrogen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Say you're operating on an ET that fell into your yard. How will his chemistry react to your steel scalpel? Maybe he's stuffed full of some sort of aerosolized sodium, and he'll burn up in our atmosphere. You'd need a Nitrogen filled room, and gold tools. Then you could safely harvest the alien fetus and sequence their genome.

And not because it is nice.
Do some real digging into who has the most gold on earth.

       There is no satiety when it comes to greed. They want more and more, and even that doesn't satisfy them. They are in a constant state of hankering and anxiety to accumulate more. They will never be satisfied.

       Suppose I am able to fill all of the space between my molecules with some sort of absolute zero cement. I would be a greyish block of goo, but the composition of my molecules would be wholly unchanged. I would be free from the effects of time because I am entirely encased in matter. I'm not alive, in any traditional sense, but I am free from time. However, my environment is not. I can still be drawn upon, or shot into the sun.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine I am shot into the sun. My magic cement keeps me from the subatomic ravages of change as I approach the corona. Anything on the exterior of my goo block will heat up, but not the goo block. It would remain unchanged, even as it crashes into whatever surface the sun has. And I would remain there, a perfect little insulated lunchbox, quietly awaiting the universe to join me, instantly.

       TPTB are in the process of conquering the heavens since 1945. Since Richard Nixon's presidency all access beyond Low Earth Orbit has been restricted to the level of the International Space Station. Space missions that are not sanctioned by TPTB are abruptly terminated/defeated/compromised.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Von Braun threat sequence goes as follows: Communism, Terrorism, Rogue Nations, Asteroids and E.T.
      </p>
      <p>
       TPTB use these threats to rationalize putting weapons into space. This is how they are conquering the heavens now and will continue to do it - by restricting the space "the heavens" from all trespassers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at how NASA tried to put No-Fly zones over the Apollo landing sites. They have a compulsion to control all access above 300 miles (475km) in altitude.

       I would say that prohibiting access to space over 300 miles is a crucial first step of the conquering activity. I would also say that the Von Braun threat sequence is expecting threats from space, e.g. asteroids &amp; E.T.
      </p>
      <p>
       To wit, the Chelyabinsk meteor explosion over Russia resulted in the formation of international (UN) and multi national operations designed to "protect the planet" from these outer space threats.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there was an existential threat from space, now or in the future,  it would be incorrect to say today that space has been conquered by TPTB. They are controlling up to 300 miles but have not conquered anything beyond what I refer to as the "Russian Glass Ceiling".

       Russians stopped "conquering" out space in 1965 when they reached a limit of 475km (300 miles) in altitude. They simply stopped trying to go any higher with human passengers.

       If you believe in the Apollo moon landings then the Americans stopped "conquering" space in December of 1972 when the last Apollo went to/from the moon.

       Order a robot to kill another robot and it will 100% every time.  Program it to torture it for eternity, it will do the same.

       I personally think humans are better because they won't do that.

      <p>
       Unless they've already given up their humanity and become a robot person, aka a psychopath.  Like everyone in the military.  When they say 'they will break you', what do you think they are breaking?  Answer: They are breaking your humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our society is a system designed to promote psychopaths into very high leadership roles, who go on to make culture and economies and administrative infrastructure. which explains the world today.  It's run by psychopaths that design systems without empathy and we live within a big robot hive that doesn't care about anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       We finally get our equality.  We're all equally ripped apart by robotic systems that don't benefit by our happiness.

       They want to turn everyone including children into cybernetic androgynous sex robots doing porn until they are 30, and then they want to rape you to death and eat you.  The chips they put in are torture chips where they can inflict pain and suffering both as physical pain as well as giving them the ability to create psychological terror like 'bad acid trips' at the press of a button, all done remotely from their smart phones.  This gives them delight.  It's all a part of psychic / emotional vampirism/parasitism, and kontrol with the added bonus of being able to sacrifice you to pagan gods for empowering them thusly.

       On "Christmas day" when they first received the device, they would ... what is the crime of forcing someone to have sex with you by forcing them to want to have sex with you? Whatever it is, that's probably the first thing they'd try. Eventually, Dipshit McFrankenberry Rothschild is going to get some girl magi-pregnant, which will result in motherfucking shit... and the shooter's are the unwilling victims used for calibration...

       It's an untestable hypothesis, much like the universal simulation. We can't possibly test the theory if our ability to remember what we just tested is entirely in question. Without that, there is only blind delusion; Perhaps it's all there ever was.
