    <div class="md"><p>What a lot of fun.    The remain supporters,   largely sponsored by their corporate owners,  and by extension government employees of all types who sold out,  really ARE that out of touch with public sentiment,   that they misjudged by how much they would have to fudge the votes.    </p>

<p>Leading up to the vote,   they drowned out any real feedback from the population with their make believe.    Like Karl Rove,   they started believing their own propaganda.    They have no idea how pissed off people are,   and no idea how many people are ready for an honest reappraisal of decades of abject corruption.    </p>

<p>Not everyone wants to be a slave,   coddled by the state,  turned into a sheep.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Modern Liberals grew up listening to shrill screams that Conservatives are devils because when Bush/Cheney were in office, they were, but the tone of righteous indignation has seeped deeply into the Liberal tone of voice, even though they are now as often wrong as they are right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because there are no more small-government conservatives who garner any real votes. Ron Paul runs republican for exposure but is really a libertarian so I don&#39;t count him. Most Republican candidates these days don&#39;t represent any of the small government ideals in favor  of big government money. And the republican congress continually fight for moronic tax cuts for obscenely wealthy people.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to just abandon some of the ideals i liked about the party, but it has been overtaken by morons. Conservative used to mean FISCALLY. Now they&#39;ve adopted this bullshit christian conservatism so it&#39;s about religion and race as well. The fuck ever happened to the idea that government SHOULDN&#39;T FUCKING BE INVOLVED in religion or stupid social issues??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are you talking about lunatic? My comment is directly related to r/worldnews censorship and the horrible light it paints Liberals in. My comment illustrates that Libs can&#39;t allow debate because they grew up in an era where the other side was wrong on every issue and didn&#39;t allow Liberals a voice.</p>

<p>That is no longer the case, and the Liberals can&#39;t pivot, hence the censorship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong><em>Reddit</em></strong></p>

<p>Here we go, me attempting to tiptoe around the hot potato! I have had my fair share of warnings...</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>1)</em></strong> All the major Reddit subs are being censored extensively. It happens from behind the scene, a block box contraptions by design, to control the flow of information on Reddit. If your post contains articles or reveal crimes about the following subjects: The US Military, US Intelligence Community, T.B.T.F. Financial Institutions, Mega Corporations, US Politics, US Economic Data, Economic Inequality, Social Unrest, the Corporate Owned Mass Media or certain well connected individuals you will become a targeted of their censorship. </p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>2)</em></strong> Their favorite methods: 1) Algorithms that automatically detect specific wordings 2) Banning of certain independent media outlets. 3) Subtle vote rigging. 4) Manual removal of posts (last resort). 5) Intimidation. 6) Banning of accounts. 7) Allowing trolling by Shills &amp; Pundits. It is a very smooth and professional operation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>3)</em></strong> A core of loyal followers and employees. If they don&#39;t want you to see what is going on, you won&#39;t s see it. By design, we can&#39;t fully observe the process, nor can we tell the entities apart. We can make patient observations. We can take notes. Patterns emerges. We are not allowed to talk about our observations or criticize &quot;them&quot;, that would be a violation of rule #2 #5 #10. Catch <del>17</del> 22!</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>4)</em></strong> Reddit has been censoring users and independent media sources for years, with an increasing zeal, they are censoring them because they are compromising the narratives of the Corporate Owned Mass Media. They punch holes in the official scenery of propaganda, fear, polarization and lies. <em>The recipe for destroying the corporate propaganda is straight forward: Data and fact driven journalism with a high degree of integrity.</em> Reddit is owned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Publications">Advanced Publication Inc</a> a de facto Corporate Owned Mass Media outlet.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>5) (As an Example)</em></strong> There is a lot of racist postings on the front page of r/conspiracy, thinly disguised as &quot;conspiracy anti-Israel posts&quot;. They constantly make up 10-20% of the front page volume if you don&#39;t repeatedly remove them. There is a lot of wedge issues, pitching various groups against each other, thinly disguised as conspiracies. On top of that you can add irrelevant trivia and celebrity gossip, all designed to distract and entertain. What you have left is maybe 5% of relevant content. This is how &quot;they&quot; are dumbing down the conspiracy forum and Reddit in general, a mere shadow if its former glory, an echo valley for idiots padding each other on the back. People kind of know, everything looks more and more like CNN and BBC, while the intelligentsia is fleeing the forum.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It has been a long process, by deliberate design, to make Reddit into another corporate owned mass media outlet. By now you might as well get drunk and watch FoxNews report on the Brexit with your grand mom.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>IMPORTANT NOTE:</em></strong> The comments section got a &quot;moderator Death Kneel&quot; post, it will disappear from the frontage with the hour, no need to pretend otherwise. </li>

    <div class="md"><p>There are other sites for decent news, but the issue is that, in it&#39;s prime, Reddit was really a nexus for discussion of social, economic, and political issues. </p>

<p>Issues like Internet censorship, Occupy Wall Street, and Citizens United were on the front page everyday. Now the front page is garbage. </p>

<p>When I woke up the morning after the Orlando shooting, I had a news alert on my phone that said there had been a mass shooting. I checked Reddit on my PC, which wasn&#39;t logged in, expecting it would be the top story. When it wasn&#39;t, I went over to <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> and saw a wasteland of deleted comments which highlighted the extent that Reddit is rigged.</p>
