ever since the USGS ( company that records seismic activity around the world ) was caught RED HANDED of keeping certain information from the public, certain size quakes, and down sizing the quakes, i been really sus of the weather and been keeping up to date with stuff around the world from a dude that is constantly harassed for reporting weather stuff and quakes around the world Dutchsinse is the page, have you seen the activity around the world lately? man this year is the most recorded year for seismic activity, 6.0 quakes shaking Fiji, Nz , india, even some swarms near the largest volcano in the world ( yellow stone ) in USA, man century old VOLCANO&#39;s erupting which only mean one thing and one thing only, the earth quakes are going too get bigger and Tsunamis will start 100%... massive quakes all around the world, some even taking lives. shit is speeding up and sooner or later ALL coastal regions ( italy, naples, california, etc, are going too be fucked by rising sea levels ( tsunamis eventually ) and dude SA will be issued Tsunami warning sooner or later, but i can fucking guarantee it will be in our life time, maybe even couple of years we got left here. its funny though, the amount of people that deny this, thinking continents and the world is just fucking going to live on with out catastrophe is a fkn joke. it un believable how ignorant people are man. just choose too look the other way and not worry about whats too come</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with this guys message. It&#39;s ramping up for sure and if they&#39;re hiding information I guess it could mean something is coming and they are hiding it.</p>

<p>People talk about how global warming raising sea levels will displace people. 12% live within 10 meters of sea level. 21% of earths population live within 25 metres of sea level. The powers that be talk about global warming raising sea levels up to 80 feet in the coming century. </p>

<p>It is clear cut to see that these rises in sea level will not happen gradually over time. I believe this post is leading in the right direction. One day there will be quakes worldwide. Massive tsunamis will hit the shores. After that day everyone will know there is nature to fear.</p>

<p>A quick google search showed me that within 1 hour of an earthquake, Japan was hit by tsunamis 39 meters high in land.</p>

<p>People are sleeping I think it&#39;s almost time many are put to rest. I see why people believe in prophecy, I am not entirely sold in bible prophecy. If massive natural disasters occur by the end of 2016 I will be sold that prophecy is always fulfilled. Whether real people orchestrate the prophecy or it is an unnatural force is up to you to decide.</p>

<p>Everywhere I look it is becoming more and more clear some crazy things are in store for the future. Everywhere I look. Politics, earthquakes and the environment, the government wanting depopulation, the fake news, the behavior of the average human, our economy, our poverty, our enslavement. And to top it off people are so deep in that any other possibility is automatically written off as ridiculous.</p>

<p>Studying the bible to increase knowledge is one thing, living by it&#39;s very word is another. Same with any other holy text. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you ever done that experiment with an ice cube in a glass of water ? try it , take a note of the waters level when you place the ice cube in there , mark it on the glass then wait for the ice cube to melt ...</p>

<p>or</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKiq5EwkzDg">watch some future space man magic </a></p>

<p>now add to this the problem with the earth growing ( yes its getting bigger as it has always done because of volcanoes spewing out lave and other future spaceman magic  about the movement of the tectonic plates ..</p>

<p>what will eventually happen is the sea level will fall , more land mass will appear like some kind of future space man magic </p>

<p>the elite know the human mind , they study it , they know how to instill feat , they know about politics , their bloodlines are older than Rome , they keep plans and make plans within plans , they have files on what to do  and when to do it . how to react and how the population will react , the system is theirs , and people from school teachers , doctors , dentists , pop stars , movie stars buy into it as slaves to the real elite in the hope that when they pull the plug on the human race they will be spared , they know their banking system is failing , they want to end the human race and start again , they made plans for it over 100 years ago and we are well into it , we are near its end and yet we sit back and watch it happen , </p>

<p>the human race needs to do more than wake up , it needs to shower and wash those bastards off their skin along with the fibers they drop in chemtrails  , it needs to then eat breakfast that is not tainted with the chemicals the elite have poisoned it with , they then need to get dressed in clothing of natural fabrics but &quot;man made fibers&quot; that cause electrostatic that is harmful to the human body , they need to go to a job that does not owe money to their banks or pay taxes to a government thats in the pocket of the elite , it then needs to educate their children with truth .. it needs to stand up and say to the elite we are not going to take it any longer but man is lazy and weak.. hes the internet generation he thinks a hero will come along and hack their computers .. yeah that will show them ..</p>

<p>a human 100 years ago would have hunted them down and shot them like the vermin they are ..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your outlook is a little off in my opinion. If they wanted to extinct the whole human race why don&#39;t they just drop every nuke they have and kill everything? lol. I agree about everything except for the end game plan. We are enslaved but it could be anything, I personally think by the time they start the microchipping they will know who is transcended and who isn&#39;t. They&#39;ll microchip all the slaves and quite literally make a second race of humans. Maybe the next race will be better maybe it will be worse in ways and better in others. It&#39;s the mark of the beast 666 and we have been warned. 7 Chakras to Christ consciousness friend. The next age may bring something people disbelieve, it may not. But either way there is no reason to sit here thinking the elite are one day going to sit back and just murder literally everyone, it&#39;s a joke. Everyone is killing themselves already look at what everyone is reading and consuming on a daily basis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is actually because of an normal step of <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/3qyqfm/premise_part1_the_pacific_was_once_closed/">earth expansion</a> (which tends to be ridiculed by agents).</p>

<p>what happens is that the crust of the (sorry for the provoking thought) hollow earth is now expanding to the tearing point, and the interior of the lowlands is collapsing (like in <a href="http://siberiantimes.com/science/casestudy/news/first-pictures-from-inside-the-crater-at-the-end-of-the-world/">yamal</a>) (with also <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/3sl0yo/premise_part4_aether_existence_nature/">bursts from pockets of hydrogen</a>)</p>

<p>but please read my <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/FringePhysics/comments/4ohd3u/expandinghollowstuff_theory_megapost/">Mega post</a> to have a better view of what&#39;s happening</p>

<p>there actually is a cheese-like layer in the crust of earth (cheese like meaning soft, not bubble style hollowed) where the rocks are saturated with water, and the water is saturated with  hydrogen... <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola_Superdeep_Borehole">I&#39;m not crazy</a></p>

<p>I just don&#39;t see any real reason the earth would be shaped differently than any other celestial bodies, which are generally spherical.  Unless we&#39;re not supposed to believe that either, considering that falls under &quot;the official story.&quot;</p>

<p>what i&#39;m actually saying is that all telluric planets are hollow with stars in the middle, and then they become gas giants with rings (like the ones we already know), and then the gas giants become stars while their rings become new telluric planets (expanding, hollow, with stars in the middle).</p>

<p>all the objects we see in space are of the same kind but at different steps of their &quot;life&quot;</p>
