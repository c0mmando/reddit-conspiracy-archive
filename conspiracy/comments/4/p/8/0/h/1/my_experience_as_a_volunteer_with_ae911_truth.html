        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I reached out to them last year demonstrating interest in being a volunteer.  I was reached by someone lets call him Jordan (not his real name), someone fairly high up in the org.  This was a pleasant conversation and to this day I still like this person although I kind of ragequit months later (to be explained below).</p>

<p>I was asked to reach out to others in the area, which I did.</p>

<p>I recieved one brief reply from one of three of these coordinators.  This reply was unhelpful and so I responded that I wanted some help with how to &#39;direct&#39; a local meetup in Asheville, NC where I&#39;m located.  </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t get anything back.</p>

<p>I spoke with Jordan again.  He gave me other people to reach out to.  I did, and although these exchanges were good (here: look at this video, oh look at that video), it didn&#39;t really help me.</p>

<p>I expressed that I didn&#39;t want to lecture, speak in front of people, or lead anything that was like an AA group, <strong><em>but that I would do it if it were scripted and very well organized.</em></strong>  Of course, they didn&#39;t have any of those materials.</p>

<p>Jordan and I decided my best use would be with anti-propaganda because he said he really liked some of the things I had written here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> that I directed him to.</p>

<p>(Wrt to speaking in front of people, I figured if I were going to speak out about 9/11, I&#39;d write my own thing and then go to the Rotary club instead of some gaggle of people on craigslist.   Why have AE911 in the picture if they can&#39;t get their volunteers a little assistance?  That was my thinking and I expressed it diplomatically)</p>

<p>But that didn&#39;t result in getting any materials.  I thought about having a &#39;casual dinner&#39; or some other kind of &#39;event planning&#39; that wasn&#39;t a boring roundtable discussion where I&#39;d have to lead it.</p>

<p>I ended up buying my own &quot;Beyond Misinformation&quot; copies and sent it to the local library, guerilla &#39;left behind&#39; these materials under Highlights and 3 yrs old Newsweek magazines at doctors&#39; and dentist&#39;s waiting rooms, and left them behind at coffee shops on tables.</p>

<p>They released it for free as a pdf so I printed up rip off sheets of the url and put them up where they were allowed to be posted in public.</p>

<p>I told Jordan again that I wasn&#39;t getting much help and that I reached out to folks.  I also expressed that I would be better at writing rhetoric and &#39;propaganda&#39;, argumentative essays and &#39;anti-propaganda&#39; strategy.  He directed me to someone else.  I reached out to them (again) this time with the intro from Jordan and a bunch of links including one to a google doc I was writing with anti-propaganda analyses. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t even get a reply.  </p>

<p>Jordan said he was going to a big AE911 meet up in Florida (I think Tampa or something) where he was going to present stuff.  And he wanted me to start working on antipropaganda and some other things.  I produced quite a lot of stuff for him in short time and gave it back to him with a request for comments</p>

<p>He thanked me and said he&#39;d look it over.  I know he was very busy so I gave him plenty of time.  </p>

<p>I then sent him some other things like youtube videos and we got in an email battle because it was &#39;ring of power&#39; that I sent him.  He didn&#39;t like the anti-catholic &#39;empire of the city&#39; idea and started attacking it as &#39;conspiracy theory&#39;.   We went back and forth and I eventually just stopped talking to him and stopped responding to AE911 emails.  I call this &#39;ragequitting&#39;.  It was when I realized they werent&#39; open minded, they weren&#39;t using my work, they weren&#39;t giving me stuff to do, and they weren&#39;t utilizing me to push their agenda forward so what&#39;s the point?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was like a level 0 dipshit summer intern the boss hired without instructions, just before he took off for a month long vacation in Italy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This plus their communications behavior of having me do stuff, and then not give me anything back, having me contact people, not having them contact me back, gave me a VERY VERY bad impression of this group.</p>

<p>Like maybe some of the people here who have criticized AE911 Truth as a &#39;controlled opposition&#39; may actually have some merit to it.</p>

<p>As in : identify the people who can do the most damage and then get them to waste their time and feel &#39;shut down&#39; and &#39;excluded&#39; as a means of control.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean to toot my own horn here but my writing is actually pretty good because I spend a lot of time researching and thinking about these things before I write.  I spend half my time in a garden / orchard (well, more like a mini-farm--it&#39;s 1.5ac) listening to audioripped youtubes of conspiracy theorists from the most absurd and nonbelievable (icke, jones, mckenna) to the most academic (michael parenti, mae brussell, j.t. gatto,  dan sheehan, yep even chomsky but he&#39;s in the doghouse)...I basically listen to it all: the truth is somewhere in there.  I let their ideas ruminate as I labor, then at night I like to write these long essays.</p>

<p>One thing I really have a problem with is the idea of AE911Truth&#39;s that &#39;we are on the cusp of having enough people to cause a big awakening&#39; and then when I try to contribute my time, people squander it, nothing comes of it, I get no legitimate assistance or direction, and they act like that is OK somehow.   It&#39;s like an automatic drip marketing system with no actual people behind it.</p>

<p>The thing that spurred me to write this for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is that I reached out to a lady, lets call her Samantha mid January.  She just now replied to my email at 2:41AM today, mid June, 5 months later.  Not even a &#39;sorry your email was buried&#39; or &#39;went to spam folder&#39;. Just a &quot;thanks for the links, here&#39;s a video.  hope you&#39;re doing well&#39;.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s...um.  Super weak.</p>

<p>AE911 either has a completely inadequate volunteer strategy and inability to communicate properly or they are controlled opposition who are just wasting people&#39;s times.  I&#39;ve never met anyone outside of email and one phone call.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I promised to tell you the truth and this is my true testimony as a volunteer with AE911.</p>

<p>AE911truth woke me up and a few other people in regards to 9/11. They produce lots of good quality videos and actually spend money on ad space. Can&#39;t say that for many other orgs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those guys have figured out that most of the conversations are a dead end waste of time.    </p>

<p>They have a slow but steady strategy that depends on not diluting their message with bullshit.</p>

<p>Their mission is to deal with engineering and architectural specialists.    </p>

<p>What do you have to contribute to engineering and architectural research?   </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Enumerating the ways that they try to subvert the science and validity of that research with propaganda.  Either attacking the engineer&#39;s academic background with like &#39;an unexplained leave of absence&#39; or that they majored in &#39;womens studies&#39; as undergrad...things like this.  If they can&#39;t attack the science, they can attack the scientist.  And they do it by finding one minor defect in their past and then amplifying it into a narrative that casts doubt on the message.  I call this &#39;doubtmaking&#39;, I believe others here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> refer to it as &#39;identifying fracture points&#39;.</p>

<p>That&#39;s really what I was getting at; producing the analysis of the myriad ways in which the media has produced &#39;fake engineering experts&#39; and other &#39;experts&#39; to debunk AE911 scientists. My findings may surprise you.  Go to the wikipedia list of &#39;propaganda techniques&#39;.  The establishment has used EVERY SINGLE APPROACH to debunk ae911 truth.  </p>

<p>This is how I know that the government is wrong, that they lie, and they are lying all the time to everyone.  They are even running these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Earnest_Voice">campaigns online (here on reddit)</a>, and abroad on other social media sites outside of the US.</p>

<p>Yeah,  its hard to get used to the lies.  </p>

<p>On the other hand,  where did we even get the idea that there has ever been a time when truth was all that valued?    We need to get some cognitive therapy for our cognitive dissonance.    And in so doing,  lets leave the fringe wakko types out,  at least for a bit.   Man,  just when we are getting free of the mainstream crap,  blow hard authoritarians in the alternative media are waiting to jump and suck us into another trap.</p>

<p>Only engineers can take offense
For the crimes of 9/11</p>

<p>Only genetic engineers can be concerned about gmos</p>

<p>Only teachers can be angry about our failed school system</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>what if it is the truth?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The WTC complex and the Pentagon experienced catastrophic structural issues on 9/11 that the structural engineering and architectural communities realize the government version is wrong in its reports.    That is the subject.   </p>

<p>Truth in general about some political or religious matter is not what these people come together for.    </p>

<p>The purpose is to get enough credible professional people on board that a real structural investigation can be publicly conducted,  not in secret.    When it moves to the legal stage,  the truth revealed will include a lot more than just structural matters.    But until then,  each organization should be honest to its focus.</p>

<p>People who just want to argue about hypothetical truth .....</p>

<p>That isn&#39;t going to be too practical in getting results,  probably.   In fact,  it usually doesn&#39;t take to long to find out who is sufficiently  disciplined to be able to cut through bullshit and show  competence in their undertakings.    Stand the test of time.</p>

I have to hand it to you though... this one is original and fairly subtle so it&#39;ll fool a lot of people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Their loss, good sir. Our gain. When they got more than 500 architects and or engineers, they quit being human. I watched. And it is very disappointing. Much like the oathkeepers, they too got co-opted. Any opposition that starts out 100% legit is clearly a target for tptb. So staying decentralized seems to be a winning strategy. People not groups. Btw, I have peeps coming back to me, thanking me for sending them the locc. Of they are open, I text it to them immediately, and encourage them to call me if they have questions. Sofar I corrupted no less than twenty innocent minds..... Oh. Wait. I am getting thank you&#39;s. And by rights they are yours. Kinda nice when someone tells you they are sending it around too. Thanks for making this easy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no doubt that those now 2500 engineers and scientists are legitimately &#39;awake now&#39; (and over 75k non-expert others).  But the organization itself has become little more than a means to track them and absorb---not unlike an &#39;anger tampon&#39;--the <em>ire</em> of some really smart, compassionate and earnest truth-seekers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMHO, 9/11 is fairly dead. We know it was a con. We do not know all of the details. Some hard-working individuals may eventually produce new evidence like they did with JFK and eventually we may come closer to the truth in 50 years or so. Or maybe the cover-up will be better this time? </p>

<p>I was very interested in it, but I have come to see that the sheeple are more interested in American Idle and Bud Lite than anything else. Literally nothing will wake them up. In a way, I can&#39;t blame them. They live in a small restricted world. We all do. </p>

<p>Your story is a nice one. Are you an Architech or engineer? This may have some bearing on their reaction to you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>EEh, 9/11 is old hat anyway.  9/11 is the most studied structural engineering failure in the world today.  Not to mention the possibly 10&#39;s of thousands of independent investigations into other areas of the event.  Isn&#39;t there a whole sub Reddit just for investigating 9/11?  This should go there.  We all know the American people were conned.  But nobody can agree who is to blame or how they orchestrated it.  Some of us don&#39;t even believe there were any actual planes in 9/11!  Others think it was a nuclear event.  I guess my point is that even though it was possibly one of the largest and most studied conspiracy theories ever, it has its own sub and doesn&#39;t belong here imho.  That&#39;s why I downvote all 9/11 posts here.  Especially if it&#39;s some moronic no planes or &quot;small nuclear device&quot; thread.  I want to say threads like that are obvious misinformation, but after reading some of the comments in those threads I think some idiots actually believe this bullshit.  Crazy!!!  </p>

<p>Anyway, I enjoyed reading your story, have an upvote.</p>
