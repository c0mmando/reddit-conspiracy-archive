        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Obama barely has a few months left in office. Four years after Sandy Hook and he didn&#39;t even come close to taking away anyone&#39;s guns.  What does this mean for conspiracy theorists? It would be a total waste of time and money to pull off such a big &quot;conspiracy&quot; and barely pass any regulation.</p>

<p>And now a mass shooting twice as deadly has taken place (or &quot;faked&quot;, take your pick). <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/06/the-senate-defeats-gun-control-measures/487964/">Four new gun control proposals were blocked by the Senate.</a> It seems pretty clear that mass shootings won&#39;t lead to any guns being taken away. In fact, gun sales only go up after mass shootings. It would be more believable that the NRA fakes mass shootings to increase gun sales.</p>

<p>So, you all still have your guns. Sandy Hook and Orlando didn&#39;t do shit in getting anyone&#39;s guns taken away. Obama is a few months away from leaving office. My question is, will you admit you were wrong?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Control them...to do what? Give up their guns? These shootings only increased gun sales. What would be the beneficial outcome of keeping everyone in fear that their kid will be killed at school at any moment?</p>

<p>Nobody is saying there are no false flags. But saying an entire school shooting was fake and 28 entire people never existed is on an entirely different level. The amount of people who would have to be in on that would make the conspiracy unfeasible. It would be far easier to just send a real gunman to actually shoot up a school.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>true that. but do you know how big the US is? the media is completely owned. officials and the education system is no less controlled.</p>

<p>mass transport in US is dismal. people are virtualy contained, isolated and alienated. to travel to another state, you have to own a car or hitchhike or whatever. what guarantees you wont run out of gas in the middle of nowhere?</p>

<p>local people setup a dedicated website to expose that the shootings were staged. the websites have been taken down by now.</p>

<p>maybe we were duped to look like fools. but maybe they just want to try something new. if new plans failed they will just rollback to older system restore. microsoft reference here ;)</p>

<p>sandy hook was a fire drill or something, and some idiot decided to turn it into news as a bloody incident. with kids being slaughtered. to add to the agenda. probably it prooved as a bad decision of theirs. hence the remoteness, initially they thought of it as a good idea.</p>

<p>theres no certain way we knew what really happened, since not everyone is local. and lack of access.</p>

<p>it only takes one bill to seize all gun ownerships. why would you think it as an impossible task?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To create division and fear amongst the societies that experience these events, in order to further an unknown agenda.</p>

<p>A mass event like 9/11 is easier to analyse than a mass shooting because of the footage, eye witness accounts, and evidence available.  </p>

<p>Take this story about the murder of MP Joe Cox: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/16/labour-mp-jo-cox-shot-in-west-yorkshire">https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/16/labour-mp-jo-cox-shot-in-west-yorkshire</a></p>

<p>There are around 5 conflicting reports of what happened from eye witnesses, making it near impossible to correlate the information. That&#39;s only 1 news article too, if I went through the other coverage of that event, there would no doubt be more conflicting accounts. This has happened with mass shootings I&#39;ve read about in he U.SA too.  A lot of information is obscured through its reporting, or by releasing a variety of conflicting accounts.</p>

<p>The end goal? Only time will tell... I&#39;ll enjoy the speculation in the meantime.</p>

<p>As more evidence or speculation on events comes to light, and that information can be correlated with other sources, then I may change my beliefs accordingly. </p>

<p>I must agree, the alternative evidence surfacing from mass shootings can be far-fetched.  Some information is factual however, and cannot be dismissed so quickly... </p>

<p>I generally follow the rule that there is no such thing as the truth. There is your truth, their truth and the &quot;gods honest truth&quot;.  I respect your opinion, and have enjoyed this discussion so far.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s one of the biggest insults in American history for citizens to erase these names from the record. It is just as big as an insult to accuse parents of being actors or &quot;not acting like they have a dead child&quot;.
Do these &quot;crisis actors&quot; not have at least one former friend, with a heart, that would expose them? It&#39;s really that simple.
You can&#39;t have a conspiracy to commit anything if your main players are regular people.</p>

<p>Right now most people&#39;s BEST FRIENDS are giving away your deepest secrets, and they nothing to gain.
Now imagine you have a secret that could bring down Obama overnight and you can make TENS OF MILLIONS from it. That&#39;s a secret that&#39;s out before the end of the day at Sandy Hook. But, the only evidence anywhere relies on normal mistakes from extremely early info from a network or CNN.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Global domination, as pointed out by historian Carroll Quigley, the hand-picked chronicler of &quot;The Network,&quot; in &quot;Tragedy &amp; Hope,&quot; is not a straight line. The masses are not predictable and often do not follow in the pattern they are intended to be led. </p>

<p>So, no. The goalposts are being shifted all the time, on both sides of this equation. With all the secrecy and lies and prosecution of whistleblowers and increased surveillance, my distrust of the president and his corrupt administration has been well-earned. And I write that as a guy who voted for him, twice. I won&#39;t be voting this time, at least not for Donald Clinton. </p>

<p>But I fear I will ultimately be proven right. I&#39;m expecting at least another mass shooting (or &quot;mass shooting&quot;) and probably more than one. Hope I&#39;m wrong and you&#39;re right. Hope I&#39;m just paranoid and all this shit I think I&#39;m seeing pretty clearly is just delusion. </p>

<p>But I tend to think this is more like Biblical prophecy of the willfully deluded playing out in real time. We&#39;ll see. </p>

<p>In closing, I don&#39;t expect anybody to read Dr. Quigley&#39;s 1200+ page tome in its entirety, but I would highly recommend Joseph Plummer&#39;s quick, 200 page synopsis &quot;Tragedy &amp; Hope 101.&quot; It will give you a good idea of what&#39;s going on. Plummer&#39;s made it available for free in pdf on his website: <a href="http://joeplummer.com/tragedy-and-hope-made-easy.html">http://joeplummer.com/tragedy-and-hope-made-easy.html</a></p>

<p>The &quot;staging&quot; is another story, I can tell you if there really was a shadow government that could pull off mass shootings, they would just send a gunman to actually shoot up a school instead of wasting time and effort on staging the entire thing. And even if they did use &quot;actors&quot; they wouldn&#39;t use the same ones twice, as some of you imply.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s still not the right approach though. You must go where the evidence takes you. Just because they have so far been ineffective at controlling guns, doesn&#39;t mean the narrative hasn&#39;t evolved substantially. The second amendment is a very significant piece of legislation. It&#39;s not something people would just consent to over night despite a shooting or two. Port Arthur massacre in 1996 was an early part of shaping this narrative too.</p>

<p>The thing is that the elite actually leave clues for us. As much as they are controlling the population through their shenanigans, they&#39;re actually initiating others simultaneously (for both good and bad purposes). I&#39;ve never been to any kind of meeting or anything but I would say through my foray into the world of conspiracy I could perhaps be described as an initiate of the gnostic illuminati.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is also significant evidence that the shooter really did exist and really shot those real children, but I&#39;m more interested in why they would even fake a school shooting in the first place if no gun confiscation would occur. Because if that question has no answer, there is no basis for any conspiracy theory. How many shootings until they start to take guns away? It didn&#39;t work with Columbine, Virginia Tech, Aurora, Sandy Hook, Orlando, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really. You&#39;ll get that kind of reaction most of the time when an unexpected death occurs. Like, if their kids got mauled at the zoo they&#39;d have questioned the broken safety regulations that let the animal escape. Or if a car malfunction killed them, the parents would have questioned the car manufacturers that missed it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a normal part of grief to ask &quot;How could this happen?&quot; And push to make sure no one else dies the same way (if possible).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are multi-level frauds, with </p>

<ol>
<li><p>gun control being but one element. </p></li>
<li><p>There is the victimization stance which allows the aggrieved to proceed with their agendas such as gender fluidity without criticism.The subset of this is gaslighting, or calling truthers or &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; crazy, such as what the poster is doing here.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a mental health and pharma agenda, and that extends so far as &quot;pre-crime&quot; detection or get em before they &quot;act out.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>There is a Muslim demonzation boogeyman agenda in the case of Orlando, Paris, and others. There is a &quot;right wing nut&quot; demonization fantasy being promoted as well  </p></li>
<li><p>There is large scale charity fraud and looting from government involved.I believe global crime syndicates and the media are behind this.</p></li>
<li><p>There is promotion of and expansion of the police state, sales of equipment, security services, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>There is an effort to take control of the internet and to curtail free speech using the misnomer &quot;hate speech&quot; and nonsense like &quot;radicalized on the internet&quot;. This links backed to the victimization stance. </p></li>
<li><p>It is a form of black magic or agit-prop mind control to run live tests of what they can pull off on the population.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a power grab where federal agencies such as the FBI and DHS grab jurisdiction over local police in any crime they choose. </p></li>
<li><p>Creates fear and synthetic realities which promote a problem-reaction-solution atmosphere. </p></li>
<li><p>The satanists behind these hoaxes and/or false flags are sick, evil twisted psychotics and psychopaths. They feel superior and get their kicks from this. My term for this is the &quot;get off factor.&quot; </p></li>
