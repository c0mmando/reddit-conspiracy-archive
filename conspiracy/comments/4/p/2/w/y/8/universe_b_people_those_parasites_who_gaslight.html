       Before you downvote because I'm going to revisit the "Nestle Mandela Effect", I have to tell you that I had a very enlightening conversation with someone today.  They mentioned chick-fil-a and jcpenny being additional 'distortions'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a short but growing list of things that are "misremembered"
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Berenstein /
        <del>
         Berenstane
        </del>
        EDIT: Berenstain Bears
       </li>
       <li>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEjDk71Tkrk">
         Chick-fil-A / Chic-fil-A
        </a>
       </li>
       <li>
        JcPenny / JcPenney
       </li>
       <li>
        Mandela dead / Mendela Alive
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Now looking into these things, I found something VERY VERY INTERESTING.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/6OnYjtFubM/">
        https://www.instagram.com/p/6OnYjtFubM/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is real, then the implications are that there was a syndication across publications and possibly on television announcements of assumingly purposeful misspelling / mispronounciation of Berenstane Bears to Jewify them for some reason.  Possibly to introduce a cognitive, systematic, antisemitic bias into the minds of americans as a 'timebomb' to cause a widespread 'confabulation' at a later date when the 'actual' spelling is revealed.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        At a time when the culture has reached a maximum potential ultranationalism.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's not possible that everyone in the 70s read TV guide alone and didn't notice the misspelling immediately.  They'd have to have it in newspapers also and on the media for it to stick.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Anyone who would purposefully do this would be gaslighting the public for a specific reason.  That reason--the purpose of gaslighting generally--is to cause someone to feel unsafe, anxious, confused and unsure of what they know.  Ultimately to distrust themselves and their understanding of the world around them.  It's a hand dealt by a psychopath as a means to shutdown the targetted individual, and isolate them when that target tries to express their confusion.

       Universe A sucks, take me back to universe E. That's all I have to say, and fuck those universe A people telling me I remembered wrong. Niggas, I have a photographic memory, and also speak/read German. Shtine and Steen are very different. Where the fuck does Stain come into the picture? Doesn't even make sense...

       Gaslighting works on such a subliminal level, but the victim will think they are losing their minds and distrust their own judgment.  Easier to control and manipulate.

       What if you are simply mistaken? Humans tend to see entire words as opposed to individual letters. I will concede that "JCPenney" seems wrong to me, but allow me to play devil's advocate. The "Mandela Effect" seems like such a futile argument unless you can pinpoint a source, something that would exist completely outside of your reach. Perhaps that is the point, to discredit those that can see.

       Search for "Dolly". She is the minor character who becomes love interest to the antagonist's henchman, Jaws. Those who've seen
       <em>
        The Spy Who Loved Me
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        Moonraker
       </em>
       will remember he's the big guy with metal teeth. And those who remember
       <em>
        Moonraker
       </em>
       will recognize Dolly as the girl who smiles back at Jaws with a mouth full of braces. Thus cementing their likeness and love.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now her braces are gone. Even from VHS copies of the film. And the weird thing is that if you check Universal's site on the
       <em>
        Moonraker
       </em>
       cast, it shows Dolly with perfect teeth. Yet it lists her character description as a girl with braces.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's fucking weird.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I should say, I remember this film. Saw it in the theater in '79. And a few times since.

       Count me in on that one. It made total sense in the film too, that she would have braces. A perfect pair of metal mouths. I specifically remember the braces. Now? Gone.

       I think I still have the VHS collection. I, too, recall Dolly with braces, smiling at a disgruntled Jaws. I always assumed these were consequences of "digital re-mastering" of these older movies.

       This is how I feel. We've been lied to. It's not that the universe and our reality is changed its that we were lied to then slipped the truths little by little in such a way that it wasn't obvious. 
We remember different spellings because they WERE different but we are told nothing has changed. This creates tension, anxiety and a further distrust of our SELVES.

       No, it's not self fulfilling.  There's a limit to the lemminghood of people and I wasn't convinced it was 'bearenstein' because some cute 17 yr old with big boobs on youtube said it 2 decades later.  I've had conversations about this while smoking pot in college and we said 'berenstein bears' not the 'stain'.
      </p>
      <p>
       I immediately had a reaction to the revelation of 'berenstain'.  It gave me a double take.  I mean it really threw me when i first found out about it, something like 2010-2011.  I didn't watch youtube to come to that conclusion.  I read one article and just about fell out of my chair.
      </p>
      <p>
       First cold-read was 'if it were 'stain' I'd remember a bear dropping his puddin' pop on hisself'   -- but instead I think of a nice Jewish bear family.  That's coming from somewhere. And something like 8 or 9/10 people thought it was stein ('steen') also.

       You get at least 5 of them in your lifetime before you're 5.  If you're paranoid or overly safe, you get the 3 shot hep one also.  If you go overseas like to Japan, you get a whole lot more and it's unpleasant.

       The closest thing in theory or common fiction to cause this phenomena would involve time-travel. However normally practically nobody would really know how history gets changed because normally it tends to be divergent. Yet all this stuff with stuff being remembered as different would be associated with convergent timelines. So what would be the reason to actively converge at least two different timelines where so many people have different memories?

       I love these Mandela effect threads because I remember berestein too, but there is one important point you're leaving out.  The age of people who are affected.  See, we were children, and children are shitty spellers.  That's why we remember it differently.

       But I wasn't a shitty speller. I was a regular spelling bee contestant and champion. Berenstein is pronounced like the stein by grandfather drank beer from. That's how I remembered how to spell it.

       IDK what you mean by that. Do you mean people that claim it was always Berenstain are over 40 or people that claim it was changed are over 40?

       Yes.  I think.  Like, the people that say it's always been spelled the way it is now are over 40ish.  The opposite is true for under 40ish.

       I'm having trouble thinking of a person I know, that's over 40, who's memory I would actually trust...

      <p>
       But I can get them to corroborate the stein. And I know I remember how to spell Berenstein, Beer N Stein. Berenstein. It's always been this way.

       Perhaps we were given the memory-altering kool-aid while at public school and the over 40s (Who all had smallpox vaccs...) missed out.
