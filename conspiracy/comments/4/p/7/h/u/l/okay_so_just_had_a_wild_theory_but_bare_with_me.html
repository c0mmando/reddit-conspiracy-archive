       Okay, so let me start with a background, I'm just chillin on youtube listening to music, and looking at ways to be mentally tougher on another tab, reading some shit, and one of the pieces of advice they put in this article had something that somehow sparked my mind into some deep shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the athletes that was quoted in the article was a bodybuilder, and he said every time before his set he would visualize himself doing every set, like actually visualize it to the point he claimed he had felt he had "already done them mentally" so he said his body just reacted with it. For some odd reason it made me just think of string theory and different dimensions and whatnot....
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought to myself, what if the key to accessing higher dimensions is through our minds, and we just haven't been enlightened. For example, if I had a task at hand, lets say I was a hit-man and I was assigned a contract to murder somebody. So lets just say I go to said persons house at the right time and am ready to take him out in his bed while he sleeps, now I didn't expect him to have his two children laying in bed with him that night.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I've been faced with a choice(or alternate path or dimension so to say... now follow me I know its a crazy theory) These choices, or for the sake of the theory, alternate dimensions, will lead me to the path I take. The choice I make leads me into that dimension. So should I kill this man and leave the kids....? Should I kill all three of them and get out....? Or should I spare them, and probably get assassinated myself.
Now based off of this wild theory, each of those choices has different outcomes, different realities. It is almost like the butterfly effect is real, but it's more than we can understand based off of this theory I had... Every one of those choices, has a different end result, thus creating an alternate reality so to say?
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck I'm stoned.... but I think I could be onto something here.
Also, I didn't know where to post this, /deepthoughts doesn't seem to have much of an active following...

       Well mentalism alone won't get you anywhere.  It is just the precursor to any action.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like your body builder.  He mentally pictures himself doing the reps because that thought precedes any action.  It would not be possible to do the reps without thinking about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why Mark Passio considers mentalism to be a natural law of our universe.  Any action must first be a thought.  Have you ever heard of the law of attraction?

       I looked a lot into his work yesterday, I tried watching the whole series but it was hard to find a six hour block of free time to do so. So I'm gonna finish today, but isn't that the principles he's trying to teach you in that? The law of attraction?

       Pretty much, yes.  And yeah his talk is long as shit but I think he does a good job of articulating it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many members of the "new age" movement believe that the law of attraction allows you to attract whatever you think about, but Passio clarifies the theory and points out that the law of attraction also requires action.  I think Mark Passio gives more meaningful knowledge in that 6 hour talk than I received in 4 years of college.

       You're not "onto" anything, you're stoned and blabbing on about things you don't understand but believe you do. Like a third grader pretending they understand higher level math.

      <p>
       People in this subreddit will entertain you but please don't think you're uncovering anything. But if you're into this whole " alternate dimension" thing, DMT might be your thing. Although it doesn't actually teleport you to the realm of deities, some people think it does. Stories of DMT trips are fascinating to say the least,  just remember to remain sceptical.

       I'm not blabbing on about anything. I know much about the things I'm speaking on, thus why I said many times that the theory was wild and crazy and not even I believe it. But I wanted to entertain the fact of the idea of it, so I go along with the comments. I'm always stoned so that means nothing, you sound ignorant.

       Do you have a degree in theoretical physics? Any certifications that hold water? No? Then you don't know anything.

      <p>
       "String theory and different dimensions and what not..." makes you sound ignorant. Being able to recognize you don't know something is a sign of maturity and intelligence, acting like you know about things you don't isn't. Come on dude, like a stoned is going to have any idea about complex theoretical physics that people with PHDs are wracking their brains trying to figure out.

       No sir I do not have a degree in theoretical physics, not would I want one or NEED ONE to be an astrophysicist. I can learn everything I need to know from a library and what's available to me through other means. People who wrack their brains for PHDs(I highly respect) but think they are stupid because none of which is required to make you a renound astrophysicist, it's the theory's themselves. A PhD is just a piece of paper you hang on the fuckin wall let's be honest. All of my mentors say college is more toxic than anything you can do in our age, so they tell me to read books, and I do. Don't tell me I don't know something I'm deeply involved and interested in based off of one, me being stoned, and two a general statement made by me. But hey let the government steal your money while I get my knowledge from investigation, searching for answers, thinking critically.

       String theory is about as complex as a theory can get, so me saying "it made me think of string theory and other dimensions and whatnot" and you basing I know NOTHING of quantum mechanics, quantum gravity, or anything involving string theory. That's ignorant. But I don't need to establish my intelligence to someone who's clearly only intellectual.

       Actually your correct in one sense, I DONT know a thing about string theory, because nobody does. There are many different perceptions on the string theory and how quantum mechanics works because it's almost ALL THEORY, nothing can be proven, as far as i know. They are just looking for the answers to the questions in physics that we can't answer yet. Get off your high horse with your PhD. Because I don't care to hear about that. Obviously you think you know so much more about this than i, so please, enlighten me with your knowledge? Im a great learner.

       You have discovered a natural law called
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub4qi3Soyr8">
        mentalism.
       </a>
       It is very real and it is very profound.  Our thoughts are our connection with the higher realms.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a concerted effort to convince you that those thoughts are meaningless.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also sheds some light on why TPTB would embed certain mental images in our minds before actual events take place.

       That's not really how it works.  Mentalism is a principle of natural law.  It is one of many.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do accept it as truth.  Nothing around you that you can touch existed before it was once thought.  You take part in creation through the process of mentalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before something enters the material realm, it must first be imagined in the mind.  Everything you see is a sea of the same thing: energy and vibration.  We have the power to configure the world around us to materialize that which we think about.

       Ahh I see, so it's not much like that in that sense. Which is comforting. From what I gathered from the 4 hours I watched of his presentation it's pretty intriguing. But he made a pretty big emphasis on the fact TPTB didn't want us to know about this. But it doesn't seem like the information he was telling us was something they would hide... I may just not be far enough into the presentation.

       But think about what the main stream media encourages us to think about.  We are bombarded with fear porn.  The news is a compilation of the worst things that are happening in your area and around the world.  They don't want us to know that our thoughts matter because they want to continue to guide what the masses think about while convincing them that their thoughts don't matter.

       That I did soak in, well. Because I have no veil to the corruption in our world, as he said in the presentation some people have no barriers and believe and understand this right away and I feel as if I am one of those people. I also like that he doesn't denote any one god or religion but he acknowledges that there has to be a creater, and he put these natural laws into place and we have no ability to change these laws because they are similar to the law of gravity in a sense...

       Clearly you have an eye for this stuff because you identified a very important principle and also identified it as truth using only your own intuition.

       Strong intuition to me indicates that you are an "old soul."  Has anyone ever called you that?

       Growing up my teachers and family would call me an "old soul" or that I was "wise beyond my years."  I never really placed any meaning to it until a few years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       I often wonder if our soul (or self) actually chose this body to inhabit at this time for a reason.  I can't understand why the world we live in is so insane, but I believe there is a reason we are here to experience it.

       Man reading this just gave me chills. When I was pre-k and in elementary all of my teachers loved to keep me after class to just talk, and have adult conversations with them. They told me they'd never met a 4 year old who could hold on an adult conversation and fully understand everything about it, they loved talking to me. And now that you say that, I've always felt like my soul has been put into this for exactly as you said, to fulfill a purpose, yet I can't put my finger on what it is.....

       Now I'm perplexed. I feel as if I need to find my purpose and fulfill it. I've always and I mean ALWAYS questioned our societies principles, and felt a strong hatret for TPTB. I've known of the Illuminati, the bohemian Grove, the Rothschilds, the bilderberg society, I never knew why I was so compelled to these things cause the average person shrugs it off as crazy, or unbelievable because they trust the government so much. I just felt a thirst for knowledge and a way to help expose the corruption and save society, but I always knew it was bigger than me so I played my role. Now maybe I serve higher purpose than I could even imagine and I just haven't found my destiny...

       We are here to search for knowledge.  I can't remember who said it but I heard someone say that the "chills" that you feel up and down your spine is your higher self trying to tell you that you are on the right track by sending vibrations through your chakras.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your higher self is not a material being so it cannot communicate with you through material means.  We are ethereal beings having a material experience.  The fact is that our higher selves already know the truth, and when we get closer to it our higher self reaches out to us to ensure us that we are on the right track.  As we continue to discover these truths we gain a more intimate understanding of ourselves and of truth as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep searching, you and I have the benefit of receiving pleasure from obtaining truth.  Our society encourages us to indulge our bodies, but what we really should be doing is indulging our minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Knowledge is free, it is bodily indulgence that costs money, and it is also what keeps these psychopaths that created this rigged system in power.

       I knew my spiritual self and my tangible body weren't aligned, I just didn't know how to do anything about it, and maybe this could be the cause of my mental illnesses and distress, because my soul is unhappy not fulfilling it's true purpose? I don't know how to harness these things. Do you meditate? How can I align my celestial body with my soul? All these questions I ask myself yet have no answers or intuition on. Besides meditation, I feel as if I need to meditate, but I've never really been one fond of meditation. Just odd how one part of the brain wants one thing, and the other part of the brain wants something else. It really blows me away how if you put everything he says in his lectures together, it is almost like common sense...

       I think he nails it.  Your mind and body are separate.  It is your job to distinguish between your body and your mind.  Your mind is your true self, your body is merely the vehicle that allows you to experience the material world.

       I do meditate, not as much as a should because I am so consumed with my job and responsibilities which I find to be suffocating.  I find that my life runs much more smoothly during times that I make time to meditate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also do an exercise where I try to keep my thoughts as ideas and try not to limit them to words.  I try to formulate concepts and picture them in my "minds eye" beyond the limitations of language.  I believe by doing so we more clearly attract that which we think about.

       For me I don't know how big of an issue time is because I'm an insomniac, so I can manage. But it's interesting you say that because my room mate meditates, but doesn't know any of the shit I'm schpleeling about like conspiracies and such, but she speaks alot of the minds eye and how it can change a person's perception of reality. And how you said beyond limitation of language, that's fucking insane you say that because I've ALWAYS wondered, do different cultures think in the same language they speak? Well the obvious answer would be yes because that's all they know, but we aren't born with language we are taught it.. Maybe through advanced enlightenment we could have a universal language, a "conscious" language so to say.... But I'm gonna try reserving myself a bit more and try opening up my "mind's eye". Is there any way to exercise it so it comes almost second nature with practice? I know they say meditation is key, but aside from that...

       Sorry if I came off as rude when I read this I was on a computer and couldn't see the emoji. I'm just tired of on every post someone has to chime in about a single misspelled word.... I'll never understand.
