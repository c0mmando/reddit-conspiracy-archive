       It goes back to the verses added to the Talmud during the Babylonian captivity. Therein they angrily declared the right to kill "goyim" rape them over 3 years old, kill the best and brightest, use, abuse, poison, destroy, murder. Modern "believers" still tell themselves these documents permit such things without offending God. They now control the U.S. government and they're itching to start the apocalypse. "Blood as high as a horses bridle" is in the offing.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is the possibility the rest of us will categorize this miscreant bunch along with the "terrorist" the cabal is trying to sick us on to initiate the massive cull, unfortunately, they've plugged their blood funnels into all power centers.

       Inside secret - religious text is divine but politicians of ancient history have inserted false information which makes God look like a God of fire and brimstone, jealousy, murder, and hate, rather than love, understanding, peaceful, compassionate, and joyful. This was done so that the politicians could use brutal force against the people while justifying it by claiming God is the same way.
      </p>
      <p>
       This ancient lie turned into an ancient myth that has ruined many, many generations of lives and it still does because we still believe this lie unless one is an atheist.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the ultimate conspiracy and it has done much more harm than any conspiracy in history. It is deeply rooted in the subconscious and it even leads to humans treating humans like shit because we were led to believe that God treats us like that. Politicians have used this myth as their cornerstone to treat the general population brutally.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the world realizes that not ALL of the religious text is genuine, and begins to dissect religious text to cut the propaganda out of it, people will evolve spiritually which will replace the deep rooted belief systems in the subconscious mind that has led us to many fights, wars, genocides, and societal breakdowns. It might sound innocent, but, in my opinion, it is the single most devastating myth that ever existed.

       the question why are we here is a stupid one if you do not know what here is.
      </p>
      <p>
       First figure out what the universe is with science, it is the only honest option we have, the rest is tainted with human lies and stupidity. Only when we know what the universe is can we ask the question what god is. For how can we ask a question about god if we don't even know what he has build(edit: maybe god is the universe)?
      </p>
      <p>
       So in the mean time the question should be: what is here?
      </p>
      <p>
       We're here to ask that question.

       Or, you know, don't acknowledge ANY religion as a justification for anything. If you can't verify the authenticity of any religious documents it's not worth trying to live according to their religion if it may result in actions otherwise unacceptable to the rest of society.

       It's not the USA nor any other country. It's the way some humans are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Certain humans have a brain disorder that almost resembles psychopaths namely narcissism. Now the problem we humans have is that the way society is set up. We think that we need those structural layers, like boss&gt;manager&gt;worker and here lies the problem. Because we have a system where the top has relative more survival and reproduction options, most humans(because monkey sees monkey does) want to float too the top so to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Narcissists with psychopathic tendencies have way more chance too reach the top, they have less or no empathy, thus they are willing to harm a lost of people just to get there. So that's why we have a system that is filled with mostly narcissistic psychopaths that don't give a shit about who's below them.

       Yes but there is also something else going on now, globalisation. It used to be that if one leader was getting too strong etc you could go to him alone or with more and kill him so to say. now a days, with things like one big EU etc etc is that you don't know who the leaders is/are and you don't even know where they live. So countries should not be bigger then like lets say Belgium, Denmark or The Netherlands(all 3 the best in the world by happiness and freedom) That way we know who is who and where they live. The bigger it gets the harder it gets for the common folk to take actions when needed, that's why they all want these big unions everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       So break up all big ass nations into smaller ones. keep government local and sorry to say but Humanity needs to get fucking smarter cause in a whole we're some fucking stupid animals.

       I agree. I actually posted a comment on here maybe a night or two ago, that the US would be better off with improved City States much like ancient Greece, but based on principles learned from the US and lessons learned from history. I'm a voluntaryist and think City States where people can choose would be the best option, based on the non aggression principle. If you want socialism, cool, if you want anarcho-cap, cool.

       Create a system where the currency has a time limit. every cent above a certain amount, 100k or 1000k gets a time stamp and now you have one year to spend that money or else it get evenly divided and given to all.

       money is not personal property it is potential personal property. and if you store money, less potential is being pomped into the system thus less economy thus less wealth.

       Money is personal property for you exchanged work to retain that monetary compensation. That was work you did. It's personal property. Reap what you sow. I can hoard all the cash/gold I want, because it's my property. I have no obligation to "pump it back into the system". If you grow corn, you can eat it or sell it, your choice. Pretty elementary...

       the work you did allows you to get stuff in return, to make it easer we invented money. But money on it self is worth the paper it is printed on. You wouldn't make a couch out of money? Not only would it sit shitty but you could buy a really nice one with the amount you need to build it in the first place. So money is potential, nothing more nothing less and if every one would store all the potential instaid of converting it into something real makes no sense.

      <p>
       money is like the oil of the engine called economy, an engine where some of the parts use way more oil then is should is a bad engine.

       I could make a couch out of money (paper), it's called Papier-mâché. That being said, are we talking fiat or an actual sound currency system? Regardless though, it's not potential, it's dormant (my choosing). I could buy a boat tomorrow, or save for a year and buy 3 boats (and rent them out). Which would be better for the "economy"?

       Yes you could would be rather dumb would't you say? about 1 m³ of bills would be,even if it was 1€ or $, a hell lot of money.
      </p>
      <p>
       all curent currencies are fiat based thus they are not dormant ( inflation is sort of a time limit).

       this doesnt make sense. Buy a boat now or 3 in a year while saving is no comparison. you could buy one now and save for 2 more or even beter buy one now and buy an other when you have the money etc etc. This combined with inflation clearly is better for an economy than waiting a year and buying 3. you could even start to rent the first boat already and make extra so by the time the year is over you have 4 boats.

       This response shows me you are ignorant and economically illiterate. You stated give a time frame for people to spend money. Yet, if I did and bought 3 boats instead of 1 and rented it out to 3 people who used it to possibly fish, would provide more for the economy than if I just bought one.
      </p>

       You need to reassess and come back. Thank you, come again.

       no you are. you make a comparison between buying 1 now and 3 in a year and this comparison is wrong. its 1 now an other 1 in 6 months etc etc, one does not wait if the market is ready....

       No, you are. I could buy a boat right now for 50k, or I could save and accumulate more. Turn that 50k into 100k and buy 3 instead of one (initial purpose/investment). Invest, and rent the boats out. They produce fish and sell at the market. If I bought that boat for 50k, it would be me, fishing leisurly and for personal consumption.

       What about this are you not understanding? Are you in college? Have you ever ran a business? Junior, I've run 3, and sold each for profit. Reassess before you spout off. The internet is a diverse place ;)

       So you say wait a year and buy 3 then rent and I say buy one now start renting it out buy one in half a year start renting that out and buy 1 in a year but still you say you have a better business plan. Dream on pal it is clearly you who is missing some screws in the head.

       I completely agree except that some politicians are still heroes. The narcissist is very difficult to stop from ruining everything and giving them power is really bad. We need to scatter the power in a way that people hold them equally and have direct control over every single politician decision. The top down model is romantic but it simply does not function. We have tried it for thousands of years and damn near every single one of them fell apart. We need to try something new. A new type of democracy. An upgraded political system that works.

       Personally? No. Humans are humans, and nature is nature. Plus, the roots are too deep (imo). Check out the post on here about George Soros' son meeting with Obama at the son's home. This is just one example. Not saying he is the top of the pyramid, but this is a generational superiority and ruler-ship of shadow families/dynasties that even over rule that cancerous family. Just my thoughts and perspective. Could be wrong (hope I am actually). But, yea..

       Well at least you are still optimistic. That's good.
If you were certain, you would be a fool. 
Good to know what you don't know.

       You think people will reject this behavior eventually? Once the baby boomers die off?

        all curent currencies are fiat based thus they are not dormant ( inflation is sort of a time limit).

       Wasn't always the case, so why is it now ;) ?

        this doesnt make sense. Buy a boat now or 3 in a year while saving is no comparison. you could buy one now and save for 2 more or even beter buy one now and buy an other when you have the money etc etc. This combined with inflation clearly is better for an economy than waiting a year and buying 3. you could even start to rent the first boat already and make extra so by the time the year is over you have 4 boats.

       This response shows me you are ignorant and economically illiterate. You stated give a time frame for people to spend money. Yet, if I did and bought 3 boats instead of 1 and rented it out to 3 people who used it to possibly fish, would provide more for the economy than if I just bought one.

       You need to reassess and come back. Thank you, come again.
