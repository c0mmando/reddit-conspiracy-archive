<p>President Snow: Seneca... why do you think we have a winner?</p>

<p>Seneca Crane: [frowns] What do you mean?</p>

<p>President Snow: I mean, why do we have a winner? I mean, if we just wanted to intimidate the districts, why not round up twenty-four of them at random and execute them all at once? Be a lot faster.</p>

<p>President Snow: Hope.</p>

<p>Seneca Crane: Hope?</p>

<p>President Snow: Hope. It is the only thing stronger than fear. A little hope is effective. A lot of hope is dangerous. A spark is fine, as long as it&#39;s contained.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Primarily Democracy</p>

<p>In my own view is that the EU is undemocratic at its core — or more accurately that it is anti-democratic. You need only look at the EU’s reaction to previous referenda to see this in action. When the 2005 referenda on the EU Constitution ended up largely ignored with the promulgation of the Lisbon Treaty (the abscene of the Supremacy Clause being perhaps the only well-known difference), this should have become clear, and if not then then certainly by the time of the Irish referndum on the latter, where the response was to force the holding of a second referendum. Evidently, democracy only suits certain elements of the EU when the “right” result is given.</p>

<p>This lack of Democracy will only accelerate as time goes on.</p>

<p>You guys have major problems to deal with, and now will no longer be a vigilant ally to the US (not that I like our government). </p>

<p>Sadiq Khan needs to be ousted and quickly. 
Half of London&#39;s population is Muslim. Londonistan can&#39;t be aloud to be created. If Greece, Italy and Spain leave, Eastern Europe could leave and ally with Russia. Even Greece, Turkey, or Spain could. Germany and the rest of the EU are not trustworthy either. </p>

<p>Britain and France, our only real allies, are being dismantled, just as the American populace is neutered and &quot;diversified.&quot; </p>

<p>I hope the people of Britain will hold their own against the Muslim invasion and the Russian occupation. For your own sakes. </p>

Do some reading &amp; don&#39;t fall for scare tactics: For a Start see:</h2>

<p>The Vienna Convention of 1969, which says that the termination of a treaty &quot;does not affect any right, obligation or legal situation of the parties created through the execution of the treaty prior to its termination.” The House of Commons Library says that &quot;withdrawing from a treaty releases the parties from any future obligations to each other, but does not affect any rights or obligations acquired under it before withdrawal.&quot;</p>

<p>In other words, Brits who have already exercised their right to live in EU states can expect to keep that right after Brexit. The same goes for any EU citizen Who has settled in the UK.</p>

<hr/>

<p>This is not an immigration Issue for me it&#39;s a democracy issue. The EU is undemocratic to it&#39;s core. Ive typed enough for you my friend, google the inner workings of the EU &amp; what a democracy actually is.</p>
