        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Check out this old British guy with an an awesome name, lord James of blackheath, as he breaks a HUGE possible banking conspiracy.  He speculates that a 3 letter government agency has gone rogue and is either seeking a 15 trillion euro payout or is attempting to launder tons of money via various banks.  </p>

<p>Also, he mentions a man named Johannes (something). I can&#39;t understand the last name because sound quality is poor on my phone.  Can anyone assist me with this?  I&#39;m unfamiliar with the name and if he is rich as he says he is I&#39;d like to know more about him.</p>

<p>Commonly thought to be Foundation X. Same protocols for contact.</p>

<p>I once trolled them as a Royal aide and they rode along for a while eventually asking for money. It&#39;s an advance fee fraud.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In about 2009 I read about them, looked at their website and though that they couldn&#39;t possibly be real. I had a few hours to kill so set up a new email account in the name of a senior royal aide (Miles Hunt-Davis) who was then the private secretary to Prince Philip, the Queens husband and sent them an enquiry on behalf of a &#39;notable public figure&#39; hoping that they would make the connection.</p>

<p>I stated that I was investing a huge amount of cash from various slightly shady deals and would like their help in making those investments confidentially to prevent any connection to my principal (Prince Philip).</p>

<p>They responded thus:</p>

<p><em>Thank you for your communication of which the content is duly noted.</em></p>

<p><em>Can I request that you provide us with a complete definitive report /
resume of your funds to enable us to undertake a full due
diligence, following the completion of which we will revert back to you.</em></p>

<p><em>Should the requested report prove to be substantial in size, please send
same by UPS to our Correspondence Receiving Office as follows:-</em></p>

<p><em>Suite 905,</em>
<em>AEK Udon, Blg. B,</em>
<em>Phosri Road,</em>
<em>Udon Thani, 41000,</em>
<em>Thaland.</em></p>

<p><em>We look forward to your response. In the meantime, we remain,</em></p>

<p><em>Yours faithfully</em></p>

<p><em>K. Phonsen</em>
<em>Administrative Manager</em></p>

<p><em>For and on behalf of:-</em></p>

<p><em>D.A.Sale.F.LLA.</em>
<em>Deputy Chief of the Council for the Cabinet</em>
<em>Special Global Envoy, Senior Commercial Advisor to H.E. The Chairman,</em>
<em>The Office of International Treasury Control,</em>
<em>UN Charter Control No: 10-60847</em></p>

<p>I then responded that the package had been sent and I awaited their reply but wanted to talk to someone on the phone. I had an old mobile number and gave them that. They didn&#39;t want to talk just yet and wanted to discuss an arrangement fee of $5000, just to show my seriousness. It would obviously be refunded (or course it would). It had to be sent Western Union because they didn&#39;t trust the regular banks...</p>

<p>So I sent a fake WU receipt (photoshopped from a 419 forum) for a location in the same city but on the other site with a stupid password like &#39;i am a cup of tea. drink me&#39;.</p>

<p>Several emails went back and forth over a few days and I used different WU locations as they went to the various WU agents to try and cash this money and eventually they stopped responding. I said we should meet in London next time and there was no reply for a while until my old mobile number got a voicemail from an angry Asian man threatening me with high level retaliations and being blacklisted by the UN. </p>

<p>In all an amusing few hours. I hopefully wasted more time for them.</p>

<p>Edit : Added a bit more.</p>

<p>Edit2 : If you are interested in this whole scam sector why not try googling &quot;Global Collateral Accounts&quot;. This is the backbone to a whole network of scammers and fraudsters based around the notion that there are trillions of USD in some bank accounts just waiting to be used for mankind. </p>

<p>There are many scammers who claim to be on the trail of these accounts, mixing real news in with their own stories. Men such as <a href="http://neilkeenan.com">http://neilkeenan.com</a>, <a href="http://benjaminfulford.typepad.com/">http://benjaminfulford.typepad.com/</a> and many others. NESARA is another key word. Be warned, it&#39;s a rabbit hole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yes they are scammers but very complex and plausible ones. They go for the big score, not a few hundred dollars.</p>

<p>The Lord speaking about them was probably taken in a little bit but the Lords do have a reputation for frivolous and humorous debate.</p>
