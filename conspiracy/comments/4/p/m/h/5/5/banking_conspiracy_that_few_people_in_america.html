       Check out this old British guy with an an awesome name, lord James of blackheath, as he breaks a HUGE possible banking conspiracy.  He speculates that a 3 letter government agency has gone rogue and is either seeking a 15 trillion euro payout or is attempting to launder tons of money via various banks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, he mentions a man named Johannes (something). I can't understand the last name because sound quality is poor on my phone.  Can anyone assist me with this?  I'm unfamiliar with the name and if he is rich as he says he is I'd like to know more about him.

       I once trolled them as a Royal aide and they rode along for a while eventually asking for money. It's an advance fee fraud.

       In about 2009 I read about them, looked at their website and though that they couldn't possibly be real. I had a few hours to kill so set up a new email account in the name of a senior royal aide (Miles Hunt-Davis) who was then the private secretary to Prince Philip, the Queens husband and sent them an enquiry on behalf of a 'notable public figure' hoping that they would make the connection.
      </p>
      <p>
       I stated that I was investing a huge amount of cash from various slightly shady deals and would like their help in making those investments confidentially to prevent any connection to my principal (Prince Philip).

       They responded thus:

       I then responded that the package had been sent and I awaited their reply but wanted to talk to someone on the phone. I had an old mobile number and gave them that. They didn't want to talk just yet and wanted to discuss an arrangement fee of $5000, just to show my seriousness. It would obviously be refunded (or course it would). It had to be sent Western Union because they didn't trust the regular banks...
      </p>
      <p>
       So I sent a fake WU receipt (photoshopped from a 419 forum) for a location in the same city but on the other site with a stupid password like 'i am a cup of tea. drink me'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several emails went back and forth over a few days and I used different WU locations as they went to the various WU agents to try and cash this money and eventually they stopped responding. I said we should meet in London next time and there was no reply for a while until my old mobile number got a voicemail from an angry Asian man threatening me with high level retaliations and being blacklisted by the UN.
      </p>
      <p>
       In all an amusing few hours. I hopefully wasted more time for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit : Added a bit more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit2 : If you are interested in this whole scam sector why not try googling "Global Collateral Accounts". This is the backbone to a whole network of scammers and fraudsters based around the notion that there are trillions of USD in some bank accounts just waiting to be used for mankind.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many scammers who claim to be on the trail of these accounts, mixing real news in with their own stories. Men such as

       </a>
       ,
       <a href="http://benjaminfulford.typepad.com/">

       </a>
       and many others. NESARA is another key word. Be warned, it's a rabbit hole.
