       The New World Order will have a banking monopoly and the biggest  international corporations at the top, not governments. The near  monopoly on the creation of money is still intact. The only serious holdouts are  Syria, Iran and North Korea.

       That's a little optimistic. The governments run on money they borrow from banks making them debt slaves, just like the rest of us.

       I disagree. This is most likely all going according to plan. Britain getting out to set the EU up for the fall. Governments, corporations and banks operate in a 'revolving door' capacity. Do a little stint at a bank, get on a few boards, then work those connections into a government or political appointment as part of the public sector, then return to the private sector (bank, law, corporation, foundation). The laws and regs are purposely made vague so that the private sector can get around them. These people write the policy. They aren't getting surprised and put on their heels here, in my opinion.

       I think many of us overestimate these people. Yes, they are uncomprehendingly rich. Yes, they pull all the strings. But, they are human too. And humans get complacent. Especially when everything has been going according to plan and they're in the final run of an uncontested plan.
      </p>

       They failed at this. They thought the vote was a good idea to gain totality of social legitimacy. They still allow voting because it's easy enough for them to throw an election by shifting a few percentage points, they almost always win... This was their power play (allowing the challenge) but failed because they overestimated traditional propaganda... Many people are waking up. If they aren't fully awoke, they're coming out of unconsciousness.

       Hey, a little respect here. Trying to corral the entire world into a slave state is no easy task. It takes time, effort and lots of perseverance.  These guys may have suffered a set back but they're not the type to give up after controlling and owning only 99% of the world's resources.  More than likely, they'll lick their wounds, wait a while, make another plan and have us all enslaved by 2017, 2018 tops.    you just do your part and cast your vote for Hillary. We all have to do our part o else we'll never be safe. Or free.

       Do you think they lost power in WW2? No, instead they profit from the conflict, from both sides. All part of the plan.

       Dude they have so much invested in land value that if a world war starts, and the UK was lumped in the EU, the elite would lose a lot in the restructuring post war... it's to protect the common wealth from the post war world unification plan. The people didn't win...

       Everyone always portrays the nwo /illuminati/tptb as this giant juggernaut of a group that just wins wins wins.  I don't think that's the case.  Sometimes another groupe or  organization bests them, sometimes their plan just doesn't work as well or the way they wanted.  And yes, even the normal people manage, sometimes accidentally sometimes on purpose (see brexit), to beat them.

       Where I'm from in The UK, we relied heavily on EU funding. Their financial support saved my city from financial and social ruin after disastrous cuts in the eighties.
       <br/>
       The result is considered a huge disappointment and I am seriously considering my options of a different country.

       Was their financial support in the form of gifts of money or were they more along the lines of resource backed loans? If they were the former, good. But if they were for the latter, no help was given, you were just tricked into giving away your resources for a temporary delay in the inevitable.
