    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. This is most likely all going according to plan. Britain getting out to set the EU up for the fall. Governments, corporations and banks operate in a &#39;revolving door&#39; capacity. Do a little stint at a bank, get on a few boards, then work those connections into a government or political appointment as part of the public sector, then return to the private sector (bank, law, corporation, foundation). The laws and regs are purposely made vague so that the private sector can get around them. These people write the policy. They aren&#39;t getting surprised and put on their heels here, in my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think many of us overestimate these people. Yes, they are uncomprehendingly rich. Yes, they pull all the strings. But, they are human too. And humans get complacent. Especially when everything has been going according to plan and they&#39;re in the final run of an uncontested plan.</p>

<p>They failed at this. They thought the vote was a good idea to gain totality of social legitimacy. They still allow voting because it&#39;s easy enough for them to throw an election by shifting a few percentage points, they almost always win... This was their power play (allowing the challenge) but failed because they overestimated traditional propaganda... Many people are waking up. If they aren&#39;t fully awoke, they&#39;re coming out of unconsciousness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, a little respect here. Trying to corral the entire world into a slave state is no easy task. It takes time, effort and lots of perseverance.  These guys may have suffered a set back but they&#39;re not the type to give up after controlling and owning only 99% of the world&#39;s resources.  More than likely, they&#39;ll lick their wounds, wait a while, make another plan and have us all enslaved by 2017, 2018 tops.    you just do your part and cast your vote for Hillary. We all have to do our part o else we&#39;ll never be safe. Or free. </p>
