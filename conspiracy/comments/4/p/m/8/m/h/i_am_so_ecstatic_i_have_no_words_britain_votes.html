    <div class="md"><p>So there&#39;s two outcomes here.
1. Today was a victory, Britts took their destiny back and refused to be a part of the world domination scheme of our planet&#39;s ruling elite. Now other EU members will opt to leave and return to sovereign states which will allow the people to regain control. This will pave the way for Americans to elect a third party candidate and finally end the fed. </p>

<p>Or</p>

<ol>
<li>Today was a loss. Britts were once again distracted and voted against their best interests. The U.K. Will start enacting various programs which were impossible while a member of the EU like 24 hour country wide surveillance, mass immigration, wage depression (slave labor), fixing their currency, market manipulation etc etc etc. this will in turn permit the govt to induce more false flags will turn the UK into the one we see in V for Vendetta. The US will follow suit thanks to presidents like Killary.</li>
</ol>

<p>Either outcome supports the theory that the rich own this planet and have done an outstanding job at keeping it a secret. Either way we&#39;re fucked. Sooner or later you have to help wake up everyone you know.... We won&#39;t change this planet with a vote, we need to bring the whole system down.</p>

<p>sure EU is a undemocratic piece of shit government, but are local governments really that much better? the one from my country surely isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>and i don&#39;t think the <em>elites</em> care that much either, sure it hurts NWO <em>a bit</em> but let&#39;s get real here, the biggest problem of NWO surely isn&#39;t UK and EU, what about a hundred other countries who will <em>surely</em> say no to NWO ?</p>

<p>this is all bullshit if you ask and on top of that, government isn&#39;t obliged by the referendum results anyways and they haven&#39;t left yet if they even will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. The MSM is overblowing the stock markets dips and the currency fluctuations, which will reinforce it and likely lead to more fear which will in turn push the stock markets lower, etc.</p>

<p>There&#39;s an MSM push to paint it in the scariest and most ominous way possible. It&#39;ll be in the EU&#39;s interest to punish the UK. So we might see a protracted recession forced onto the UK by the globalists which includes Obama and Trudeau.</p>

<p>This could be a trade boom for the US and Canada, should the EU react badly towards the UK, but Obama and Trudeau likely will pile on, hurting their own economies in the meantime.</p>

<p>It&#39;s gonna be an interesting couple of years for sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is how they move the global economic collapse into its next phase, an accelerated one at that. By Fall of 2016, we will see a laundry list of European countries holding their own referendums. Scotland to leave the UK, Netherlands, France... All the European countries are outraged most recently by the forcing of refugees into them. They had no say. They want the ability to &quot;vote&quot; on such decisions instead of an overbearing governing body. They will all want their own separation.</p>

<p>It makes no difference though. </p>

<p>This is what the authority wanted.</p>

<p>Renewed sense of nationalism.</p>

<p>I believe this is the beginning of accelerated fears and turmoil in the global economic landscape. </p>

<p>With Britain leading the charge. </p>

<p>Stay vigilant and prep. </p>

<p>Do something to piss them off enough, (forced refugees / immigration) at the EU level, so they all don&#39;t have a say. </p>

<p>That was the catalyst.</p>

<p>Then get Britain to spearhead the exodus. He separation. The People have had enough. They are inundated with Muslims and fear in Europe.</p>

<p>Fan the flames of ISIS and Muslim hatred. </p>

<p>Give the people the false hope that by being &quot;separate&quot; you have more voting power. No overbearing governing body like the EU.</p>

<p>Bullshit. All of it.</p>

<p>Unless we rise up, and see all of this orchestration, we&#39;re fucked.</p>

<p>The global economic landscape is what is on the chopping block right now as we speak. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course they are! People have become so short sighted, and distracted, by design I remind you, to forget what happened as little as 6 months ago.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not referring to any event in particular, I&#39;m merely expressing that people are failing to connect the dots anymore.</p>

<p>Truly, </p>

<p>What do you all think the next 6 months will look like?</p>

<p>Country after country wishing to hold their own referendums to separate from the EU.</p>

<p>All of this will be cataclysmic for the global economy / markets. </p>

<p>Pushing us towards a one world currency. </p>

<p>I suspect an increase in fake terror attacks, either in severity or frequency. </p>

<p>If all of these countries are now free of an overbearing body, the EU, they can take matters into their own hands so to speak to &quot;wage the war on terror&quot; in the comfort of their now &quot;independent borders&quot;. </p>

<p>The Race wars will begin. </p>

<p>The fascist nationalist governments will wage war on their own people. </p>

<p>As the economic landscape crumbles and tensions and terror rise, what do think will happen?</p>

<p>We&#39;re on an accelerated timeline now. </p>

For people like you and I who can see these games being played, the moves make more sense. The average person will see a global recession as the result of whoever is in power at the moment. Look at how many people blame Obama for the recession. The guy has many faults but that is not one of them, prolonging it maybe, but it was created before him. </p>
