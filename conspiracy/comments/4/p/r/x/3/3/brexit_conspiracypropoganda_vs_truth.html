       There are multiple posts with 2k+ upvotes saying "The Richest People in the World lost 127 Billion dollars", or "Global Stock Markets Lost 2 Trillion Dollars"  because of Brexit. I have a decent understanding of the stock market(my dad traded every day, and taught me the basics before he died). The biggest point he made to me is that the stock market is a Zero-Sum Game. That is, in order for somebody to make money, somebody has to lose money.
I'm curious how people can say that "the rich people lost money", when I'm sure many of them were properly short-selling, and hedging areas affected by Brexit.
I'm curious how people can say "Global Stock Markets Lost 2 Trillion Dollars", when the Stock Market Does not work that way. The Value was either added in other markets, or currencies absorbed the value.
I feel like this is a bunch of propaganda, used to make people think that NOBODY wanted the Brexit at the top(or at least the Central Bankers did not).
      </p>
      <p>
       In reality, massive CHANGES in wealth happened, not massive LOSSES. And i'm sure that the people who follow markets closely could easily have profited off of this. While many people DID lose value in their investments, it was most likely mostly affective of Retirement plans, 401k's etc, where people do not actively control their money, and did not hedge in time. This means Brexit more than likely "Moved" money from 401k's, Pension Funds, Retirement Plans, etc, which did not properly short term hedge, and TO rich people who knew how to properly hedge. Despite what is being spewed out of propoganda mouthpieces, the POOR lost money, while a few ELITE who properly hedged acquired all of this wealth from the POOR(mostly from Pensions, 401ks, Retirement Plans, etc)
I don't think laymen understand. In order for a person to make a profit in the stock market off of trading, somebody else has to take a loss, and vica versa. If people lost 2 trillion "dollars", somewhere 2 trillion "dollars" in value was added.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think G.B.(The monarchy, and Central Banks) wanted to leave the EU to form another Union.  This one will be with USA, Canada(G.B. crown country), Australia(G.B. crown country), Japan(Tpp Partner), and others, who are not able to join the European Union, due to Geography.  Eventually this new Partnership, will combine with the E.U.(and probably change its name to "Global Union", or something like that) This is how I think the one world gov't will happen.  Great Britain is probably the only Country that the USA would ever be willing to enter a "European Union" style agreement with, and I think this is the reason, why the Brits left.  It's not because they dislike these big one world gov't bodies.  It's because they want to create another, to expand it.

       Central Banker Rothschild was begging the UK to stay in the EU just days before the vote, but I think you are right about the Monarchy, they would love nothing more than to bring back the focus on the commonwealth; the EU was making them weaker.

       In a time when "anti-establishment", and "anti-elite" notions are majority public sentiment, what better endorsement of the Brexit is there than to have the Central Bankers, Globalists, David Cameron, etc, be against it?  It seems to me that David Cameron, and the whole establishment, Central Bankers included wanted this, and played the public like a fiddle.  If the people hate you, and you want something to happen, just say you support the opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like with Trump in America.  The Bushes, and Establishment have made this whole charade, in which they hate Trump(yet he gets more free air time given to him by ALL American media than anybody I've seen in my life).  This is because in America, a vast majority of citizens(and an even greater majority of Republicans), are voting against the establishment.  The fact that the Bushes will not endorse trump is a PLUS for his campaign.  Trump is surrounding himself with tons of Bush people.  Bush helped Israel Greatly.  Trump is heavily entrenched with Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       By making it seem like Trump and Bush(and the Establishment the Bush Dynasty Represents) are at odds, they have garnered more support for Trump than if the Bushes had endorsed him from the start.  This, however does not change the fact that Trump will be surrounded by the same people, and working for the same foreign/globalist interests that the Bushes served so loyally.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, even though David Cameron, and the globalists(and Central Bankers) were the one who STARTED the referendum in the first place, they have tricked you into thinking they were against it all along.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's very simple.  If the public hates you, and you want something to happen, just pretend to support the opposite.

       I would be inclinded to agree with you, but the EU is the elites wet dream. It allows appointed individuals to make unpopular decisions without taking flak by being so far above the vote taken by the people. It is a tactic to seperate the people who really have the power, from the people who want or need someone to blame. While a federation of states can succeed I dont think it can with the way the EU was set to run.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reasons for the elite to want remain was pretty paramount I'm curious as to your theory on why the elite would really want people to vote brexit and used their support for bremain as a means to make it happen. What is the end game?

       I said it in my post.  The USA will not join the E.U.(and thus the 1 world gov't) because there is a stigma against Europe in the USA.  However, the USA is culturally similar to Britain, and has respect for them that surpasses respect for all other European nations.  It is possible that the UK/Globalists/Central Bankers are creating another "Union", with North America, and some parts of Asia/Pacific.  If Great Britian was still in the E.U. the US and others would not feel that the U.K. is fully committed to the new "union".   Great Britain joined the E.U. to help it in its infancy(as well as arguably creating it).  They've also helped create the African Union, which is very powerful.  Now that the E.U. is all grown up, they are leaving, to start the North American/Pacific Union, or whatever it will be called.  Then, from there, it's just a matter of combining these Unions, and making them work in a world gov't/court.  That's how I see the "end game".  It's all about getting more nationstates to join into this internationally governed alliance.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think just because Great Britain left means they don't want these Unions to prosper.  I think they're jump-starting the North American Union, and giving it some credibility, and economic viability, and guidance(similar to what they did with African Union, and European Union).  There's really not much change for G.B. in terms of leaving the E.U.  They're still a trade partner, and probably won't even be penalized that much for leaving.  It just can't SEEM like Great Britain is leaving on purpose, to go start another union.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a few years, we'll see what happens for sure.

       Right. But with a new union popping up wouldn't the EU, and its otherwise downward spiral with whats happened with Greece, The refugee crisis, and now brexit that the people will see it as another E.U. and reject being apart of it?
      </p>
      <p>
       While i can see a scenario you painted played out, I see the one problem for the assumed North American Union to be people being able to reflect on it as already set to fail if this Brexit takes the EU's downwars spiral down to far.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're right; America would never join the EU, and i don't think for that matter our supreme court would rule it constitutional to create a north American Union. You would also have the succession of states gaining tremendous support from the people who already feel federal government has extended its reach (states like Texas, Florida, Alabama etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       In short I think it would put to much at risk for the elite to establish a new E.U. for the north America's, and the push could otherwise create civil war.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see Brexit as the elite thinking they had more power then they actually have. It feels more like a tortoise and hare type scenario where insteadrigging votes etc., they had faith in their manipulation and propaganda, and it shows people are finally fed up with it, andare no longer listening to it anymore.

       Well, they aren't calling it the E.U.  They're calling it the TPP, and they're doing it in secret(sort of).  I'm sure you're aware of it.  The TPP is one of 5 treaties that are part of the current plan.  They passed fast tracking in USA for 5 years(that means no need to publicly debate).  The American people may not currently be in favor of such a system(as many in Europe were not at the time of the E.U's inception).  But, the youth is being propagandized with the idea the Europe(and thus the E.U.) does everything better, and that socialism is the answer.  As the old die, and the new generations of propagandized youth grow into a majority, it will become easier(every year, millions of baby boomer voters are dying off).  Combine this with the fact that they have ALREADY passed fast tracking for 5 years for the TPP(and the 4 coming parts), and I think it is a LIKELY assertion, that the TPP, and its 4 other parts will result in a E.U. like scenario, in the near future.  From what we know about the TPP, it already supersedes the constitution, and foreign judges have more power than federal/state ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying it's right.  It's just what's goin on.  American Federal Judges have already ruled that international courts, which are created by treaties that the USA legitimately signs onto are parallel to the constitution.  I don't agree with the rulings, but it is the current precedent in the USA, meaning the TPP, or any E.U. like plans will not likely be stopped by the courts(because they already allow FISA, international intelligence courts to be parallel to the constitution).

       and TPP is a trade agreement which even though has the potential to be a consolidation of power still lacks that political arm of a federation that we see with the E.U.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the most part i am inclinded to believe you because i always like scratching my beard and wondering if things are what they seem. However from what we've seen in the last 40 years from the E.U. it has been a slow power grab where the top officials are not blamed for the unpopular decisions made by the people at the top; instead the elected officials take flak and it's blown over the next time something big happens in geopolitics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm glad you are keeping your skepticism, because some of us have to. I for one think this puts TPP on the back burner because more pressing matters have occured. Let's see what happens; This referendum could be the catalyst that pulls the E.U. apart which in turn would cause so much bureaucratic chaos that i don't think TTP will be on anyone's agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day all we can do is wait and watch. I feel like there is something big on the horizon; who knows this might be a move to anticipate the next market crash that's expected next year. Regaurdless; this is one hell of a time to be alive.

It was an election promise he made to try and stop the growing grass roots support for UKIP,  which was dragging a lot of votes away from the Conservative Party, and to prevent more back bench MPs defecting to UKIP. After giving Scotland a referendum regarding self determination, he placed himself in a position where it would have been hypocritical to refuse the rest of the Union a similar say in our future in the EU.

       The Rothschilds aka Bauers controlled all the Wealth of the European monarchies for centuries. In fact, all the european Monarchies are heavily indebted to Rothschilds since the 1750s . You still think it was Oliver Cromwell who overthrew the King in England? The Rothschild's overthrew King Charles, and the rest of the European monarchies got the message. It was the first powerful move to dominate the World. Henceforth, they had enough wealth to crush any nation and Kings.They became the hidden Kings puppeteering other monarchies and nations around the World. In this way they can remove any politician King or leader by financing a popular uprising or revolt. And Since they are the invisible hands, no one could point any fingers at them or direct any blame on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The UK monarchy is a worthless symbol of the past, they are frontline workers of a powerful hidden Zionist family. The Rothschild's may have decided to seperate London from the rest of the financial mess they created and inflated to collapse or Brexit isnt worth the paper they voted on and is just symbolic. The system may colapse before Britain even gets to gather the paperwork to leave legally.

       The Commonwealth??? Since when has the Commonwealth been relevant?? It's a relic of the colonial age. The UK ranks as Australia's 7th largest trading partner behind NZ and Singapore, and we are not going to suddenly jump back into bed with them now that they have split from the EU. If anything it will probably finally persuade the Australia people to have another referendum on becoming a republic like the Scots and maybe even Northern Ireland. The Commonwealth is about as relevant as Johnny Manziel is to the NFL!!

       Brexit was rigged from the start, as I got to find out everyone up to Breitbart are frauds thats why it always got polled as a tie or remain win and also why we saw no exit polls, that would have truly shown shocking numbers I think.

       But now everyone is happy, all those in the know had long prepared and us the workers think we had a victory over these darned globalists by turning it into a win and everyone is too busy jerking each other off to look at voting fraud going on and realize we got played from the start.

       And if the REMAIN won, everyone in this sub would be saying, "the globalists rigged it!" This sub is certified retarded with comments like this. How does Britain leaving the EU benefit the NWO or the banking elite? How does it benefit the globalists in Brussels? It doesn't. Not everything is completely controlled and masterfully manipulated by occult wizards behind closed doors. When you believe this shit, it takes your own power away from you because you don't think you have any chance of winning. That's what elites want.
      </p>
      <p>
       Britain just stood up for itself against the NWO and won. Conspiracy should be celebrating. Instead, there's a bunch of people that now... support(?) the EU/NOW globalization plan. The Brexit has truly brought the morons out of the woodwork.

       It is naive to think the global elite would leave anything up for grabs. Including the freedom of anyone on this planet. If you think a large issue like this is purely negative for the global elite then you're naive.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people have controlled the world for over 80 years now. They will not play by the rules. This is not monopoly, this is a power game where the global elite
       <em>
        has
       </em>
       monopoly on power. It doesn't matter if everything points towards a loss for the global elite, when you own the whole game, you cannot lose.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not that they rigged it, it's that it was indifferent from the start. The people believe they made a difference, they didn't.
       <em>
        If
       </em>
       this affected the global elite's plans then it's like a pebble compared to Africa. Their resources are close to infinite.

       Would you not agree that the powers at be would include themselves in political and economical matters across the globe if they could? By that I mean it is naive think there is a place they would not include themselves on this planet. Clearly they were very well aware of the brexit issue for years now and since they're aware of how manipulative, expensive and worthless the EU really is they prepared for the date when nations leave the EU. I believe it is very naive to believe they would just sit back and relax whilst people of the world vote them out of their lives.

       It's a hypothetical question to you. My beliefs is that they can because I am not willing to limit their reach because nobody could not simply know where they could have a finger involved in the game. I would also argue that
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       (my beliefs is not reality, which is why I use "if") they could involve themselves in economical games across the globe, would it not be in their interests? There are countless methods to involve your politics behind the scenes and I am sure we all are aware of this. Why is it safe to say they're not involved in a post-brexit UK just because UK is not part of the European Union?
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now I can only assume that you believe every single politician that is in favor of UK without EU is sincere in not having big corporations legislate laws in UK because this is essentially one of the core parts of leaving EU, bringing back democracy. However, this is putting limit on the big corporations which(in my beliefs) can manipulate the politics in UK with or without EU. That's what I meant when I said it is naive to think they would leave anything up for grabs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am in favor of removing EU from all European nations but that doesn't mean everyone in our nations have our best interests at heart. I am not trying to cause a ruckus or anything, I just feel you're celebrating a tad early and that's all.

       I believe this too. My beliefs is far from many people here but maybe some here share my beliefs that most(if not all) large changes in politics and economics is(if not rigged) made in favor of the global elite. There are no way people in their position would stand by as the world they created crumble. They will be at every corner of the world and if they cannot be there, they will be there by other means. Be that with spies, infiltration or other means.

       I tend to agree with you. Although it seems like TPTB wouldn't want a Brexit to occur. It seems unlikely that it would have happened if they did not. I find myself wondering, also, if perhaps the reason that the UK was never made to go Euro is a sign that they were always intended to leave.

       They fucking rigged it as hard as they could in favor of stay and it wasn't enough , for fuck sake,  you had a "52% STAY poll " broadcasted on all MSM channels during the entire referendum already impregnating the narrative that Brexit lost, even though exit polls are illegal.

       They must have got what they wanted. The UK is divided. Either way, TPTB will benefit. They rule. The politicians are pawns, and we are slaves.
You do know that this isn't the end anyway. It will go on for 2 years, or perhaps more. Cameron said that he would invoke article 50 of the Lisbon treaty if "Leave" won. This takes at least 2 years of negotiations. There is nothing preventing a second referendum after that time.
Britain is divided over this decision. Isn't that a success for them anyway?

       Right. But with a new union popping up wouldn't the EU, and its otherwise downward spiral with whats happened with Greece, The refugee crisis, and now brexit that the people will see it as another E.U. and reject being apart of it?
      </p>
      <p>
       While i can see a scenario you painted played out, I see the one problem for the assumed North American Union to be people being able to reflect on it as already set to fail if this Brexit takes the EU's downwars spiral down to far.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're right; America would never join the EU, and i don't think for that matter our supreme court would rule it constitutional to create a north American Union. You would also have the succession of states gaining tremendous support from the people who already feel federal government has extended its reach (states like Texas, Florida, Alabama etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       In short I think it would put to much at risk for the elite to establish a new E.U. for the north America's, and the push could otherwise create civil war.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see Brexit as the elite thinking they had more power then they actually have. It feels more like a tortoise and hare type scenario where insteadrigging votes etc., they had faith in their manipulation and propaganda, and it shows people are finally fed up with it, andare no longer listening to it anymore.
