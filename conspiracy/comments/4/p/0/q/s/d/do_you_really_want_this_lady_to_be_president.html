       What does not voting accomplish?  Instead of 33% voting you make it what?  28% voting.  Congratulations.  You've made a mark on history by being invisible and accomplishing nothing in absenteeism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with the idea that it's pointless, but you have to participate symbolically to let history know the will of the people, and how that was continually raped away from us each and every time.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you really want change, you should find a way to convince the Congress and Supreme Court to reverse the Continuity of Government Plan modality that is non-constitutional deep state governance and step the country down from the 9/11 state of emergency.  It's only been

       You lost me here. If the vote is inherently pointless, how does it in any way - even symbolically - represent the will of the people. Not voting or voting third party en masse is the only way to show dissatisfaction with two bad choices, otherwise participation indicates tacit approval.

       oh my god individualism is so rampant people can't actually comprehend the aggregate voting populace as a HUGE and IMPACTING thing, because they still feel invisible. Our arrogant entitlement will kill us. This selfish delusion is the problem.

       Not voting and voting third party are two entirely different things. The "en masse" bit is a ridiculous condition. You only have one vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do mostly agree anyway, though in the overall point. The biggest reason I vote is to avoid having to justify that my political opinion is still valid without voting.

       I don't think it is, OP did. I was trying to figure out his logic. But you could easily argue that Republicans are protesting a bit too much and too loudly on Trump considering how weak his opponents were and how accurate his views align with the angry nationalist base the GOP has been tapping every mid term election since 2002.

       How does voting matter with the electoral college and vote rigging? Capitulation to a failed system is enablement. I'd rather not vote,  not trade by their rules or consent to their ill gotten authority.

       Maybe not income but we all pay medicare/medicaid/social security. Being poor isn't really a form of protest. In fact, they want you poor. To really protest would be to make money and use it to change things.

       Symbolically the best thing to do is maintain your own moral intregity and not participate. If there is any argument at all for voting, it has to be practically, because symbolically voting is immoral.

       Right on :D How were we brainwashed into thinking if we dare vote outside the two we will be "wasting our vote" ? As long as this message gets through, those that do vote will be hesitant to change. I saw stats last night somewhere (I will Google and look again to make sure) that said we are registered 30% Dem 30% Rep and 40% Ind ...that's huge! Yet somehow it never changes. All the Ind+10% of each of the other two and we can make a change.

       This is probably the most viable argument I have heard for voting. Im in the "your vote doesn't actually count" camp and this is good advice. It doesnt negate the hopelessness that comes with knowing that elections are a scam, but its a more proactive approach than doing nothing.

       I'm no great fan of hers, but hey, guess what? When you're appointed to a case by a judge, you don't really get to say no. And if you want to be good at your job as a defense lawyer, you do your job, and in this case that meant defending someone who was obviously guilty. It happens every day at every level. The laughing is disbelief at how fucked up the court system is. Which it is. I'm a Bernie guy all the way, but this story does not pass the smell test.

       I mean, I despise Hillary, but I certainly have to agree. She doesn't seem to be reveling in any of it whatsoever. As you said, she's not laughing about the rape itself at all, just recounting the fucked up way her case played out.

       Uhm. No you don't. Unless you like being found in contempt of court. A judge's order is not a request. It is not a "pretty please." It is just that, an

        order.

       That order can be appealed, but unless another judge says otherwise, you're stuck.

        "Quite apart from the power of a court to impose sanctions for refusing to represent an indigent criminal defendant, an attorney has an obligation to provide public interest legal services imposed by Bar Rule 3.10, adopted in 1984.
       </p>

      <p>
       At least in Maine, if the court orders you to represent somebody, you need a damn good reason not to, and still avoid sanctions.

       She was running a legal aid clinic at the time she was appointed to defend this person. And, as loathe as we are to want to believe it, even guilty, repugnant people who do horrible things are entitled to a legal defense.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Snopes not being neutral, ok, fine, show me the results from a 'neutral factchecker'. Any way you cut it, there's nothing here. She defended a guilty person, which is what legal defenders do sometimes, and she was cynical about the legal process. So what?

       I had heard mention of how horrible these recordings were, but never heard them until now.

       Yep, much ado about nothing. People are upset that a defense attorney defended somebody. Yeah, that is pretty much the job description. And as far as the laughing.....she seemed to be laughing at how ridiculous the situation was, not out of maliciousness.

       I totally agree... I wanted this to be a smoking gun because I think she is a lunatic.  It just wasn't.  She was doing her job... a job i could never do for sure but it was the position that job put her in.

       I did not hear any laughing about the fact that she got this dude a slap on the wrist.  The main laughing is because she knew he was guilty and he still past the polygraph.

       You should look up the ethical obligations of a defense lawyer to the court and to the defendant.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The defense lawyer must not intentionally misrepresent matters of facts or law to the court. For example, if a defendant admits his guilt to the defense lawyer, the defense lawyer may not permit him to testify that he did not commit the crime.

       Yeah, I have, I know what the obligations are. But I'm not certain it's ever been a question as to whether or not he admitted it to her. If that's been documented, I'd be happy to take a look at it.

       Everyone knew John Gotti was a Mafioso and a murderer. Everyone knew it, including his lawyer. But Gotti still received defense representation, because he was legally entitled to it. The presumption of innocence of those who are accused of crimes, no matter how awful, is still the law of the land.

       My understanding is that accounts vary on that depending on the time frame the question was asked. More recent interviews suggest she did that, yes, but I'm inclined to trust the accuracy of transcripts from interviews that took place closer to the events. Still, though, why does that matter? If it was a professional courtesy, she would still be obligated to give her client what he is guaranteed by the Constitution, which is a full and vigorous defense. And that would not matter if her client was guilty or innocent.

       Anti-globalist? That is the last word I would use when describing him. I can think of many, many I would put before that. No, sorry. 100x better than Hillary? At best it's a toss-up. At worst. She's a just a shill for the powers that be and at best he's a megalomaniac with racist and misogynistic tendencies who thinks publicly mocking the handicapped is perfectly fine. She will keep business as usual, he could blow up the damned world with hate and nuclear weapons. Appreciate your candor though.

       The last elected Potus was Kennedy. All subsequent presidents have been (s)elected. The Potus is nothing more than a high dollar prostitute to the handfull of people running the show.&gt;Funny. I think the same thing about Trump every day. We sure picked two winners.

       I don't even know a third party candidate though. And if we are being super real about this a third party stands no chance against these two. I wouldn't be surprised if Hilary has already won and we are just in the dark until election results.

       I'm a libertarian voting for trump, how is he bad? Lower taxes, bring back jobs to America, put America first. Who gives a shit about anything else. I agree with a lot of Gary Johnson's policies, but not only will he not get elected, Trump's over all plans for America will enable a libertarian to have a real chance come 2024 to make everlasting positive impacts on the country for the future. You cant go from a leftist like Obama directly to a libertarian, the country can't function.

       Yes but more and more people are voting third party each year. It shows that people are getting sick of the 2 party system. Maybe one day we might be able to break the current system if enough people say "enough is enough." Please consider voting 3rd party to make a statement. I like Jill Stein, she's Green Party. She got arrested at a 2012 Presidential Debate. Goes to show how 3rd party candidates are treated

       Or you could do what many others are choosing to do: write your candidate in on your ballot. It's the only option we have left: a democracy Hail Mary. Along with my disaffected peeps, I will be writing the name of my candidate. And together we can watch the shit pile up, but take solace in the fact that every other asswad caused the mess.

       It's widely available information if you need to look it up.  Go to google and type in "2000 US election candidates" or something along those lines instead of all those periods.  Then you won't have to go around asking random people online for the answer.

       also, google is a corporation, that works for the establishment.
Google filters out search results, it is not a transparent engine, so "googling" something, doesn't mean you are "educating" yourself about anything.

       This is exactly why we're in the situation we're in. The two-party system that gives the illusion of choice sucks, but refusing to vote outside of it makes you complicit.

       If the green party or libertarian party gets 5%(?) Of the vote the government has to provide funding for them next election, though. 
Also, what do you care if you screw up the math, seeing as you don't want either candidate anyways? Unless you live in a swing state, your one vote isn't going to change who wins this.

       She was a public defender... And she asked to be removed from the case. She was not granted that, so she did her job as a public defender. When interviewed about it she chuckled a few times about the circumstances. There are PLENTY of reasons to hate HRC, but honestly this is nothing.

       That's completely not true though. You are 100% wrong. Court appointed attorneys cannot refuse a case. If the court appoints a lawyer to defend someone, that lawyer is under oath to defend that someone to the best of his/her ability.

       come on. I think Hillary is a horrible shill that'll ruin this country but this is just dumb.
      </p>
      <p>
       she's a lawyer. This is how lawyers are. They defend criminals as well as the innocent. Nothing in this was even remotely bad. Maybe the 'miscarriage' pun which probably would've been totally acceptable coming out of George Carlins mouth. She's a lawyer not a nun.
      </p>

       The rest of the 'jokes' are just making observations about the case not about rape itself.

       To me it sounded that she was laughing at the result of the poly because she knew he was guilty. Not laughing at the rape itself per se. To her credit she did seem to try hard to get that blood evidence that would prove his guilt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having said that though, listening to how she speaks about it all shows you she is quite heartless. She also laughed at the death of Gaddafi... sure, not a nice guy but still, it's serious stuff.

       you do realise 1)thats a lawyers job and they literally take an oath to try they're best to defend whoever they are working for regardless of personal feelings, and 2) the man took a polygraph test and passed. proof in that time and still pretty damn good proof for a court that someone didnt do what they are being accused of.

       I don't know if there ever will be a politician who is 100% acceptable. However, we need to take a look at some third party candidates. Because as bad as Hillary might be, Tramp is worse.

       Find one person who is for Hillary.  I challenge you.  Then tell me if it's an 18-25 yr old female majoring in non-sciences, law or medical; bonus: african-american because they like to vote against their own interests nearly every time and that's why they are where they are.  Sorry if that's racist to you, it's also factual so what can I say.

       Dude for someone on a conspiracy sub you seem
Pretty manipulated by the
Mainstream narrative.  Go actually ready his policies and get back to me.  He's the least war hawkish candidate by far way less of a war hawk than even sanders.  He's the only one left against TPP he's the only one talking about radical Islam and how our governments are
Complicit in attacks because of our Immogration and foreign policy.  Just read his policies and
Tell me what
You think then.  Ignore the persona and the mainstream propaganda 
Edit:  racists is a Marxists creation used
To stifle discussion.  If
You have no
Argument you use words like racist xenophobic and misogynistic.

       Not voting and voting third party are two entirely different things. The "en masse" bit is a ridiculous condition. You only have one vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do mostly agree anyway, though in the overall point. The biggest reason I vote is to avoid having to justify that my political opinion is still valid without voting.

       Yes but more and more people are voting third party each year. It shows that people are getting sick of the 2 party system. Maybe one day we might be able to break the current system if enough people say "enough is enough." Please consider voting 3rd party to make a statement. I like Jill Stein, she's Green Party. She got arrested at a 2012 Presidential Debate. Goes to show how 3rd party candidates are treated

       Uhm. No you don't. Unless you like being found in contempt of court. A judge's order is not a request. It is not a "pretty please." It is just that, an
       <strong>
        order.
       </strong>
       That order can be appealed, but unless another judge says otherwise, you're stuck.

       I can't find anything about AR, but found this from the Maine Bar Assoc.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Quite apart from the power of a court to impose sanctions for refusing to represent an indigent criminal defendant, an attorney has an obligation to provide public interest legal services imposed by Bar Rule 3.10, adopted in 1984.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       At least in Maine, if the court orders you to represent somebody, you need a damn good reason not to, and still avoid sanctions.

       She was running a legal aid clinic at the time she was appointed to defend this person. And, as loathe as we are to want to believe it, even guilty, repugnant people who do horrible things are entitled to a legal defense.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Snopes not being neutral, ok, fine, show me the results from a 'neutral factchecker'. Any way you cut it, there's nothing here. She defended a guilty person, which is what legal defenders do sometimes, and she was cynical about the legal process. So what?
