       Yesterday, MotherBoard
       <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/dnc-hacker-guccifer-20-interview">
        interviewed
       </a>
       Guccifer 2.0. He claimed that he was Romanian and not Russian, just like the original Guccifer and that he "hated" Russia's foreign policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, when the journalists asked him to communicate with them
       <em>
        in Romanian
       </em>
       , he stalled, saying he didn't want to waste his time. Eventually, he wrote a few sentences in Romanian that were riddled with mistakes:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But when we asked him to explain to us how he hacked into the DNC in Romanian,
        <strong>
         he seemed to stall us
        </strong>
        , and said he didn’t want to “waste” his time doing that. The few short sentences he sent in Romanian
        <strong>
         were filled with mistakes
        </strong>
        , according to several Romanian native speakers.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Also. some of the files released by Guccifer 2.0 had Russian meatdata in them:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Exhibit A in the case is
        <a href="https://guccifer2.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/2.doc">
         this document
        </a>
        created and later edited in the ubiquitous Microsoft Word format. Metadata left inside the file shows it was last edited by someone using the computer name
        <strong>
         "
         <a href="http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/metadata.jpg">
          Феликс Эдмундович
         </a>
         ."
        </strong>
        That means
        <strong>
         the computer was configured to use the Russian language and that it was connected to a Russian-language keyboard.
        </strong>
        More intriguing still, "Феликс Эдмундович" is the colloquial name that translates to Felix Dzerzhinsky, the 20th Century Russian statesman who is best known for founding the Soviet secret police.
       </p>
       <p>
        Exhibit B is
        <a href="https://guccifer2.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/1.doc">
         this opposition research document
        </a>
        on Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Exhibit B is also written in Word. Several of the Web links in it are broken and contain the error message "Error! Hyperlink reference not valid." But in a PDF-formatted copy of the same document
        <a href="http://gawker.com/this-looks-like-the-dncs-hacked-trump-oppo-file-1782040426">
         published by Gawker
        </a>
        a few hours before Guccifer 2.0's post went live, t
        <strong>
         he error messages with roughly the same meaning appear in Russian.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <a href="http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/error-messages.png">
        http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/error-messages.png
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The most likely explanation is that the Russian error messages are an artifact left behind when the leaker converted the Word document into a PDF.
        <strong>
         That kind of conversion would be expected if the leaker's PC was set up to use Russian.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        In response to Wednesday's leak, CrowdStrike raised the possibility that the leak was part of a Russian Intelligence disinformation campaign.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Then, when he was asked why some of the files he converted into PDF had
       <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/06/guccifer-leak-of-dnc-trump-research-has-a-russians-fingerprints-on-it/">
        Russian metadata
       </a>
       in them, he explained that away by saying he wanted to "leave his watermark" (?), whatever the heck that means:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The hacker said he left Russian metadata in the leaked documents as his personal ”watermark.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       As a computer programmer myself, this makes
       <strong>
        absolutely no sense whatsoever
       </strong>
       . First, why choose Russian to leave his watermark? Secondly, and more importantly, the metadata that was in Russian actually consisted of
       <strong>
        errors
       </strong>
       because the hyperlinks could not be accessed when the Word files were converted to PDFs by him. Only an idiot would believe some errors in a PDFs metadata are some sort of "watermark" And shouldn't a watermark be something personal, like a logo or something? What's so personal about a bunch of hyperlink errors in Russian in a PDF file?
      </p>
      <p>
       All this makes even MORE sense when considering an article on oilprice.com about the Russian government promising to release Clinton's emails:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Russia-Is-Reportedly-Set-To-Release-Intercepted-Messages-From-Clintons-Private.html">
        Russia Is Reportedly Set To Release Clinton's Intercepted Emails
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The reports indicated that the decision as to whether to reveal the intercepts would be made by Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin, and
        <strong>
         it was possible that the release would, if made, be through a third party, such as Wikileaks.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Then, WikiLeaks' Assange said that they'd be releasing more of Clinton's emails to help indict her:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://betanews.com/2016/06/12/wikileaks-hillary-clinton-emails/">
        Julian Assange's WikiLeaks poised to release more Hillary Clinton emails
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Before you start championing Russia's government, just know that they're ding this to advance their
       <em>
        own
       </em>
       interests, not ours. This is all part of  the Russian government's disinformation war against the West. The Russian government is interfering with U.S. elections because it's afraid of Clinton's record as a war hawk. They prefer Trump, who has promised to disband Russia's main enemy, NATO.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        [Moscow’s discreet messaging about a possible leak of the traffic,** in time to impact the U.S. elections
        <strong>
         , was designed to pressure faster U.S. legal action on the matter, **but was largely due to Russian concerns about possible U.S. strategic policy in the event of a Hillary Clinton presidency.
        </strong>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So, WikiLeaks, Snowden, and now Guccifer 2.0 - all being controlled by Russia. Looks like the timing of this is no coincidence:

      <p>
       They're objective is quite clear now.

       Hatred? Exposing the propaganda and disinformation of these regimes is not "hatred".

      <p>
       First of all, NATO said that it would be an act of war
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       if it was severe enough - like damaging a nuclear power plant or causing  huge amount of economic damage. Second, are you implying that I'm a NATO shill just because I posted one or two links about Russian attacks? Do you want to
       <strong>
        ban
       </strong>
       all discussion of Russian/Chinese hacking attempts, where they call themselves members of ISIS but use the same attack vectors as Russian hackers have in the past? Isn't that sort of stuff the

        exact

       thing that should be exposed on this sub?

       Your goal has been partially achieved: attempting to attack the OP's posting history as a
       <strong>
        distraction
       </strong>
       from the topic at hand. Thus, from now on, I will ignore all posts from you, as I do not want to help you in your endeavour of distracting from information that puts Russia in an unfavourable light.

       I'm allowed to post whatever I want. Saying I'm a shill just because I don't bother posting critical articles about the U.S., of which there are plenty, is faulty thinking. My interests lie in researching Russian disinformation, like false flag cyber attacks blamed on ISIS. I also just started posting this stuff, so I have plenty of time to "branch out".

       policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So while it's great to hold your leaders to task, the fact that Russian peoples cannot do the same, without risk of being silenced/killed, etc
      </p>
      <p>
       Means that this issue needs to be addressed on all fronts. If the US was torn down from the inside out, without a plan to re-stabilize or succeed power to competent constitutionally respectful leaders, the county and world would be destabilized.
      </p>

       And don't think Russia isn't entirely aware of this reality. Which is why they are funding online propaganda campaigns aimed at making US people hate their government.

        Misinformation and disinformation are not interchangeable, he clarified. “Misinformation is an official government tool while disinformation is a secret intelligence tool.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Lt. Gen. Pacepa, who defected from the Soviet bloc and was intimately knowledgeable of its security, explained that “During the Cold War, more people in the Soviet bloc worked for the disinformation machinery than for the Soviet army and defense industry put together.” (p. 38)

       Considering Russians basically invented or at least have contributed or are directly responsible for the modern form and interpretation of Disinformation, including popularizing or giving modern meaning to the word: Yes, I'd say they helped write the book on psychological warfare.

       That being said, I think the CIA and other US government alphabet soups are equally formidable or excel in other types of warfare. That being said, some was in response to Russian disinfo campaigns, others were to cover up their own criminal programs or operations.

       Is it a coincidence all Guccifers information was routed through Russian servers and they grabbed/obtained it all. To what end? The thread supposes Russia wants Trump in power. If that's true, their use of hacking and propaganda is shaping American Peoples Opinions, which in turn shapes political landscape.

       I debunked your claim about my post about NATO not wanting to fight with a nuclear superpower over a lie. You ignored the "nuclear" part and started rambling about other times when the U.S. lied to start a war, except those countries were not nuclear countries, as I had originally mentioned. The U.S. has a policy of not starting conflict with nuclear states. Why else do you think North Korea is so bent on perfecting nuclear technology?

       I did not interpret falsely. You're simply backtracking from your earlier comments. Of course you mentioned BRCIS and a potential gold-backed currency and of course you were talking about the dollar when you said "breaking your hold". There's nothing else you could have meant.

       The U.S. is the official reserve currency of the IMF, along with the Euro, British pound, Japanese Yen, and Chinese Yuan. One is a European entity, another two are East Asian countries and only one is a Western entity, apart from the Euro: the dollar. So, you were obviously talking about the dollar. Otherwise you'd be claiming BRICS, of which China is a part of, would be "breaking the hold" of the Chinese Yuan in the IMF.

       Do you believe the James Foley video was faked? If so, Russia's disinfo group, known as CyberBerkut, has identified you as a target to seed propaganda through to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       They know full well that the West is full of nutcases who believe all anti-government conspiracy theories, probably because Westerners are pathetic these days and live in a land of fantasy. Or maybe it's because people here suffer from confirmation bias and think every shooting is some sort of hoax. The Russians know their audience quite well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know this video was breathlessly shown on InfoWars? And do you think they did a frame-by-frame analysis to check if the movements are authentic? Nope.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the Russians succeeded in this agitprop, just like during the Cold War they spread propaganda about the CIA creating AIDS, through Operation INFEKTION, about JFK being assassinated by the CIA, about fluoride in water being poisonous, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the funny thing is, 25+ years after the Cold War ended and Soviet defectors exposed this massive disinformation campaign, and 40+ years after this disinformation was spread by the KGB, people on this sub
       <strong>
        still
       </strong>
       believe this decades-old disinformation!

       I never spoke about ideology. I spoke about the disinfo campaigns waged by the USSR, how leftist idiots became hooked to it, and how now, rightist idiots are being hooked to Russian propaganda, because, somehow, Putin is "with them" and is
       <em>

       Good job purposely ignoring my other points. Must have been so true that you couldn't think of a good counterproposal.

       Go on, do Russia's work for them. Believe the James Foley execution is faked, just like they want you to. Feel proud, "patriot". Be awake!

       That's bullshit. The US has been building up NATO specifically for an offensive, not defensive positioning. It's gotten so bad that our buddy Germany even decided to give us a talking to.

       I don't think you understand the difference between pissing off Russia and war. The U.S. is trying to use E. Europe to make a point to Russia. But doesn't contradict my earlier point, which was that
       <strong>
        there will never be a war between NATO and Russia.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter what happens, the powers that be care about their survival over everything else. Nuclear war is something they won't risk. Sending weapons and a few hundred/thousand troops to E. Europe is just a big FUCK YOU to the Russians. Nothing more and nothing less.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody can wage war on Russia with 4000 troops and likewise, Russia won't nuke the U.S. because of military exercises with Poland.

       You haven't answered the questions I asked. Not only that, but you expose your faulty logic: nuclear power has been a part of the U.S. since roughly a quarter of its history and despite that, it always avoids war with nuclear powers. Anyone who has a decent knowledge of history and U.S. policy towards nuclear states should know that.

       Once again, you ignore the question itself:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Does the U.S' history show that it avoids
        <strong>
         direct
        </strong>
        escalatory confrontation with nuclear powers or not?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There are a million reasons why your example is wrong. One, the U.S. drone bombed a terrorist, so Pakistan can't claim it's an act of war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, the U.S. pays Pakistan hundreds of millions of dollars in aid, along with making sure Pakistan buys its weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, the U.S. did not bomb  and has already been bombing terrorists with Pakistan's permission. Only difference this time is that it didn't bother asking for permission. Not an act of war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering these things, do you still think the U.S. is at war with Pakistan?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not even close. Very, very poor choice of an example,
       <strong>
        especially in relation to Russia
       </strong>
       .

      <blockquote>

       </p>

      <p>
       Russia and Pakistan are different examples, and the Pakistani government has not said this was an act of war. Lastly, this is a war
       <em>
        against
       </em>
       terrorists. The war against the Taliban was declared over a decade ago.

       Where did you get that malarky from? Entering another country with military vehicles and dropping bombs violates that country's sovereignty and is an act of war.

       That's direct confrontation.

       The only reason why the US can get away with it is because Pakistan knows they can't defend against us even with it's nuclear deterrent capability.

       The use of drones by the Central Intelligence Agency in Pakistan to carry out operations associated with the Global War on Terror sparks debate over sovereignty and the laws of war. The U.S. Government uses the CIA rather than the U.S. Air Force for strikes in Pakistan in order to avoid breaching sovereignty through military invasion. The United States was criticized by[according to whom?] a report on drone warfare and aerial sovereignty for abusing the term 'Global War on Terror' to carry out military operations through government agencies without formally declaring war.

       Don't minimize the amount of civilian casualties and amount of drone strikes over there. It hasn't been "a few" and there's been plenty of innocent lives lost.

       There is no direct conflict here. The U.S. bombed terrorists without Pakistan's permission.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pakistan, in response, condemned the move as a violation of its sovereignty but did not declare it as an act of war.

      <p>
       The whole point of you bringing up Pakistan was to compare it to Russia. But bombing the rebels in an area close to the Pakistani-Afghan border is completely different than thousands of troops in E. Europe attacking Russia, which was the original scenario.

        Pakistan, in response, condemned the move as a violation of its sovereignty but did not declare it as an act of war.

       <p>
        The whole point of you bringing up Pakistan was to compare it to Russia. But bombing the rebels in an area close to the Pakistani-Afghan border is completely different than thousands of troops in E. Europe attacking Russia, which was the original scenario.

       No, the U.S. an Pakistan are not currently at war, and more importantly, NATO will never drone bomb Russia or go to war with it, which was the theme of our original discussion.

       But that was my point, it already did. NATO initially supported Vietname and the US lied to engage in the war. It was a proxy war with Russia but it was still a war between US/Russian, just happened to have Vietnamese in between.

       If you mean a direct war with a nuclear country, you might have a point. I would have to go over the records as I can't think offhand.

       Yes, this is exactly what I mean. The U.S. has never gone to war with a nuclear country. That's the main reason North Korea wants to complete its nuclear program.

       Okay, yeah this makes sense. You should point this out in debate because I think you are being misinterpreted.

       Worth pointing out the only nuclear states who've had
       <em>
        direct
       </em>
       conflict is Russia/China (very briefly and RU asked for help), and Pakistan/India. That's all I could find. The former was a brief skirmish that put people on edge, and I remember personally people worrying about nuclear end of days on the latter.

       You lack reading comprehension skills, as many others on this sub do. You merely focus on the first part of my sentence  - "NATO would never lie to go to war", but skip the latter: "with a nuclear country".

       If they were honest about the fact that they are anti-west, we wouldn't have to dodge anymore about them pretending to be objective sources of information. They clearly doctor and filter whatever narrative they want to push. Its useful to understand that anyone who offers you information on a friend for family member immediately should become suspicious, even if that information is true, surprising, or revelatory. What does that person have to gain from sharing it with you?
      </p>
      <p>
       No source is free from bias but what Wikileaks is choosing to OMIT is equally important IMO.

       Point out anything pro-Clinton in my post. I post one self-post about Guccifer 2.0 being Russian and now I'm a Clinton shill. Wow.

       Wow, you could not be more of a drama queen here if you tried.  Please explain why a russian hacker exposing the truth is such a bad thing?  The DNC is actively and openly subverting the political process, but you're concerned about Guccifer and want to make Wikileaks look bad as well.  Alrighty then.

       Because Russia is a nation with its own national interests and is not doing this out of the goodness of its heart. It is attempting to influence the U.S. election, so Trump will win.
      </p>
      <p>
       Say you like Trump and he wins because of Russia, but 4/8 years later, the Russians don't like one POTUS candidate and start using active measures to elect the one that favours them the most. Then what? Is that OK to you? Not to me.

       First off, Trump will not win.  It will be Clinton barring some huge event.  That was decided long ago.
      </p>

       I don't believe your assertion/implication that these leaks are invalid or somehow plagiarized by Russia.  As I said, the DNC is actively, openly, blatantly, subverting our own political process, so I don't see why you're so concerned about a hacker giving away clinton emails.  Guccifer 1 exposed a lot, and the Clinton camp doesn't even deny those emails as being altered in any way, do they?
      </p>
      <p>
       PS, if you are so concerned about another country having influence over our own, I highly suggest you look into the fact that this nation is entirely run by Israel.
