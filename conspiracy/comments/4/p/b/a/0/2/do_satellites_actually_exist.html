A friend of mine is adamant that satellites do not exist, but doesn&#39;t do much to defend this notion beyond saying he won&#39;t believe they exist until he sees one in person.</p>

<p>That being said, I am open-minded and therefore curious if any of you feel similarly and have more substantial backing for this theory. Alternately, if you too have addressed this theory and refuted it, if you have any supporting evidence for the physical existence of satellites, that too would be appreciated.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re too impatient for that, or live somewhere with too much light pollution to see small ones, look for the International Space Station: <a href="http://www.isstracker.com/">http://www.isstracker.com/</a></p>

<p>Alternatively, look into how GPS works. Or <em>satellite</em> phones. Or ask yourslf what the purpose of a <em>satellite</em> dish is, if there&#39;s no satellites. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Basic understanding of thermodynamics&quot;, don&#39;t make me fucking laugh.</p>

<p>If you had a basic understanding of thermodynamics, you&#39;d understand that the thermosphere being described as &quot;hot&quot; means that the gas particles in it have a lot of energy, because that&#39;s how temperature works (in general). You&#39;d also understand that the particle density is incredibly low, so the total energy transferred from gas particles to your satellite or whatever is <strong>very low</strong>.</p>

<p>Secondly, you&#39;re confusing <strong>radiative</strong> cooling with <strong>conductive</strong> cooling. Considering there&#39;s only three basic ways of transferring heat, I&#39;d expect someone with a &quot;basic understanding of thermodynamics&quot; to know the difference between them. You don&#39;t need an atmosphere or any sort of medium to radiate away energy. Spacecraft don&#39;t use conductive or convective cooling for the exact reason that you need a medium to do it and so it obviously doesn&#39;t work in space.</p>

<p>The science of satellites breaks down with just the slightest bit of misinformed inquiry and a <em>incredibly</em> basic, if not outright wrong, Dunning-Kruger understanding of thermodynamics.</p>

<p>Heat isn&#39;t &quot;transfered&quot; from the gas particles to the satellite. That&#39;s the stupidest explanation I&#39;ve ever heard. </p>

<p>Do you think that a sidewalk heats up to 140 on a hot day because the gas particles in the atmoshphere are transfering their heat energy?</p>

<p>No, it&#39;s directly absorbing solar energy and because it&#39;s a better conductor than the surrounding atmosphere, and thus it get&#39;s significantly hotter. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You don&#39;t need an atmosphere or any sort of medium to radiate away energy. </p>

<p>Really? Because where do you think that energy goes when it &quot;radiates&quot; away? </p>

<p>This dude just read a few wikipedia articles and decided he&#39;d have a go. </p>

<p>What a joke. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some energy is transferred from the gas particles to the satellite and vice versa, it&#39;s just a small amount in total because there aren&#39;t a lot of particles. </p>

<p>The sidewalk heats up due to radiative heating from the Sun, although there is some conductive heat transfer to and from the atmosphere as well. How do you think energy from the Sun gets here through the vacuum of space? </p>

<p>The energy radiates away into space as EM radiation.</p>

<p>You actually have no clue about thermodynamics or how heat transfer works. </p>

<p>Haven&#39;t you ever wondered why the water in a stovetop pot heats up more slowly than the pot itself? Different materials heat up at different rates based on their physical composition. This is grade-school science.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Different objects will heat up at different rates. They will absorb and emit more energy depending on their shape, size, surface, material, etc. and their temperature will depend on their heat capacity, i.e. water will take longer to get from temperature X to Y than say, asphalt, because the water actually requires more energy to get to the same temperature. The sidewalk is dark asphalt whereas the hood of your car is probably reflective metal, so it will heat up at a slower rate. The interior of your car also experiences a greenhouse effect which traps heat.</p>

<p>If you left them in the Sun, everything would indeed eventually reach the same temperature. Please note that putting your hand on the car/pavement is in absolutely no way an accurate way of telling the actual temperature of an object.</p>

<p>Seriously, do you just think energy transfer through radiation don&#39;t real or something?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, a satellite can radiate into a vacuum as much as it likes. There is no efficiency involved because it&#39;s just radiating. The only measure you could make comparable to efficiency is energy radiated as a fraction of power generated/received.</p>

<p>Go and make yourself a fire. Grab a log from the fire, notice how the heat is conducted to your hand. Hold your hand above the fire, notice how the heat is transferred to your hand by convective air currents. Hold your hand away to the side of the fire, notice how heat is transferred to your hand by radiation from the fire. Also please note that you hand receives radiation from the fire in all these situations, but in the third one experiences virtually no conductive/convective heat transfer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to work at a factory that made satellites. I was part of the science group in the Solar Array team. A large part of my job was making sure that solar cells could handle fluctuations of temperature from -200C to around +300C (or thereabouts, it was a decade ago and I don&#39;t remember the exact numbers).</p>

<p>We&#39;d &quot;thermally cycle&quot; them in a special oven, by spraying them with liquid nitrogen to get down to -200C, then baking them back up to whatever the max temperature was. I think it was 300 or 400C. Then we made sure the cells were fine afterwards.</p>

<p>Another thing that took up a large amount of my time was calculating the projected power output from a solar wing over the next 18 years or so, given where the thrusters are in relation to the solar wings, given where we are in the solar flare cycle, given the satellite&#39;s orbital slot.</p>

<p>Yes, radiation does degrade the satellite wings over time. But they&#39;re still doing fine after 15 years - not as well as the day they deploy, but still enough to power the satellite.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure the wings never get over a couple of hundred degrees celsius. And that&#39;s only the parts that are under direct sunlight. The reverse sides are generally a couple hundred below zero.</p>

<p>Whatever thermodynamics you think you understand, is clearly not correct. If it predicts melting satellites, its predictions are wrong based on dozens of satellites being up there and not melting. </p>

<p>Its radiation and EMP proof. While you wont be playing Farcry on a machine running with this memory you wont really have to. The satellites and electronics in space arent doing a bulk of the computing. They are very simple and typically handle a few very important duties. Why calculate things in space when you can transmit the relevant data and have the solution beamed back? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually it&#39;s a perfectly logical question that most people never ask themselves. </p>

<p>If the thermosphere is as hot as they claim it is, and there is no significant atmoshphere in which to radiate(Which is how cooling works) the heat away from the satellite, the absorbed solar radiation would decimate delicate electronics systems (which are producing their own heat mind you).</p>

<p>The &quot;science&quot; of satellites breaks down almost immediately with just the slightest bit of inquiry and a basic understanding of thermodynamics.  </p>
