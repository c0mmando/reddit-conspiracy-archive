<p>99.9% or more of the towers were air, as is most any building. They weren&#39;t wall-to-wall and floor-to-ceiling concrete and steel. The structural components themselves simply don&#39;t have a lot of volume.</p>

That doesn&#39;t include the furniture or fixtures, so probably more like 85% or 86% air.  There should be a pile of rubble at least 1/8 the size of the building, and more because that pile would still have air in it,  and there isn&#39;t.  The buildings were largely turned to dust. The energy from a plane impact, fire, gravity, or even thermite cannot account for that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only evidence I&#39;ve seen that even remotely suggests &#39;steel turning to dust&#39; is the iron microspheres discovered and attributed to the high heat generated by the use of thermate. That heat would, of course, only have been generated at the point where thermate cutting charges were used to sever the columns/beams/bolts.</p>

<p>It appears likely that only a very tiny percentage of the steel could have been affected like that.</p>

<p>&quot;When an honest man, honestly mistaken, comes face-to-face with undeniable and irrefutable truth, he is faced with one of two choices, he must either cease being mistaken or cease being honest.&quot; - Amicus Solo (Latin for &quot;a lone friend&quot;)</p>

<p>If Richard Gage is using AE911Ttruth&#39;s funds to buy Dr. Wood&#39;s book, and Richard Gage is suppressing Dr. Wood&#39;s work, one must conclude that the prime directive of AE911Truth is to suppress the evidence. Mr. Gage cannot refute the overwhelming, conclusive, and indisputable evidence contained in Dr. Wood&#39;s book but only misrepresent it (i.e. promote disinformation about it). Science is not determined by popular opinion, but a psyop is. Referring to the sum of 2+3=5 as &quot;a view&quot; or as &quot;an opinion&quot; or &quot;a theory&quot; is how cover-ups work. It creates doubt where there is no doubt. Humanity has awoken. Those who are worthy and willing to open their eyes to the truth will read WHERE DID THE TOWERS GO? by Dr. Judy Wood. </p>

<p>Form 990 ARCHITECTS &amp; ENGINEERS FOR 9-11 TRUTH INC, Part I Summary, 1.) mission statement</p>

<p>Our mission is to research, compile, and disseminate (some) scientific evidence relative to the destruction of the three World Trade Center skyscrapers, (not all 7, just 3 of the buildings) calling for a truly open and independent investigation and supporting others in the pursuit of justice. (Except Dr. Judy Wood)</p>

<p>Form 990 ARCHITECTS &amp; ENGINEERS FOR 9-11 TRUTH INC, Schedule A, Part II, Section A</p>

<p>from 2008 to 2012 AE911Truth income was $1.365 million!!!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.checktheevidence.com/pdf/AE911%20Tax%20Return%20-%2026-1532493_990_201212.pdf">http://www.checktheevidence.com/pdf/AE911%20Tax%20Return%20-%2026-1532493_990_201212.pdf</a></p>

<p>If Mr. Gage was searching for the truth, then he would not be trying to deceive his supporters and the American people by claiming to present the best &quot;scientific forensic evidence&quot;, only to completely ignore the large sum of scientific forensic evidence that thermite does not explain. If a scientist or researcher only presented the evidence that supports their hypothesis while completely ignoring the evidence that countered their hypothesis, they could be stripped of their professional license or degree for presenting such an unscientific and biased fraction of the total sum of important physical evidence that demands consideration.</p>

<p>Theory, speculation, and belief are not necessary to understand that a type of directed energy was used on 9/11, rather, only detailed study of the empirical evidence from 9/11 is necessary. Situations like this are rare in science, where there is so much empirical evidence that one can bypass theory and speculation to draw an irrefutable conclusion from the evidence. This also helps to illustrate a major difference between Dr. Judy Wood and other 9/11 researchers, as she did not start with theory or speculation and then begin researching to see if it was consistent with the evidence. Instead, Dr. Wood simply did what any objective, vigilant scientist would do, she gathered and studied as much of the empirical evidence from 9/11 as possible, assembling a monumental database of verifiable physical evidence that dwarfs the efforts of any other 9/11 &quot;research&quot;, including the unscientific &#39;9/11 Commission Report&#39;. After gathering and studying all of this important evidence, Dr. Wood arrived at the only logical, inescapable conclusion that explains all of this empirical evidence, a general category of weapon technology known as &#39;directed energy weapons&#39; (DEW). It would be theory or speculation to go beyond that by trying to name a specific weapon technology or location, because that is not what the evidence allows us to irrefutably conclude. This is why the term is left as a general one, because that is the only logical, conclusive, and irrefutable conclusion that the evidence allows us to make.</p>

<p>This download is the Foreword and book review of &quot;WHERE DID THE TOWERS GO?&quot; by  Eric Larsen, Professor Emeritus at John Jay College of Criminal Justice  1971 - 2006 (35 years), plus the Author&#39;s Preface.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.checktheevidence.com/pdf/Where%20Did%20The%20Towers%20Go%20-%20Dr%20Judy%20Wood.pdf">http://www.checktheevidence.com/pdf/Where%20Did%20The%20Towers%20Go%20-%20Dr%20Judy%20Wood.pdf</a></p>

<p>Those of us who have read Dr. Wood&#39;s book can give at least 10 reasons that rule out the theory by &quot;AE911trutherd&quot; that welding material destroyed the WTC. How many can you list ? Hint: the bottom of page 45, the top of page 171, the diagrams on page 81 and 84, the diagram at the bottom of page 11, and of course pages 122 to 127. The list is endless, actually.</p>

<p>By reading WHERE DID THE TOWERS GO?, you know from the EVIDENCE that the Twin Towers turned to dust in mid-air never hitting the ground.</p>

<p>*Bombs don&#39;t do that.</p>

<p>*Thermite does not do that.</p>

<p>*Thermate does not do that.</p>

<p>*Nano-enhanced thermite does not do that.</p>

<p>*Nano-thermite does not do that.</p>

<p>*New-and-improved super-duper mini-micro-nano thermite does not do that.</p>

<p>We know this because we know those things above involve Kinetic Energy and/or Thermal Energy and we know that the &quot;dustification&quot; was done without Kinetic Energy and without Thermal Energy. That is, &quot;dustification&quot; was not done with high heat (Thermal Energy) nor with some form of Kinetic Energy (wrecking ball, projectile, gravity collapse). The building was not cooked to death nor was it beaten to death. So Kinetic Energy Weapons (KEW) did not destroy the buildings nor did Thermal Energy Weapons (TEW) destroy the buildings. But we know that Energy was Directed somehow (and controlled within fairly precise boundaries) to cause the building to turn to dust in mid air. That is, some kind of (cold) Directed Energy that was used as a weapon (cDEW) had to have done this. Energy was directed and manipulated within the material such that it came apart without involving high heat (fire, welding materials such as thermite) and without having something fly through the air and hit it (bullets, missile, bombs, wrecking ball, a giant hammer, or many micro hammers)</p>

<p>If this technology can manipulate energy to do something like this, it can also be manipulated to provide us with &quot;free energy&quot; (i.e. &quot;off the grid&quot;). Simply by looking at the cover of Dr. Wood&#39;s book you can realize there must be a technology that can do this. This is evidence that such technology does exist. This is evidence that a technology capable of providing &quot;free energy&quot; (&quot;off the grid&quot;) exists. The whole world witnessed this which means the whole world can know that &quot;free-energy technology&quot; exists. This realization will change the world. This is probably the biggest reason why there is so much effort spent misrepresenting, distorting, and suppressing Dr. Wood&#39;s research.</p>

<p>Those that choose to focus on hearsay, speculation, conspiracy theories, or unqualified opinions while ignoring irrefutable factual evidence by avoiding it is what keeps a cover-up in place. Diverting the public to arguing between the two false choices of &quot;9/11 Truthers&quot; verses &quot;The Official 9/11 Conspiracy Theory&quot; while ignoring the facts is classic perception management designed to hide and obscure the evidence. </p>

<p>Richard Gage is NOT a qualified forensic scientist. Dr. Judy Wood IS a qualified forensic scientist. AE911Truth is calling for a new investigation. This implies an admission that they are NOT qualified to conduct such an investigation of what happened. Otherwise, why are they calling for a new investigation instead of conducting one themselves -- unless the intention is to knowingly distract its members and others away from the new investigation that has already been conducted?  AE911Truth wants a new investigation?  They already have one. It&#39;s contained in a book called &quot;WHERE DID THE TOWERS GO?&quot;  Why is AE911Truth suppressing it? AE911Truth cannot lobby Congress. They are a 501( c )3 and are prohibited from lobbying Congress. Why didn&#39;t AE911Truth submit their so-called &quot;thermite evidence&quot; to  NIST? - Oh, that&#39;s right. It&#39;s a federal crime to defraud the government. Why hasn&#39;t AE911Truth filed a Federal qui tam case?  Because they haven&#39;t blown the whistle on anything and they have no evidence and it is past the statute of limitation. So, why didn&#39;t they support Dr. Wood&#39;s Federal qui tam case that was filed instead of banning members who mentioned it? * -- I guess they really didn&#39;t want such a case to go forward. So they want &quot;respect and compassion for all people&quot; except for those named &quot;Dr. Judy Wood.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>AE911truth first opened their website about 3.5 weeks AFTER Dr. Wood submitted her Request for Corrections (RFC) to NIST. She was the first to submit an RFC that blew the whistle on the contractors for the NIST report. Can you say &quot;damage control&quot; ? Then she filed a federal qui tam case that could have blown this whole case wide open, including putting people under oath - if there were enough supporters. Guess what? It became a policy in AE911Truth to ban those who discussed the work of Dr. Wood in an honest manor. ** Since Richard Gage, founder &amp;  CEO of AE911truth, bought Dr. Wood&#39;s book in the spring of 2011 and read it, he can no longer use &quot;plausible deniability&quot; as a defense. Mr. Gage is knowingly leading people away from the truth about 9/11 and using AE911Truth funds to accomplish this task. So leading people away from the truth must be the mission of AE911Truth. How else could he justify using AE911Truth funds to buy this book?  Who funds AE911Truth? Donations through the donation drives on his site have dried up. However, donating creates a psychological hold on the donor and they are less likely to leave the organization or question Mr. Gage. Dr. Wood is a teacher and promotes independent thinking. Perhaps this is why she does not ask for donations on her website or conduct membership drives for a &quot;truth club&quot; to keep everyone in lockstep, where members are issued a list of talking points to focus on so that they don&#39;t go looking for the truth. Dr. Wood is just one person. Richard Gage brags about having a large membership in lockstep with him. So why is he so concerned about just ONE person and radiates such anger at Dr. Wood? The truth is powerful and it emerges through independent thought. ;-) â™¥</p>

<p>Thermite is the lie behind door #2 for those who didnâ€™t like the lie behind door #1 (19 bad guys with box cutters). And if too many folks start hearing about the evidence Dr. Judy Wood presents, they show you the lie behind door #3 (nukes).</p>

<p>AE911Truth vs Dr. Judy Wood</p>

<p>&quot;When an honest man, honestly mistaken, comes face-to-face with undeniable and irrefutable truth, he is faced with one of two choices, he must either cease being mistaken or cease being honest.&quot; - Amicus Solo (Latin for &quot;a lone friend&quot;)</p>

<p>If Richard Gage is using AE911Ttruth&#39;s funds to buy Dr. Wood&#39;s book, and Richard Gage is suppressing Dr. Wood&#39;s work, one must conclude that the prime directive of AE911Truth is to suppress the evidence. Mr. Gage cannot refute the overwhelming, conclusive, and indisputable evidence contained in Dr. Wood&#39;s book but only misrepresent it (i.e. promote disinformation about it). Science is not determined by popular opinion, but a psyop is. Referring to the sum of 2+3=5 as &quot;a view&quot; or as &quot;an opinion&quot; or &quot;a theory&quot; is how cover-ups work. It creates doubt where there is no doubt. Humanity has awoken. Those who are worthy and willing to open their eyes to the truth will read WHERE DID THE TOWERS GO? by Dr. Judy Wood.</p>

<p>Form 990 ARCHITECTS &amp; ENGINEERS FOR 9-11 TRUTH INC, Part I Summary, 1.) mission statement</p>

<p>Our mission is to research, compile, and disseminate (some) scientific evidence relative to the destruction of the three World Trade Center skyscrapers, (not all 7, just 3 of the buildings) calling for a truly open and independent investigation and supporting others in the pursuit of justice. (Except Dr. Judy Wood)</p>

<p>from 2008 to 2012 AE911Truth income was $1.365 million!!!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.checktheevidence.com/pdf/AE911%20Tax%20Return%20-%2026-1532493_990_201212.pdf">http://www.checktheevidence.com/pdf/AE911%20Tax%20Return%20-%2026-1532493_990_201212.pdf</a></p>

<p>If Mr. Gage was searching for the truth, then he would not be trying to deceive his supporters and the American people by claiming to present the best &quot;scientific forensic evidence&quot;, only to completely ignore the large sum of scientific forensic evidence that thermite does not explain. If a scientist or researcher only presented the evidence that supports their hypothesis while completely ignoring the evidence that countered their hypothesis, they could be stripped of their professional license or degree for presenting such an unscientific and biased fraction of the total sum of important physical evidence that demands consideration.</p>

<p>Theory, speculation, and belief are not necessary to understand that a type of directed energy was used on 9/11, rather, only detailed study of the empirical evidence from 9/11 is necessary. Situations like this are rare in science, where there is so much empirical evidence that one can bypass theory and speculation to draw an irrefutable conclusion from the evidence. This also helps to illustrate a major difference between Dr. Judy Wood and other 9/11 researchers, as she did not start with theory or speculation and then begin researching to see if it was consistent with the evidence. Instead, Dr. Wood simply did what any objective, vigilant scientist would do, she gathered and studied as much of the empirical evidence from 9/11 as possible, assembling a monumental database of verifiable physical evidence that dwarfs the efforts of any other 9/11 &quot;research&quot;, including the unscientific &#39;9/11 Commission Report&#39;. After gathering and studying all of this important evidence, Dr. Wood arrived at the only logical, inescapable conclusion that explains all of this empirical evidence, a general category of weapon technology known as &#39;directed energy weapons&#39; (DEW). It would be theory or speculation to go beyond that by trying to name a specific weapon technology or location, because that is not what the evidence allows us to irrefutably conclude. This is why the term is left as a general one, because that is the only logical, conclusive, and irrefutable conclusion that the evidence allows us to make.</p>

<p>Those of us who have read Dr. Wood&#39;s book can give at least 10 reasons that rule out the theory by &quot;AE911trutherd&quot; that welding material destroyed the WTC. How many can you list ? Hint: the bottom of page 45, the top of page 171, the diagrams on page 81 and 84, the diagram at the bottom of page 11, and of course pages 122 to 127. The list is endless, actually.</p>

<p>By reading WHERE DID THE TOWERS GO?, you know from the EVIDENCE that the Twin Towers turned to dust in mid-air never hitting the ground.</p>

<p>*Bombs don&#39;t do that.</p>

<p>*Thermite does not do that.</p>

<p>*Thermate does not do that.</p>

<p>*Nano-enhanced thermite does not do that.</p>

<p>*Nano-thermite does not do that.</p>

<p>*New-and-improved super-duper mini-micro-nano thermite does not do that.</p>

<p>*Firecrackers do not do that.</p>

<p>*Fire does not do that.</p>

<p>*Nukes do not do that.</p>

<p>*Megga nukes do not do that.</p>

<p>*Milli-nukes do not do that.</p>

<p>*Mini-nukes do not do that.</p>

<p>*Nano-nukes cannot do that.</p>

<p>*New-and-improved super-duper invisible shock free nukes cannot do that.</p>
