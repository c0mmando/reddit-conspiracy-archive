<p>Ever heard of Radio Carbon Dating and the Bomb Effect?</p>

<p>Unnaturally high levels of Carbon 14 were released into the atmosphere during the height of Nuclear Weapons testing throughout the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s That abundance of C14 allows us to compare the C14 present in any given artifact and compare it to our baseline/control measurement (an organic compound that has the same C14 level as a piece of wood grown no later than 1950)</p>

<p>Just to humour you on this for a moment longer: The scientific theory behind these weapons exists, it is completely viable - in a world where having the biggest stick matters, I see no reason why these weapons would not be real.</p>

<p>A damned site more real than the prospect of this planet being flat.</p>

<p>Edit:  Ok I read up a bit, so atmospheric gas is used in the production of all steel.  So nuclear testing affected the atmosphere of the entire planet then?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes. For nearly all purposes, the contamination is so low that it can be routinely ignored. The exception is equipment that is manufactured for extremely sensitive instrumentation, such as neutrino detectors and particle accelerators. These instruments are so sensitive that even very low levels of radiation can render them useless. Hence the need to find steel that was manufactured prior to 1950.</p>

Are you seriously implying that 90,000 people actually did not die at Hiroshima and Nagasaki? That the Hiroshima monument is fake? That survivors who are still alive are what paid actors? That thousands of people did not witness nuclear bomb tests from Las Vegas in the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s. That it was all some kind of what a special effects show? Seriously?

    <div class="md"><p>Those people did die, but it&#39;s alleged that it was just more carpet firebombing by the U.S. which is also claimed by some survivors of those attacks, and they did repopulate both quite quickly again afterwards and vegetation grew again, I could go on here to discuss all nuclear related things with you but it&#39;s pointless, that&#39;s why I want to discuss the core matter of it all, is the atom bomb principle real? Is the controlled chain reaction in an atom bomb actually possible?</p>

<p>This is why I&#39;m starting to hate this sub, so many people like you, why exactly am I a retard? Because I want to discuss something?</p>

<p>I&#39;M JUST ASKING FOR A CONCLUSIVE ANSWER/DEBATE, is that so fucking difficult?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the process of a nuclear power plant is that it heats water which is then transformed into energy by turbines and condensed to be reused, the claim was that the chain reaction in an atom bomb to cause such an explosion was not possible, and that&#39;s what I want to get to the bottom to, no more, no less.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no difference between the reactions that power a nuclear generator and a nuclear bomb. The only difference is that a bomb doesn&#39;t have any neutron moderators to control the reaction - it releases all of its energy in one shot.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same principle as using a propane tank to grill food versus puncturing the tank with a welding torch. One of these reactions is uncontrolled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is an enormous lie, so most people cannot even begin to consider it.  It is just not possible for nuclear weapons to be fake without making serious adjustments to their world view.  If nuclear weapons aren&#39;t real, then what is all the nonsense with Iran negotiations?  This world view barrier provides cover for other frauds as well (if the moon landings were fake, the Russians would have called us on it, right?).  </p>

<p>But when you start to look at the evidence for nuclear weapons, like the old test footage when special effects are not what they are today, you find that nuclear weapons are psychological weapons.  Watch the &#39;duck and cover&#39; propaganda as an observer from another time and see how they were used to maintain fear and sell the Cold War.  The old Disney films from that era are easily recognizable for the propaganda that they are whereas is is harder to critically view material from our own time due to cultural immersion.  </p>

<p>Most people think of military as tanks and guns, but psychological warfare is so much more important to understand and this weapon is directed inwardly as well as towards foreign countries.  Nuclear weapons don&#39;t need to explode to be effective, they just need to be believed.</p>

<p>But yeah I guess you&#39;re right, I do get some information here but make sure to research further, it is just a shame if it were true that it is almost impossible to leak that into even subs like these, it&#39;s not even open for discussion on some topics as I get to see myself, I never understood the importance of up/downvote as I also did not do it myself, but it&#39;s such an easy thing to manipulate rather than look at thread views/interactions as an indicator of what is &quot;hot&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it certainly does, and while I understand you&#39;ll have the (insert 3 letter agency here) shills and disinformation, what surprises me is the amount of people who are just as angry when you bring this up, refuse to discuss it, that&#39;s what I also tried to write in a thread but I deleted it because it wasn&#39;t well written.</p>

<p>But basically you have the surface truth which most will believe because of the media/politicians etc, then there&#39;s the conspiracy theory &quot;truth&quot; where you supposedly unravel all the conspiracies, but when you go even further it seems to be nothing more than an accepted list of conspiracies behind which is the actual layer of truth.</p>

<p>Both the surface layer and accepted conspiracy layer all has people very furiously defending it even if you remove the influence and interactions with the shills and astro turfers.</p>

<p>But that are some interesting posts, it is certainly something I will look more into myself even if people dismiss the idea because it is certainly important to know the truth here for me.</p>

<p>This reminds me of Noam Chomsky: </p>

<p>“The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum....”</p>

<p>The nuclear bomb hoax is a great example of a topic that is outside the spectrum of acceptable opinion.  I have identified a few other topics I believe to fall into this category. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion, fake.</p>

<p>Hiroshima and Nagasaki were firebombed. Look at this man stand at the epicenter of the blast at 1:00 of this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWCUvDVZT94&amp;amp;list=PLznScaQ3uUA084LZXrNiDsMDCdQfJ_BQd&amp;amp;index=12">video.</a></p>

<p>Shouldn&#39;t he be worried about radiation? He isn&#39;t wearing any protective clothing...</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take a closer look at the pictures of the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Atomic_bombing_of_Japan.jpg">bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</a></p>

<p>Notice the colour difference in each picture? And the fact that the clouds don&#39;t quite align?</p>

<p>I think that they have taken two separate mushroom clouds and spliced them together.</p>

<p>A study was done on the impact of the bombs on survivors, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/01/us/hiroshima-study-finds-no-genetic-damage.html">it failed to identify an increase in congenital abnormalities, cancer, chromosome aberrations or mutational blood protein changes.</a></p>

<p>Miles Mathis did a great piece on the <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/bikini.pdf">Bikini Atoll tests</a></p>

<p>The main takeaway from that document is the continuity error on page 2.</p>

<p>Notice the wooden structures on the beach and in the sea.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ctbto.org/uploads/tx_ctbtoslider/Able_crossroads_2.jpg">https://www.ctbto.org/uploads/tx_ctbtoslider/Able_crossroads_2.jpg</a></p>

<p>The picture above is from the able nuclear test, and the picture below is from the Baker test.</p>

<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Operation_Crossroads_Baker_Edit.jpg">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Operation_Crossroads_Baker_Edit.jpg</a></p>

<p>The Baker test was 24 days after the Able test, why are the wooden structures still present in the second picture, shouldn&#39;t they have been blown away?</p>

<p>Mathis also did an article about nuclear weapons in general, and why he thinks they are fake.</p>

<p><a href="http://mileswmathis.com/trinity.pdf">http://mileswmathis.com/trinity.pdf</a></p>

<p>Like many conspiracies it is easier to see the fakery, once you break free of the conditioned response.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGhWB2px99g">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGhWB2px99g</a></p>

<p>This video is a good example. Pause at 0:50, just before the explosion. Where is the bomb? Surely we would expect some kind of tower to be visible?</p>

<p>Maybe the bomb was dropped by a plane? Nope. According to wikipedia a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/596_(nuclear_test">tower was used.</a></p>

<p>Then there is the explosion itself, before the flash it looks like daytime, yet afterwards the sky turns dark! Very strange! Perhaps this is another example of spliced footage.</p>

<p>I personally think the flash is a magnesium bomb.</p>

<p>The red/yellow colour of the mushroom cloud at 0:59 is indicative of burning hydrocarbons, such as those found in TNT. Again this appears to be at night time, so another example of spliced footage.</p>

<p>Nuclear weapons are designed to scare people and justify wars, they don&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>For the 1000th and final time, it was an air-burst. Air-bursts produce a fraction of the radiation when compared to lay-down blasts because they don&#39;t draw up as much dust and debris into the cloud. Not only that, but not only was radiation from blasts very badly understood at the time, they likely just didn&#39;t think enough about it to care.</p>

<p>You are Dramatically overestimating how powerful a Nuclear blast is. The largest detonation produced from Crossroads was 23kt. From that size, compared to the distance from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Crossroads#/media/File:Bikini_Atoll_Operation_Crossroads.svg">the location</a> of the shots (I&#39;m going to go with Bikini, just because of the size of the cloud), you could lie on the fucking beach and as long as you didn&#39;t directly stare at the explosion <a href="http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/?&amp;amp;kt=23&amp;amp;lat=11.5977127&amp;amp;lng=165.50918&amp;amp;hob_ft=0&amp;amp;therm=_3rd-100,35&amp;amp;zm=13">you&#39;d be completely fine.</a></p>

<p><em>Edit</em> - </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Ok, now in about 50% sure you&#39;re trolling, because surely you know that it&#39;s because of the settings on the camera as to not get blown the fuck out by the nuclear explosion right in-front of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, exactly. And if you watch the whole sequence from ~0:13 to 0:18 in 0.25 speed you can see that by the time the &#39;mushroom&#39; shape of the explosion has formed, you&#39;ve already seen most of the energy expelled outwards.
