       No, religion is a good thing. Notice how the elite is desperately trying to discredit religion at the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me, religion is about anchoring society into the wisdom of the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       Religion gives us a sense of individual purpose, one based on spiritualism, rather than the mindless hedonism/consumerism of the modern day world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Contrary to the protestations of shills like Richard Dawkins, religion is not about God or believing in his existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Religion is about promoting conservative values, because without these, civilisation collapses! Read John Glubb's 'The Fate of Empires'.

       Actually it's a solution to many of the world's problems. Most people behave better than they would if it were not for religion. Christianity, especially, tends to build social cohesion and cooperation so that people spend less time and effort worrying about how to keep from being stabbed in the back, and more time collaborating to achieve win-win solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, there are flaws with building high-trust societies. You can't have a lot of moochers or parasites who refuse to abide by the same rules as the charitable, altruistic masses or it all collapses the way Weimar Germany did when corrupt Jewish ethnic networking allowed Jews to take over and to exploit the German masses.

       Well you said it's the source of the worlds problems.

       So surely removing the source of the worlds problems would result in a world without problems?

       The actions of the prophets are the main distinction between these three religions. Still the same overarching deity.

       You can't know where hell is. Mortal flesh can't know that. Only when you die do you really find out. And seeing as how no one dead is coming to life you can't disapprove any religion. Hell even the church of the flying spaghetti monster can't be disproved

       Hell and heaven can't be proved you're right. But then again you are not dead and you don't know for sure. That's where faith comes in. No I don't believe everything in the bible but I have faith something greater is out there. If you don't that's your choice but don't try and shit on others choices just because its not your choice. People like you always try to prove something isn't real when you can't grasp what it means to others and why they think its real. So until you can prove god does not exist with factual evidence and not just "science proves you're wrong" then my faith will remain where it is.

       So there'd still be war, still be issues with world hunger, still be issues with the distribution of wealth.

      <p>
       So with or without religion, the major problems that plague the world would still be here. I thought you said religion was the source of the worlds problems?

       I do believe in Jesus he's brought me to be humble but like I said it's your opinion and I could go on and on what I believe but whats the point when you just will not except it. God's not real in your eyes so be it but we are in shitty times like my book said there will be.
All I am saying I got more truths from the bible than most things on this earth. I hope you find your way brother.

       I can prove to you the existence of gods and the spirit world.  But you have to actually do what I say because this IS the only way.  You are in the atheism box and need to understand that you are wrong.

       Okay, do everything you can to find pure dimethyl-tryptamine dmt.  Buy a micro g pen from grenko sciences.  Fill the pen with dmt and inhale.  Do this from time to time over the next few months and explore everything that is.  Your welcome.

       Logic can be cold.  Do you believe in the NWO?  They justified 9/11 for the catalyst which will create the NWO.  I have a feeling our concept of the holocaust will be like a tea party compared for what awaits us. The "logical" hate conspiracy theorists so I fail to see your point.

       That's just human psychology.  To follow others.  It has nothing to do with religion.  The Nazi's didn't hate The Jew's religion, they hated the Jews themselves.  They blamed the Jews for Holodomor, the ukrainian holocaust.  They believed the Jews controlled international finance.  The Nazis were a nationalist movement fighting against an internationalist movement.

       Wow.
Did a priest leave something up your arse, or something?
      </p>
      <p>
       first of all - calm down and you'll find you are a lot more coherent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly,
Learn the difference between faith and religion, you seem to be getting them mixed up.
Religion is indeed an oft misused tool, but what you are characterizing is faith - i.e people's beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Faith is a wonderful, powerful phenomenon that almost everyone experiences at some point or another - it's just down to what you believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes - the action of blindly following a religion seems a bit foolish to those of us with more
       <em>
        faith
       </em>
       in atheism.
You are totally wrong to think that believing in God diminishes your intellect or credibility, or ability to control your own actions etc.
Using religion as an excuse for atrocities is, I agree, an absolute abhorrence, but labeling all people who
       <em>
        believe
       </em>
       in anything as dangerous is utterly retarded.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure you would take umbrage with someone suggesting that all people who believe in alternative press / conspiracies are mentally ill and therefore the root of all that is evil in the world... wouldn't you?

       Give it a rest.
Very few people have the lack of acuity to be force fed anything they don't want to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       we're back on faith again - not religion.
If you can show me anything from any religious text that instructs it's followers to commit the horrors you've ascribed to them, I'll be surprised.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, 
If what you are saying about being force fed this bull is even halfway true, anyone that watches Fox News or Infowars  ought to be interred in your "camp for the mentally ill."

       You subscribe to the idea that all religious people are weak minded, easily influenced and potentially dangerous because of this.
I just wondered if you could see this from a different point of view - i.e how these religious people might view you for being outspoken about your faith.

       I understand completely. That's the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       So - this weight your putting on evidence... it goes both ways, right?
Only fair that you take a look at your own belief system and work out what you believe, despite a lack of evidence to support it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still feel like your failing to see the blinding similarity between someone believing in God because a book says he exists and believing that, for example, Bildebergers control the world because a website said so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you understand the similarity?

      <p>
       Mathematics is a man made construct... where is your evidence that 1+1 does in fact equal 2?
Because your maths teacher told you?
      </p>
      <p>
       It becomes a lot harder to provide tangible evidence when your discussing an abstract idea.
