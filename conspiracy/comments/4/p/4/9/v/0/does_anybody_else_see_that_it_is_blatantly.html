    <div class="md"><p>No one with a brain would believe that Clinton&#39;s wife being set up to &#39;run for president against&#39; a billionaire Clinton donor and family friend (Trump) is a legit contest. It&#39;s an obvious false opposition scam - her family friend/campaign donor/tv actor buddy suddenly appears on the political scene to <em>completely</em> take over her opposition at the exact time she needs it, and to split her &quot;anti-establishment&quot; opposition down the middle by party affiliation. It&#39;s an OBVIOUS scam.</p>

<p>it doesn&#39;t matter who wins, just like if Putin&#39;s wife was &quot;running for president&quot; against Putin&#39;s billionaire campaign donor and family friend. It would be an obvious scam. They don&#39;t even need to rig the general election, they just need to rig who is allowed in to the general election, which they are obviously already doing by defrauding Sanders at every corner while fomenting a false opposition campaign to scam the dumbass poor &quot;republican&quot; (not that that word means anything) gun-owning morons into thinking &quot;they got der guy in&quot; and &quot;dey can stop taken over buildin&#39;s now&quot; and &quot;dey beat da corruption&quot; and to make them calm down and go along with the next war that comes down the pike, and the new police state programs (ostensibly for use against muslims and immigrants, just like nazi germany&#39;s police state programs, for use against &quot;bad&quot; minorities and immigrants).</p>

<p>btw Alex Jones is an asset who is seeing direct use in this particular scam. a &#39;pied-piper&#39; asset.</p>

<p>&quot;the best way to control the opposition is to lead it ourselves&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>VI Lenin, USSR</li>
</ul>

<p>Sanders campaign itself IDK about, he could be saying and doing a lot more but he seems to be playing well within the boundaries drawn up by the dangerous anti-democratic forces who are fucking him out of a party nomination, as if he doesn&#39;t realize what they actually are, or maybe he just thinks they would JFK him if he went any further in his opposition to them (and then blame the muslims for it, or some specific group who Israel/Saudi Arabia wants america to wipe out for them).</p>

<p>anyone with a trump sign or sticker is the equivalent of an autistic child, as far as i&#39;m concerned, and hillary supporters? well they don&#39;t really exist in real life, so I don&#39;t think anything of them, I&#39;ve never seen one. This whole thing is a scam being run by the foreign intelligence agencies and major corporations that have infiltrated the american political establishment while the law enforcement dickhead anti-americans were too busy chasing whistleblowers and spying on their fellow americans like the secret police anti-democratic forces they are, to do anything about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, and I agree with you that &quot;universally hated&quot; is incorrect on its face. What you don&#39;t seem to understand is the difference between an echo chamber and a subculture. Conspiracy is definitely the latter, and usually the former. You came in here to express a view you knew would be unpopular, but even when prompted, refuse to start any real conversation about <em>why</em> you disagree with the majority of this subculture. You deserved the down votes. Not for expressing your opinion, or stating a fact, but for stopping there. You added nothing to the conversation but your disagreement. </p>

<p>This is an anonymous website I don&#39;t know you, therefore I don&#39;t care what you think. I might care about why you think it.</p>

<p>Let me give you an example. I have a sister.<br/>
Do you care? Did that statement of fact add anything to the conversation? No. It didn&#39;t. If I told you why she thinks Hillary will be a terrific president it might, but the mere statement of fact is useless to everyone else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that was his position. But while Trump is without a doubt a frightening thought as President, Clinton is a violent, narcissistic, double-crossing criminal who as President would work hard to help Wall Street make/steal money to the detriment of any person who wasn&#39;t in that .5-1% income bracket:  <strong>there is no lesser of two evils in this situation.</strong></p>

<p>Further, we <em>know</em> what a crook Clinton is, so we can expect more war in Syria, Iran, Iraq (for example), alongside of more surveillance, reduction of civil rights, etc. because she <em>articulated and supported these policies when she was Sec&#39;y of State.</em> Trump, however, as threatening as he seems, may not be the asshole he is on the campaign trail— it could all be bluster.  So although I wouldn&#39;t vote for Trump, his backers at least have a shred of a logical argument for their position.</p>

<p>But the only real vote is for <em>anyone other than these two.</em> Don&#39;t get sucked into this fucked-up duopoly!  Vote for Gary Johnson or <em>anyone</em> other than Trump or Clinton. She is everything this sub hates about our Federal Government!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gosh, I just can&#39;t agree with you there.</p>

<p>As someone who has been active politically since the early &#39;90s, I just see 25 years of republican smears being dredged up, topped with whipped cream, and served up again to the green tea party types. I don&#39;t really see her as being notably worse than any other active politician, and her policy positions fall much closer to my preferences than Johnson.</p>

<p>No, I&#39;m sure you and many others disagree with my assessment, but hey, it&#39;s a free country. And I&#39;m hardly alone in how I see things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You keep reiterating that you&#39;re not alone in your thought process as if that makes your opinion any more credible. Many people used to think tuberculosis symptoms were a sign that the carrier had been the victim of a vampire attack. That doesn&#39;t make the idea any less ridiculous. </p>

<p>I find it amusing that you actually care about who sits in the oval office still. As if the presidency has the power to change America in any significant way at this point. They might as well be the equivalent of the British royal family. That&#39;s not even a conspiracy, that&#39;s just the way it is. </p>

<p>If you want to find presidential elections amusing, that&#39;s certainly your right. But the result will be that they are decided by those of us who do take them seriously. Whether you find our opinions credible or not.</p>

<p>I think the best evidence that they do matter is the fact that billions of dollars are spent to influence them. Including at least a few hundred of mine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re implying that your vote actually matters. Let&#39;s put aside for the moment the plethora of possible conspiracies polluting the broken voting system.</p>

<p>As you know, the Electoral College votes for the President and Vice President. Citizens do not directly vote. These are delegated to states according to how many seats they have in congress, which effectively makes the majority of the 50+ US states inconsequential. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t live in a swing state, your single vote really has no say in the election. The official appointed electors are not even bound by federal law to honor their pledge to vote for the candidate that wins majority in their state.</p>

<p>This breeds apathy in the American people which keeps the red states red and blue states blue since the only people voting are people like you who think it actually makes a difference. Throw in the fact that it has been proven that voter fraud in various forms from hacking voting machines to the dead voting are very real issues and you have a system that simply does not speak for the people.</p>

<p>So why should I take this system seriously? The fact that we spend billions of dollars to sway people&#39;s opinions on an individual&#39;s character is nauseating. It&#39;s a constant shit storm of he said, she said slandering that really has nothing to do with the real issues in America. </p>

<p>Super PACs are there to spin stories, manipulate the public, and scare you into voting for someone who really doesn&#39;t have your best interest in mind. But with a billion dollars they&#39;ll make you think they do. </p>

<p>But I will say that if you truly believe George W and George HW Bush are sociopathic, self-serving, murderous criminals, then you would know that the Clintons are no less. </p>

<p>In fact, I find it very odd that you find this sub even remotely palatable. There are numerous discussions here every month in which we discuss, more specifically,  the criminal acts of George HW Bush and Hillary Clinton—the two people we believe are at the root of the criminal acts/enterprises within their respective families. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not often that someone visits here and immediately aligns with our &quot;theories&quot; but I would say that those who do tend to be the least partisan. Without needing explanation they understand that should they conclude there exists a rampant criminal element in the federal government, partisanship games are not involved.</p>

<p>And if you don&#39;t believe that George W and George HW Bush (namely Poppy) aren&#39;t the murdering sociopaths that many may say then you sir are quite blind.</p>

<p>Do you know we here in the Netherlands pay at least 24 % tax and it goes up quickly to 30% and 60 % if you earn more than 100k€ a year or so. But we don&#39;t complain, it&#39;s the opposite really. We&#39;re happy to do so and you know we have way higher living standards. I do realize that those countries are really not comparable but never the less it saddens me when humans don&#39;t want to pay more taxes just to help others (never pay more to make some assholes richer ofc)</p>

<p>Dutch are the main ally of Britain in the colonial era. And both serve the British Crown and the City of London, which is a soverign entity under Rothschild rule.</p>

<p>Therefore Holland is another important seat of the shadow elites. And so are their major companies - like Shell, Unilever and Phillips - owned by the shadow elite.</p>

<p>Dutch and British where at war during colonial age...
Dutch crown has some old family ties with UK but they ended it when we lost Belgium and the UK created a puppet king (our king used to be a puppet eswell but he fucked up for himself)
There is even talk in the EU royal corridors that the House of Orange is illegitimate and thus non of the royals want to marry off to the Oranges. Beatrix and her father didn&#39;t invent the Bilderberg for nothing they wanted to get in the middle of it and keep England out.</p>

<p>Yes, but during the Napoleonic wars, Dutch handed its colony in south east Asia to UK. To hinder it falling to French hands.</p>

<p>Yes and after Napoleon was defeated UK created the kingdom of the Netherlands. We used to be a republic before and it was war war war with UK(so we basicly lost here)</p>

<p>But after some years our newly and beloved king fucked it all up lost Belgium and had to abdicate.Belgium was given an other English Royal but the House of Orange was not welcome in UK any more. Dutch king wanted to attack Belgium and was prevented by UK. Ever since it has been a bad relation. they are not BFF more like competitors in world dominance.</p>

<p>So why hand over Netherland-Indie, when they were at war? How did they know UK will return the colony back to Netherland?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good question and they didnt know the UK would return the colony, the UK invaded Java to get it. Mind you the Dutch didn&#39;t mind being controlled by the French at first, Napoleons brother was a good king for the Netherlands and was even removed by his big brother for being to kinds towards us. I&#39;m guessing the return was part of the deal for the creation of the kingdom of the Netherlands or something like that., but not sure interesting matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m kind of leaning towards this. I think he started this whole thing as a joke, as if to say in Peter Griffin-esque fashion, &quot;Imagine - <em>me,</em> as President?!&quot; and then all sorts of whacky shenanigans played out in his brain. And so he went out of his way to be as crazy and whacky as possible, assuming there&#39;s no way he would make it very far. Little did he know how utterly retarded the American public is and bought into his goofy dog and pony show and then he came to the realization that he actually <em>could</em> win this thing. Theoretically anyway. It&#39;s not like they&#39;d actually let him be President.</p>

<p>The same thing happened to me when I ran for class president in senior year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s public knowledge that Hillary and Trump are good friends and that Bill Clinton asked Trump to run for President. So I&#39;ve never really understood why so many &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; and &quot;freethinkers&quot; and libertarians embrace the &quot;anti establishment candidate&quot; Trump. </p>

<p>The MSM and the rest of the elite used reverse psychology to get people to vote for Trump. By telling them NOT to vote for him, they knew people would do the opposite, since so many people no longer respect the MSM or the rest of the elite. </p>

<p>It was a clever trick indeed. </p>

<p>Add to that the fact that Alex Jones and other controlled opposition disinfo agents also embrace Trump, and it&#39;s no wonder Trump is getting so popular. He&#39;s a populist with no real policies, a professional liar and he speaks in simple terms that even idiots can understand. He changes his stance on important topics even more often than Hillary, and he obviously can&#39;t be trusted. </p>

<p>The whole point of his campaign seems to be the ushering in of chaos and an &quot;American Spring&quot;, a new civil war. He&#39;s probably shorted the world economy together with his Goldman Sachs pals, and stands to gain a fortune when the economy collapses partly due to his very own campaign. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and have since the beginning.  Personally, I think Trump was meant to knock out Jebbers from the running, which is exactly what he did with ease.  All he had to do was call Bush &quot;low energy&quot; or &quot;guacamole bowl merchant&quot; one time.  The fact that his run has been so spectacular I&#39;m sure surprised everyone, and shows just how primed for fascism this nation is.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Even Trump&#39;s most trusted advisors didn&#39;t expect him to fare this well.</p>

<p>Almost a year ago, recruited for my public relations and public policy expertise, I sat in Trump Tower being told that the goal was to get The Donald to poll in double digits and come in second in delegate count. That was it.</p>

<p>The Trump camp would have been satisfied to see him polling at 12% and taking second place to a candidate who might hold 50%. His candidacy was a protest candidacy.</p>

<p>It pains me to say, but he is the presidential equivalent of Sanjaya on American Idol. President Trump would be President Sanjaya in terms of legitimacy and authority.</p>

<p>And I am now taking full responsibility for helping create this monster — and reaching out directly to those voters who, like me, wanted Trump to be the real deal.</p>

<p>My support for Trump began probably like yours did. Similar to so many other Americans, I was tired of the rhetoric in Washington. Negativity and stubbornness were at an all-time high, and the presidential prospects didn&#39;t look promising.</p>

<p>In 2015, I fell in love with the idea of the protest candidate who was not bought by corporations. A man who sat in a Manhattan high-rise he had built, making waves as a straight talker with a business background, full of successes and failures, who wanted America to return to greatness.</p>

<p>I was sold.</p>

<p>Last summer, I signed on as the Communications Director of the Make America Great Again Super PAC.</p>

<p>It was still early in the Trump campaign, and we hit the ground running. His biggest competitor had more than $100 million in a Super PAC. The Jeb Bush deep pockets looked to be the biggest obstacle we faced. We seemed to be up against a steep challenge, especially since a big part of the appeal of a Trump candidacy was not being influenced by PAC money.</p>

<p>After the first debate, I was more anxious than ever to support Trump. The exchange with Megyn Kelly was like manna from heaven for a communications director. She appeared like yet another reporter trying to kick out the guest who wasn’t invited to the party. At the time, I felt excited for the change to the debate he could bring. I began realizing the man really resonates with the masses and would bring people to the process who had never participated before.</p>

<p>That was inspiring to me.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t long before every day I awoke to a buzzing phone and a shaking head because Trump had said something politically incorrect the night before. I have been around politics long enough to know that the other side will pounce on any and every opportunity to smear a candidate.</p>

<p>But something surprising and absolutely unexpected happened. Every other candidate misestimated the anger and outrage of the “silent majority” of Americans who are not a part of the liberal elite. So with each statement came a jump in the polls. Just when I thought we were finished, The Donald gained more popularity.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think even Trump thought he would get this far. And I don’t even know that he wanted to, which is perhaps the scariest prospect of all.</p>

<p>He certainly was never prepared or equipped to go all the way to the White House, but his ego has now taken over the driver&#39;s seat, and nothing else matters. The Donald does not fail. The Donald does not have any weakness. The Donald is his own biggest enemy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s more, but this is the part that addressed Bush and the early goals of Trump&#39;s campaign.</p>

<p>-drowned out Bernie
-captured the far right early on 
- possibly took on a few independents that otherwise may have favored Bernie over Clinton (trade policy, etc)
- free media distraction whenever </p>

<p>Not to mention he and the clintons are long buds and much of what he&#39;s on the record saying in the 90s/early 2000s very much mirrors Clintons policies.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s totally obvious controlled opposition. The only argument against this is how much he attacked Clinton. I think the attacks on Clinton were all fully fleshed out by the time Trump ever said anything, so he was probably just playing his role.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it wasn&#39;t, it was founded by religious refugees (sounds familiar right?), people trying to make a home for themselves outside of the empire, and free thinkers that wanted to escape the tyranny of King George and the British empire. Maybe you might want to review your history.</p>

<p>Secondly white people are still the majority, but females overall are the majority, I&#39;m having trouble finding anything breaking down the white female/male statistics but assuming the population female/male trend stays true white females are the majority, white males are the minority. So no, angry white males are not the majority, and I&#39;m pretty sure we can&#39;t quantify the percentage of angry/racist/homophobic/xenophobic white dudes but I&#39;m more than positive they are far in the minority.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get it twisted my friend Trump at his highest polling was only taking well below 50% of the total Republican vote, I think it hovered between 25% and 35% but his closest opponent only had 20% at the very most and the rest were much lower. So let&#39;s say he has at least 50% of the total Republican vote, do you really think those numbers will beat the Hillary votes, the people who went from Bernie to Hillary, and then the Republicans that are saying they&#39;re going for Hillary, and then the independents that will vote for her? Don&#39;t get me wrong Trump will garner independents as well but I&#39;m sure the statistics will fall in line with the previous trends. </p>

<p>Trump is the dog and pony show, whereas Hillary is the mean machine, she has all of the advantages and a lot of his campaign and relationship with the Clinton&#39;s shows an easy case for the theory that Trump is controlled opposition, and you and others like you are most certainly are his marks, I mean look at the evidence coming out now that he&#39;s using donations to keep his empire afloat and giving pay outs to his family. </p>

<p>Remember Trump has said it himself, he loves the poorly educated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is the 9/11 of American presidential politics, the government&#39;s official response to the attacks was an instance of falsity hiding in plain sight, while sowing enough uncertainty among the populace to cause most of them to doubt their own gut instincts or to tune the matter out. The same with Trump&#39;s candidacy: an entirely unbelievable story line, but all alternative explanations for his motivations are seemingly unprovable, so rational people are compelled by default to discount their gut instincts and accept the official narrative promoted by the msm.  </p>

<p>People in general are ill-informed idiots. They have no independent thought, do no independent research, and just listen to the talking heads on the tee-vee who looks the most like they do. Of course they like Trump. He&#39;s &quot;telling it like it is&quot; and playing the game where he sympathizes with the plight of the poor white man, despite being a flamboyant playboy millionaire who has never existed in the reality that most people live day to day.</p>

<p>This is working especially well right now because of the political climate in this fucked up country. We&#39;ve spent the last 15 years fighting &quot;terror&quot; based on a false flag attack that raised chest-beating, gun-toting Patriotism to skyhigh levels. We all wanted to blow those goddamn sand niggers to kingdom come when they attacked Merika! And we&#39;ve been fighting this war ever since. They just keep moving the finish line further and further away. Of course people will support a guy like Trump in this day and age. He&#39;s telling all the angry white people what they want to hear - that it&#39;s everyone else&#39;s fault and if we just build a really tall wall, that will pay for itself, it will make this country like it was in the 1950s again, with big cars and apple pies cooling on window sils!</p>

<p>Perfect example:</p>

<p>Trump was asked about abortion, he said that he is against abortion. The interviewer asked what would be done to women that got abortions illegally. Trump answered that they would be punished... You know like what happens when you break the law.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump probably never intended to actually serve the country.   Come on,  service?   Really,  by now he must realize that politics is very hard work,  and being an actor is relatively easy.    Some of the hardest hitters on the planet like the Clintons who are fully as capable as any Mafia,  in fact,  they are a type of Mafia.....</p>

<p>Trump has his abilities,   but he is a lightweight.   He is not even all that rich.    He is more in the realm of that <strong>Here Comes Honey Boo Boo</strong> reality show.    If they let someone like that sit in the white house,   say,  Ronald Reagan,   they are just as likely to let him be shot.    No,   Trump never was really up to it.    That doesn&#39;t mean he is actually collaborating with Hillary.    He&#39;s just a useful idiot who hit a chord with a shit ton of ignorant fools.    And besides,   if all you care about is your brokerage account balance,  well,  Trump vs Clinton,   why not Trump?    Seriously.</p>

<p>In 2006 Trump unsuccessfully sued a journalist who wrote a book proclaiming the mogul was worth a mere $150 – $250 million. Trump sat for a deposition in late 2007 as part of that case and had to discuss his net worth under oath.   During the deposition the billionaire famously said that his net worth fluctuates “with markets and with attitudes and with feelings, even my own feelings,” but that he determines the number based on his “general attitude at the time that the question may be asked.” When your fortune ebbs and flows according to your own mood, it’s not hard to push limits or conjure up billions. And what about when Trump isn’t feeling so hot about himself? “You wouldn’t tell a reporter you’re doing poorly,” he said.</p>

<p>So,  I guess he made it to the list anyway.   What a con.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When net worth is directly tied to the brand name, then, yeah, it can fluctuate wildly depending on perceptions. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s put it another way by changing gears: How much is the brand Nike worth? I&#39;m not talking assets even. What&#39;s it mean for the profit margin of the sale of a single shirt when a shirt gets a Nike symbol compared to when it doesn&#39;t have one? Has that value fluctuated? What about when competing brands rise up like Under Armor? Why was it such a big deal that Under Armor &quot;stole&quot; Steph Curry from Nike?</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t understand the answers to these questions, you&#39;ll never understand what Trump was talking about in the quotes you mentioned. Because you don&#39;t understand the value of a brand. Because you don&#39;t understand modern marketing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In accounting terminology it used to be called goodwill.    Its why companies protect a tradename.</p>

<p>In accounting,  you put a value on it from year to year,  and account for fluctuations.    It doesn&#39;t depend on your mood.</p>

<p>Also,  if it depends on a single personality,  the insurance you take out on that person is proportionate.</p>

<p>Remember P.. T. Barnum,  there is a sucker born every minute?   Would have loved the celebrity hucksterism of reality politics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do hope people realize this whole topic, and lot of people in it are probably the paid for Clinton shills. But to answer the question let&#39;s see here.</p>

<p>When Trump announced he was running he was attacked immediately by both MSM, and several big business that cut ties with him. Why do this if he is part of the plan?</p>

<p>Secondly Trump went places TPTB would never ever want any presidential candidate to go even as a joke. There are certain topics that are supposed to be off limits for both sides. He has successfully put the dissolving of our southern border, and bad trade deals that are killing the middle class on the table. And of course attacking the new Muslim immigration agenda that seems to be a major priority lately in Europe, and other Western nations.</p>

<p>Finally he besides basically sinking the campaign of all the other Republican candidates he is also trying his hardest to sink Clinton. Digging deep into scandals other candidates would never touch. Like Bill Clinton&#39;s history of rape. The only person he went easy on was Bernie Sanders. Because it was to Trump&#39;s benefit for Bernie to give Clinton a hard time. If he is in kahoots then he is doing a terrible job of helping her.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm. </p>

<p>The biggest sign for me that Trump was controlled opposition is the fact that one of reddit&#39;s most zealous political activists, jcm267 (search that name), started <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a>. </p>

<p>jcm267 is perhaps reddit&#39;s biggest supporter of the Bush admin, Israel, war, torture, spying on innocent Americans and mass-murdering Palestinians (and all Muslims in general). Hillary <em>should</em> be his ideal candidate, but he spent all his time and efforts conflating Trump with racism and /pol/ trolling. Gee, I wonder why???

<p>Trump&#39;s support on /pol/ existed long before there was any following on reddit (I&#39;ve used /pol/ for a long time). If anything I would say reddit is controlled so it doesn&#39;t get into things like holocaust denial or racism or too anti Israel, which would turn off republicans. I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re right or wrong but your argument does rely on the_donald being meant to hurt trump&#39;s campaign, which I disagree with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are watching the dissolution of the GOP (divide and conquer) who exactly will be left as the collectively pissed? The options are narrowing.</p>

<p>Options
1. The GOP nominates someone other than Trump, thus alienating their voters.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The GOP nominates Trump and he self destructs in a spectacular fashion thus spurning whatever trust and confidence the GOP still holds with the public.  (If anyone wants to bet on self destruction options, start below, I am partial to the N Bomb in a live debate)</p></li>
<li><p>If I am missing an option that keeps the GOP viable as an organization (not a public one) who just lost the rigging an election game vs the DNC (the clear winner), let me know. The GOP is ending as a viable party. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/2016/03/31/how-donald-trump-exaggerates-and-fibs-about-his-4-5-billion-net-worth/#5452eeb3787e">http://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/2016/03/31/how-donald-trump-exaggerates-and-fibs-about-his-4-5-billion-net-worth/#5452eeb3787e</a></p>

<p>In 2006 Trump unsuccessfully sued a journalist who wrote a book proclaiming the mogul was worth a mere $150 – $250 million. Trump sat for a deposition in late 2007 as part of that case and had to discuss his net worth under oath.   During the deposition the billionaire famously said that his net worth fluctuates “with markets and with attitudes and with feelings, even my own feelings,” but that he determines the number based on his “general attitude at the time that the question may be asked.” When your fortune ebbs and flows according to your own mood, it’s not hard to push limits or conjure up billions. And what about when Trump isn’t feeling so hot about himself? “You wouldn’t tell a reporter you’re doing poorly,” he said.</p>

<p>So,  I guess he made it to the list anyway.   What a con.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that was his position. But while Trump is without a doubt a frightening thought as President, Clinton is a violent, narcissistic, double-crossing criminal who as President would work hard to help Wall Street make/steal money to the detriment of any person who wasn&#39;t in that .5-1% income bracket:  <strong>there is no lesser of two evils in this situation.</strong></p>

<p>Further, we <em>know</em> what a crook Clinton is, so we can expect more war in Syria, Iran, Iraq (for example), alongside of more surveillance, reduction of civil rights, etc. because she <em>articulated and supported these policies when she was Sec&#39;y of State.</em> Trump, however, as threatening as he seems, may not be the asshole he is on the campaign trail— it could all be bluster.  So although I wouldn&#39;t vote for Trump, his backers at least have a shred of a logical argument for their position.</p>

<p>But the only real vote is for <em>anyone other than these two.</em> Don&#39;t get sucked into this fucked-up duopoly!  Vote for Gary Johnson or <em>anyone</em> other than Trump or Clinton. She is everything this sub hates about our Federal Government!</p>
