Were they fake flights where no planes were actually involved or were they real flights and nobody knows what happened to the people?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The undisputed facts are that nobody on the flight rosters of either plane were ever seen again. The planes themselves are gone and haven&#39;t been seen. The people alleged to have died in the Pentagon hit were also never seen again. </p>

<p>All this suggests that if the planes did not in fact crash, the government(?) seized a flight, executed (or kidnapped?) all the passengers, dismantled the plane, and staged a plane sized explosion at the Pentagon to accomplish some goal. They also did the same with some other plane for no apparent reason.</p>

<p>It would seem like the easiest way to make people think a hijacked plane hit the Pentagon, would be to actually hijack a plane and fly it into the Pentagon. I can&#39;t completely discount the possibility that the government was involved in some nefarious plot, though it seems that a conspiracy of that size would be awful hard to keep secret for so long.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flight 93 never landed at Cleveland Hopkins. This was a misreading of an United Airlines press release published by the news outlet WCPO. Woody Box, the 9/11 researcher who popularized the original WCPO article which was featured in <em>Loose Change</em>, wrote an article in May 2004 about an airliner performing a &quot;terror drill&quot; that landed at Cleveland Hopkins, but it was not Flight 93. </p>

<p><em>Loose Change</em> grabbed his article and assumed it was talking about Flight 93. Woody Box had <a href="http://911woodybox.blogspot.com/2007/02/cleveland-airport-mystery.html">to correct</a> the false statements about his article and the original WCPO piece. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, I&#39;ve seen all those. Maybe there was only one that captured the impact, because it had a sidelong view, but that&#39;s not to say that others wouldn&#39;t have captured the planes decent, or incoming flight along the ground.

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.911myths.com/html/rumsfeld__9_11_and__2_3_trilli.html">People knew about the &#39;missing trillions&#39; since February 2000.</a> If the scheduling of the conference was an issue, Rumsfeld could&#39;ve moved it to a few days before 9/11. </p>

<p>Boeing 757 impact is completely consistent with damage pattern, physics and eyewitness accounts. </p>

<p>Regarding the alleged &quot;seized&quot; security footage. There are only two supported accounts of confiscated footage outside the five-frame Pentagon security tapes: Citgo and Doubletree. These tapes were publicly released years ago. </p>

<p><strong>There is no proof that more than three tapes around the Pentagon&#39;s vicinity were seized by the FBI.</strong></p>

<p><strong>There is no proof that other tapes apart from the parking lot footage depict a Boeing 757 impact.</strong></p>

<p>The rest of the claimed &quot;85 confiscated videotapes&quot; were <em>voluntarily sent in</em> from private individuals to the FBI&#39;s field offices, and are privately held footage. Thus, in order to release them publicly, permission would need to be secured from the individual who owns that footage. The majority of the tapes sent in have no relation to the Pentagon crash at all. </p>

<p>Neither the DoD nor the FBI ever claimed to have eighty-five tapes depicting a Boeing 757 crash into the Pentagon, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re referring to. </p>

<p>A 2004 FOIA request asked for footage depicting the crash of Flight 77. The agent who replied to the FOIA request determined that the FBI &quot;was in possession of eighty-five videotapes <strong>related</strong> to 9/11&quot;. It then went on to categorize what was contained on 29 of the tapes she reviewed personally. (The other 56 cropped up in an initial database search and didn&#39;t even show the Pentagon building). </p>

<p>16 of those 29 tapes showed the Pentagon, but <strong>&quot;did not show the Pentagon crash site nor the impact into the Pentagon.&quot;</strong> Of the remaining 13 videos, 12 showed the Pentagon only <em>after</em> the impact. That leaves just one tape: the parking lot footage. Which was released. 14 years ago. 
The other videos weren&#39;t released, because <strong>those did not fulfill the claimant&#39;s request.</strong> The person asked for footage of Flight 77 hitting the Pentagon, and the <strong>closest tapes to that request</strong> that the agent could find were the Doubletree and Citgo tapes (i.e. it captured when the impact happened, but not directly).</p>

<p>In other words, the agent was simply itemizing the tapes she thought the FBI had, and excluded the ones which weren&#39;t relevant to the person&#39;s request. </p>

<p>Somehow, no-planers read the quotation above, and got the idea that the FBI confiscated 85 tapes that showed clear footage of the impact. This is how the &quot;confiscated tapes&quot; claim got started: from a misreading of a reply to a FOIA request.</p>

<p>In complying with the FOIA request, the FBI released the relevant footage it had. This is how we got the Doubletree and Citgo videos. Up until 2006 we only had the five-frame Pentagon video (which is the only tape the Pentagon has which clearly depicts the crash).</p>

<p><strong>The seized footage has been publicly released and is available on YouTube.</strong></p>

Two different take-off times as well, the same case for Flight 175. The wheels-off for Flight 93 was 8:28 according to BTS, but according to F.A.A. it departed at 8:43. Flight 11 had two different gate numbers. I think the official departure gate was Gate 32, but other sources say Gate 26 (perhaps the real plane that was duplicated, and Gate 32 was the drone which was tracked by the FAA). There&#39;s apparently evidence for an earlier take off for the real Flight 11. This is documented in Elias Davidsson&#39;s book, <em>Hijacking America&#39;s Mind</em>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t watched the video, but I bet it uses that infamous BBC article about the hijackers being &quot;alive and well&quot;. The bottom of that article contains an <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2006/10/911_conspiracy_theory_1.html">update</a>. This clarifies that there was confusion over the apparent names and identities, a fact which was acknowledged by the FBI. If the hijackers were still alive, why not do a TV interview to prove they&#39;re living, and also their innocence. They&#39;re associated with a major crime, after all. </p>

<p>The Pentagon was hit by a large airliner, this is what all the evidence says to be true based on the evidence. This scenario is also consistent with Norman Mineta’s testimony and over a hundred eyewitness testimony </p>

<p>David Chandler, Jonathan Cole, Nathan Flach, Dr. Niels Harrit etc etc, some of the best and honest 9/11 researchers are in agreement with this.</p>

<li><p>The &quot;small hole&quot; is in reality ninety foot wide.

<p>It&#39;s quite easy to conclude, once you ignore the misinformation. A 757 hit the Pentagon. There is simply no other theory which accounts for the evidence of the ATC records (cross-referenced by other radio traffic), radar data, the footage, etc. </p>
