        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We know Hillary has the media in her pocket as those leaked docs show. I find it strange that as soon as MSM declares Hillary as the victor ( even though she hasn&#39;t won ), all talks of Bernie disappear ( though still in race ) and Trumps ratings start to fall. The same people behind the polling are the corps that Hillary has in her pocket.  </p>

<p>Could they have kept polling numbers up for Trump to keep people scared until they were able to bag Bernie. Now that they consider Bernie less of a threat they drop Trumps numbers and push Hillary hard giving the false narrative that people actually support her.  </p>

<p>Anyone following this election can easily see that USA has totally lost any credibility it had left. As if we didn&#39;t lose it already when we illegally invaded Iraq. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve realized blind nationalism only works when your limited with information. This is no longer the case here and we finally see the emperor has no clothes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s got to the point where my father tries to have &quot;a sensible debate&quot; with me over politics and I just hear him parroting the MSM. It really disgusts me. He gets angry when I tell him I won&#39;t talk politics with him when his main source of information is just a campaign of lies. He then tries to say how he has other sources on the internet, which are basically the MSM homepages. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same.. no TV. Recently I&#39;m proud that I was able to get my mother to start surfing the internet more. She also has a receptive ear to news that isn&#39;t the MSM. She questioned why they would call the race for Hillary the day before people finished voting in CA. She found it interesting that I was blabbing about the Nevada caucus days before the MSM spun it as &quot;crazy Bernie bros throw chair and get violent&quot; and questioned it.  </p>

<p>Bottom line is, we are the generation with the information. Hate to say it but, out with the old and in with the new.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tend to agree -- it&#39;s not 100%, but it&#39;s very likely it&#39;s pretty much spot on.  And Iraq got started, naturally, by 9/11, the false flag.  Cheney, Rumsfeld, and Wolfowitz and Bush Sr. -- all amazing geniuses, albeit evil beyond comprehension.  And ever since then we have turned monstrously evil, nazi version 2, and a lot of the higher ups know it.  For many years we have been planning it, and now it&#39;s done -- and we are done for.</p>

<p>Anyone following this election can easily see that USA has totally lost any credibility it had left.&quot;</p>

<p>What credibility?  <a href="https://youtu.be/xZoGbBsdbyY">Diebold</a> voting machines election fraud back in 2000 and every election since they got away with it with Gore vs Bush was when those paying attention knew not to trust the media.   </p>

<p>How about William Cooper warning us an attack is coming and it will be blamed on Osama bin Laden 06/28/2001</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/CEsesnzDBvA">2 months and 14 days before 9/11/2001</a></p>

<p>Not to mention the <a href="https://youtu.be/0iQgjFdwvN0">nanothermite</a> found in the dust of WTC 1,2 and 7.
It was since then I got rid of my cable TV and never read any reports spun by the corporate-fascist, government-sanctioned infotainment shitshow that passes for &quot;the news&quot;. </p>
