       We know Hillary has the media in her pocket as those leaked docs show. I find it strange that as soon as MSM declares Hillary as the victor ( even though she hasn't won ), all talks of Bernie disappear ( though still in race ) and Trumps ratings start to fall. The same people behind the polling are the corps that Hillary has in her pocket.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could they have kept polling numbers up for Trump to keep people scared until they were able to bag Bernie. Now that they consider Bernie less of a threat they drop Trumps numbers and push Hillary hard giving the false narrative that people actually support her.
      </p>

       Anyone following this election can easily see that USA has totally lost any credibility it had left. As if we didn't lose it already when we illegally invaded Iraq.

       I've realized blind nationalism only works when your limited with information. This is no longer the case here and we finally see the emperor has no clothes.

       It's got to the point where my father tries to have "a sensible debate" with me over politics and I just hear him parroting the MSM. It really disgusts me. He gets angry when I tell him I won't talk politics with him when his main source of information is just a campaign of lies. He then tries to say how he has other sources on the internet, which are basically the MSM homepages.

       I feel you. Same here. Fauxnews. It used to be one channel that really wore the badge now it is all just rot. I won't watch it. None of it. Since I decided to not watch TV my knowledge base has increased dramatically. Best choice ever.

       Same.. no TV. Recently I'm proud that I was able to get my mother to start surfing the internet more. She also has a receptive ear to news that isn't the MSM. She questioned why they would call the race for Hillary the day before people finished voting in CA. She found it interesting that I was blabbing about the Nevada caucus days before the MSM spun it as "crazy Bernie bros throw chair and get violent" and questioned it.

       Bottom line is, we are the generation with the information. Hate to say it but, out with the old and in with the new.

       Forgive them. Their whole world was an illusion, sold to them on credit. They payed. But do your best to get as much knowledge of how things really are and be willing to answer their questions. Cause they sure are going to start asking some serious questions, and mygut says this shit show will not stand a whole lot longer.

       I tend to agree -- it's not 100%, but it's very likely it's pretty much spot on.  And Iraq got started, naturally, by 9/11, the false flag.  Cheney, Rumsfeld, and Wolfowitz and Bush Sr. -- all amazing geniuses, albeit evil beyond comprehension.  And ever since then we have turned monstrously evil, nazi version 2, and a lot of the higher ups know it.  For many years we have been planning it, and now it's done -- and we are done for.

       I was impressed that the GOP allowed a candidate they hated when the DNC rigged their primaries to favor their candidate. Now I'm wondering if the GOP was just as rigged so that their fake candidate would have no real chance against Clinton - who is a corporate, wall street, warmonger's dream.

       Eight years ago they did not allow the people's choice to speak at the convention, and the delegates did not matter. So this is not benevolence or having learned. They have a backup plan. Nothing they say or do on either side should be believed at this point.
