Suddenly,the SWAT team come in, and for a second you think you are finally safe.</p>

<p>Then they open fire, and for that fleeting moment everything you&#39;ve ever thought is pushed through you from the barrel of a weapon.</p>

No, its been swept under the rug for lack of &#39;assault&#39; weapon</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were 50 survivors and we only have a list of dead.....that nobody can interview (Other than the Obvious 2-3 Crisis Actors that the media were directed to) Sounds rather suspicious.

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone died at 5:13 because the swat calmly waited for them to bleed out before entering.  Many lives could have been saved if were willing to actually do their job.  So long as police wait outside in a scenario like this then they don&#39;t deserve hero status because they&#39;re not putting their lives on the line.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The police are people, flesh and blood, with families. If the scene isn&#39;t secured and there is an even remote chance of their being more shooters, explosives, etc. . . It makes ZERO sense for them to enter. </p>

<p>Rushing an unsecured building isn&#39;t a job requirement, it doesn&#39;t mean they have to be reckless in order to achieve hero recognition. </p>
