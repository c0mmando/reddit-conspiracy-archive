       I am here (this sub) for my sanity.    There is a social taboo against asking certain questions,  or questioning certain events or assumptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump and Hillary,  even Bernie and their followers are showing the effects of selective memory,   delusion,  and mental illness.    I mean,  Bernie,  turning millions of people who worked hard for change over to the Democratic Party that shafted him?   Trump,  no connection to facts and reality.    Hillary,   riding the wind of the most heinous of treacheries of any family in living memory,  delighting most in her shafting of others while clawing for ever more power.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't have to beg for what is decent,  honest,  and fair.    But we do need to stop compromising with the least worst alternative.   That did not work when bullied on the playground,  and look what it does in real life.   Just look around.
      </p>
      <p>
       Time to bring these criminals down to earth.    Time to strip away their privilege,  secrecy,  and special status for their corporate entities.    The entities that count in a democracy are free press and balance of power.    No more money in politics.  No more rights for parties,  corporations,  and charitable organizations to plot treasonous criminal theft against the population.   PERIOD.

       I agree but I can't see us stopping them without resorting to violence so I'm pretty sure we're forced to go on with their charade for now. Just hope to god Christ consciousness is actually returning soon.

       It's up to you to bring about Christ consciousness, my friend. It has never left. We need to stop with this whole "something is coming to save us" scenario. It's up to us to save ourselves. And we don't have to resort to violence. Imagine what a simple general boycott would achieve...

       It depends, the pyramids were made specifically to vibrate the crown chakra. Either we need to re-finish the pyramids or do something. There is absolutely no way we are going to be able to wake up the masses. David Icke has been going for like 30 years and he's just labelled disinformation everywhere. Before him there were others. How long will it go?

       You must be catching up on some of the youtube stuff i was watching a couple of years ago, so i know where you're coming from. speaking as someone who believes we are actually in the midst of spiritual warfare ( though is it really a war if only one side is fighting it??), i would still warn against believing some of the new-agey stuff that comes along. yes, the pyramids contain knowledge of our past that has been hidden for millenia, knowledge which is essential for the continual evolution of our species. but this knowledge is much too lofty for most people to take. remember, we live in the Matrix and some people are not ready to wake up. especially to the reality that they are having their evolutionary development arrested in order that they be kept as chattel to feed entities slightly higher on the evolutionary ladder :p
      </p>
      <p>
       check out Danny Wilten on youtube, i think you'd enjoy his stuff. also, the Gospel of Thomas has been invaluable to me in these trying times. it says stuff like:
      </p>
      <p>
       (3) Jesus said: If those who lead you say to you: See, the kingdom is in heaven, then the birds of the heaven will go before you; if they say to you: It is in the sea, then the fish will go before you. But the kingdom is within you, and it is outside of you. When you know yourselves, then you will be known, and you will know that you are the sons of the living Father. But if you do not know yourselves, then you are in poverty, and you are poverty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Peace, friend.

       What Bernie did with the betrayal of a movement he started is not criminal.    He sincerely believes that the Hilary version of corporate sellout is better than the Trump version of corporate sellout.    But the corporate sellout is very unethical,  its condoning corruption and criminal bribery.   Pathetic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now,  if we look at Bernie's voting record on foreign wars and military spending,    that was in support of US war crimes in places like Iraq and Libya,  yes,  that was outright treasonous and criminal.    US leaders who voted thus or otherwise supported it,  should be hauled off to something like Nuremberg for war crimes.

       Eject them from society. We don't have to be violent. Mark them and set them loose. We won't succeed in revolution until the ability to identify psychopaths is common. We don't have to be violent though, unless they initiate the violence. And usually they won't if they're smart, and if they're dumb they're easier to catch.

       Why fight a government that gives protection and structure in a world of conflict?

       You do realize Hillary Clinton has coordinated with the supposed to be neutral DNC to conduct "opposition" research to ensure her nomination? By opposition, I mean other potential democratic candidates. Meaning she subverted the Democratic process.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do realize Hillary Clinton, the amount of evidence that increases almost daily, says that she intentionally set up a private email server in an effort to circumvent FOIA requests? In addition to having the State Department disable spam filters(filters that have prevented phishing attacks in the past) because it was causing issues with said server. So in other words she disabled government security features for convenience.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do realize people have been fired for accidentally leaving sensitive documents out on there desks overnight, while she has blatantly disabled security features meant to protect such documents?
      </p>
      <p>
       And she is still not in jail.
      </p>

       That is why.

       If you are afraid of letting go of a government-ruled world full of rape, theft, and murder because you're afraid there will be more rape, theft, and murder then I tend to think you haven't been thinking critically and doing your own research, are afraid to defend yourself and your community, or you like having war criminals tell you you're safe because they're fighting the bad guys and as long as you're not the bad guy you don't care who they kill.
      </p>
      <p>
       War is consuming the planet. The masses are being robbed. Our men, women, and children are suffering grievous sexual and psychosexual violence. You think we really have something to lose by dropping government? We're careening towards a cliff WITH goverment. You think government is gonna fix itself? You think the eternal pattern of government descending into tyranny is gonna change some time soon?
      </p>
      <p>
       Take responsibility for yourself so you can look in the mirror and feel like an adult. Stop expecting someone else to save you at the expense of innocent people across the planet.

       What world do you live in where freedom doesn't have its price? The world is a system of chaos barely held together by the structure of government.
      </p>
      <p>
       The united states of America is in a constant power struggle with the rest of the world trying to ensure American's quality of life remains constant as opposed to being turned into a wasteland by opposing nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Diplomacy is a fickle bitch and every move the government makes either domestic or foreign is a strategic action carefully planned to bring about the best possible outcome for those involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       How would you like it if the government just stopped observing everyone and sat stagnant letting foreign intelligence agencies and terror cells infiltrate America and subvert what order remained? America would crumble and become a military occupied sovereignty of whichever nation had the most resources to devote.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want to become China's bitch because I feel like I deserve a little privacy and I think anyone who wouldn't give their privacy to the government doesn't truly understand what it means to be an American.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cost of freedom isn't measured in how many die overseas fighting wars but in the sacrifice
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       americans make to ensure this nation stays at the top of the totem pole.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm tired of all the anti-government attitudes on r/conspiracy because its obvious that those involved have no idea what the freedom and structure available to any and all americans is worth.

       Revolution takes many forms.   Sometimes its like the fall of the Soviet Union,  where a system has run its course,  and not enough people want to see it continue.

       Other times,  sufficient people are sufficiently pissed off,  usually because the quality of their life had been adversely affected in a huge way.

       The united states of America is in a constant power struggle with the rest of the world trying to ensure American's quality of life remains constant as opposed to being turned into a wasteland by opposing nations.

       Diplomacy is a fickle bitch and every move the government makes either domestic or foreign is a strategic action carefully planned to bring about the best possible outcome for those involved.

       How would you like it if the government just stopped observing everyone and sat stagnant letting foreign intelligence agencies and terror cells infiltrate America and subvert what order remained? America would crumble and become a military occupied sovereignty of whichever nation had the most resources to devote.

       I don't want to become China's bitch because I feel like I deserve a little privacy and I think anyone who wouldn't give their privacy to the government doesn't truly understand what it means to be an American.

       The cost of freedom isn't measured in how many die overseas fighting wars but in the sacrifice
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       americans make to ensure this nation stays at the top of the totem pole.

       I'm tired of all the anti-government attitudes on r/conspiracy because its obvious that those involved have no idea what the freedom and structure available to any and all americans is worth.
