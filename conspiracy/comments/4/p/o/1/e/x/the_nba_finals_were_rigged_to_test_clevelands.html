The police, public transportation, and civil infrastructure of Cleveland has never had a true stress test within the past 52+ years, and they wanted to make sure that nothing could go seriously wrong during the RNC.</p>

Not to mention LeBrons player value index of so high that if he lost, the NBA would of lost 100 million minimum. Plus the NBA is allowed to gamble on its own games and holds the same entertainment license as WWE. It&#39;s not considered sport, it&#39;s entertainment.</p>

They can legally predetermine the outcome, and also can bet on the outcome to create what&#39;s called a lay, or tip off to investors. The NBA, NFL, WWE, and Mexican wrestling all have this license and are not considered athletics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a possibility. That would explain why Steph Curry randomly was fouled out on a couple of BS calls. I mean, you don&#39;t just not foul out in 4 years and foul it in Game 6 of the NBA Finals 4 years later. Another instance of the NBA Finals being rigged was 2001. Sixers against Lakers. NBA and David Stern didn&#39;t like Allen Iverson as he was bringing in a new culture and era into the NBA. So NBA rigged the finals with a ton of bad calls by the ref. Plus when asked of what the ideal NBA finals to David Stern would be, he said &quot;Lakers vs Lakers&quot;. Lakers probably would have won the series anyways, but this series attributes to a history of rigged finals. Not to mention the 1985 draft where during the lottery, David Stern picked up a card, then dropped it. He picked up a second card which had a bent on it. It came out to be the Knicks and they picked Patrick Ewing. So it is definitely possible the NBA rigged it, since it has a history of rigging things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was one game in that series I think it was 1 or 2 where Kobe shot something like 40 FTs. NBA never really liked Allen Iverson either. No doubt the Lakers would have won anyways, (could destroy the 2015-2016 Warriors btw). David Stern was also asked one time which final series he would like to have and he stated Lakers vs Lakers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m from Cleveland, and as ecstatic as I was to see the team win, I had a similar feeling regarding the outcome of the series and the RNC that is taking place a month from now. </p>

<p>While the term &quot;stress test&quot; is a great way of putting this &quot;experiment&quot; (celebration after game seven, parade of 1.3 million etc), I think the climate of the RNC will be totally different. </p>

<p>The game 7 clinch so minor vandalism (a police car did get roughed up a bit) and no arrests. The parade was slightly tarnished by a domestic shooting. </p>

<p>The protests that will come during the RNC will be much more violent and aggressive. I won&#39;t go as far as to say the NBA is fixed, but there is a sincere coincidence here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is really weak and is not true,  I follow pro ball really closely and that series was not fixed.  The NBA would not make Golden State lose they were the best regular season team ever.  They stood to make the same amount from tv deals and the press about a new best team ever would have made just as much as Cleveland winning its first.  The RNC was planned long before LeBron James even came back.</p>

<p>Oh, you follow pro ball? Case closed then.</p>

<p>What brand of retarded do you have to be to call that series not fixed after watching it?</p>

<p>Yeah buddy, Curry is known to flip behind the back passes out of bounds at the end of the fourth quarter in a game 7. He is also known for clutch 3 point shots that brick off of the bottom of the backboard...multiple times a quarter. All things a 2 time MVP is known to do from time to time.</p>

<p>Have a brain here the only good argument here would be the Green suspension.  Steph had not been the MVP when it comes to the finals Iggy got that one.</p>

<p>Curry was harrassed and probably not 100% since 
the injury.  </p>

<p>Crying about fixing the outcome takes away from the athletes.  I  got an idea buddy tweet at any of the Warriors and imply that they threw the game.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not very good at this. How the fuck do you come to that conclusion from what I wrote up there? Don&#39;t put words in my mouth.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care what it takes away from the athletes, the outcome was most definitely fixed. I don&#39;t have a horse in that race either so don&#39;t assume there is much crying over it, Im just stating facts here. If I ever see Steph Or Iggy (funny you should mention those two) in person I&#39;ll do more than imply it. I saw what they did. And I saw the masonic handshake between Lolbron and Curry before tip-off. As others have pointed out, its just entertainment. There is too much money coming and going from too many directions to remain so naive. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll prove this shit to you:</p>

<p>The conversation seemed to have gone something like this;</p>

<p>Golden State, you&#39;ll be returning to the Finals again to face Lebron, again. This time you&#39;ll lose the championship to him but in return we&#39;ll let you have the regular season record plus Durant. MJ hated this but was ok with it once he learned that GS wouldn&#39;t win the championship along with the wins record keeping the 96 Bulls as the &#39;best ever&#39; as a result.</p>

<p>The proof will be when you see Durant in a Warriors uniform next year. Mark my words.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree.</p>

<p>I think the league, throughout the regular season and playoffs, gave Draymond more &quot;benefit of the doubt&quot;s than anyone else.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the NBA wanted to suspend a marquee player in a big moment(that needed extending), but then they found themselves in a fortuitous situation later when they had an easy opportunity to punish him (when another series needed extending).</p>

<p>NBA= Draymond... Taking advantage of a situation even though hindsight and replays will show what their intents were.</p>

<p>Next you have Steph Curry throwing a woopdie doo behind the back pass to the court side seats in the end of the 4th quarter of game 7.
