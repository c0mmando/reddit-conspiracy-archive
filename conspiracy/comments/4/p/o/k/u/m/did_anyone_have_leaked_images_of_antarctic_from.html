       I looked a little bit in the Admiral Byrd story. Could you tell me how one would account for gravity on the interior? I did a rough calculation based on basic physics (centripital acceleration), and the acceleration on the inside surface is only a fraction of an earth gravity.

       If the inner earth is hollow and the shell has a symmetric radial density gradient (most probably true,) wherever you are on the inside, there is
       <strong>
        no (net) gravitational force

       I'm familiar with the shell theorem, but I guess I'm asking if hollow earth supposes gravity to be present on the inside "pushing outward", so to speak. I've seen stories where there's supposed to be an inner sea, but that wouldn't work if there's no net gravity inside.

       Is Concave Earth the one where Earth is like a dish and light bends in funny ways?

       Interesting.  Now, honestly the theory of gravity is that each point of mass attracts each other point of mass.  If this isn't true, then the Shell Theorem is just math.  To my best knowledge, scientists have not proven gravity at the small scale (or any scale) due to being unable to truly rule out electromagnetic influence.  And on the large scale, we just make the theory of gravity work since we see things supposedly orbiting around and then assign it a mass so the math works out.
      </p>
      <p>
       All interesting stuff to really understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Concave Earth, it's the most plausible out of all Copernican alternatives, based on my research and does hinge on a few things being true (one being bending light as you point out.)  I wouldn't call it "funny ways" though.  The light is claimed to be simply traveling along splines when not travelling perpendicular from the central point of the sphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's an illustration I made:

       I had only seen the theory in passing but just looked into it more right now. I love ideas like this because theoretically they're self consistent. Similar to historical explanations of the retrograde motion of the planets. Those theories do explain the motion just as well as our current theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a question. Do you know of any observations that might indicate the concave earth theory is superior to the convex model?

       Yes.  Flat Earth isn't a terrible place to start as I do believe they are not totally bonkers when they point out issues with convexity, but they still may be too attached to their theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, there is something to the horizon, and it's non-compliance to how it would appear on a convex surface.
      </p>
      <p>
       a) The distance to the horizon doesn't seem to always hold.  In some positions we can see much further than should be possible, even taking elevation difference into account.
       <br/>
       b) The horizon always remains at eye level no matter how far up one goes
      </p>
      <p>
       And given that all the footage we have of 'outer space' is fraudulent, and there is good evidence of this being true, especially since Mars, Moon and ISS footage is most definitely faked (although I can't say with 100% certainty) :
      </p>
      <p>
       c) the distances ascribed to stars and planets might just be simple math backed out from false interpretation of red shifts and luminosity.  In Concave Earth, stars, planets and the moon are much closer and much smaller, just as they are in Flat Earth.
       <br/>
       d) Sonoluminescence:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8UZ1-AqNcg">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8UZ1-AqNcg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       e) Reversing of star rotation in different 'hemispheres' is internally consistent within Concave Earth, just as it is in Convex Earth.  It is not in the theory of Flat Earth.  See Mostafa Abdelkader geometrical inversion thesis written in 1983 for more information.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a particular video of a GoPro attached to a rocket launch from, I believe Virginia, which is surprisingly in view of the moon at a certain altitude, when it should be over Australia.  The reason this is possible in Concave Earth is due to Bending Light.  If you examine the picture in my grandparent post, you should intuitively grasp that as one gains altitude, one's vision of the inner geometry expands exponentially.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've more if these pique your interest, just ask.

       If you've got more info, I'm game. I'm happy to learn about it from someone who knows more about the subject. You seem to have your concepts in good order, too. i.e. you're not bonkers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can I address some points?
      </p>
      <p>
       b) I've never been that high up with the proper equipment to confirm or deny this point, but according to the concave theory, is the apparent horizon we observe also due to the bending of light?
      </p>
      <p>
       c) I totally agree that the distance to stellar bodies is based on significant assumptions, yet people/scientists generally speak of it as established truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       d) I've read a decent amount on sonoluminescence. What does it have to do with this theory?

       Someone coincidentally just posted a thread on this discussion (kind of rare.)  I don't agree with everything he says, but it's another good source for information for someone who wants to know more.
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4q3rfu/flat_earth_is_a_zionist_psyop_to_discredit_the/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4q3rfu/flat_earth_is_a_zionist_psyop_to_discredit_the/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       b) Well I do believe amateur footage of rockets is real.  There are many examples of rockets being launched up to ~100 km (plenty available on YouTube) which is a partition of some sorts that needs to be investigated further.  But yes, the apparent horizon would emerge based on the bending of light.
       <strong>
        The "setting" sun doesn't go "beneath" the horizon; it's light failing to bend enough towards your line of sight, and colliding with the ground, or looping either close or far above your head, causing darkness
       </strong>
       See the image I posted above which should clarify this more.  Simply do your best to imagine yourself on some point of the inner surface, with that central light source rotating.
      </p>
      <p>
       c) Indeed.  I value math and science, but people need to understand the model (map) is not the machine.  Some useful predictions does not mean that the model is true.  This is extremely applicable to Quantum Dynamics.  They really mean Quantum Statistics.
      </p>
      <p>
       d) Interesting that you came across sonoluminescence before Concave Earth.  I only ran into because of my investigations surrounding Concave Earth.  Essentially, in the 'accepted' astronomical theory stars can have a diameters of hundreds of thousands of kilometers or more (Our sun is estimated by them to be 1.4 million kilometers diameters or something)  In Concave Earth, this just couldn't be the case due to geometrical constraints.  The diameter of these lights must be much smaller while still producing bright, intense light.  The phenomenon of sonoluminescence is producible in the lab and shown to be a brightly intense light, manifested using sound waves, through a not-well understood mechanism (although there a few leading theories.)  Whatever it is, it has
       <em>
        uncanny
       </em>
       similarities to the stars we see in the sky, hence the colloquial name of that video "Stars in a Jar".
      </p>
      <p>
       So basically, there might be a rotating central sphere which is filled with many of these sonoluminscent points, indicating that they are being created through some sound generator, (perhaps engineered by whomever created this Cell?.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a pet theory for the reason we see millions, nay, billions(!) of these stars when we focus on some patch in the sky.  The sonoluminscent points may be reflecting back and forth between the inner surface of this sphere (Optical physics mandates some transmission, some reflection and some absorption) causing an infinite multiplication of dimmer and dimmer stars, apparently very far away from us.

       As far as "his-tory" goes that's how it always been.  Innovators and novel thinkers and theories get flamed, at least at first.  Dissenters get witch hunted, hanged, cast away or shipped off to the loony bin.  Sad.

       Haven't read his story, but he was allegedly a Freemason and of course military which is kind of two strikes against him. Haven't formed an opinion on his claims yet. Not sure how gravity works either, and quite frankly I'm not convinced physicists really do either aside from their theories.

       Well it is true that due to centrifugal force, when you spin something, matter gets thrown to the edge of the axis of rotation. There was an experiment shown on YouTube where water droplets were injected with air bubbles, and when spun, the bubbles actually formed a sort of "core" in the spinning bubble. So I suppose it is conceivable that when the earth formed, the spinning created a hollow cavity to some extent. I'm not convinced about the magical "sun" that's supposed to exist in the center. That part sounds like insanity. Unless gases somehow collected and formed another sun inside which... I don't know. If that was true my mind would be blown to bits.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the second part, just look at Google trends. Too sharp a rise to be natural. I started noticing the flat earth tards everywhere there was conspiracy discussion, starting sometime around last year. Blatant attempt to make conspiracy theorists look like lunatics.

       I studied geology, and a lot of people believe Antarctica used to be in a tropical location and has loads of old earth artifacts. I've also heard it has an energy platform that gathers energy from the magnetosphere and is blocked.

       Norwegian scientists wanted to search for artifacts left by the Roald Amundsen expedition. They were stopped by the US, as their search would involve use of geo-radar. So someone is hiding something there, that's for sure.

       Read and study about Admiral Byrd and all of his expeditions down there for like 20 some years with insane amounts of resources and money from the US government.
      </p>
      <p>
       What strikes me as odd is the unilateral exodus from Antartica by all the countries that were down there after his last expedition. Immediately the Antarctic treaty is signed afterwards. You can't go down there, or even lobby to go down there if you're some super company who wants the resources.

      <p>
       Immediately following the exodus of Antarctica? Us and Russia begin firing nukes straight up into the air. Operation fish bowl for one.

       Because it is a world heritage site, there's a range of protocols and policies to protect the ecosystem. You see the lack of care that most corporates give to the environment in their own back yard, imagine what they would do far from prying eyes. The research stations down there take all their waste off the continent as a lot of things tend to be very well preserved, check out Capt Scott's Hut as an example.

       "Flat earth hypothesis" FTFY
      </p>
      <p>
       A theory has evidence and experimentation and is peer reviewed. All of which is completely absent with the flat earth hypothesis, or premise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Premise would actually be better because it would be a philosophical conversation rather than scientific. See, as far as science goes, flat earth is a pile of rubbish.

       You're in denial, what's so secret? Are you joking me. If we are truly living in the flat earth it destroys everything we are currently working for, space travel, believing in god, the whole thing. You have done no research at all and are against it, exactly what drives the force against the flat earth movement. Shills tell you it's a crazy theory and makes no sense and then you believe it and do their work for them.

       Why do you people always lie about this shit? You can't even see the curve at 120,000 feet. Look up weather balloon footage that doesn't use a fish eye lense. I don't know if it's flat or round because we don't have the defining proof, picture of our whole plane/planet.  I'm talking a real genuine full picture that isn't composite images. That's why I remain skeptical of both models. However since there is zero curve at the height I stated, how do scientists and most of the population believe boats go over the curve? I swear this sub doesn't even understand the elite sometimes. They don't tell us the truth about anything so why would they let you know what the shape of our world is lol. The flat model has its problems but so does the globe so don't come attacking me like I'm trying to push a certain model cause I'm not. We should all be in this together :)

       The earth is a massive orb. A GoPro isn't going to capture the whole thing, even if from the edge of space. I mean, fuck sakes give your head a shake man, there is slight curvature visible even in the video you posted. With or without fisheye I still see it. Flat-earthers obviously never took a shop class, they would say a bowed 2x4 is straight! LOL

       I mean I shouldn't have to shake my head to see a curve. I don't see a curve there maybe I just have bad eyes. Regardless tho all I was trying to say is that you have to be up extremely high too even think you see a curve, therefore boats are not going over the curvature so why do people say they are? And I'm not a flat earther sheesh, don't get so offended.

       Yea this place is big. The flat earth is far from perfect. But both models have their problems so why do people act like the globe is perfect?  People just refuse to think that they might not know where or what they're living on.  I don't mind it tho it's fun to entertain at the very least. Peace to you mate :)

       The footage from that video is insufficient evidence to make ANY claim about the curvature. Why are you guys arguing over this?
      </p>
      <p>
       All cameras are subject to some distortion due to the way they collect light; the same goes for our very eyes. Not even accounting for the fact that light bends due to refraction and other less explored phenomena, especially when flying high &amp; observing a scale as large as the 'horizon,' in which light may traverse hundreds of miles through an atmosphere of varying thermodynamic / electromagnetic properties.  This introduces all sorts of different issues with experimentation.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need a mechanical way to determine curvature such as a repeat of the Rectilineator experiment, or some other novel idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       If one really cares about this, figure out how to run an experiment to mechanically (not using optics) determine the curvature of earth and please post your results. Gathering a like-minded, conspiracy oriented team of intelligent people will probably be a start.

       Have you seen how flooded this sub gets with flat earth posts? I've been tired of it for a couple years and I've seen a lot of people blindly following that crap. High-priest-of-slack was notorious for his "flat earth primer" and endless videos of "science" that was made up, and ignored or horribly attempted to disprove common scientific theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       To answer your question, I call out flat earthers on their bullshit so either they'll stop and/or everyone else will see how dumb it is.

       Are you seeing the end?  Or perspective vanishing to a point, (since our eyes can only discern up to some resolution of light on the screen of the retina)?  Have you tried looking through magnification?  Does the horizon still end at 12.2 miles?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or perhaps natural atmospheric condition (air, moisture, pollution) creates the effect of the horizon?

       What do you mean by down? They fly away from the ground and horizontally towards their destination using computers to chart their path...

       The equator is thicker than the poles obviously. So to cut time on an airplane you would fly to avoid the path that would take the longest distance. On the contrary they fly into the equator from the southern hemisphere which on a globe earth would add travel time not reduce it.

       How is that proving your point, saying I am a shill is retarded because in no way shape or form does the government try to disprove itself. Especially something as set in stone as the globe earth. Plus I am not mentally impaired, I'm starting to think you are. Giving thought to an idea is a skill it seems not many people have. There is potential evidence against it, but I am not seeing it here. Although I will add those two questions that guy asked above took a bunch of research.

       Just like I said the earth is the shape of a V, so the southern hemisphere looks out at an angle, while the northern is at the bottom of the V just looks up. The southern hemisphere changes because the edge is spinning and we see over the edge.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll quote things from this article.
       <a href="http://www.adn.com/science/article/sunniest-day-year-look-why-alaska-has-most-daylight/2015/06/20/">
        http://www.adn.com/science/article/sunniest-day-year-look-why-alaska-has-most-daylight/2015/06/20/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The sun is a spotlight that spins around the inside of the V or U shape.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If you add up all of the daylight throughout the course of the year, every place in Alaska receives more daylight than every place in the Lower 48.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Alaska gets the most sunlight but it's at the edge because the sun moves upwards towards the top of the earth, while Alaska stays at the bottom. The edge of the light touches Alaska 24 hours a day when the sunlight moves down.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Longyearbyen currently has 24 hour sunlight. That means the earth is in view of the sun the entire day, and night. Which would also mean the opposite location on the globe would be in total darkness.

       The sun is a spotlight and shines upwards and downwards and spins around in a circle. The earth is like a top. Like the flat earth but there is a big weight on the north pole to create the shape. The equator is half way up on each side and the north pole is at the very bottom of the V at the base. At the top of the V who knows what's up there but I'm assuming infinite land. Once we're done playing this whole government game we can probably just fly away onto more land and maybe there are more holes in the world creating other worlds people live in. It's hard to describe. Picture the globe earth, cut the circle at the top, curve the bottom and have a sun that spins around the middle. The sun is a spotlight. When it's setting it's just leaving our view. continuing it's journey around the grand circle. It's a concept so it may be different slightly, but that's the theory that holds up the most in my eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I'll see if I can find a picture of two that represents my idea.

       People who argue for a Flat Earth aren't worth arguing with as they are cherry picking anti-intellectuals. If they did their homework they'd see the reality of the situation, but no amount of arguing on the internet will enlighten them.

       This is not research. This is pure conjecture not based on any scientific method. Whereas the math used by pilots to fly around the world only works because the world is a sphere. Knowledge in action, not armchair conjecture.

       You are so ignorant it makes me cringe. Air planes don't fly downwards. If you plot flight paths on a flat earth map they fly in direct straight lines to get to the destination. I have posted enough information today I am not posting anymore. Everyone can attempt to disprove it but there is still no logical counter argument.

       That's the whole point of being a conspiracy theorist, to entertain an idea even though it might not be truth. I recently finished "The Book of Enoch" and it doesn't state that the world is flat but it does say:
      </p>
      <p>
       "And this is the law and the course of the sun, and his return as often as he returns sixty times and rises, i.e. the great luminary which is named the sun, for ever and ever. And that which (thus) rises is the great luminary, and is so named according to its appearance, according as the Lord commanded. As he rises, so he sets and decreases not, and rests not, but runs day and night, and his light is sevenfold brighter than that of the moon; but as regards size they are both equal."

       I've entertained the idea, it just doesn't seem plausible. Until you start defying the laws of physics I'm going to have a super tough time taking you seriously espousing flat earth theory. It was disproved many moons ago at the threat of death via jesuit. Just because something is rarely entertained doesn't automatically make it legitimate and it certainly doesn't make it cognitive dissonance. The earth being flat or round makes two fucks to me, I just don't see the evidence for it being flat. There is ample evidence that is a round shape.

       No problem friend, pretty sad on how a conspiracy forum you get paraded with down votes for an idea that is pretty plausible. Not only that but people's counter argument is what the government has shown us, easily disprovable.

       Same here. I like hearing both sides and then making a choice for what I think. I'm not a scientist or explorer so I will never have first hand proof of any theory or fact other than what I'm told/read.
Interested to know if the world is flat is it a disc? If so , surely those living on the edge would tell everyone else by now.

       -The globe theory has holes, like us being able to look across massive bodies of water. They say it's gravity curving the rays, maybe. But I call bullshit.

       Why do you people always lie about this shit? You can't even see the curve at 120,000 feet. Look up weather balloon footage that doesn't use a fish eye lense. I don't know if it's flat or round because we don't have the defining proof, picture of our whole plane/planet.  I'm talking a real genuine full picture that isn't composite images. That's why I remain skeptical of both models. However since there is zero curve at the height I stated, how do scientists and most of the population believe boats go over the curve? I swear this sub doesn't even understand the elite sometimes. They don't tell us the truth about anything so why would they let you know what the shape of our world is lol. The flat model has its problems but so does the globe so don't come attacking me like I'm trying to push a certain model cause I'm not. We should all be in this together :)
