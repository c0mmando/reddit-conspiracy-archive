<p>There are over 30 hours available on youtube for free. There is going to be one more event held in Canada this year which will be much bigger than these two events. This is not about blurry images or out-of-focus films anymore. These are real insiders all of which have top secret clearance or higher.

    <div class="md"><p>So a group of ufo enthusiasts managed to verbally spam like 5 members of congress about ufos? Cool stuff. I think everything is worthy of investigation, it&#39;s part of the reason I hang out here. I genuinely believe there&#39;s alien life out there, but I don&#39;t think they&#39;ve visited earth yet. I&#39;m all for people exploring that on their own though.</p>

<p>What you linked is no where near the crackpot level of stuff OP was talking about. Ufos and potential alien intelligence are one thing, Freemason pyramid nazi occultism is a whole other branch of crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are not ufo enthusiasts at all. It&#39;s around 400 members of the american intelligence community coming out as whistleblowers. They all carry their dispatch papers proving they were in the position they say there were and they are all under oath.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually skimmed the video and it&#39;s pretty interesting. Though I didn&#39;t hear anything that explicitly proved alien intelligence, they did talk a lot about UFOs. Perhaps they&#39;re manmade and are just advanced secret technology or something?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of the whistleblowers claim they&#39;ve been in contact with ETs inside the military. What boggles me is that it isn&#39;t even touched upon by anyone and these are the same people that work on nuclear armaments, radar, stealth technology etc.</p>

<p>However, since this is more of a puzzle than a full picture, it&#39;s hard to pinpoint what is real and what is not. There was a documentary that was removed that was really good in portraying what happened during the citizen hearing(The maker of the movie died, unfortunately). Hopefully the press conference this year will open up more people to this subject. I&#39;m glad you had a look at the links!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you ever stopped and given any real thought to the UFO whistleblowers themselves?</p>

<p>Back in the 50s and 60s, UFO eyewitnesses were generally laymen. They were farmers, traveling salesmen, drunk yokels, and the occasional cop. Their credibility as witnesses was attacked because few, if any, of them had any relevant expertise and could legitimately mistake a flock of birds for an alien spacecraft. How could you believe that Cletus saw a spaceship when his blood was 10% moonshine? But this changed as more and more eyewitnesses with &#39;expert&#39; credentials came forward, followed by the whistleblowers. Who were these &#39;experts&#39; and what gave them credibility? </p>

<p>The simple truth is that most of the credible witnesses, and all of the whistleblowers, have ties to the military and/or intelligence community. An Air Force pilot is a credible witness because he has been trained to accurately identify supersonic fighter planes at a glance and is intimately familiar with the capabilities of modern aircraft. A retired General is an &#39;officer and a gentleman&#39;, so his word has weight with a lot of people. The President, of course, would never lie.</p>

<p>Consider the treatment of people like Assange, Manning, and Snowden. Now consider how many &#39;credible witnesses&#39; have come forward and been able to openly write books, hold seminars, and attend press conferences about UFOs for <em>decades</em> without repurcussions. How does that work? Actual contact with intelligent extra-terrestrial life has profound implications for all of humanity to begin with, but the possession of alien technology makes something like PRISM look laughably like a blunderbuss. How is <em>any</em> of the information leaked by Assange, Manning, and Snowden, comparable in importance to alien contact? How is it that the uniform-wearing UFO whistleblowers aren&#39;t holed up in foreign embassies or sitting pretty in prison? The Rosenbergs were executed and yet the UFO whistleblowers are left alone.</p>

<p>Far from lending credibility to the story, a military uniform is a red flag.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s two pieces of the puzzle for you to look into: Watch the documentary <em>Mirage Men</em> about Richard Doty&#39;s efforts at misinformation, and then read up about Project Have Doughnut, where a MiG was secretly taken to Groom Lake for testing in 1967/8 which resulted in the &#39;Top Gun&#39; school and an enduring piece of UFO lore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s been sightings by military personnel since way back. They were called &quot;Foo fighters&quot; in WW2. There are many whistleblowers, reaserchers and other who have been killed by talking about this.</p>

<p>I believe it&#39;s so compartmentalized that the people who attack Snowden and Assange have no idea about the ET phenomena. To attack any whistleblower when it comes to the ET phenomena would also validate their claim. Like with Gary Mckinnon if you&#39;re aware of him.</p>

<p>It is not only whistleblowers that makes me believe there&#39;s a coverup. There are reports from inside the military including radar reports from commercial and military radars including eye testimony of the incident. When it comes to project Blue Book they flat out lied about the data. We found out this because of the freedom of information act.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also inside jobs such as &quot;The Rockefeller Initiative&quot; where a few people inside the white house tried to inform the president about the phenomena and expose the truth. The people involved in this were Hillary Clinton, John Podesta and Lawrence Rockefeller to name a few. I know Hillary doesn&#39;t hold much value to the truth, but she was the first lady when this was happening.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t expect anyone to blindly follow my beliefs but I am very convinced there are a coverup of some sort. How deep it goes and what is being covered up I don&#39;t know for sure. I just wish some people would actually look at this subject and not ridicule it by default. It&#39;s not harmful to investigate what is put on the table.</p>

<p>UFOs <em>are</em> the cover-up. It is a Cold War misinformartion campaign used to obscure what the military was really up to. The military benefits from this profitable tale and it is military men who spread it <em>without repurcussions</em>. Military witnesses <em>cannot</em> be trusted. You&#39;re right, it&#39;s not harmful to investigate, so I say again: look into Project Have Doughnut and the activities of Richard Doty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had previously watched it but I watched it again. It is a very good documentary to show how polluted this subject really is. I had a look at your previous comment and just want to clarify for my own sake. What you meant was that the military whistleblowers carry no significant validity <em>because</em> they&#39;re just that - military whistleblowers. Even if they were to be taken upon investigation, they would never fall in the pile of 100% certainty because we could never know if they&#39;re a false agent or not. Have I understood that correctly? </p>

<p>If it is then yes, this is very true and this is something everyone has to take in consideration. I, too, have questioned the whistleblowers tied to the Disclosure project but I cannot let such a movement pass. Yes, some might be disinformation agents. There&#39;s even a chance every single one is. However, there are significant evidence across the globe regarding UFOs, enough so that I would be positive to have governments around the world engage in a formal investigation. This alone makes me a &quot;believing&quot; and the american group of whistleblowers is the closest thing to pressing for the truth.</p>

<p>Regarding the harassment such as Assange, Manning, and Snowden received I believe this could fall both ways. If these whistleblowers are false disinformation agents and the intelligence community wants these people to be taken seriously in this field - why are they not deliberately being harassed to increase the validity? If there are suggestions as to if these people are fed disinformation to (not deliberately) misinform the people then I would say it&#39;s not a very good job. If anything, I would say Assange, Manning, and Snowden are false flags. I don&#39;t believe they believe they are but I believe there&#39;s a greater chance the ongoing drama regarding them are a false flags to get people looking their way rather than the countless other whistleblowers across the globe.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t necessarily believe the information being portrayed is the important part. Rather that there are an extreme amount of effort behind the scenes being made to keep <em>something</em> secret. This secret could only have <em>one</em> reason to be kept secret which is for the sake of national security. However, I am not an advocate of such politics so I would still be engaged in the movement to stop the truth embargo on the people. I have to say the people behind the scenes are making it incredibly difficult to people who wants to be an advocate of this. The general sense of people is that they&#39;re not trusting the government in too much, but talking about UFOs is stretching it too far. Today I would say most conspiracies land in the &quot;Government spies on me&quot; pile and that this is a great distraction. It&#39;s another way to keep people busy, there are people who have ambition for conspiracy just like there are people who enjoy painting. These people also need a field where they can express themselves creatively and this is where these people end up - &quot;The Government spies on me&quot; pile.</p>

<p>I am sorry this went on being a long rant about my opinions but I have to say I am quite excited to have a discussion with someone regarding this. I am ready to switch my views in any direction if there is enough evidence for me to be convinced. You absolutely convinced me that anyone associated with the military should be treated as a associate rather than a knight in shining armor. </p>

<p>However,</p>

<p>This I cannot agree with. There have been numerous accounts by citizen across the globe who is credible enough that the sheer number of reports weigh enough to spark a investigation. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/3phkgq/zimbabwe_school_ufo_incident_1994/">The Zimbabwe School Ufo Incident</a> stands alone with weight enough to conduct some sort of investigation. The consensus that the usual white trash is the seed to all UFO stories are, to me, false information and propaganda.</p>

<p>If you made it all the way down I am incredibly grateful and thank you! It is a rare occurrence to me that someone actually <em>want</em> to have a discussion regarding this subject. I am sorry if my grammar is not on point, english is not my first language and I still struggle with some of the grammar. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you missed my point about Assange, Manning, and Snowden, which is that their actions had consequences. </p>

<p>Contact with intelligent alien life is not just important from a philosophical point of view, it is also an immense strategic advantage to the contactee. The atomic bomb is insignificant in comparison with access to the kind of technologies that a species capable of interstellar travel would have. Whether via crash or treaty, if the US, or any other, government has access to extra-terrestrial technology it is the biggest military secret there is.</p>

<p>Assange, Manning, and Snowden leaked government information and now one is in prison, one is holed up in an embassy, and the other is hiding in Russia, all of which are better fates than Julius and Ethel Rosenberg who were executed for leaking information about the atomic bomb to the Soviets. How many military whistleblowers have been executed for releasing state secrets about UFOs? How many UFO whistleblowers, of any kind, have been prosecuted for releasing Top Secret documents and republishing them in books freely available at any library and promoted at bookstores? How many are in prison, in hiding, or on the run? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely understand this way of thinking and belief. However, lets say there plenty of these whistleblowers prosecuted or executed. How would the world react? We can see from the people you mentioned that the world now believe these people to some extent. They&#39;re indulging themselves in this information as truth and if that were to happen to something like the ET phenomena, obviously the people would demand something more than &quot;stop spying on us&quot;.</p>

<p>I believe it is deliberate. That Assange, Snowden and Manning are getting the attention they are getting, both from the intelligence community and the media. That the ET/UFO whistleblowers get no attention, no attention from the intelligence community nor the media. This is because the intelligence community that gives Assange, Snowden and Manning attention are not aware of the Unacknowledged Special Access Projects that&#39;s going on far above NSA. The media is not giving them attention because of ridicule and the sheer volume of implications.</p>

<p>I know how you look at this, I know I am a total nutter and am wearing a tin foil hat right now but lets say the UFO phenomena is real. Let&#39;s say the world is looking like I describe it. If you were the global elite and would be able to choose to have people believe the absolute pinnacle of black projects and intelligence agencies would be that they&#39;re spying on their people, creating wars across the globe, hoarding oil for power and money or that there is a ET/UFO phenomena going on, that the phoenix lights were real, that there are retrieved technology somehow and you have no interest in sharing this with the world, your allies or your enemies. What would you choose?</p>

<p>Obviously this does not by any means validate my theory. But it gives a explanation as to why there is no attention to this field, whistleblowers or researchers.</p>

<p>I believe this is a &quot;This and that&quot; world scenario. Where we belong in &quot;This&quot; world where our major issues is politics, energy consumption, economical collapses, war, famine and starvation. Where the global elite is creating &quot;That&quot; world which have technological advancement we cannot imagine, that there is a whole world of black projects which have created inventions far beyond our dreams and it is being kept from us intentionally. We are required to do what we do in order for that other world to exist and that is why we&#39;re being kept in the dark. The things we see as documents, whistleblowers, projects and other secrets are droplets of what&#39;s really going on behind the scene. </p>

<p>If you would want more &quot;evidence&quot; on this topic then Richard Dolan is a excellent researcher who talks about this &quot;Breakaway civilization&quot;. In fact, he is also a great advocate for the whole ET issues and if you want to spend a short amount of time researching more about this, I would recommend him.</p>

<p>I admit to my defeat that I do not believe any of this will have any weight or impact on you but I&#39;d like to leave with two quotes from a 2nd direction of Lockheed Skunkworks. Nevertheless, I enjoyed reading your comments and having a discussion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We now know how to travel to the stars. There is an error in the equations, and we have figured it out, and now know how to travel to the stars and it won’t take a lifetime to do it. It is time to end all the secrecy on this, as it no longer poses a national security threat, and make the technology available for use in the private sector. There are many in the intelligence community who would like to see this stay in the black and not see the light of day. We now have the technology to take ET home.</p>
