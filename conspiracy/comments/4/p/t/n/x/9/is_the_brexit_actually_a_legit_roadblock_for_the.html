       It's amazing how many people fail to see that Britain is still 2 to 3 years away from actually being out of the EU and that along the way something could "go wrong" and force them to stay.

       "Two-thirds of Greek voters backed parties opposed to the EU/IMF deal, renewing fears that Athens may default on its debts and leave the eurozone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Germany's Angela Merkel has made clear that Greece's reforms must go on...."

       "Greece's parliament has approved a controversial overhaul of taxes and pensions despite mass rallies against the measures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Police said almost 18,000 people turned up in Athens and about 8,000 in Thessaloniki on Sunday against the changes demanded by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund that the government approved in the lead-up to a crucial meeting of eurozone creditors in Brussels."
      </p>
      <p>
       So the Greek vote was ignored and the people were rightfully furious.

       I actually thought they wouldn't allow it...But they did. So these 3 scenarios pop in my head:
      </p>
      <p>
       1.Even criminals need somewhere to keep their wealth. They need a safe haven. So naturally, London would not be included into the European Brussels super state emerging as it is risky now.
      </p>
      <p>
       2.They wanted to create a planned chaos seemingly arising from the peoples'  democratic decision in the UK(and not caused by bankers and elites)The chaos would result in banking failures fleecing the people. The leaders of Western nations would give the green light to bailout bankers and as a result they would walk away laughing.
      </p>
      <p>
       3.Brexit does not have any legal ground it will really make no difference cause Britain will not close borders or cease trade deal. Brexit was a media stunt. Nothing more.

       Not only did they allow it, it was their idea in the first place...

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        While attending the May 2012 NATO summit meeting, British Prime Minister David Cameron, William Hague and Ed Llewellyn discussed the idea of using a European Union referendum as a concession to energize the Euroskeptic wing of the Conservative Party.[19] In January 2013, Cameron promised that, should his Conservative Party win a parliamentary majority at the 2015 general election, the UK Government would negotiate more favourable arrangements for continuing British membership of the EU, before holding a referendum as to whether the UK should remain in or leave the EU.[20] In May 2013, the Conservative Party published a draft EU Referendum Bill and outlined their plans for renegotiation and then an In-Out vote if returned to office in 2015.[21] The draft Bill stated that the referendum must be held no later than 31 December 2017.

       The simple fact is, those "onerous regulations" that Brussels apparently forced down the throats of the British? They were only "onerous" to the corporate elites that do not like being regulated. They don't like laws designed to protect the health and safety of the public. They don't like laws designed to protect the environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       They want "free trade", not "free people", and the EU made every European freer than they ever were before, despite the corporate propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       The corporate elites want poor people trapped in poor countries so that rich people from rich countries can exploit them for profit. But when the workforce is free to move to where wages and conditions are better, the corporations can't outsource their production to places where the people have no choice but to accept low wages and poor conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The EU was the very
       <strong>
        opposite
       </strong>
       of what the "NWO" wanted - it regulated trade, and freed people.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       decided to hold a referendum.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's too bad that gullible fools have once again been tricked into voting against their own best interests, but that is in fact what happened.

       I'm sure they had scenarios gamed out no matter which way the vote went. That being said....
      </p>
      <p>
       a/ Cameron, one of their pig-fucking favorites has to take the fall. That's no fun, but maybe his time was up.
      </p>
      <p>
       b/ It's certainly possible we're seeing warfare here between different segments of the NWO. Not sure the Queen and Royal Family like the way they see things trending vs. the Zionist types. Do you see the Royals hanging on in the face of slow Islamic invasion? I don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       c/ Strange, though, to read the Murdoch papers pushing for Brexit and the Royal Family allegedly feeling the same. Those two not on the same page very often.
      </p>
      <p>
       d/ The vote could bring additional chaos to the playing field -- English vs. Scottish vs. Irish. Old vs. Young. Tech vs. Industrial. Batman vs. Superman -- whoops, wrong thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       e/ There's always the possibility, too, the "White Hats" have turned the tide. As another post on this subreddit noted last week, there are saboteurs of the NWO riddled throughout the system. They may be pushing for a breakdown of the world economy on their terms, not the NWO.  One of the alternative financial sites says that the markets are going to crash by design one way or the other -- if it happens in August or September, it's via the good guys; if it happens in October or November, it's the bad guys. Take that for however it's worth.
      </p>
      <p>
       f/ Who fucking knows? These are crazy times.

       I think it's not what the NWO wanted because EU is part of the NWO.  But there was too much of a groundswell to suppress via normal means of rigging votes.  They'll no doubt find a way to benefit from it anyway, and punish the 99% by trashing the economy even more, and causing even more suffering, for daring to oppose them.

       I can't say for sure.  Probably to give the illusion that the people have a say in such matters.  It worked for them with the Scotland vote.  But they underestimated the opposition to the EU.

       Why? There was no reason to even suggest that the people have a say. So why give it to them? The British people were not rioting in the streets demanding the UK leave the EU. Most people never even gave a shit until after the referendum was called and the campaigns started.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why take the risk of an adverse outcome, if they didn't need to do it?
      </p>
      <p>
       No, they wanted that vote for a reason, and it wasn't to give people a say. They wanted that vote because they wanted to be able to blame the people for the consequences of leaving the EU.

       What the "NWO" (the corporate elites) want is a world where they can exploit the poor for their own profit. The last thing they want is a world where the poor can simply move to areas where wages are higher and conditions better.
      </p>
      <p>
       They want "free trade" not "free people".
      </p>
      <p>
       The EU gave Europeans the power to move to where
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       got the most benefit. No longer were they trapped working under horrible conditions for low wages - they could simply move to where the offer was better.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "NWO" (corporate elites) also want a world where they do not have to worry about the costs of their profit making ventures. They do not want to be regulated into spending money to protect the environment, because they don't live where
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       poison the air and water. They would rather keep that money and let the "little people" suffer the consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
       The regulations imposed by the EU prevented that form of "filthy capitalism" and that alone meant it had to go. The EU kept the power over corporations that the "NWO" (corporate elites) are trying to take away from governments with their "free trade" agreements like the TTIP.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the UK to leave the EU but sign on to the TTIP would be the complete
       <strong>
        opposite
       </strong>
       of regaining its independence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people of the UK have been hoodwinked. They have voted to cut their own throats. What surprises me is how many people on this sub have also fallen for it.

       I think there is no such thing as an "NWO". It's the same old "World Order" doing the same old shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Elites will work together if there is a profit in it and they will oppose each other if there is a profit in it. There is no overarching goal they all work towards other than self enrichment.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the EU was good for them, the UK's elites wanted in. Now they see it as bad for them, so they want out. It's always about what gives them the most power and wealth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The EU as an economic bloc was good for them. The EU as a regulatory bloc is bad for them. They do not like being told how to do business. They do not care about human rights or environmental concerns. They see those things as costs that are to be minimised.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the EU is going to open new markets for them to exploit, they're in... but if the EU is going to prevent them from exploiting those markets to the degree they want... they're out.
      </p>
