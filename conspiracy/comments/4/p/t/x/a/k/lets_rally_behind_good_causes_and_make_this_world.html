        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Recently Ive been thinking about how much doom and gloom I take in on a daily basis between television, internet and conversations. Even here on r/conspiracy we perpetuate a lot of the hatred, anger and fear that are gripping the world today.</p>

<p>I just saw a thread posted on r/plants about teaching students how to grow their own food and it made me think about what kind of impact ive had on the world. I spend so much time reading about conpiracies and atrocities but do little towards making this world a better place. So I just donated what I could to that cause.</p>

<p>I know theres an active citizenry embedded amongst the shills here. We are above 350,000 strong! Lets inspire each other to support good causes and help make this world a more aware and better place!</p>

<p>Heres the link to the cause I donated to: <a href="https://www.generosity.com/fundraising/help-schools-in-costa-rica-grow-food-and-medicine">https://www.generosity.com/fundraising/help-schools-in-costa-rica-grow-food-and-medicine</a></p>

<p>What causes and missions would you like to see us support?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. I believe in kindness among those around us. In my city there are hundreds  thousands of needy people. I rather stop by a homeless person and buy them sandwich and talk with them. I can say I fed a needy person today. There is something that disturbs me about sending my money to the black holes of the  internet. Costa Rica, you say? God knows that money will line  the pockets of corrupt NGOs overthrowing the very people we hope to help. 
My advice is do good in your own neighborhood. Money gone in the black hole of internet funds dark projects not good. that is wisdom of being tin foil hatter knowing sustainable projects are cover for agritech corporate takeover..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aquaponics is really cool. Growing tilapia fish and using the emulsion to feed vegetables. The sustainable nature of it keeps produce local and organic. I would also like to see the public at large educated for free in areas of nutrition. Poor health is directly related to nutritional value of a persons diet. Then last let me say this, kill your TV. Do It! Destroy that idiot box! Read more, learn hands on and practice meditation. Kill your tv. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Each of us must uniquely:</p>

<p>1)<strong>secede</strong> participation from that which is contradictory</p>

<p>2)use the system to <strong>nullify</strong> contradictions (work from within and without)</p>

<p>3)create businesses and non-profits that make contradictions obsolete - <strong>SUPERSEDE</strong> the Status Quo in your life and among communities</p>

<p>4)Use Open Source <strong>Emulation</strong> techniques to propagate such methods</p>

<p>People assume that the volition of innovative individuals to create nonprofits and businesses couldnt actually solve socio-economic issues, without realizing that these public calls for government intervention perpetuates issues to the benefit of the largest government/corporate institutions. What incentive do governments have to actually solve issues when such problems perpetuate this perceived need for intervention? In the near future (if collapse doesn&#39;t happen first) businesses and nonprofits will use amazing new technologies to solve socio-economic issues, effectively making obsolete The Establishment obsolete. I believe that younger generations will not economically support businesses unless they actively 1)limit their socio-economic and environmental externalities  &amp; 2) have a social/mutual - benefit component of their business. It&#39;s going to be up to each of us to uniquely engage businesses and nonprofits to Supersede the Status-Quo.  The ability of individuals to voluntarily cooperate in the promotion of new organizations that make these old-world, contradictory Establishments obsolete will be the future. The Agora can overcome.</p>

<p>Edit: check out Open Source Ecology also
Edit2: just saw their aquaponics designs and they look great too - check it out! <a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/141252002">https://player.vimeo.com/video/141252002</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Want to really disrupt the consumer food market? Invent a robot garden kit. Imagine if a person could take small plot of land, say 6ft by 6ft and a green-thumb robot would set about to do all the work until harvest time. Not an easy thing to do, no doubt, but if self-driving cars are getting close, then this kind of application can&#39;t be that far behind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a really great idea and something I hope occurs in the future. We shouldn&#39;t abandon the tradition of traditional gardening and rediscovered forest gardening and other stuff; but imagine if you could get a solar powered robot that&#39;s applied to a tract of dirt, makes its own calculations with an analysis of samples, and gets you food...</p>

<p>I imagine it might be a major suppressed invention. Also, mining and stuff would still be necessary for many robot components. Stay optimistic though! Note that mainstream media crap is so often negative and <em>discouraging</em>, so you must<sup><sup>sorta</sup></sup> disobey that!</p>
