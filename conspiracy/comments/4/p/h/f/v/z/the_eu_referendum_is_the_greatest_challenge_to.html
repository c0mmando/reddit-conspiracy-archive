       There is a huge amount at stake. If the majority of fairly cast ballots vote for Britain to Leave the EU (and are also fairly counted) it will be a mortal wound to the European Union - other countries will clamour for their own referendums, and the whole edifice will disintegrate over the next decade or so. The globalists simply aren't going to let his happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are numerous ways in which David Cameron (and a large part of the British political establishment) has been doing the bidding of the globalists to secure a Remain announcement on 24 June 2016.
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <strong>
        British government circled the wagons
       </strong>
       to ensure the mainstream debate would be between different factions of the Conservative Party, and excluded Nigel Farage and UKIP. Even though Boris Johnson and Michael Gove have been giving very convincing performances as Brexit cheerleaders, they are still true blue Tories, and therefore if not controlled, then "controllable" opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The government spent a lot of public money on pushing the Remain Campaign
       </strong>
       printing Remain leaflets, but they also used the civil service until a few weeks ago to help push the Remain agenda. Many people suspect that British Security Service (MI5) or its subcontractors are still working towards this outcome.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people of
       <strong>
        Gibraltar are allowed vote in the referendum
       </strong>
       , and they should not be, because Gibraltar is not part of the UK, and their interests are quite different from those of people in the UK. Because of their proximity to Spain, the overwhelming majority of Gibraltarians favour Remaining in the EU. Obviously, the population of Gibraltar is tiny (32,000) but if the Leave vote is thwarted by a very narrow margin, then this could negatively affect the way many Brits feel about Gibraltar. The government will not hesitate to use Gibraltar as a scapegoat.
      </p>
      <p>
       As has previously been reported, there was a suspiciously large number of
       <strong>
        last minute online voter registrations (about 2 million in the final week)
       </strong>
       . The government even passed emergency ad hoc legislation to get the registration period extended. This was completely unconstitutional but also, ironically, anti-democratic. Plebiscites are processes by which the public expresses their views, but the "process" part is just as critical as the "vote" part. You can't set the rules, and then change the goalposts with emergency legislation because some of your demographic were too disorganized to register in time! There could yet be a court challenge to this action by the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       These last minute registrations - are they all genuine, or are some made up people? Or might they real people, who have been registered for the vote - without their knowledge? Are their votes going to be cast for them (either by proxy or by postal ballot) - without their knowledge?
       <strong>
        Postal votes are probably the biggest risk factor to the integrity of the UK paper ballot voting system
       </strong>
       , and if a significant amount of these last minute vote registrations are for postal ballots, that will be a huge red flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       As has been discussed elsewhere,
       <strong>
        the absence of exit polls
       </strong>
       is another red flag that a rigged result is on the cards. Exit polls are normally very accurate, and they would have imposed restrictions on how far the vote could be rigged without drawing suspicion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whilst he print media have been split between Leave and Remain (The Telegraph, Daily Mail, Express, Spectator are pro Brexit, and the Guardian, Independent, Times, Mirror are against), the
       <strong>
        television media has been uniformly biased against Brexit
       </strong>
       . The BBC has been trashing whatever credibility it had left by pushing Remain.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is likely that a result will be announced around 7am GMT on Friday 24 June. Whether the announcement reflects how the people of the UK actually voted is perhaps something that we will never know, but there have been enough red flags to ensure that a Remain announcement will be greeted with considerable suspicion.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Please use this thread to add any further issues which have struck you as dubious about the run up to the UK's EU referendum, and of course, anything that strikes as "off" after polls close.

       OK, so polls have closed, and the result will be in within the next 5-7 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently Nigel Farage has already "conceded defeat" which is a pretty odd thing to do, particularly after going awol yesterday and missing the final debate. He doesn't know the result, so why would say this? Has he been threatened, bribed to "pre-corroborate" the fixed "Remain" announcement tomorrow morning, to make it seem more plausible? Predictive programming and all that. God knows.

       Anyway, this post will be stickied (with the required mod approval) for 24 hours.

       Update 12pm GMT. The Betfair exchange odds have seen a major swing towards Leave (down from 17 to 4) following rumours of a very good Leave result from the Sunderland count (the first one due to announce its results)
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       There should be plenty of drama during the next few hours, but unless the Leave % nationally is overwhelming, I expect that Remain will somehow "find the votes" in the major metropolitan areas which are due to report last.
      </p>
      <p>
       Update 2am: The North East of England is barnstorming to Brexit, and the odds have swung massively towards the UK leaving the EU at this point. However, the large metropolitan areas which report results towards the end of the process, and in particular London, are likely to be heavily pro-Remain, and this is when large numbers of postal ballots can be used to swing the overall total back to Remain. I think the Brexit celebrations are still premature, unfortunately. Still, here's hoping.

       You reek of agenda pushing yourself. All of a sudden everyone is talking about Brexit because of the massive economic and geopolitical implications of the referendum's outcome. Feel free to educate yourself or ignore it. But to claim it's not newsworthy is far more suspect than the coverage Brexit is getting.

       Satan is a myth you use to externalize your own impulses. To prevent yourself from accepting truths outside of a worldview others are using you to profit from. Good luck with that.

       You know what's really sad? A "one world government" wouldn't be such a bad thing if it weren't run by these rich elitist bastards. If instead it were built on a foundation of sound Enlightenment principles and gave every member state wide autonomy -- the world could be a much better place. But we don't even have that in the USA, where it is constantly espoused. It's all a lie.

       But trying to commit genocide against the white race was not a good way to produce "interconnectedness of people" and that is why Britain split from the EU. The people of any nation need to control their own borders, or there is no nation. That's the fatal flaw with the EU. European nations have no control over their own borders. And those who control the bureaucrats who run the EU decided to use this weakness to destroy Europe with black and Muslim immigration. Instead, it is going to destroy the EU, and good riddance.

       Yep, a ground-up global community is hopefully in our future, as a natural, organic inevitability of the species. A top-down world-government concocted by the investment class to create favorable trade scenarios &amp; moving cheap labor around the world at their behest for the sake of shareholder value, will be a disaster for this species.

       One government for the entire world is dangerous notion and incredibly susceptible to corruption and that corruption would damage every single person in the world's well being. I would much rather have a competition of ideas and governments that are all free and all hopefully enlightened.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happens when all that power is concentrated in so few peoples hands? Eventually (and rather quickly) it gets corrupted by money and political power. Its hard to brush that off in any scenario. Where there is power and money, our nature has shown that people will eventually bend the rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why having multiple sovereign governments all hopefully enlightened and well meaning is a better way to go imo. We get a diversity of ideas and policies.  We don't all have to be governed in the same way as every other person and we can see what works best.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now we have a bunch of theoretically independent countries but anytime they try to be truly independent they get singled out for regime change or war.
      </p>
      <p>
       One government for the entire world seems like a terrible terrible idea to me and I hope like heck it never happens.

       I think we agree more than you realize. I made a point of "wide autonomy" for member states. The problem today is that we have states that can't agree to disagree. So today's world is more like what you fear. I am right there with you in thinking the competition of ideas and governments is the way to go. That should be the general framework of a word-wide government.

       I don't know...perhaps in the distant future, but if you ask me history has shown that such things are beyond our reach for now. Humanity is still far too tribalistic and swayed by things like greed and power. Constant negotiations in trade, border disputes, land rights, etc, between sovereign nations with hopefully well-informed populations are our best hope for now.

       Exactly and that is what I disliked about the normal people I saw who were remainers who were absolutely hateful towards leavers and thought that they were stupid. But it's not true, with all the issues we currently have Humanity isn't ready for it and ontop of that the UK wasn't fixable whilst in the EU, so I don't understand how that simple point is missed or is considered stupid

       I think it's that tribalism actually is the answer to successful life. Like other forms of government, there are good and bads, but not all tribes were violent. Self-sufficiency is the only way to survive for long periods (1000's of years) of time, only God can touch you or your people at that point.

       Well it's final Great Britain chose to leave and PM David Cameron has resigned as Prime Minister. Thus ended the conspiracy of the elite trying to maintain control. This is what happens when the voters come out in full force and make it known what they want. Britains braved even shitty flooding rains and thunderstorms, and spoke their mind. Well done Brits showing the power of getting off the ass and voting! Now if we could get Americans to do the same on getting a third party in.....

       MARK MY WORDS: the forthcoming Second Great Depression will be blamed on President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Nigel Farage. “If it hadn’t been for this evil nationalism nonsense, the global economy wouldn’t have collapsed! We need to invade the United States, destroy the Constitution, and institute a global currency so that this can never happen again!”
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump, months ago, called them out. He knows that they’re duct taping the economy together so that Obongo's “legacy” “isn’t” tarnished.

       Prime minister Nigel Farage? Where are you getting that? The prime ministry isn't changing hands because we are leaving, at least not at the moment gotta wait till like 2020 and if you had foresight this is a great opportunity for the people to create a whole new party to sweep the current shitty ones away.

       Of course they'd be bullshit, it was a desperate attempt to convince people to give up and not vote or vote remain. It's absurd the amoutn of people I've seen trusting all media from this, like don't it's impossible to do currently

       I don't think so personally. The Uk has been lucky to avoid the sort of rioting that places like France have had to deal with recently. I honestly think that just saying no on this would cause a meltdown.

       Labour is tory 2.0, The Tory party has been split by brexit, Nigel farage has done what he said his career wanted to do so if he continues it shows hes dishonest and can be removed and the liberal democrats proved they were hypocrites by joining with a party that was the complete opposite to them. I personally have an idea in mind of a party and a reform of government but i'm still working out the kinks.

       Speaking of Nigel Farage, what the fuck happened to that guy? His whole career has been building up to the point of a referendum, literally the most important night of his political career, and he excuses himself from the debate because of 'family issues' and then declares a loss at 10pm, when the vote hasn't even been counted yet. He bottled it at such a key moment and no one seems to have noticed, it's just weird.

       Oh yeah, I mean hes always called a racist though I have never seen any proof of him being racist. But that always blackened UKIP i'd say if he really wanted this and has taken all the claims over the years he can take this one for the team. Though tbh with you this has really shown the true colours of people, like I know some of the people that I used to grow up with that are financially well off like middleclass wanting to riot in working class innocent areas because the vote didn't go their way, so right now I'm showing no respect to people like that

       I am incredibly disappointed by everyone's reactions. I hate that a leave vote has somehow turned into 'i hate everyone who is not white, deport them all!'. Voting leave doesn't mean you're an uneducated bigot. This vote really has brought to the surface just how divided we are as a country, the ugly truth about what the rich think of the working class has been truly laid bare.

       Regressive left my friend regressive left the youth have become brainwashed into this whole feminist privilege bullshit and its seen now that it is progressive and those that ain't are just as bad as the Nazi's and shit. People are genuinely saying the economy is fucked up beyond all repair now too but it'll go back up I'd rather sacrifice a few years of my life in a recession then a lifetime in such a corrupted system.

       Was anybody else who is is conspiracy minded at least slightly encouraged by the fact that democracy is still alive and well in the UK?  I don't think it's a great outcome, but I do think it is the will of the people.  I have a feeling that the American establishment wouldn't have "allowed" for a true result.  Just my thoughts.

       Great Britain was never bound to the EU like Greece , they use the Pound and they're not in Schengen zone , which means they already had control over their borders and economy , the current crisis will continue, the only difference is that they will now be outside of EU , politically ... but will continue doing the same things. (diversity and multiculturalism)
      </p>
      <p>
       Change will happen in around 2 years or next elections...and that is, if they get a huge "British" majority in their parlament , that will do "British" stuff , unless they cuck themselves and elect a Muslim PM .

       I know we're supposed to be adult about this decision, but I just wanted to say, "Na-na-na-na-naaaaah!" Bad guys lost, good guys won. The English get to control their own borders once again, and make their own laws. It's a wonderful day.

       Another red flag that several posters have mentioned is the fact the betting odds don't reflect the opinion polls at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Firstly, I would add the official opinion polls all conveniently put the result "in the balance" but if you go to any poll by a media outlet, the overwhelming majority says LEAVE. The Daily Telegraph is 72% Leave, with about 600,000 respondents. The Remain camp is "a little bit Hillary" in that it gets a lot of favourable MSM coverage, but in terms of real people, they are thin on the ground.)
      </p>
      <p>
       But back to the betting odds. Betfair currently has Remain on 1.16 (decimal odds) which equates to an implied probability of 85%.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.betfair.com/exchange/politics/marketactivity?id=1.118739911&amp;amp;selectionId=9481397">
        https://www.betfair.com/exchange/politics/marketactivity?id=1.118739911&amp;amp;selectionId=9481397
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are in the US and some other countries you may not be able to access the above link, but Betfair is a large UK betting exchange, and it shows that £60 million ($100 million) has been wagered on this vote, with most of the "big money" on Remain. What do these people know, that makes them so confident, when the polls don't support their position?

       I'd like to point out too that there are people actually wanting a redo of the referendum because it had a 72% turn out

        https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/131215
       </a>
       despite the fact that it was probably because people didn't want to vote so a redo would change nothing in that turn out. So from what I can gather its just a bunch of whinging remainers not getting the vote they wanted

       The ECHR (Strasbourg) is a Council of Europe institution, and the UK will still be a signatory. A Brexit would allow the UK to sever its shackles to the European Court (Luxembourg), but this will be a long slow process. I'm not as pessimistic about this as you - I don't think our Parliament should be subservient to any foreign institution.

       "True blue Tories" that does not mean that they are controlled. The conservatives really are split over whether they hate the EU or love it (well stand it for the majority of conservatives)
      </p>
      <p>
       The referendum didn't have to happen, if the "NWO" want Britain to remain in the eu why are so many conservatives for brexit? They surely can't be controlled opposition as one of the biggest reasons for a referendum was tory division

       The two main figures in the Referendum debate are the same age, went to the same school (Eton), the same University (Oxford), were members of the same elite club (Bullingdon) and ended up as the two most important figures in the Conservative Party. But yeah, there's no stitch up. Farage is an outsider and he was deliberately kept that way.

       They were two years apart in school. University I don't believe they ever actually knew each other well (Cameron being quiet whereas Johnson went into student politics). Cameron then went into the conservative party but Johnson became a journalist in the EU, mainly complaining about over regulation.

       So yes it isn't a a "stich up"

       Farage is a firm believer in neo liberal economics. The eu has too many regulations for him

       If they're both members of Bullingdon, that's all you need to know about the fix being in. Here's a watered-down mainstream media explanation of Bullingdon and pig-fucking. Makes "Black Mirror" look all the more interesting, right?

       It's not politics. It's the quest for a one-world globalist government, as chronicled by Dr. Carroll Quigley in "Tragedy &amp; Hope." Sometimes the politics differ, but the ultimate goal does not.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're genuinely interested in doing something to push back against the elitism that has infected the world's leadership, I suggest you look into Dr. Quigley's work. Perhaps starting with Joseph Plummer's concise "Tragedy &amp; Hope 101" would be a good place to start.

       Boris clearly is neo liberal, now what does that mean? It means he will want to roll back the barriers of the state. Also globalisation is pretty much a certainty, has been since 1900 ish arguably, isn't necessarily a bad thing imo

       The 'emergency ad hoc legislation to get the registration period extended' was due to the website crashing on the original last registration date, and thousands of voters could not get registered in time. It was then decided to extend the deadline date.  Nothing sinister here.

       Yes, we all know the official excuse. How many people were actually prevented from registering during this website crash? What evidence do you have, and what is your source? How do you know the website even crashed at all, and if it did, how do you know it wasn't done so deliberately by the Remain camp?

       The bottom line is that moving the goalposts during the referendum process was unjustified, and constitutes the sort of election malpractice we might expect from a country like Zimbabwe.

       Seriously though, there's only so much manipulation, I mean, if HRC had a solid fix from the get-go, why would she have needed the AP stunt before the CA primary? The vote tonight confirms it; many of the people involved in the process of election(in any country) work towards a genuine result.

Indeed, the demographic profile of potential Brexit voters is strikingly similar to that of American supporters of Donald Trump and French adherents of the National Front."

       So called highly educated elitist with their heads up their ass usually fail to see revolutions coming because their lives are disconnected from the struggles of the common man. Those older, poorer, less educated voters might be that way for a reason you know. Especially since College still isn't free. I'll sit back an continue to watch the elitist fail to call this until their heads are rolling.

       What lies?  The fact of the matter is that Britain is in the bottom 10 of developed countries for high-school completion rates and that many of the Brexit supporters haven't completed high-school, or are over 60 or or have “D, E” blue-collar occupations.  The majority of people who actually contribute a significant amount to British culture, education and economy are in favor of the "remain" campaign.  Stats don't lie.

       I never did that whatsoever, I was merely pointing out that the leave campaign has gained traction amongst the less-educated as well as out-of-touch.  This is supported by numerous demographic studies of referendum voters.  If you disagree with the statistics, then point out where they are incorrect and provide different numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Brexit campaign been effective in simplifying the issue for those people and boiling it down to the ideas of "democracy" and "state sovereignty" when it is in fact far more complicated. This is visible throughout their campaign which tugs at emotional strings and contains fear-mongering messaging in order to make it about issues that are easier for the majority of their supporters to understand.  The fact that the Brexit campaign coincides with increasing dropout rates is no coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never said that anybody's opinion has "special value" of any kind, I was pointing at well-documented demographic leanings which demonstrate that the majority of Brexit supporters are in fact less educated than their counterparts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your reflective, baseless musings regarding my qualifications aside, you can't argue with what the numbers show, but at least you've decided to add "value" to your own opinion through bragging about your educational qualifications.

       It's used by Russian/Chinese oligarchs and criminal entities use banks like HSBC to illegally launder money. None of those benefits go to the people and London's status as a financial capital will only diminish.

       I don't think so personally. The Uk has been lucky to avoid the sort of rioting that places like France have had to deal with recently. I honestly think that just saying no on this would cause a meltdown.

       The NWO also ONCE AGAIN failed to repeal the Second Amendment after their latest false flag gun seizure attempt in the US, and instead managed to make the opposition look like adults and proponents look like disgruntled children who are exploiting a national tragedy.

       Great Britain was never bound to the EU like Greece , they use the Pound and they're not in Schengen zone , which means they already had control over their borders and economy , the current crisis will continue, the only difference is that they will now be outside of EU , politically ... but will continue doing the same things. (diversity and multiculturalism)
      </p>
      <p>
       Change will happen in around 2 years or next elections...and that is, if they get a huge "British" majority in their parlament , that will do "British" stuff , unless they cuck themselves and elect a Muslim PM .
