        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">120</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-06-23 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Sabremesh.html">Sabremesh</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There is a huge amount at stake. If the majority of fairly cast ballots vote for Britain to Leave the EU (and are also fairly counted) it will be a mortal wound to the European Union - other countries will clamour for their own referendums, and the whole edifice will disintegrate over the next decade or so. The globalists simply aren&#39;t going to let his happen.</p>

<p>There are numerous ways in which David Cameron (and a large part of the British political establishment) has been doing the bidding of the globalists to secure a Remain announcement on 24 June 2016. </p>

<p>The <strong>British government circled the wagons</strong> to ensure the mainstream debate would be between different factions of the Conservative Party, and excluded Nigel Farage and UKIP. Even though Boris Johnson and Michael Gove have been giving very convincing performances as Brexit cheerleaders, they are still true blue Tories, and therefore if not controlled, then &quot;controllable&quot; opposition. </p>

<p><strong>The government spent a lot of public money on pushing the Remain Campaign</strong> printing Remain leaflets, but they also used the civil service until a few weeks ago to help push the Remain agenda. Many people suspect that British Security Service (MI5) or its subcontractors are still working towards this outcome.</p>

<p>The people of <strong>Gibraltar are allowed vote in the referendum</strong>, and they should not be, because Gibraltar is not part of the UK, and their interests are quite different from those of people in the UK. Because of their proximity to Spain, the overwhelming majority of Gibraltarians favour Remaining in the EU. Obviously, the population of Gibraltar is tiny (32,000) but if the Leave vote is thwarted by a very narrow margin, then this could negatively affect the way many Brits feel about Gibraltar. The government will not hesitate to use Gibraltar as a scapegoat.</p>

<p>As has previously been reported, there was a suspiciously large number of <strong>last minute online voter registrations (about 2 million in the final week)</strong>. The government even passed emergency ad hoc legislation to get the registration period extended. This was completely unconstitutional but also, ironically, anti-democratic. Plebiscites are processes by which the public expresses their views, but the &quot;process&quot; part is just as critical as the &quot;vote&quot; part. You can&#39;t set the rules, and then change the goalposts with emergency legislation because some of your demographic were too disorganized to register in time! There could yet be a court challenge to this action by the government.</p>

<p>These last minute registrations - are they all genuine, or are some made up people? Or might they real people, who have been registered for the vote - without their knowledge? Are their votes going to be cast for them (either by proxy or by postal ballot) - without their knowledge? <strong>Postal votes are probably the biggest risk factor to the integrity of the UK paper ballot voting system</strong>, and if a significant amount of these last minute vote registrations are for postal ballots, that will be a huge red flag.</p>

<p>As has been discussed elsewhere, <strong>the absence of exit polls</strong> is another red flag that a rigged result is on the cards. Exit polls are normally very accurate, and they would have imposed restrictions on how far the vote could be rigged without drawing suspicion. </p>

<p>Whilst he print media have been split between Leave and Remain (The Telegraph, Daily Mail, Express, Spectator are pro Brexit, and the Guardian, Independent, Times, Mirror are against), the <strong>television media has been uniformly biased against Brexit</strong>. The BBC has been trashing whatever credibility it had left by pushing Remain.</p>

<p>It is likely that a result will be announced around 7am GMT on Friday 24 June. Whether the announcement reflects how the people of the UK actually voted is perhaps something that we will never know, but there have been enough red flags to ensure that a Remain announcement will be greeted with considerable suspicion.</p>

<p><strong>Please use this thread to add any further issues which have struck you as dubious about the run up to the UK&#39;s EU referendum, and of course, anything that strikes as &quot;off&quot; after polls close.</strong> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, so polls have closed, and the result will be in within the next 5-7 hours.</p>

<p>Apparently Nigel Farage has already &quot;conceded defeat&quot; which is a pretty odd thing to do, particularly after going awol yesterday and missing the final debate. He doesn&#39;t know the result, so why would say this? Has he been threatened, bribed to &quot;pre-corroborate&quot; the fixed &quot;Remain&quot; announcement tomorrow morning, to make it seem more plausible? Predictive programming and all that. God knows.</p>

<p>Anyway, this post will be stickied (with the required mod approval) for 24 hours. </p>

<h2>And I am also stickying this comment for the sole benefit of <a href="/u/orangutan">/u/orangutan</a>. Enjoy.</h2>

<p>Update 12pm GMT. The Betfair exchange odds have seen a major swing towards Leave (down from 17 to 4) following rumours of a very good Leave result from the Sunderland count (the first one due to announce its results)</p>

<p><a href="http://politicalbetting.com/">http://politicalbetting.com/</a></p>

<p>There should be plenty of drama during the next few hours, but unless the Leave % nationally is overwhelming, I expect that Remain will somehow &quot;find the votes&quot; in the major metropolitan areas which are due to report last.</p>

<p>Update 2am: The North East of England is barnstorming to Brexit, and the odds have swung massively towards the UK leaving the EU at this point. However, the large metropolitan areas which report results towards the end of the process, and in particular London, are likely to be heavily pro-Remain, and this is when large numbers of postal ballots can be used to swing the overall total back to Remain. I think the Brexit celebrations are still premature, unfortunately. Still, here&#39;s hoping.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One government for the entire world is dangerous notion and incredibly susceptible to corruption and that corruption would damage every single person in the world&#39;s well being. I would much rather have a competition of ideas and governments that are all free and all hopefully enlightened. </p>

<p>What happens when all that power is concentrated in so few peoples hands? Eventually (and rather quickly) it gets corrupted by money and political power. Its hard to brush that off in any scenario. Where there is power and money, our nature has shown that people will eventually bend the rules.</p>

<p>That is why having multiple sovereign governments all hopefully enlightened and well meaning is a better way to go imo. We get a diversity of ideas and policies.  We don&#39;t all have to be governed in the same way as every other person and we can see what works best.</p>

<p>Right now we have a bunch of theoretically independent countries but anytime they try to be truly independent they get singled out for regime change or war.  </p>

<p>One government for the entire world seems like a terrible terrible idea to me and I hope like heck it never happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another red flag that several posters have mentioned is the fact the betting odds don&#39;t reflect the opinion polls at all.</p>

<p>(Firstly, I would add the official opinion polls all conveniently put the result &quot;in the balance&quot; but if you go to any poll by a media outlet, the overwhelming majority says LEAVE. The Daily Telegraph is 72% Leave, with about 600,000 respondents. The Remain camp is &quot;a little bit Hillary&quot; in that it gets a lot of favourable MSM coverage, but in terms of real people, they are thin on the ground.)</p>

<p>But back to the betting odds. Betfair currently has Remain on 1.16 (decimal odds) which equates to an implied probability of 85%.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.betfair.com/exchange/politics/marketactivity?id=1.118739911&amp;amp;selectionId=9481397">https://www.betfair.com/exchange/politics/marketactivity?id=1.118739911&amp;amp;selectionId=9481397</a></p>

<p>If you are in the US and some other countries you may not be able to access the above link, but Betfair is a large UK betting exchange, and it shows that £60 million ($100 million) has been wagered on this vote, with most of the &quot;big money&quot; on Remain. What do these people know, that makes them so confident, when the polls don&#39;t support their position?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to point out too that there are people actually wanting a redo of the referendum because it had a 72% turn out <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/131215">https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/131215</a> despite the fact that it was probably because people didn&#39;t want to vote so a redo would change nothing in that turn out.

<p>You don&#39;t agree with the stats?  That&#39;s what the numbers demonstrate and is perfectly summed up here:</p>

<p><em>&quot;First, the “Brexit” referendum is part of a global phenomenon: populist revolts against established political parties, predominantly by older, poorer, or less-educated voters angry enough to tear down existing institutions and defy “establishment” politicians and economic experts. Indeed, the demographic profile of potential Brexit voters is strikingly similar to that of American supporters of Donald Trump and French adherents of the National Front.&quot;</em></p>

<p>What lies?  The fact of the matter is that Britain is in the bottom 10 of developed countries for high-school completion rates and that many of the Brexit supporters haven&#39;t completed high-school, or are over 60 or or have “D, E” blue-collar occupations.  The majority of people who actually contribute a significant amount to British culture, education and economy are in favor of the &quot;remain&quot; campaign.  Stats don&#39;t lie.</p>

<p>Where did you see that?  The numbers say this:</p>

<p><em>&quot;Opinion polls indicate that British voters back the “Leave”campaign by a wide margin, 65% to 35%, if they did not complete high school, are over 60, or have “D, E” blue-collar occupations. By contrast, university graduates, voters under 40, and members of the “A, B” professional classes plan to vote “Remain” by similar margins of 60% to 40% and higher.</em>&quot;</p>

<p>I never did that whatsoever, I was merely pointing out that the leave campaign has gained traction amongst the less-educated as well as out-of-touch.  This is supported by numerous demographic studies of referendum voters.  If you disagree with the statistics, then point out where they are incorrect and provide different numbers.</p>

<p>The Brexit campaign been effective in simplifying the issue for those people and boiling it down to the ideas of &quot;democracy&quot; and &quot;state sovereignty&quot; when it is in fact far more complicated. This is visible throughout their campaign which tugs at emotional strings and contains fear-mongering messaging in order to make it about issues that are easier for the majority of their supporters to understand.  The fact that the Brexit campaign coincides with increasing dropout rates is no coincidence.</p>

<p>I never said that anybody&#39;s opinion has &quot;special value&quot; of any kind, I was pointing at well-documented demographic leanings which demonstrate that the majority of Brexit supporters are in fact less educated than their counterparts.</p>

<p>Your reflective, baseless musings regarding my qualifications aside, you can&#39;t argue with what the numbers show, but at least you&#39;ve decided to add &quot;value&quot; to your own opinion through bragging about your educational qualifications.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great Britain was never bound to the EU like Greece , they use the Pound and they&#39;re not in Schengen zone , which means they already had control over their borders and economy , the current crisis will continue, the only difference is that they will now be outside of EU , politically ... but will continue doing the same things. (diversity and multiculturalism)</p>

<p>Change will happen in around 2 years or next elections...and that is, if they get a huge &quot;British&quot; majority in their parlament , that will do &quot;British&quot; stuff , unless they cuck themselves and elect a Muslim PM .</p>
